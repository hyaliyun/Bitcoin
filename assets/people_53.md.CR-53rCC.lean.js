The town is the largest population centre on the peninsula, with an economy based upon agriculture, fisheries and various industries. It is also a highly popular tourist destination, with the area's population greatly expanded during the summer holidays, usually by Adelaide locals looking to escape the summer heat. It is a popular destination with South Australian high school graduates for their end of year celebrations, known colloquially as schoolies.  History  Adare House, built in 1893. The building is now owned by the Uniting Church Australia. Victor Harbor lies in the traditional lands of the Ramindjeri clan of the Ngarrindjeri people. Matthew Flinders in visited the bay on 8 April 1802 while on the first circumnavigation of the continent, mapping the unsurveyed southern Australian coast from the west. He encountered Nicolas Baudin in Le Geographe near the Murray Mouth several kilometres to the east of the present day location of Victor Harbor. Baudin was surveying the coast from the east for Napoleonic France. Although their countries were at war, each captain was given documents by the other nation's government, stating that the ships were on scientific missions, and were therefore not to be regarded as ships of war. Together, the ships returned to the bay and sheltered, while the captains compared notes. Flinders named the bay Encounter Bay after the meeting. In 1837 Captain Richard Crozier who was en route from Sydney to the Swan River Colony in command of ,HMS Victor, 1814, Index of 19th Century Naval Vessels, www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900 anchored just off Granite Island and named the sheltered waters in the lee of the island 'Victor Harbor' after his ship.South Australian State Gazeteer About the same time two whaling stations were established, one at Rosetta Head (popularly known as \\"the Bluff\\") and the other near the point opposite Granite Island. Whale oil became South Australia's first export. From 1839 the whaling station was managed for a time by Captain John Hart, a later Premier of South Australia. The town of Port Victor was laid out on the shores of Victor Harbor in 1863 when the horse- drawn tramway from Goolwa was extended to the harbour. The last whale was caught off Port Victor in 1872. The municipality of the town of Victor Harbor was proclaimed on 7 May 1914, with Oliver Alexander Baaner appointed as the first mayor.Established as \\"Victor Harbor\\". The South Australian Government Gazette, 1914, page 1165, 28 May 1914. On 26 December 1936, a one-off motor race meeting was held to the east of the town to commemorate the centenary of South Australia ‚Äì the \\"South Australian Centenary Grand Prix\\". The circuit was made of public roads, measured 12.6 kilometres in length and featured two long straights, two short straights, and several corners, including the banked Nangawooka Hairpin. Winner of the 240-mile Grand Prix, which was held as a handicap, was Les Murphy in an MG P-type, from Tim Joshua in another P-type and Bob Lea-Wright in a Terraplane Special.  Town name  The spelling of Victor Harbor, spelled without a u is a curiosity as harbour is normally being spelt with a \\"u\\" in Australian English. This spelling is found in several geographical names in South Australia, including Outer Harbor. The township of Victor Harbor was proclaimed in 1914 with the spelling \\"Harbor\\". The South Australian Government Gazette, 1914, page 1165, 28 May 1914. The harbour was proclaimed on 27 May 1915 under the Harbors Act 1913, The South Australian Government Gazette, 1915, page 331, 15 July 1915. and its name established on 15 June 1921 as \\"Victor Harbor\\". The South Australian Government Gazette, 1921, page 1267, 16 June 1921. The name of the harbour was changed from Port Victor as a result of a near shipwreck blamed on confusion with Port Victoria on the Yorke Peninsula. Victor Harbor Times, 27 September 1963, page 4. State Library of South Australia SA Memory. According to the State Library of South Australia, the lack of the \\"u\\" is not influenced by American spelling, but archaic English spelling. The name is not consistently applied. The Victor Harbor Times used \\"Harbour\\" in its masthead from 1922 to 1978, before reverting to \\"Harbor\\".Editions 8 September 1922 to 22 March 1978.

The portion of this combined urban area residing in Victor Harbor is 14,954. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. Victor Harbor was declared a city in 2000. As a local government area, the City of Victor Harbor includes the surrounding rural area and the contiguous township of Encounter Bay as well as the town of Victor Harbor itself; its total area is 34,463 hectares. It shares boundaries with the District Council of Yankalilla and the Alexandrina Council. The city is in the state electoral district of Finniss and the federal Division of Mayo.  Attractions  Causeway leading to Granite Island from Victor Harbor Horse-drawn tram on causeway at Victor Harbor The beach in Victor Harbor The monument at the Soldiers Memorial Gardens A popular site for visitors is Granite Island, which is connected to the mainland by a short tram/pedestrian causeway. The tram service is provided by the Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram, one of the very few horse-drawn tram routes remaining in public transit service. Granite island is home to a large colony of little penguins which are a popular attraction on the island. These penguins shelter on the island during the night, departing in the morning to hunt for fish before returning at sunset. Sadly this colony of penguins is now almost gone. At the last count in 2012, only seven were found. It is suspected that an increase in New Zealand fur seals in the area may be to blame, however incidents such as those in 1998 where locals apparently kicked several of them to death have also contributed. The SteamRanger Heritage Railway runs train services, most notably The Cockle Train between Victor Harbor and Goolwa, along the Victor Harbor railway line. During the months of June to September, whale spotting is a popular attraction. Southern right whales come to the nearby waters to calve and to mate. The South Australian Whale Centre located at Victor Harbor provides hands-on interactive activities and presentations as well as information and whale watching tips.South Australian Whale Centre Accessed 3 September 2012. Greenhills Adventure Park offered activities including: waterslides, canoes, rock wall climbing, archery, mini golf, and go-karting, however this attraction has since closed down. Victor Harbor is the centre of the surf zone known as the \\"South Coast\\" to Adelaide and local surfers. Popular surf beaches in the area include Parsons, Waitpinga, Middleton and Goolwa. The Granite Island breakwater usually shields the town from waves. Victor Harbor also offers numerous fishing opportunities varying from offshore reefs for larger boat based anglers to excellent surf fishing on the beaches closer to the Murray Mouth.  Media  The main newspaper printed locally is the Times (1987‚Äì). The newspaper was originally published as The Victor Harbor Times and Encounter Bay and Lower Murray Pilot, with the first edition published on Friday 23 August 1912. On 16 May 1930, the title was briefly altered to Times Victor Harbor and Encounter Bay and Lower Murray Pilot, and on 15 April 1932 until 31 December 1986 it was called Victor Harbor Times. Other historical publications included the short-lived South Coast News (4- 25 June 1965), printed by A.H. Ambrose, and its \\"successor\\", South Coast Sports News (20 June ‚Äì 4 July 1969), printed by The Ambrose Press.  Festivals and events  This town hosts a three-day Schoolies Week festival in late November mainly for South Australian school leavers. Victor Harbor hosts the second largest Schoolies Week Festival in Australia after the Gold Coast, centering around official activities held by the organisation Encounter Youth in Warland Reserve. The centre of the town is a dry area (no alcohol) at night and during the Christmas Pageant and New Year's Eve. Another notable event is the Art Show run by the Rotary Club of Victor Harbor and exhibits of paintings are shown from all over Australia. The event is held in January, during the summer holidays, and the 40th Art Show was held in January 2019. It has grown to become Australia's largest outdoor art exhibition, with more than 10,000 people attending over 9 nine days. Climate Victor Harbor has a warm summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb). Summer average temperatures are significantly lower than most of the state, due largely to the sea breeze moderating temperatures and hot northerlies rarely extending past the hills north of the city.

It is best known as the community closest to the decisive Battle of Adwa fought in 1896 with Italian troops; the Ethiopian soldiers, aided by Russia and France,Soviet Appeasement, Collective Security, and the Italo- Ethiopian war of 1935 and 1936 won the battle, thus being one of the few African nations to thwart European colonialism. Located in the Mehakelegnaw Zone of the Tigray Region, Adwa has a longitude and latitude of , and an elevation of 1907 meters. Adwa is surrounded by Adwa woreda. Adwa is home to several notable churches: Adwa Gebri'el Bet (built by Dejazmach Wolde Gebriel), Adwa Maryam Bet (built by Ras Anda Haymanot), Adwa Medhane \`Alem Bete (built by Ras Sabagadis), Adwa Nigiste Saba Huletenya Dereja Timhirt Bet, and Adwa Selasse Bet. Near Adwa is Abba Garima Monastery, founded in the sixth century by one of the Nine Saints and known for its tenth century gospels. Also nearby is the village of Fremona, which had been the base of the 16th century Jesuits sent to convert Ethiopia to Catholicism. Landscape between Axum and Adigrat, along the national road  History  =Origins= According to Richard Pankhurst, Adwa derives its name from Adi Awa (or Wa), \\"village of the Awa\\". The Awa are a tribe that was mentioned in the anonymous Monumentum Adulitanum that once stood at Adulis.Richard K.P. Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns: From the Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 192. Francisco Alvares records that the Portuguese diplomatic mission passed Adwa, which he called \\"Houses of St. Michael,\\" in August 1520. Despite this claim of antiquity, Adwa only acquired major importance following the establishment of a permanent capital at Gondar. As the traveler James Bruce noted, Adwa was situated on a piece of \\"flat ground through which every body must go in their way from Gondar to the Red Sea\\". The person who controlled this plain could levy profitable tolls on the caravans which passed through.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Towns, vol. 1 p. 194. By 1700, it had become the residence for the governor of Tigray province and grew to overshadow Debarwa, the traditional seat of the Bahr negus, as the most important town in northern Ethiopia. Its market was important enough to need a nagadras. The earliest known person to hold this office was the Greek immigrant Janni of Adwa, a brother of Petros, chamberlain to Emperor Iyoas I. Adwa was home to a small colony of Greek merchants into the 19th century. =19th Century= Because of its location on this major trade route, it is mentioned in the memoirs of numerous 19th- century Europeans visiting Ethiopia. These include Arnaud and Antoine d'Abbadie, Henry Salt, Samuel Gobat, Mansfield Parkyns and Th√©ophile Lefebvre. After the defeat and death of Ras Sabagadis in the Battle of Debre Abbay, its inhabitants fled Adwa for safety. The town was briefly held by Emperor Tewodros II in January 1860, who had marched from the south in response to the rebellion of Agew Neguse, who had burned then fled the town. Giacomo Naretti passed through Adwa in March 1879, after it had been devastated by a typhus epidemic. It had been reduced to a shadow of itself, having about 200 inhabitants. =20th Century= Its geographical importance has also led to Adwa's greatest importance as the site of the final battle of the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War, where the Ethiopian Emperor fought to defend Ethiopia's independence against Italy in 1896. Menelik led the Ethiopian Army to a decisive victory against the Italians, which ensured an independent Ethiopia until the Italians invaded again in 1935 (Second Italo-Ethiopian War). A large tree at the edge of the town was shown to visitors in the following years as the place where Emperor Menelik passed judgement on about 800 Eritrean askaris captured in the battle. Eritrean Battalions were part of the Italian colonial army, but the drumhead court-martial that passed judgment on them did not recognise this, and condemned the prisoners to having their right hand and left foot cut off. Writing in the 1890s, Augustus B. Wylde described the Adwa market, held on Saturdays, as a large one with cattle of all sorts available for purchase.Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 494 The Asmara-Addis Ababa telegraph line, constructed by the Italians in 1902-1904, passed through Adwa and had an office there. By 1905 it was considered the third-largest town in Tigray. Telephone service reached Adwa by 1935, but no phone numbers are listed for the town in 1954. On 6 October 1935 Italian forces entered Adwa, after two days of bombardment had shocked Ras Seyoum Mengesha into a hasty retreat, abandoning large stocks of food and other supplies. The Italian Gavinana Division brought with them a stone monument in honor of the Italian soldiers who had fallen in 1896. This monument was erected immediately after their arrival, and inaugurated on 15 October in the presence of General Emilio De Bono. The town had passed from Italian hands before 12 June 1941, when the newly arrived 34th Indian State Force Brigade set up a post office there. During the Woyane rebellion, 6000 of the territorial troops retreated to Adwa on 22 September 1943. By 1958 Adwa was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. During the 1960s the town was not only an educational center but also an early focus for nationalist dissent, indicated by the fact that all three of the leaders of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) over the 22-year period from 1975 to 1997, Aregawi Berhe, Sebhat Nega, and Meles Zenawi, all came from Adwa and attended the town's government school. Adwa was a frequent target of attacks by the TPLF during the Ethiopian Civil War: in 1978 the TPLF attacked Adwa; in 1979 it unsuccessfully tried to rob the bank. The town permanently passed into TPLF control in March 1988. Adwa and its environs are the native district of many of the core leaders of the TPLF which lead Ethiopia today, and the district was represented in Parliament by the former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi himself.  Demographics  Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 40,500, of whom 18,307 are men and 22,193 women. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 90.27% reporting that as their religion, while 9.01% of the population were Muslim.Census 2007 Tables: Tigray Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 and 3.4. The 1994 census reported it had a total population of 24,519 of whom 11,062 were males and 13,457 were females. Islamic population is larger and is based in neighborhoods of Simom , Kelvin Crash, Mambaja and Snake Coast. Small community of Muslims reside in Delver Ethin, Adwa. Sports Almeda Textile Football Club (ALTEX) was promoted to the Ethiopian National Football League after winning the Ethiopian football club championships held in Mekelle. ALTEX beat Meta Beer Football Club 2-1 in the final. ALTEX is the first club from Adwa town to represent the town in Ethiopian association football history. Films *Adwa (1999).

It is the former estate of Joseph Medill and his grandson Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publishers of the Chicago Tribune, and is open to the public. Cantigny includes large formal and informal gardens, two museums, a 27-hole golf course, a picnic grove, a playground, hiking paths, restaurants and a gift shop. Origins The land was acquired by Joseph Medill as a country estate, which he called Red Oaks, in the late 1800s. After his death, the estate passed to his grandson, Colonel McCormick. Colonel McCormick served in World War I and saw action at the Battle of Cantigny. After returning home, he renamed the estate in honor of the battle. Colonel McCormick had no children. When he died in 1955, he left his fortune to establish the McCormick Charitable Trust (now the McCormick Foundation). He also directed that Cantigny should be transformed into a park for the use of the general public. Since then, the McCormick Foundation has used the endowment funds bequeathed by Colonel McCormick to operate Cantigny as a public facility. Robert R. McCormick Museum In 1896‚Äì1897, Joseph Medill built a 35-room mansion on the estate; it was designed by architect Charles Allerton Coolidge. Today the mansion is the Robert R. McCormick Museum, a historic house museum which is open to the public for tours.http://www.cantigny.org/museums/mccormick/default.aspx McCormick Mansion First Division Museum During World War I, Colonel McCormick served with the First Division of the United States Army--also known as the \\"Big Red One\\". Colonel McCormick provided an endowment for the First Division Museum, which was designed by architect Andrew Rebori. The museum has exhibits and artifacts chronicling the First Division's service history, not only in World War I, but also in World War II and later U.S. wars. On display outside the museum is the area's largest collection of tanks and artillery pieces, known as \\"Tank Park\\". The collection includes tanks and armored vehicles from the First World War up to the present day. Visitors are allowed to climb on the vehicles. The museum's ongoing Date with History series features guest speakers on subjects of interest to the general public and military historians in particular. Speakers include historians, authors, filmmakers and veterans. The presentations are generally open to the public and free of charge. The museum is also home to the McCormick Research Center, for use by authors, scholars, teachers and students. The Center's archives contain more than 10,000 works on military history, including secondary works on various battles, campaigns and wars. Included in the primary works are the bound battle records of the First Division in World War I, and the 1st Infantry Division's World War II battle records on microfilm.

Written and directed by Amando de Ossorio, the premise of the movie is that a group of African explorers run afoul of a native cult. \\"Brujo\\" means a \\"male witch or warlock\\", so the title actually translates as \\"Night of the Warlocks\\", not \\"Night of the Witches\\" Plot In a 1910 prologue, an unnamed missionary (played by Barbara King) is kidnapped by native Bokor (sorcerers) to be sacrificed under a full moon. The Bokor tie her between two posts, whip her, then carry her to a stone altar where they decapitate her. The ceremony is interrupted, however, by soldiers who shoot all the participants. Unnoticed in the melee, a Shedim (demon) takes possession of the woman. Years later, Professor Jonathan Grant (played by Jack Taylor) commands a safari investigating the disappearance of elephants in West Africa. Amongst the explorers are a \\"great white hunter,\\" Rod Carter (played by Sim√≥n Andreu), two blonde women (Elisabeth, played by Maria Kosti, and Carol, played by Loli Tovar), and a mulatto woman, Tunika (played by Kali Hansa). Elizabeth's father financed the expedition. They stumble across the clearing where the natives had performed their Vodoun rituals before being wiped out in colonial times. Carol decides to take some photographs of the altar for a magazine article. They decide to camp nearby. That night, Carol returns to the clearing to take some more atmospheric photographs. The former missionary, now dressed in leopard skins and with feline-like canine teeth/fangs, emerges from the surrounding jungle and subdues her. The long-dead Bokor, resurrected from their burial mounds, recreate the ceremony from the prologue. Carol is whipped and decapitated. The remaining Europeans search for Carol the next day, but discover only her camera. That night, Carol, now also dressed in leopard skins, joins the other leopard-woman. Together, they sneak into the camp. The brunette kills Professor Grant and destroys the photographs from Carol's camera which he had been developing. The distraught Liz had taken sleeping pills when no one could locate her friend, and is groggy when Carol appears in her tent. \\"Elizabeth, it's me, your best friend Carol.\\" \\"We thought you'd been lost in the jungle...\\" \\"It's just as well. Come!\\" The two blondes leave the camp and join the other leopard-woman in the jungle. Just as Liz realizes what they are going to do, the two leopard-women plunge their fangs into her neck. In Liz's struggles, the original leopard-woman is knocked down and the choker she wears to fasten her neck together splits. Her severed head rolls free and she perishes as blood gushes from her neck. After another fruitless day of searching, Rod and Tunika make plans to depart. That night Carol is joined by the demon-possessed Elizabeth, also dressed in leopard skins, her new fangs gleaming in the moonlight. They abduct Tunika, take her to the ceremonial clearing, place her on the altar, and use their sharp fingernails and fangs to bloody her. As they place the leopard skins across her shredded flesh, Rod emerges from the jungle and shoots them both. He tosses his ammunition belts into the ceremonial fire, and the random shots kill the resurrected Bokor. In the confusion, he picks up Tunika and carries her to a jeep. They make their escape, and Tunika tells him she‚Äôs \\"feeling much better already\\" in the breathy voice of the Shedim.

It is about 100 km (driving time 45 minutes) from Kuala Lumpur. It is situated in the southern part of Perak and is 20 km north of Tanjung Malim. It is about 100 km (driving time 1 hour) from Ipoh. The town is surrounded by many small villages. History The town is named after a nearby river, Sungai Slim. The word Sungai means river in Malay. The river was actually named after an English captain with last name Slim in the 19th century. He accidentally went up the river instead of the Perak River which was the main waterway back then. Slim River was a military strategic midpoint from North to South of Malaya during World War II. It was the site of a major battle during World War II between the Japanese and British forces which consisted of troops from India, Australia and Great Britain. The British lost the Battle of Slim River to the Japanese forces, who were equipped with tanks. The Japanese also had total air superiority. In their defeat at Slim River, the British suffered heavy casualties and many units were cut off from their line of retreat. The battle effectively ended British hopes of defending Malaya. Economy The main economic activities are agriculture-based, such as palm oil and rubber plantations. There are some automotive shops selling engine parts and components. This is due to the proximity of the new car manufacturing town, Proton City in Tanjung Malim. Demographics The population is estimated at 100,000, and comprises Malays, Chinese, Indians and Aborigines (Orang Asli) Public Amenities There is a new modern government hospital providing basic medical care for the district. In addition, there is a public library for the locals to visit. =Schools= Primary and secondary education are provided by a few schools in Slim River, namely: *Sekolah Kebangsaan Balun, Slim River *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dato' Zulkifli Muhammad *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Slim *Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuala Slim *Kolej Vokasional Slim River *Sekolah Kebangsaan Slim River *Sekolah Kebangsaan Aminuddin Baki *Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Chin Hua *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama Slim River *Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan (T) Slim River *Sekolah Kebangsaan Slim Village *Sekolah Kebangsaan Ulu Slim *Sekolah Kebangsaan Pos Bersih *Sekolah Kebangsaan Pos Tenau *Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Ho Pin, Slim Village *Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (T) Slim Village *Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (T)LADANG CLUNY Places of interest The waterfall at Sungai Bil is famous among the locals for a weekend getaway. Recreation activities and camping is possible, and one can travel from the town by road within 30 minutes. Food stalls selling lunch and fast food are available normally during weekend. There is also an open wet market every Sunday morning until noon, where one can try a variety of local dishes and delicacies. At Ulu Slim, about the same distance from Slim River to Sungai Bil, there is a hot spring, and it is expected that the local government will develop the place, into a recreation area, for families. The hot spring water is 104 ¬∞C and is reputed to be the 5th hottest hot spring in the world. Several outdoor extreme sports are available inside Ulu Slim, reservation will be required for these activities such as white water rafting, 4x4 rides, camping, and jungle trekking. The upcoming Slim River Water Theme Park will also be opened soon. Transportation Slim River railway station It is accessible by road from the capital city, Kuala Lumpur (100 km) or by train (Slim River railway station). The main trunk road to Tanjung Malim was the first ever toll road in Malaysia and was eventually given free access to the public in the mid 1980s. Before the construction of North‚ÄìSouth Expressway, all traffic going to destinations in the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, such as Kedah, Perlis and Penang would pass through the town of Slim River. With the new North‚ÄìSouth Expressway bypassing smaller towns, fewer people, traffic, and tourists pass through Slim River. Currently, the economy of Slim River is improving due to the nearby Proton City, located in Tanjung Malim.

In this context, Westside is synonymous with Seattle. The most common definitions of the Eastside include the cities of Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Sammamish, Issaquah, Newcastle, and Mercer Island. The towns west of Bellevue, collectively known as the Gold Coast, are usually considered part of the Eastside. These include Beaux Arts Village, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina, and Yarrow Point. The Northshore cities of Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville may be considered part of the Eastside, as each city contains portions that are east of the lake and south of its northernmost tip. Similarly, on the southeast tip of Lake Washington, Renton may also be included. The most expansive definitions of the Eastside can include cities in the Snoqualmie Valley, including Duvall, Carnation, Fall City, Snoqualmie, and North Bend. In politics, the area is sometimes referred to as the \\"suburban crescent\\". History Peter Kirk Building, built 1889‚Äì1890 as the Kirkland Investment Company Building. Now Kirkland Arts Center. Before settlers arrived, the eastern shore of Lake Washington was dense forest largely uninhabited even by Native Americans. The Duwamish had a small settlement along the Mercer Slough and built two longhouses near Yarrow Point, but most of the Duwamish lived near present day Renton and Seattle. The cities on the Eastside mostly began as centers of logging or mining in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Once logged, the land was eventually cleared (primarily by Japanese immigrant labor) to support farming. In the years prior to World War II they became centers of dairy and berry farming. During the post-war boom, they became bedroom communities for Seattle. This was made possible by the 1940 construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge across Lake Washington, as well as the later construction of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963; additional traffic later led to the construction of an additional bridge paralleling the Murrow bridge, Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, as well as the replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge. Currently, the area is growing several edge cities. Economy Microsoft Building 17 View from Bellevue Downtown Park Bellevue is the largest city on the Eastside and fifth largest in the state. A major technology center, the Eastside is home to many large high-tech companies, mainly in the software and wireless industries, including Microsoft, T-Mobile US, Nintendo of America, AT&T; Mobility (formerly Cingular), the former Western Wireless (now part of Verizon Wireless), Vulcan Ventures, Expedia Group, 180 Solutions and InfoSpace. Companies like Paccar, Puget Sound Energy, Symetra Insurance, Boeing, Verizon Wireless, Google, Yahoo, Walt Disney, and Fox Sports also have national, major divisional or regional offices in the Eastside. The Eastside is also a hub for biotech and medical companies including Amgen, Icos, and Merck. Many local magnates, including Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, John Stanton, and Craig McCaw, live in the Eastside's cities. The Eastside is also home to many video game and interactive media companies. These include Bungie, Valve, ArenaNet, Sucker Punch, Monolith Productions, Sony Online Entertainment, Warner Brothers Entertainment, Microsoft Game Studios, Epic Games, Unity Technologies and DigiPen Institute of Technology. Kirkland hosts the annual Junior League Softball World Series. Kirkland Signature is also the own brand of Costco, which founded its first warehouse in Seattle (#1), and operates from its corporate headquarters in the Eastside city of Issaquah. Transportation =Air= There are public and private airfields on the Eastside. Major facilities include: *Kenmore Air Harbor provides scheduled seaplane service to various points in the Northwest United States and southwest British Columbia. *Renton Municipal Airport adjacent to the Boeing factory has a runway. *Bellevue Airfield was closed in 1983. There is also a landing zone for paragliding at the base of Tiger Mountain at . =Rail= The Woodinville Subdivision is a rail line built in the late 19th century. In 2008, the Wilburton Tunnel was eliminated, severing the line. The right-of-way was purchased the same year by the Port of Seattle. Eastside cities and King County purchased portions of the Port property for conversion to a rail trail called the Eastside Rail Corridor. =Road= The Eastside is connected to Seattle by the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge from Medina (State Route 520) and the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and Third Lake Washington Bridge from Bellevue via Mercer Island (Interstate 90). It is also served by Interstate 405, a loop route of Interstate 5 that runs to the east of Lake Washington from Tukwila to Lynnwood.

Mertz was laid down by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine on 10 May 1943 and launched on 11 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Selma M. Allen, daughter of Rear Admiral Mertz The ship was commissioned at Charlestown, Massachusetts on 19 November 1943, Commander William S. Estabrook, Jr., in command. Service history =Arrival in the Pacific= After shakedown off Bermuda, Mertz departed Norfolk, Virginia, 26 January 1944 for the central Pacific, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California, arriving at Pearl Harbor 5 March. On 9 March, the destroyer got underway for the Marshall Islands as convoy escort, arriving Majuro Atoll 6 days later. Mertz sailed on 22 March to join TG 58.2 and on 26 March and act as escort back to Majuro. En route on 31 March, she caught a Japanese maru at 0600 in the glare of her searchlights. The enemy merchant ship maneuvered to get away, only to go down under the hail of projectiles from Mertz. The task group reached Majuro 6 April. Five days later Mertz steamed for the New Hebrides as a screen for the escort carrier , arriving at Espiritu Santo on 15 April. In mid-May, the destroyer returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the Marianas campaign. She took fire support and patrol station close ashore to Saipan on 14 June, pounding gun emplacements in the daytime and at night maintaining illumination over the enemy lines until 22 June, when she began screening convoys. =Peleliu and Angaur= Mertz participated in the occupations of Peleliu and of Angaur in the Palau Islands, arriving 10 September. She retired to Manus, Admiralty Islands, on 23 September to prepare for the invasion of Leyte, Philippines. =Philippines campaign= On 20 October, D-Day for the Leyte landing forces, Mertz escorted landing craft through air attacks to the beach and later in the day patrolled off Dinagat Island at the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Early in the morning of 25 October as the Japanese Southern Force approached Leyte Gulf through the Mindanao Sea, Mertz and patrolled between Desolation Point and Homonhon Island, lest the enemy fleet choose to steam north along the east coast of Dinagat Island to attack the Allied beachhead. When the Japanese entered Surigao Strait, Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf‚Äôs force met and destroyed the enemy armada in the classic ‚Äúcrossing-of-the-T‚Äù maneuver known as the Battle of Surigao Strait, part of the overall Battle of Leyte Gulf. Later that same day Mertz splashed a Zero at several hundred yards with heavy machinegun fire. With the Leyte beachhead established, the destroyer got underway 26 October for Hollandia, New Guinea, anchoring in Humboldt Bay on the 30th to replenish. She got underway for Leyte again 9 November escorting a reinforcement convoy arriving 5 days later. Mertz then continued on to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, to join a task unit staging for the daring expedition through the Sulu Sea, controlled by the enemy since early 1942, to capture Mindoro. The American ships had to contend with both a typhoon and heavy air attacks. Mertz splashed a Ki-43 (\\"Oscar\\") 15 December and assisted in the destruction of several others. Departing San Pedro Bay 4 January 1945, she made another voyage through the Sulu Sea, to support the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January before returning to San Pedro Bay on 16 January. =Attacks on Japan= On 10 February, Mertz steamed from Ulithi for three months at sea with the Fast Carrier Task Force. During this time, she played a role in the airstrikes on the Tokyo area 16 February, the landings on Iwo Jima 19 February, and the raids on Okinawa 1 March. While screening the flattops off Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, in March, she downed two more enemy planes. While operating off Okinawa Mertz helped sink the on 18 April.Fitzsimons, Bernard, general editor. Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons & Warfare (Phoebus, 1978), Vol 13, p.1409, \\"I54\\". He mistakenly identifies I-56 as I-58, however. The destroyer retired to Ulithi 14 May, before returning to Okinawa on 24 May. She next steamed to Okino Daito Jima which she bombarded on 9 June. The next day, she got underway for Leyte Gulf, anchoring at San Pedro Bay 13 June. As part of Adm. Willam F. Halsey‚Äôs 3rd Fleet she cleared San Pedro on 1 July, and nine days later arrived at the launching area off the southeast coast of Tokyo for strike on the Japanese home islands. Beginning with the attacks on Tokyo 10 July, Mertz ranged up and down the coasts of Japan until she joined an antishipping sweep in the Kuriles while en route to the Aleutians. The destroyer arrived at Adak 14 August, the day of Japan's capitulation. =End of World War II and fate= Mertzs first and only peacetime duty came 31 August, when she departed Adak for Japan, arriving Ominato, northern Honsh≈´, on 8 September, to operate with the 3rd Fleet during the occupation of the northern Honsh≈´-Hokkaid≈ç area. On 15 September the destroyer departed Ominato Harbor for the west coast, arriving San Francisco on 30 September. On 1 December, Mertz steamed to San Diego, where she decommissioned 23 April 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was reassigned to the Long Beach, California, group 1 July 1951 and the Stockton, California, group 1 January 1959, to remain there into 1969. Awards Mertz received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

It is an example of a nucleotide. They are the molecular precursors of both DNA and RNA, which are chains of nucleotides made through the processes of DNA replication and transcription. Nucleoside triphosphates also serve as a source of energy for cellular reactions and are involved in signalling pathways. Nucleoside triphosphates cannot be absorbed well, so they are typically synthesized within the cell. Synthesis pathways differ depending on the specific nucleoside triphosphate being made, but given the many important roles of nucleoside triphosphates, synthesis is tightly regulated in all cases. Nucleoside analogues may also be used to treat viral infections. For example, azidothymidine (AZT) is a nucleoside analogue used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS.  Naming  The term nucleoside refers to a nitrogenous base linked to a 5-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose). Nucleotides are nucleosides covalently linked to one or more phosphate groups. To provide information about the number of phosphates, nucleotides may instead be referred to as nucleoside (mono, di, or tri) phosphates. Thus, nucleoside triphosphates are a type of nucleotide. Nucleotides are commonly abbreviated with 3 letters (4 or 5 in case of deoxy- or dideoxy-nucleotides). The first letter indicates the identity of the nitrogenous base (e.g. A for adenine, G for guanine), the second letter indicates the number of phosphates (mono, di, tri), and the third letter is P, standing for phosphate. Nucleoside triphosphates that contain ribose as the sugar are conventionally abbreviated as NTPs, while nucleoside triphosphates containing _d_ eoxyribose as the sugar are abbreviated as dNTPs. For example, dATP stands for deoxyribose adenine triphosphate. NTPs are the building blocks of RNA, and dNTPs are the building blocks of DNA. The carbons of the sugar in a nucleoside triphosphate are numbered around the carbon ring starting from the original carbonyl of the sugar. Conventionally, the carbon numbers in a sugar are followed by the prime symbol (‚Äò) to distinguish them from the carbons of the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base is linked to the 1‚Äô carbon through a glycosidic bond, and the phosphate groups are covalently linked to the 5‚Äô carbon. The first phosphate group linked to the sugar is termed the Œ±-phosphate, the second is the Œ≤-phosphate, and the third is the Œ≥-phosphate.center  DNA and RNA synthesis  In nucleic acid synthesis, the 3‚Äô OH of a growing chain of nucleotides attacks the Œ±-phosphate on the next NTP to be incorporated (blue), resulting in a phosphodiester linkage and the release of pyrophosphate (PPi). This figure shows DNA synthesis, but RNA synthesis occurs through the same mechanism.The cellular processes of DNA replication and transcription involve DNA and RNA synthesis, respectively. DNA synthesis uses dNTPs as substrates, while RNA synthesis uses NTPs as substrates. NTPs cannot be converted directly to dNTPs. DNA contains four different nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. RNA also contains adenine, guanine, and cytosine, but replaces thymine with uracil. Thus, DNA synthesis requires dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP as substrates, while RNA synthesis requires ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. Nucleic acid synthesis is catalyzed by either DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase for DNA and RNA synthesis respectively. These enzymes covalently link the free -OH group on the 3‚Äô carbon of a growing chain of nucleotides to the Œ±-phosphate on the 5‚Äô carbon of the next (d)NTP, releasing the Œ≤- and Œ≥-phosphate groups as pyrophosphate (PPi). This results in a phosphodiester linkage between the two (d)NTPs. The release of PPi provides the energy necessary for the reaction to occur. It is important to note that nucleic acid synthesis occurs exclusively in the 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô direction.  Nucleoside triphosphate metabolism  Given their importance in the cell, the synthesis and degradation of nucleoside triphosphates is under tight control. This section focuses on nucleoside triphosphate metabolism in humans, but the process is fairly conserved among species. Nucleoside triphosphates cannot be absorbed well, so all nucleoside triphosphates are typically made de novo. The synthesis of ATP and GTP (purines) differs from the synthesis of CTP, TTP, and UTP (pyrimidines). Both purine and pyrimidine synthesis use phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a starting molecule. The conversion of NTPs to dNTPs can only be done in the diphosphate form. Typically a NTP has one phosphate removed to become a NDP, then is converted to a dNDP by an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase, then a phosphate is added back to give a dNTP. = Purine synthesis = A nitrogenous base called hypoxanthine is assembled directly onto PRPP. This results in a nucleotide called inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP is then converted to either a precursor to AMP or GMP. Once AMP or GMP are formed, they can be phosphorylated by ATP to their diphosphate and triphosphate forms. Purine synthesis is regulated by the allosteric inhibition of IMP formation by the adenine or guanine nucleotides. AMP and GMP also competitively inhibit the formation of their precursors from IMP. = Pyrimidine synthesis = A nitrogenous base called orotate is synthesized independently of PRPP. After orotate is made it is covalently attached to PRPP. This results in a nucleotide called orotate monophosphate (OMP). OMP is converted to UMP, which can then be phosphorylated by ATP to UDP and UTP. UTP can then be converted to CTP by a deamination reaction. TTP is not a substrate for nucleic acid synthesis, so it is not synthesized in the cell. Instead, dTTP is made indirectly from either dUDP or dCDP after conversion to their deoxyribose forms. Pyrimidine synthesis is regulated by the allosteric inhibition of orotate synthesis by UDP and UTP. PRPP and ATP are also allosteric activators of orotate synthesis. = Ribonucleotide reductase = Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the enzyme responsible for converting NTPs to dNTPs. Given that dNTPs are used in DNA replication, the activity of RNR is tightly regulated. It is important to note that RNR can only process NDPs, so NTPs are first dephosphorylated to NDPs before conversion to dNDPs. dNDPs are then typically re-phosphorylated. RNR has 2 subunits and 3 sites: the catalytic site, activity (A) site, and specificity (S) site. The catalytic site is where the NDP to dNDP reaction takes place, the activity site determines whether or not the enzyme is active, and the specificity site determines which reaction takes place in the catalytic site. The activity site can bind either ATP or dATP. When bound to ATP, RNR is active. When ATP or dATP is bound to the S site, RNR will catalyze synthesis of dCDP and dUDP from CDP and UDP. dCDP and dUDP can go on to indirectly make dTTP. dTTP bound to the S site will catalyze synthesis of dGDP from GDP, and binding of dGDP to the S site will promote synthesis of dADP from ADP. dADP is then phosphorylated to give dATP, which can bind to the A site and turn RNR off.  Other cellular roles  = ATP as a source of cellular energy = The energy released during hydrolysis of adenosine tripshophate (ATP), shown here, is frequently coupled with energetically unfavourable cellular reactions. ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. Despite being synthesized through the metabolic pathway described above, it is primarily synthesized during both cellular respiration and photosynthesis by ATP synthase. ATP synthase couples the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate with an electrochemical gradient generated by the pumping of protons through either the inner mitochondrial membrane (cellular respiration) or the thylakoid membrane (photosynthesis). This electrochemical gradient is necessary because the formation of ATP is energetically unfavourable. The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi proceeds as follows: :ATP + H2O -> ADP + Pi This reaction is energetically favourable and releases 30.5 kJ/mol of energy. In the cell, this reaction is often coupled with unfavourable reactions to provide the energy for them to proceed. GTP is occasionally used for energy-coupling in a similar manner. Binding of a ligand to a G protein-coupled receptor allows GTP to bind the G protein. This causes the alpha subunit to leave and act as a downstream effector. = GTP signal transduction = GTP is essential for signal transduction, especially with G proteins. G proteins are coupled with a cell membrane bound receptor. This whole complex is called a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). G proteins can bind either GDP or GTP. When bound to GDP, G proteins are inactive. When a ligand binds a GPCR, an allosteric change in the G protein is triggered, causing GDP to leave and be replaced by GTP. GTP activates the alpha subunit of the G protein, causing it to dissociate from the G protein and act as a downstream effector.  Nucleoside analogues  Nucleoside analogues can be used to treat viral infections. Nucleoside analogues are nucleosides that are structurally similar (analogous) to the nucleosides used in DNA and RNA synthesis. Once these nucleoside analogues enter a cell, they can become phosphorylated by a viral enzyme. The resulting nucleotides are similar enough to the nucleotides used in DNA or RNA synthesis to be incorporated into growing DNA or RNA strands, but they do not have an available 3' OH group to attack the next nucleotide, causing chain termination. This can be exploited for therapeutic uses in viral infections because viral DNA polymerase recognizes certain nucleotide analogues more readily than eukaryotic DNA polymerase. For example, azidothymidine is used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Some less selective nucleoside analogues can be used as chemotherapy agents to treat cancer, such as cytosine arabinose (ara-C) in the treatment of certain forms of leukemia. Resistance to nucleoside analogues is common, and is frequently due to a mutation in the enzyme that phosphorylates the nucleoside after entry into the cell. This is common in nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV/AIDS.

After breaking up in 1991, they reunited in 2001 and again in 2013. To date, Blast has released three original studio albums (the latest being 1989's Take the Manic Ride), and they have gone through several line-up changes, leaving vocalist Clifford Dinsmore and guitarist Mike Neider as the only constant members. History Blast released their first album, The Power of Expression, in 1986. They recorded the album three times before releasing it. They first were signed by Green World Records. Blast caught the attention of SST Records, who signed them for their next release, 1987's It's in My Blood. That same year, a 7-inch was released, including a cover of Alice Cooper's \\"School's Out\\". They also were releasing new music on Santa Cruz Skateboard videos. SST and Santa Cruz Skateboards began shared videos and merchandise bridged by Blast as Neider had worked for the skateboard company for many years. The band's third release for SST was Take the Manic Ride, released in 1989. Blast broke up in 1991 while working on their next album. Neider and Torgerson began Blackout, releasing one 7-inch under that name, and then LAB, who put out a 7-inch EP and a four-song CD and continued into the late 1990s, playing many shows with Fu Manchu. Former Kyuss and Fu Manchu drummer Brant Bjork moved to Santa Cruz to briefly join LAB before joining up with Fu Manchu. In 2001, Blast reunited for shows on the West Coast of the United States. On September 3, 2013, Southern Lord and Dave Grohl released a remixed and remastered version of It's in My Blood, titled Blood!. Following that release, original vocalist Clifford Dinsmore and guitarist Mike Neider recruited bassist Chuck Dukowski and drummer Dave Grohl to a new Blast EP For Those Who've Graced The Fire, which was released on Rise Records.

It was designed to launch payloads into low earth orbit, geosynchronous transfer orbit or geosynchronous orbit. Sixty-three launches of the Atlas II, IIA and IIAS models were carried out between 1991 and 2004; all sixty-three launches were successes, making the Atlas II the most reliable launch system in history. The Atlas line was continued by the Atlas III, used between 2000 and 2005, and the Atlas V which is still in use. Design Atlas II provided higher performance than the earlier Atlas I by using engines with greater thrust and longer fuel tanks for both stages. LR-89 and LR-105 were replaced by the RS-56, derived from the RS-27. The total thrust capability of the Atlas II of 490,000 pounds force (2,200 kN) enabled the booster to lift payloads of 6,100 pounds (2,767 kg) into geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) of 22,000 miles (35,000 km) or more. Atlas II was the last Atlas to use a three engine, \\"stage-and-a-half\\" design: two of its three engines were jettisoned during ascent, but its fuel tanks and other structural elements were retained. The two booster engines, RS-56-OBAs, were integrated into a single unit called the MA-5A and shared a common gas generator. They burned for 164 seconds before being jettisoned. The central sustainer engine, an RS-56-OSA, would burn for an additional 125 seconds. The Vernier engines on the first stage of the Atlas I were replaced by a hydrazine fueled roll control system. This series used an improved Centaur upper stage, the world's first cryogenic propellant stage, to increase its payload capability. Atlas II also had lower-cost electronics, an improved flight computer and longer propellant tanks than its predecessor, Atlas I. Versions =Atlas II= The original Atlas II was based on the Atlas I and its predecessors. This version flew between 1991 and 1998. =Atlas IIA= Atlas IIA was a derivative designed to service the commercial launch market. The main improvement was the switch from the RL10A-3-3A to RL10A-4 engine on the Centaur upper stage. The IIA version flew between 1992 and 2002. =Atlas IIAS= Atlas IIAS was largely identical to IIA, but added four Castor 4A solid rocket boosters to increase performance. These boosters were ignited in pairs, with one pair igniting on the ground, and the second igniting in the air shortly after the first pair separated. The half-stage booster section would then drop off as usual. IIAS was used between 1993 and 2004, concurrently with IIA. Background In May 1988, the Air Force chose General Dynamics (now Lockheed-Martin) to develop the Atlas II vehicle, primarily to launch Defense Satellite Communications System payloads and for commercial users as a result of Atlas I launch failures in the late 1980s. Led by lead engineer Samuel Wagner, the Atlas II was crucial to the continued development of the United States' space program. Atlas IIs were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., by the 45th Space Wing. The final West Coast Atlas II launch was accomplished December 2003 by the 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, California. Specifications Atlas launch vehicle evolution.

As it is located on the western bank of the Ural river, it is considered geographically in Europe. It is the capital of the West Kazakhstan Region. The ethnic composition is dominated by Kazakhs (69%) and Russians. Population: Oral is an agricultural and industrial centre, and has been an important trade stop since its founding. Barge traffic has passed up and down the Ural River between the Caspian Sea and the Ural Mountains for centuries. Today it is one of the major entry points for rail traffic from Europe to Siberia, servicing the many new oil fields in the Caspian basin and the industrial cities of the southern Urals. It is served by Oral Ak Zhol Airport. History Church of Christ the Saviour in Oral, placing the first stone in 1891 Oral was founded in 1613 by Cossacks, and was originally named Yaitsk, after the Yaik river, the name of the Ural river at the time. In 1773 there occurred the first Cossack rebellion against the local Russian commander General Traubenberg, led by Yemelyan Pugachev. Traubenberg was murdered along with several other officers. The city was captured by Pugachev, and its fortress besieged from 30 December 1773 to 17 April 1774. Tsarist troops under Commander Mantsurov re took the city after Golytsin had taken the city of Orenburg from the rebel forces. As a punishment for the Yaik Cossacks siding with the insurrectionists, Empress Catherine II declared on 15 January 1775 that the Yaik river would henceforth be renamed the Ural River and Yaitsk would be known as Ural'sk. Alexander Pushkin visited the city with his friend Vladimir Dahl in September 1833 while doing research for his book The History of Pugachev (1834) and his novel The Captain's Daughter. (1836) The city was under siege imposed by Cossacks during the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922. Mikhail Frunze, Vasily Chapaev and Georgy Zhukov participated in its defence. After the independence of Kazakhstan in 1991, Ural'sk was renamed as Oral. Geography =Climate= The climate of Oral is continental with long cold winters and warm, often hot summers. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Oral has a hot summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfa). Summers are extremely hot considering its position north of the 51st parallel, but winters are more reminiscent of continental climates further east rather than Europe. Oral is considered to be one of the cleanest cities in Kazakhstan. Sport Petr Atoyan Stadium FC Akzhaiyk are a Kazakhstani football club based in Petr Atoyan Stadium in Oral. =Bandy= Rauan Isaliyev, captain of Kazakhstan national bandy team, is from Oral Bandy is the principal sport in the city. Akzhayik Sports Club, based in the Yunost Stadium (Zhastar Stadium in Kazakh), is the only professional team in the country and plays in the 2nd highest division of Russia. In September 2017 Kazakhstan Bandy Federation bought the club. The city sent a team to the Spartakiade 2009 and the finished 2nd. All the players of the Under 23s' national team in the 2013/14 season came from Oral. After the Kazakhstan national bandy team took the gold medal at the 2011 Asian Winter Games, the team came back to Oral in triumph.Video from the triumphant homecoming A few former residents now live in Germany and play for the German national team. The first international bandy championships in Kazakhstan was held in the city in the 1990s, World Championship for Under 15s' boys. Oral hosted the 2nd Republican Youth Winter Games in 2015, with competitions in bandy and ice hockey. The Yunost Stadium in 2018 became equipped with artificial ice.

McCord. McCord was laid down on 17 March 1942 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California and launched on 10 January 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Frank C. McCord, widow of Commander McCord. The ship was commissioned on 19 August 1943, Comdr. W. T. Kenny, in command. Service history =World War II= McCord, departing San Diego on 27 November 1943, joined the Pacific Fleet in time for operations in the Marshall Islands and Marianas, and remained in continuous action through the Palau, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa campaigns. She arrived off Kwajalein as a unit of Task Force 51 (TF 51), 30 January 1944. During Operation \\"Flintlock\\", she screened transports and provided rapid close support fire. On 15 February the task force sortied from Kwajalein to Eniwetok Atoll for operation \\"Catchpole\\". McCord at first screened the minesweepers as they cleared the passages into the lagoon and then screened the bombardment group as Engebi Island, containing the atoll's only airfield, was secured, 17-18 February. On 21 February, she steamed back to the southern end of the lagoon for the bombardment of Eniwetok and Parry Island. By mid-March McCord had rendezvoused with TF 39 in the Bismarck Archipelago and for two weeks she cruised in the Ysabel Channel in support of landings at Emirau Island, 21 March. She next escorted replacement troops from Purvis Bay, Florida Island, to Emirau. Returning to Purvis Bay at the end of April, she departed 1 May to escort tankers to refueling positions in the Solomons area. On 11 June, after 2 weeks of antisubmarine patrols in the area around Bougainville and New Georgia, she arrived off New Ireland to bombard an enemy tank repair installation, resuming escort duties upon its destruction. Interrupting her escort service between the Admiralties and the Solomons on 23 July, she joined TF 52 at Saipan and took part in the shelling of Tinian. The Palau Islands offensive was next. She arrived off Peleliu on 11 September and remained through 30 September to support the forces landed on the 15th. On her arrival at Manus 4 October, McCord joined CarDiv 22, 7th Fleet, as it prepared for operations in the central Philippines. She arrived at her assigned operating area east of the Philippines as landings were made at Suluan and Dinagat, 17 October. On the 25th her task unit, 77.4.1, came under constant air attack as the Battle off Samar raged to the north. Escaping damage, McCord protected her unit's carriers and rescued their pilots. She returned to Manus 3 November, but was back off Leyte by the 16th to prevent enemy surface forces from attacking Allied forces, installations, and shipping in the central Philippines. On 6 December, at Ulithi, McCord joined the fast carrier force, TF 38. The force sortied from that island on 10 December and steamed to the Philippines to support the Mindoro landings by launching strikes against enemy airfields and harbors in the northern and central islands. Back at Ulithi by 24 December, they sortied again on 30 December. First they struck at Formosa, 3-6 January 1945. Then, in quick succession, they raided enemy installations and shipping in Indochina, southern Formosa, the China coast, the Philippines, eastern Formosa, and Okinawa. Constantly moving and always ready for targets of opportunity, the force's strikes were successful. While in the South China Sea on 11‚Äì12 January they sank or damaged almost 200,000 tons of enemy shipping. The force returned to Ulithi 23 January, remaining until 10 February. On 16 February, strikes were launched against Tokyo itself; on 18 February against Chichi Jima; and on 20 February against Iwo Jima in support of the Marine units landed on 19 February. By 24 February, the planes from TF 58 were back over Tokyo and on 25 February they flew against defense installations in the Nagoya-Kobe area. During March, McCord continued to operate in the screen of TG 58.4 as it concentrated its efforts against Okinawa and southern Ky≈´sh≈´ in preparation for the amphibious assault on the former 1 April. She remained in the Ry≈´ky≈´ area until 12 May when she escorted the battleship to Guam. She returned to Okinawa on 27 May for a final two weeks of combat. TG 58.4 then retired to Leyte Gulf, arriving 13 June. McCord departed four days later for the west coast and a navy yard overhaul. On 8 July she arrived at Puget Sound, where she was docked when the Japanese surrender was announced. On 7 September she steamed to San Diego, reporting on 15 September to the Inactive Fleet. =Postwar= Decommissioning 15 January 1947, she remained berthed at San Diego until recommissioning 1 August 1951. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, McCord departed San Diego 1 November and reported to ComDesRon 28 at Norfolk on 17 November. For the next year she operated along the east coast, cruising as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia and as far south as the British West Indies. On 10 January 1953 the destroyer once again got underway for a western Pacific war zone. By 15 February she was off the west coast of Korea operating with carriers in TF 95. She remained in the Yellow Sea combat zone until mid-March when she received a week's availability at Sasebo. On 26 March she joined TF 77 as it ranged the east coast of Korea providing shore bombardment and fire support services where needed by the U.N. forces. Departing the battleline 17 April, McCord, joined TG 96.7in exercises off Okinawa. She rejoined TF 77, 14 May, and remained in the Sea of Japan operations area until 5 June when her Korean deployment terminated and she got underway for the United States. Steaming via Subic Bay, Singapore, Aden, Suez, and Gibraltar, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia 6 August. During the next months she operated off the southern east coast and in the Caribbean. She decommissioned 9 June 1954 and was berthed at Norfolk, where, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, she has remained into 1969.

It is not to be confused with presentism, a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas (such as moral standards) are projected into the past. The idea was first articulated by British literary critic Matthew Arnold in 1880 and later named and defined by American historian David Hackett Fischer in 1970. Concept The idea that a critic can make erroneous interpretations of past works because of knowledge of subsequent events was first articulated by Matthew Arnold. In his 1880 essay The Study of Poetry, he wrote: > The course of development of a nation‚Äôs language, thought, and poetry, is > profoundly interesting; and by regarding a poet‚Äôs work as a stage in this > course of development we may easily bring ourselves to make it of more > importance as poetry than in itself it really is, we may come to use a > language of quite exaggerated praise in criticising it; in short, to > overrate it. So arises in our poetic judgments the fallacy caused by the > estimate which we may call historic. The concept of the historian's fallacy was named and outlined in 1970 by David Hackett Fischer, who suggested it was analogous to William James's psychologist's fallacy. Fischer did not suggest that historians should refrain from retrospective analysis in their work, but he reminded historians that their subjects were not able to see into the future. As an example, he cited the well-known argument that Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor should have been predictable in the United States because of the many indications that an attack was imminent. What this argument overlooks, says Fischer, citing the work of Roberta Wohlstetter, is that there were innumerable conflicting signs which suggested possibilities other than an attack on Pearl Harbor. Only in retrospect do the warning signs seem obvious; signs which pointed in other directions tend to be forgotten. (See also: hindsight bias.) In the field of military history, historians sometimes use what is known as the \\"fog of war technique\\" in hopes of avoiding the historian's fallacy. In this approach, the actions and decisions of the historical subject (such as a military commander) are evaluated primarily on the basis of what that person knew at the time, and not on future developments that the person could not have known. According to Fischer, this technique was pioneered by the American historian Douglas Southall Freeman in his influential biographies of Robert E. Lee and George Washington.

According to the 2011 Canadian census, a larger number of 478,185 adherents identify as Lutheran. History The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada came into being in 1986 through the merger of two predecessor bodies the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada (started in 1966 by Canadian congregations of the American Lutheran Church) and three synods of the Lutheran Church in America, called the Canada Section. (In 1988 these two US church bodies ceased to exist as they merged into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the ELCIC's sister denomination in the United States.) =Constituting Convention= *1985 Winnipeg, Manitoba =National Conventions= *1987 Ottawa, Ontario *1989 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan *1991 Edmonton, Alberta *1993 Vancouver, British Columbia *1995 Winnipeg, Manitoba *1997 Toronto, Ontario *1999 Regina, Saskatchewan *2001 Waterloo, Ontario *2003 Camrose, Alberta *2005 Winnipeg, Manitoba *2007 Winnipeg, Manitoba *2009 Vancouver, British Columbia *2011 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan *2013 Ottawa, Ontario *2015 Edmonton, Alberta *2017 Winnipeg, Manitoba Doctrine The Church derives its teachings from the Bible and the Book of Concord which includes the three ecumenical creeds of the Christian Church‚Äîthat is, the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is in full communion with the Anglican Church of Canada under the Waterloo Declaration. Martin Luther University College and Lutheran Theological Seminary, Saskatoon are the seminaries owned by the church. Organisation The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is composed of five synods (similar to a diocese in Anglican polity). The presiding officer and chief pastor of each synod is a bishop. *The British Columbia Synod *The Synod of Alberta and the Territories ** Robert Jacobson first bishop (1985‚Äì1995) *The Saskatchewan Synod *The Manitoba/Northwestern Ontario Synod *The Eastern Synod This structure is identical to the synod structure of the ELCA, except that the Canadian synods cover one or more entire provinces, whereas some ELCA synods cover the whole or part of a metro area and some cover several states. Like the ELCA a presiding bishop serves as its head, but in the ELCIC, this bishop is known as the \\"National Bishop\\". Although episcopal in structure, the church does not have cathedrals as such, though the largest parish church in a city may well have that de facto function with respect to major worship services involving the whole Lutheran community. National Bishops *Rev. Donald Sjoberg, 1986‚Äì1993 *Rev. Telmor Sartison, 1993‚Äì2001 *Rev. Raymond Schultz, 2001‚Äì2007 *Rev. Canon Susan Johnson, 2007- Same-sex unions In 2006, the Eastern Synod voted to allow individual pastors and congregations to conduct blessing of same-sex unions, prompting a dispute between the synod and the national church over which body has the authority to make such a decision. The national church had previously voted against blessings, and the ELCIC's full communion partner, the Anglican Church of Canada, had voted to defer a decision. On June 23, 2007, at its National Convention, the ELCIC voted, by a 200‚Äì181 vote margin, against authorizing the Synods to devise individual mission strategies in regard to ministering to people who live in committed same-sex relationships, including the possibility of blessing such unions. The Eastern Synod Council, while affirming its jurisdiction in the matter, agreed to hold its decision in abeyance pending a decision by the national church. In July 2011, the National Convention of the ELCIC adopted a new social statement on human sexuality and approved a motion allowing pastors whose conscience permits, in consultation with their congregations, to preside at marriages for same-gender couples. Some have claimed that the adoption of \\"ELCIC Social Statement on Human Sexuality\\" openly violates Article 2 of the ELCIC constitution, and have challenged the adoption as a violation of the ELCIC's constitution. A challenge was placed before the ELCIC's Court of Adjudication. The Court found that the complainant did not have the status required by the Constitution to press the complaint and declined to hear the complaint. As a result of the 2011 vote and the court's decision, the ELCIC today permits the blessing of same-sex unions and the ordination of openly gay or lesbian pastors.

With the advent of motion picture sound and the film musical, Rainger and other songwriters found work in Hollywood. He teamed up with lyricist Leo Robin to produce a string of successful film songs, including \\"I'll Take An Option On You\\" from the Broadway hit show \\"Tattle Tales\\" (1933). In the years that followed, Rainger wrote or collaborated on such hit songs as \\"I Wished on the Moon\\", \\"Love in Bloom\\" (comedian Jack Benny's theme song), \\"Faithful Forever\\", \\"Easy Living\\", \\"June in January\\", \\"Blue Hawaii\\", and with Leo Robin on the 1938 Oscar-winning song \\"Thanks for the Memory\\", sung by Bob Hope in the film The Big Broadcast of 1938.

M. n. Silanus (AD 1454), was the eldest son of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus and Aemilia Lepida. His mother was the great- granddaughter of the emperor Augustus. As a member of the imperial family, Silanus could therefore be considered a possible candidate for the succession. Although he was honoured with a consulship by the Emperor Claudius in 46,Cassius Dio, 60.1 and served as proconsular governor of Asia,Ronald Syme, \\"Problems about Proconsuls of Asia\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 53 (1983), p. 196 Silanus did not survive the death of that Emperor. Although Tacitus exonerates Nero of Silanus' death, the 'first crime of the new principate,' the historian casts Agrippina, Nero's mother, as the architect of the murder, on the grounds that she feared that Silanus would avenge his brother's death, of which she was the perpetrator.Annales 13.1 As with Claudius, poison was the means to Silanus' end; the epitomator of Dio Cassius' Roman History tells us that Agrippina sent Silanus the same poison which she gave her late husband;Dio, 61.4 and Tacitus informs us that the lethal drug was administered by a Roman of the Equestrian class named Publius Celerius, with the aid of a freedman named Helius. The pair committed the crime openly, and the Province of Asia eventually prosecuted Celerius for this deed; moreover, according to Tacitus, Nero saw to it that the prosecution was delayed to such an extent that Celerius died of old age.Annales 13.33 Silanus' son, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, whom Tacitus calls a young man of moderation (modesta iuventa),Annales 16.7 was considered a threat on similar grounds as his father had been, and informers soon invented a conspiracy implicating him and his aunt Junia Lepida on charges of magic rites and incest.Annales 16.10 Upon being exiled to Bari, he was set upon by a centurion and some guards. Young Silanus, however, did not open his veins, when invited to do so; he went down fighting with his fists, and Tacitus notes that the centurion was forced to run him through with his sword; his fatal wound, according to the historian, was in front.Annales 16.9 See also * Junia (gens) Footnotes Category:14 births Category:54 deaths Category:1st- century Romans Category:Julio-Claudian dynasty Category:Junii Silani Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Roman governors of Asia Category:Poisoned Romans Category:Ancient Roman murder victims ","title":"Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 46)"},{"id":"848942","text":"iCube can refer to: *International Consortium of Universities for the Study of Biodiversity and the Environment (iCUBE) *Power Mac G4 Cube, a small form factor Macintosh personal computer from Apple Inc. *iCube Corporation, see Valups, a Korean company *iCube-1, a miniaturised satellite ","title":"ICube"},{"id":"848952","text":"\\"The Sandkings\\" is a 1995 Canadian-American television film based on the 1979 novella Sandkings by George R. R. Martin, and the first episode of the revived 1960s science-fiction television series The Outer Limits. It premiered on 26 March 1995 on Showtime and features three generations of the Bridges acting family: Beau, his father Lloyd, and son Dylan. Kim Coates and Helen Shaver also star. The episode garnered five Gemini Award nominations. One of these was in the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series for Beau Bridges' leading role as Simon Kress, which also garnered nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series and the CableACE Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series. Plot Dr. Simon Kress' (Beau Bridges) research for the government on Martian life is aborted because one of his specimens escaped his lab and almost made it to the surface. However, Kress does not agree with the abandonment of the project and decides to continue his experiments in his barn. He steals some sand containing Martian eggs from his lab and creates a makeshift incubator to hatch more of the Martian lifeforms. Kress' obsession with the project causes his relationship with his wife Cathy (Helen Shaver) to break down. The family dog, Cowboy, gets eaten after stepping into their territory, having been awoken by their digging. The sandkings evolve into two distinct groups, a white group and a red group, and they settle on opposite sides of their glass enclosure. Kress comes to believe that he is a god to his sandkings when the white group builds a sand structure that resembles his face. He smashes the sand structure of the red group who did not do the same, one of them getting loose and stinging him. He kills his former supervisor Dave Stockley (Kim Coates) by tossing him into the enclosure, where the sandkings then devour him. Later, he finds himself in the basement with the red sandkings, who have made a nest with the face of Stockley. He breaks a gas pipe to cause an explosion in an attempt to kill all of the sandkings. In the ending of the episode, a colony of sandkings is shown surviving in the wilderness. Aftermath The Sandkings thrived after their escape from Kress' home laboratory. Fragments from the episode are included in the final episode of season one, \\"The Voice of Reason\\". There, clips from \\"The Sandkings\\" are used to support an argument that the Earth is undergoing a number of different alien invasions. Later in the episode, two alien conspirators acknowledge, in private conversation, that the Sandkings could become a serious problem in about thirty years, assuming that they could survive in a methane-based atmosphere, which the aliens intended to gradually transform from the Earth's human-friendly one. In the sixth-season episode \\"Final Appeal\\", we discover that the Sandkings plague has been eradicated, which took \\"the better part of a decade\\" to complete. Differences from the original story * The action of the original story Sandkings by George R. R. Martin takes place in the distant future on a faraway planet colonized by humans. * The original story does not specify the planet of Sandkings' origin. * Simon Kress is possessed by neither scientific interest nor desire to receive the Nobel Prize but simple cruelty (there is a difference between cruelty and aggression), the application of which influences the sandkings. * There are no Maws that act to control the Sandkings. * No betting takes place, even though that is a pretty large plot point in the original story. * The faces don't change based on the SandKing's perception of their \\"God\\". * There are only 2 groups, not 4. * There is no psionics explaining any of the characters' action. * There are two murders instead of at least ten. * There is no real elaboration about the Sandkings. * Most of the horror elements have been removed; the original story was mostly science fiction with a small bit of horror. * All of the actions taken to destroy the SandKings are changed. * The protagonist is a family man, as opposed to a wealthy bachelor in the novelette. * Without the Maws and their increasing size and intelligence as well as their psionic ability, there is no way to examine the idea of superintelligence or evolution. * In the original story, at least one alien is involved in importing the Sandkings; in this retelling, humans bring the Kings back themselves. * The episode examines the themes of hubris and ecological catastrophe rather than the responsibility of a parent (\\"God\\") to a child and how that child will \\"grow up\\". Awards nominations * In 1995, for the role of Simon Kress, actor Beau Bridges was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category \\"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series\\". * In 1996, The Outer Limits TV-series was nominated for some Gemini Awards, including Beau Bridges receiving a nomination in the category \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini- Series\\", and the episode \\"SandKings\\" was nominated in the category \\"Best TV Movie or Mini-Series\\" and \\"Best Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series\\". Also, for this episode, Joseph L. Scanlan was nominated for \\"Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\\", and Peter Outerbridge was nominated for Best Performance by an \\"Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini- Series\\". * Beau Bridges was nominated for the CableACE Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.

In 2005, David Gauntlett claimed that grant funding, news headlines, and professional prestige more commonly go to authors who, in good faith, promote anti-media beliefs. Tom Grimes, James A. Anderson, and Lori Bergen reiterated these claims in a 2008 book examining sociological effects on the production of media effects research. =Voluntary regulation= Voluntary rating systems adopted by the video game industry, such as the ESRB rating system in the United States and Canada (established in 1994), and the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system in Europe (established in 2003), are aimed at informing parents about the types of games their children are playing (or are asking to play). Some ratings of controversial games indicate they are not targeted at young children (\\"Mature\\" (M) or \\"Adults Only\\" (AO) in the US, or 15 or 18 in the UK). The packaging warns such games should not be sold to children. In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors. In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are legally binding. UK retailers also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not legally binding.  Canada  The Ontario Film Review Board and the British Columbia Film Classification Office respectively prohibited the sale of Manhunt and Soldier of Fortune to customers under the age of 18, notwithstanding their ESRB \\"Mature\\" ratings, by legally classifying them as films and giving them a \\"Restricted\\" rating. Ontario, as well as several other provinces, have since adopted laws that allow the ESRB ratings system to be enforceable by law, primarily by making it unlawful for retailers to sell \\"Mature\\" or \\"Adults Only\\" rated games to customers who are not appropriately- aged.  China  Cai Wu, former head of China's Ministry of Culture Video game consoles were banned in Mainland China in June 2000.Hook L. \\"Lenovo's Kinect-clone evades Chinese ban on video-game consoles.\\" The Globe and Mail 18 June 2012.

However, the Chinese would still police video games which would be \\"hostile to China or not in conformity with the outlook of China's government\\". Reported by Bloomberg, metaphorically speaking, Cai Wu, head of China's Ministry of Culture, said \\"We want to open the window a crack to get some fresh air, but we still need a screen to block the flies and mosquitoes.\\". Censorship of video games in China often relate to unfavorable views of war, history, and the government. Several video games have been banned in China for these reasons. In 2004, Hearts of Iron was banned as the Ministry of Culture deemed the games portrayal of World War II to be distorted. In 2013, the Chinese Ministry banned Battlefield 4 as they claimed it misrepresented China and was an attempt to \\"smears China's image\\".  Germany  The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) in ¬ß 86a outlaws the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations, ¬ß 130 Volksverhetzung (agitation of the people), and ¬ß 131 instructions for crimes. In the official lists, these three sections are always bundled, so any game that contains swastika flags and/or any depiction of Adolf Hitler is listed alongside racist propaganda pieces. ¬ß 131 outlaws representation of excessive violence in media \\"which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity.\\" On August 9, 2018, USK announced that the German government will relax this Section ¬ß 86a restriction on video games, as long as the imagery included falls within the \\"social adequacy\\" allowance. USK will still evaluate how this imagery is used and reject games they believe fail to meet the social adequacy allowance. One notable example of censorship in Germany is that of Call of Duty: WWII. In the German version of the game, swastika symbols are removed and replaced with Iron Crosses. Gore is also heavily censored, especially in the campaign. Another censored video game in Germany was Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, where Hitler's famous mustache was digitally removed and swastikas were replaced with triangular symbols.  Japan  The Japanese versions are known for removing or heavily modifying anything and all related to sex and nudity in the game out of fear and concern for the \\"morality\\" of its citizens. In general, censorship in Japan aims to reduce gore and extreme violence in the localized versions of games.

United States and territories  The United States, Puerto Rico, Samoa, Guam, Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands all voluntarily comply with the ESRB rating system. = History = The first major controversy over video games in the United States was in the early 1990s, when games such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap released, which were known for scenes that would be considered too violent or too sexual for kids. The issue regarding video games eventually made it into the United States Congress. After a proposal to have a government commission to establish video game ratings, the Interactive Digital Software Association was established by major video game corporations and presented the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to the Congress, which was approved and would become the standard of video game ratings. Jack Thompson has criticized \\"violent video games\\", claiming that playing violent video games leads to teenagers replicating those behaviors in the real world.\\"Excerpt from '20/20' on the Debate Whether Violent Video Games Desensitize Children\\". World News Now, ABC, 2000-03-23. He often represented victims or parents of victims in cases regarding shootings, usually blaming the actions on the perpetrator having played violent video games. Thompson also supported a campaign that tried to stop the release of Bully.Dobbs, Lou. Lou Dobbs Tonight. CNN, 2005-08-24. In 2013, the Entertainment Software Association, the lobbying group for the video games industry, had enlisted over 500,000 members to the \\"Video Game Voters Network,\\" a \\"grassroots\\" lobbying group to mobilize gamers to act against public policy that may negatively impact the gaming industry. The VGV was launched in 2006 by the ESA, and uses social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to inform members of allies and opponents. In 2013, the ESA spent over US$3.9 Million on lobbying, including but not limited to against VVG legislation. This included opposing a bipartisan federal bill that would direct the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects of all forms of violent media. Such bills themselves had come under criticisms from some scholars for pressuring scientists to find specific outcomes rather than studying the issues neutrally =US government legislation= The regulation of video games have been historically supported by politicians such as Joe Lieberman and Hillary Clinton, who have pushed legislation for regulating video games.\\"Senators Clinton, Lieberman Announce Federal Legislation to Protect Children from Inappropriate Video Games\\".

No video game console manufacturer has allowed any game marked AO to be published in North America; however, the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as Hatred to be published on its platform. No major retailers are willing to sell AO-rated games. However, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was rated AO after the presence of the Hot Coffee add-on became evident. The add-on was later removed and the game rated M. In the 109th Congress and 110th Congress, the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives. The act required an identification check for the purchase of M and AO rated games. The bill and others like it did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations.\\"Video games ratings enforcement act.\\" FR Web Gate US government website.Triplett W. \\"Bill targets teen gamers.\\" Variety 7 May 2008. Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content, a 2008 survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from 83% in 2000 to 20% in 2008. A further survey in April 2011, found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant decrease from the 20% purchase rate in 2009. On 7 January 2009, Joe Baca, representative of California's 43rd District, introduced H.R. 231, the Video game health labelling act. This bill called for a label to be placed in a \\"clear and conspicuous location on the packaging\\" on all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher stating, \\"WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.\\"\\"H.R. 231, Video game health labelling act.\\" Congressional bills, GPO access.Baca J. \\"Video game health.\\" US government.

The bill was once again passed onto the subcommittee. On 27 June 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association. Video games were protected speech under the First Amendment. The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors. The video game industry, led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association, successfully obtained an injunction on the bill, believing that the definition of violence as stated in the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech. This opinion was upheld in lower courts, and supported by the Supreme Court's decision. The majority of the justices did not consider the studies brought to their attention as convincing evidence of harm, and stated that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that was not applied to other forms of media.\\"Arnold Schwarzenegger.

However, Justice Breyer's minority decision found the evidence more convincing. Deana Pollard Sacks, Brad Bushman, and Craig A. Anderson objected to the ruling, claiming that the thirteen experts who authored the Statement on Video Game Violence on the Brown side were considerably more academically merited, and had on average authored over 28 times as many peer-reviewed journal articles about aggression/violence based on original empirical research as the signatories supporting the EMA, whereas the over 100 signatories supporting Brown had on average authored over 14 times as many. Richard Hall, Ryan Hall, and Terri Day replied: \\"It is not surprising that Anderson and Bushman found their own qualifications and the qualifications of those who agree with them to be superior to the qualifications of those who disagree with them\\", and claimed that they might have used methodology which have undercounted contributions of some scholars. On 3 April 2013, Dianne Feinstein, a Californian senator and Democrat, spoke in San Francisco to a group of 500 constituents about gun violence. She said video games have \\"a very negative role for young people, and the industry ought to take note of that\\" and that Congress might have to step in if the video games industry did not cease to glorify guns.\\"Sen.

It is commonly named in Colombia as Bobito, Utta, Tol and Coludo. The puffbirds are an insectivorous bird family related to the jacamars, but lacking the iridescent colours of that group. The russet- throated puffbird is fairly common in dry scrub and dry forest. It excavates a burrow in an arboreal termite colony and lays three white eggs. The russet- throated puffbird is typically long and weighs . It is a dumpy bird with a large head, a long tail and a thick black hooked-tipped bill. The face is mainly white with a large yellow eye. The upperparts are brown with whitish spotting and white wing tips. The underparts vary considerably. The two western subspecies have an off-white throat, buff underparts, and two dark brown chest bands. Some authorities split this genus into two species, the other being the two-banded puffbird, H. bicinctus. The three subspecies found in Colombia and in Venezuela east of the Andes have a single breast band, a deep rufous throat and whitish or buff underparts. This insectivore hunts from a perch, sitting and watching, then flying down to catch insects, lizards and other small prey. The russet-throated puffbird's call is a long series of woduk notes, often given synchronously by a pair of birds.

It starred Marlo Thomas as the title character Ann Marie, an aspiring (but only sporadically employed) actress, who moves from her hometown of Brewster, New York, to try to make it big in New York City. Ann has to take a number of offbeat \\"temp\\" jobs to support herself in between her various auditions and bit parts. Ted Bessell played her boyfriend Donald Hollinger, a writer for Newsview Magazine. Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp played Lew Marie and Helen Marie, her concerned parents. Bernie Kopell, Ruth Buzzi, and Reva Rose played Ann and Donald's friends. That Girl was developed by writers Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, who had served as head writers on The Dick Van Dyke Show (with which Thomas's father, Danny Thomas, was closely associated) earlier in the 1960s.

Some consider this show the forerunner of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and an early indication of the changing roles of American women in feminist-era America. Thomas's goofy charm, together with Bessell's dry wit, made That Girl a solid performer on the ABC Television Network, and while the series, in the overall ratings, never made the top thirty during its entire five-year run, it did respectably well. At the end of the 1969-1970 season, That Girl was still doing moderately well in the ratings, but after four years Thomas had grown tired of the series and wanted to move on. ABC convinced her to do one more year. In the beginning of the fifth season, Don and Ann became engaged, but they never actually married. The decision to leave the couple engaged at the end of the run was largely the idea of Thomas. She did not want to send a message to young women that marriage was the ultimate goal for them, and she worried that it would have undercut the somewhat feminist message of the show.\\"THAT GIRL on The Web: Interviews with Marlo Thomas\\" Intro Every episode started with a small cold open; the dialogue would always turn to Ann Marie, as one of the characters would make an assertive reference to her as \\"that girl;\\" the camera would freeze frame on a surprised Ann Marie (although it is sometimes a picture or a reflection of her in a mirror). This was followed by the opening credits and theme music. During the first four seasons, the theme song was instrumental only; beginning with season five, lyrics were added: Diamonds, daisies, snowflakes, That girl. Chestnuts, rainbows, springtime... Is that girl. She's tinsel on a tree... She's everything that every girl should be! Sable, popcorn, white wine, That girl Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway... Is that girl. She's mine alone, but luckily for you... If you find a girl to love, Only one girl to love, Then she'll be That Girl too... That Girl! source: https://lyricsondemand.com/tvthemes/thatgirllyrics.html Production notes According to Marlo Thomas, she was approached by ABC executive Edgar Scherick, who saw her in a screen test for a failed pilot, but still wanted to feature her in a project. Scherick gave Thomas several scripts to read, none of which she liked, as they all focused on a woman who was either a traditional girlfriend, wife or secretary to someone else; Thomas wanted a show in which the main character was a young, modern woman focused on her own dreams and aspirations. Although never officially credited as such (Persky and Denoff were the series' creators and official executive producers), Thomas was also a de facto executive producer of the series through her Daisy Productions, which she formed specifically for the series; it was credited on-screen as the production company.\\"The Paley Center for Media  She Made It  Marlo Thomas\\".

Episodes Five complete seasons of That Girl aired, with the series finale airing on March 19, 1971. Over the five seasons, a total of 136 episodes aired. Thomas' sister Terre, her brother Tony, and father Danny Thomas all appeared in a 1969 episode called \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". =Pilot= The only episode never shown during the series' original network run was the pilot produced in 1965. The major differences were evident in its opening credits. Bessell's character was Don Blue Sky, Ann Marie's talent agent who was part Cherokee, and Harold Gould and Penny Santon played her parents. By the time the series aired on ABC, Thomas and Bessell were the only actors to receive top billing.Stoddard, Sylvia. TV Treasures: That Girl. Second Edition. Los Angeles: SquareOne Publications, 2004. The pilot episode centered on Ann Marie's attempt to adopt a stage name based on her agent's suggestion. After her use of \\"Marie Brewster\\" (the names of her family and hometown combined) was met with disapproval from her parents, she decided to not make the change in the end. This storyline and numerous scenes were recycled into the 11th episode of Season 1 titled \\"What's in a Name?\\" from November 17, 1966. The pilot was included in the 5-disc set of That Girl: Season One, which was released by Shout! Factory in 2006.Vancheri, Barbara. \\"TV on DVD: That Girl: Season One; Brilliant But Cancelled: EZ Streets,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Thursday, May 18, 2006.

Spin-offs In 1973, Rankin/Bass produced That Girl in Wonderland, an animated television special in which Marlo Thomas reprised the role of Ann Marie. It aired as an episode of The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie on January 13, 1973. The special also featured the voices of Patricia Bright, Dick Hehmeyer, Rhoda Mann, and Ted Schwartz. Popular culture The series' theme song and opening visuals have been parodied in pop culture several times. They appeared as a series of T-shirts, then as a Saturday Night Live skit featuring Danitra Vance in an African American remake \\"That Black Girl\\", as a sequence on episodes of Animaniacs, The Simpsons, Family Guy, Clarissa Explains It All, Arthur, Friends and Roseanne. It was also parodied in the pre-credits teaser of an episode of The Nanny where Maxwell's mother encounters Fran at the florist. The 2011 advertising campaign for the launch of Fox's sitcom New Girl featured posters of that sitcom's star, Zooey Deschanel, in the make-up, pose and graphic look of Marlo Thomas from the original That Girl series. An episode from Ugly Betty had Fabia forcing Wilhelmina Slater into making an exchange: she'll give up her wedding date to Wilhelmina in exchange for the services of Wilhelmina's assistant, Marc St. James, after Fabia evokes the opening lines. In 1968, shortly after the feminist protest against bras and other feminine products at the Miss America pageant, Marlo Thomas began going braless on That Girl. \\"God created women to bounce,\\" Thomas said. \\"So be it.\\" In season 7, episode 2 of Mad Men, episode 80 of That Girl (\\"There Was a Time Ann Met a Pie Man\\") which originally aired February 13, 1969 can be seen playing in Donald Draper's home.

The term remained in use during subsequent monarchic reigns in German-speaking areas of Europe until the end of the First World War. At its origin the literal meaning of the word in German was 'trusted advisor'. The English-language equivalent is Privy Councillor. The office contributing to the state's politics and legislation had its roots in the age of absolutism from the 17th century onward, when a governmental administration by a dependent bureaucracy was established similar to the French Conseil du Roi. A precursor was the Reichshofrat, a judicial body established by Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg. In Austria the professional title of Hofrat (Court Councillor) has remained in use as an official title for deserved civil servants up to today. With the Empire's dissolution and the rise of Constitutionalism in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the office of a Geheimrat became an honorific title conferred by the German states upon high officials, accompanied by the address Exzellenz. During that period related titles no longer affiliated with an office arose, like , an award for outstanding contributions in the field of commerce and industry, or ', an award for outstanding contributions to medicine. The term is also used in combination with the word Ecke - , colloquially describing male pattern baldness at the 'edges' of the forehead (i.e. the upper 'corners' of the face). In the Republic of Austria the title was officially abolished in 1919. In Germany, the title largely disappeared after the fall of the German Empire in 1918, when the various princely states of Germany were replaced by the constituent states of the Weimar Republic, although Geheimr√§te continued to be appointed by the Free State of Bavaria. However, many honorees continued to use it, and the title Geheimrat, its abbreviation and related abbreviations (, and even ) appear in captions until the 1930s, such as used by the German Federal Archives.\\"Mitglieder, welchen die Ehrengabe verliehen wurde\\".

History Alweg was founded by Swedish industrial magnate Dr. Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren in January 1953 as Alweg-Forschung, GmbH (Alweg Research Corporation), based in F√ºhlingen, a suburb of Cologne, Germany. The company was an outgrowth of the Verkehrsbahn-Studiengesellschaft (Transit Railway Study Group), which had already presented its first monorail designs and prototypes in the previous year. The Alweg name is an acronym of Dr. Wenner- Gren's name (Axel Lennart WEnner-Gren). Alweg is best remembered for their role in building the original Disneyland Monorail System at Disneyland, which opened in 1959, and the Seattle Center Monorail, which opened for the 1962 Century 21 Exposition. Both systems remain operational, with the Seattle Center Monorail still using the original Alweg trains which have traveled over one million miles. A third system, built in Turin for the Italia 61 exposition remained unused a few months after the exposition closed and was destroyed by a fire in the late 1970s, most probably set by vandals. The remnants of the system were scrapped in 1981, with the north station now being repurposed as an office building. In 1963, Alweg put forward a proposal to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for a monorail system that would be designed, built, operated and maintained within Los Angeles County, California by Alweg. Alweg promised to take all financial risk for the construction with the cost of the system to be recovered through fares collected. The supervisors voted down the proposal, mostly due to political pressures from Standard Oil of California and General Motors, which were strong advocates for automobile dependency. This move was greatly resented by famed author Ray Bradbury who supported the monorail project and resented the later move to build a subway in Los Angeles.Bradbury Speaks: Too Soon from the Cave, Too Far from the Stars (c.2005) for essay entitled: \\"L.A., We Are the World! A New Millennium Revelation\\"(1989) Alweg's technology was licensed in 1960 by Hitachi Monorail, which continues to construct monorails based on Alweg technology around the world. What was for decades the world's busiest monorail line, the Tokyo Monorail, was completed in 1964 by what was then the Hitachi-Alweg division of Hitachi, and today's busiest monorail system, Chongqing Rail Transit, is also based on Alweg and Hitachi technology. After Alweg ran into financial difficulties, Alweg's German operations were taken over by Krupp. Krupp wound up all Alweg operations by 1964. In the 1960s there was a plan to build an ALWEG monorail in the High Tatras in Slovakia.

They first appeared in Forever People #1 (cover-dated February-March 1971), and were created by Jack Kirby as part of his \\"Fourth World\\" epic. Publication history The protagonists of the series are a group of young New Gods from New Genesis who were on a mission to oppose Darkseid on Earth, and talked, dressed, and acted much like the flower children of the 1960s. In addition to the individual abilities and equipment of the members, the group can join together using the technology of a Mother Box to summon the powerful hero known as the Infinity-Man. The group travels by use of their Super-Cycle. The first issue of their title also introduced the Boom Tube. Their own title, The Forever People, debuted in 1971 and lasted 11 issues. They mainly fought Darkseid's forces, such as Glorious Godfrey in issue #3. Issues #9 and 10 guest-starred Deadman; according to writer/artist Jack Kirby's assistant Mark Evanier: \\"We were ordered to put Deadman into New Gods, but we slipped him into Forever People instead, where he was a little less obtrusive. Jack didn't like the character and didn't want to do it. He didn't feel he should be doing someone else's character. ... He doesn't want to trample on someone else's vision. Carmine [Infantino, DC Comics publisher and Deadman's co-creator] said the character hadn't sold and he wanted the Kirby touch on it\\". The series ended on a cliffhanger, with the Forever People stranded on Adon. In 1988, a six-issue Forever People limited series by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Paris Cullins was published, showing what happens to the Forever People on Adon. This series reveals that the Forever People were Earth-born humans ‚Äî infants doomed to die but brought to New Genesis instead, gathered to protect the human race. They returned to Earth to oppose 'the Darkness', a sentient but disembodied force of hopelessness. They were aided by a mysterious being Maya who is ultimately revealed to be the consciousness of their Mother Box. During the events of Death of the New Gods, one of the miniseries that attempted to lead into Final Crisis, the human origin of the Forever People was retconned, and it was hinted that the five were to have been the first of the next evolution of the New Gods ‚Äî godlings becoming more than the sum of their parts. In the Death of the New Gods, Superman and Mister Miracle discover that the Forever People were murdered several months prior to the discovery of their bodies, and it is later revealed that an impostor posing as Himon has been murdering the New Gods as an agent for the Source; but the murderer turns out to be Infinity Man. In the Final Crisis Sketchbook, the Forever People (along with other members of the New Gods) are shown to be given updated looks, which Grant Morrison calls \\"more gothic art school student than flower power\\". In the event itself, Japan's pop culture team, the Super Young Team are revealed to be the Fifth World incarnation of the Forever People. In The New 52, the series Infinity Man and the Forever People makes some changes, where Serifan is now Serafina, Vykin's sister, and Beautiful Dreamer has been renamed Dreamer Beautiful. This series was cancelled as of issue #9 (May 2015). Original members Members of the Forever People, on the cover of issue #9 (June-July 1972). From top to bottom: Big Bear, Vykin the Black, Mark Moonrider, Beautiful Dreamer, Serifan. Artists: Jack Kirby and Mike Royer =Beautiful Dreamer= During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries, it was established that Dreamer had been married to Big Bear, and together they had a child, named Maya after the spirit of their old Mother Box. Since then, their marriage and daughter has been voided by a retcon during John Byrne's Jack Kirby's Fourth World series. When last shown, Dreamer was romantically involved with Takion, the new Highfather of New Genesis. In Superman & Batman: Generations 3, she marries Superman, and has his children, Lar-El and Vara. All three are killed by Darkseid. Powers and abilities Like all the children of New Genesis, Beautiful Dreamer possesses the advanced physiology of a New God; she is extremely long-lived, has a limited degree of superhuman strength, resistance and reflexes. She's a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Also, she has psionic powers, with which she can create illusions. It seems there are no limits to the size or duration of these images. In addition, she has been able to feel the fluctuations within the Source. =Big Bear= Big Bear had been married to Beautiful Dreamer, and she had been pregnant with their daughter. A shift in time resulted in the marriage never happening and the child never having existed. This traumatized Beautiful Dreamer for a time. In Forever People #7, he was shown to have been responsible for the historical event that led to the legend of King Arthur. Powers and abilities A skilled hand- to-hand combatant, Big Bear is among the strongest of the children of New Genesis, making him superstrong by human standards, capable of bending steel and hurling giant redwood trees almost effortlessly. Big Bear's atomic structure is reinforced by a constant flow of so-called high-density atoms, and he is able to store an excess of free-flowing atoms which he can direct at will to reinforce the power of his already awesome punch. =Mark Moonrider= During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries set on Adon, Mark was shown to have fallen in love with, and later married one of the natives, Mina. They had three children (Merry, Wendy and Starbright), but when the shift in time caused by the Darkness' actions undid the events which 'evolved' the natives, this marriage now never had occurred, leaving Mark with only his friends. Powers and abilities In addition to being extremely long-lived, Mark has superhuman strength, reflexes and he's very resistant to conventional injury. Also, he has a keen mind with good leadership skills and he is well-trained in hand-to-hand combat. He possesses a Megaton Touch. With it, he can cause a tremendous explosion, and no doubt he could easily kill with it if he and his companions were not sworn never to take a life. Used at low intensity, it can cause a severe shock. On one occasion he used his megaton touch to turn solid rock into molten lava. =Serifan= Serifan is the youngest member of the group. He's usually the most vulnerable. The Dark saw this and possessed Serifan, using him to conquer Forevertown and plague the Forever People. After the Dark was defeated he returned to his normal self. Powers and abilities Although Serifan doesn't have super- potencies, still he is stronger and more durable than any human. Also, Serifan is functionally a sensitive possessing limited telepathic powers. In his hatband Serifan carries \\"cosmic cartridges\\" that serve various purposes when fired from his revolver. For example, the cartridges can be used to create a protective shock-repelli-field, drain energy of people, to create an anti- gravity effect, to generate high gravitational force, modify the atomic density, to generate intense heat, to power a vehicle, or to stun an opponent. Also, the cartridges tune the wielder into the \\"cosmic Harmony\\" that is linked to the Source and, in the case of the \\"Blue Cartridge\\", it manipulates the life force and allowed Deadman to merge with a \\"Follower\\" and have a body of his own once again. =Vykin= Throughout the Kirby run, Vykin was referred to as \\"Vykin the Black\\". He was the first black superhero to appear in a DC comic book, preceding Kirby's Black Racer by approximately seven months. When the Forever People were stranded on Adon, Mark Moonrider thought it would be advantageous to civilize the people of the planet. When Vykin used their Mother Box to do so, it overloaded and was destroyed, killing Vykin in the process, but managing to create Forevertown. When the Dark overtook and reversed the effects of the Mother Box, Vykin was brought back to life. Recently he was reunited on New Genesis with his mother, Valkyra the Commander, who rode a winged robotic horse. Later on, she sacrificed her life to save her lover Orion. Powers and abilities Like all New gods, Vykin The Black is functionally immortal and all his physical attributes are superhuman. Also, Vykin The Black possesses \\"Magno-Power\\", which enables him to project magnetic energy. He can mentally trace atomic patterns, and is therefore good at tracking. Vykin has a keen mind and he's a skilled hand-to- hand combatant. It is Vykin who carries the Forever People's Mother Box, a kind of sentient computer. =Infinity-Man= Infinity-Man is Drax, the older brother of Uxas, who would later become Darkseid of Apokolips, and became the Infinity-Man after treachery at the hands of Uxas while attempting to harness the Omega Force for himself. No explanation was given as to why he was involved with the Forever People other than Big Bear's offhanded comment to Superman in the first issue of \\"we've got an arrangement with the Infinity Man\\". The Infinity-Man's powers were never fully cataloged other than having some direct link to the Source. He was shown capable of flight, super- strength, enhanced vision powers, and the ability to negate gravity and convert it into a repulsive force. Fifth World The Super Young Team are the contemporary Fifth World incarnations of the Forever People. Created by writer Grant Morrison in the early \\"52\\" stages of his DC Universe Final Crisis storyline, they are influenced by American super-heroes and Japanese pop culture, and were first mentioned in 52 #6. This group recruits Sunny Sumo, a powerful fighter who assisted the original Forever People in the first series. Other versions =Amalgam Comics= The Un-People are a superhero group in the Amalgam Comics universe. They are a combination of the Forever People and Marvel Comics' the Inhumans. In other media =Television= * The Forever People appear in the Justice League episode \\"Twilight\\" Pt. 2. * The Forever People appear in the Young Justice episode \\"Disordered\\" with Vykin voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, Big Bear voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, Beautiful Dreamer voiced by Grey DeLisle, and Serifan voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. They arrived on Earth in order to reclaim the \\"New Genisphere\\" (the same sphere that the Bialyans found) where they run into Superboy and Wolf. They learn that Superboy had saved the New Genisphere. Superboy and the Forever People end up arriving at a nearby construction site where they stumble upon Intergang in the middle of a gold theft. The group witness Intergang using technology from Apokolips. Upon bringing their fight to the surface, the Forever People summon Infinity-Man who repels Intergang. When Superboy and the Forever People find a warehouse containing the weapons from Apokolips, they are ambushed by Desaad of Apokolips. During the Forever People's formation of Infinity-Man, Desaad throws a Father Box into the formation in order to control him. Desaad then has Infinity-Man attack Superboy and Wolf. With help from the New Genisphere, Superboy reclaims control of Infinity-Man. After Desaad retreats, the Forever People place the Mother Box in the New Genisphere to heal it and tell Superboy that they must take the New Genisphere to New Genesis. After an outburst from Superboy, and positive feedback from the Sphere itself, the Forever People let the New Genisphere stay with him. Big Bear returns in the third season. There are implications of a falling out between Big Bear and Beautiful Dreamer. Beautiful Dreamer appears in the episode \\"Quiet Conversations\\" explaining that they will need Metron's chair to fix Victor Stone. =Film= * An alternative universe version of Mark Moonrider makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in Justice League: Gods and Monsters. He participated in the massacre of the Apokoliptians during the wedding of Bekka and Orion.

While an indifference curve mapping helps to solve the utility- maximizing problem of consumers, the isoquant mapping deals with the cost- minimization problem of producers. Isoquants are typically drawn along with isocost curves in capital-labor graphs, showing the technological tradeoff between capital and labor in the production function, and the decreasing marginal returns of both inputs. Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output, and this is reflected in the shape of the isoquant. A family of isoquants can be represented by an isoquant map, a graph combining a number of isoquants, each representing a different quantity of output. Isoquants are also called equal product curves. Production isoquant (strictly convex) and isocost curve (linear) An isoquant shows that extent to which the firm in question has the ability to substitute between the two different inputs at will in order to produce the same level of output. An isoquant map can also indicate decreasing or increasing returns to scale based on increasing or decreasing distances between the isoquant pairs of fixed output increment, as output increases. If the distance between those isoquants increases as output increases, the firm's production function is exhibiting decreasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs will result in placement on an isoquant with less than double the output of the previous isoquant. Conversely, if the distance is decreasing as output increases, the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs results in placement on an isoquant with more than twice the output of the original isoquant. As with indifference curves, two isoquants can never cross. Also, every possible combination of inputs is on an isoquant. Finally, any combination of inputs above or to the right of an isoquant results in more output than any point on the isoquant. Although the marginal product of an input decreases as you increase the quantity of the input while holding all other inputs constant, the marginal product is never negative in the empirically observed range since a rational firm would never increase an input to decrease output. An isoquants shows all those combinations of factors which produce same level of output. An isoquants is also known as equal product curve or iso-product curve. It describes the firm's alternative methods for producing a given level of output. Shapes of Isoquants If the two inputs are perfect substitutes, the resulting isoquant map generated is represented in fig. A; with a given level of production Q3, input X can be replaced by input Y at an unchanging rate. The perfect substitute inputs do not experience decreasing marginal rates of return when they are substituted for each other in the production function. If the two inputs are perfect complements, the isoquant map takes the form of fig. B; with a level of production Q3, input X and input Y can only be combined efficiently in the certain ratio occurring at the kink in the isoquant. The firm will combine the two inputs in the required ratio to maximize profit. Isoquants are typically combined with isocost lines in order to solve a cost-minimization problem for given level of output. In the typical case shown in the top figure, with smoothly curved isoquants, a firm with fixed unit costs of the inputs will have isocost curves that are linear and downward sloped; any point of tangency between an isoquant and an isocost curve represents the cost-minimizing input combination for producing the output level associated with that isoquant. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.Salvatore, Dominick (1989). Schaum's outline of theory and problems of managerial economics, McGraw-Hill, Non convexity Under the assumption of declining marginal rate of technical substitution, and hence a positive and finite elasticity of substitution, the isoquant is convex to the origin. A locally nonconvex isoquant can occur if there are sufficiently strong returns to scale in one of the inputs. In this case, there is a negative elasticity of substitution - as the ratio of input A to input B increases, the marginal product of A relative to B increases rather than decreases. A nonconvex isoquant is prone to produce large and discontinous changes in the price minimizing input mix in response to price changes. Consider for example the case where the isoquant is globally nonconvex, and the isocost curve is linear. In this case the minimum cost mix of inputs will be a corner solution, and include only one input (for example either input A or input B). The choice of which input to use will depend on the relative prices. At some critical price ratio, the optimum input mix will shift from all input A to all input B and vice versa in response to a small change in relative prices.

Badcoe, born Peter Badcock, joined the Australian Army in 1950 and graduated from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, in 1952 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Australian Artillery. A series of regimental postings followed, including a tour in the Federation of Malaya in 1962, during which he spent a week in South Vietnam observing the fighting. That year, Badcock changed his surname to Badcoe. After another regimental posting, he transferred to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, and was promoted to major. In August 1966, Badcoe arrived in South Vietnam as a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was initially a sub-sector adviser, but in December became the operations adviser for Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Province. In this role, between February and April 1967, he displayed conspicuous gallantry and leadership on three occasions while on operations with South Vietnamese Regional Force units. In the final battle, he was killed by a burst of machine-gun fire. He was highly respected by both his South Vietnamese and United States allies, and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. He was also awarded the United States Silver Star and several South Vietnamese medals. He was buried at Terendak Garrison Cemetery in Malaysia. In 2008, Badcoe's medal set was auctioned for A$488,000 to Kerry Stokes in collaboration with the Government of South Australia. After going on display at the South Australian Museum and touring regional South Australia, it is now displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Buildings and awards have been named after Badcoe, including a soldiers' club in South Vietnam, an assembly room and library at Portsea, the main lecture theatre at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and a perpetual medal for an Australian Football League match held on Anzac Day. Early life and career A group of Australian Army officers in Singapore. Badcoe is in the centre with his hands behind his back. Badcoe was born Peter John Badcock on 11 January 1934 in the Adelaide suburb of Malvern, South Australia. His father was Leslie Allen Badcock, a public servant, and his mother was Gladys Mary Ann May Overton. He was educated at Adelaide Technical High School, before gaining employment as a clerk with the South Australian Public Service in 1950. Despite his father's opposition, Badcock held ambitions to join the Australian Army; and enlisted in the Regular Army on 10 June 1950. After a brief posting to the 16th National Service Battalion in early 1952, Badcock entered the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, on 12 July 1952, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Australian Artillery on 13 December that year. This was followed by a short posting to the 14th National Service Training Battalion, then a posting to the 1st Field Regiment in 1953. He returned to train national servicemen in 1955‚Äì1957. On 26 May 1956, he married Denise Maureen MacMahon in the Methodist Church at Manly, New South Wales. The couple had three daughters ‚Äì Carey, Kim and Susanne. Badcoe was posted back to the 1st Field Regiment in 1957‚Äì1958. A junior staff officer in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans at Australian Army Headquarters from 1958 until 1961, he was promoted to temporary captain in 1958, and substantive captain in June 1960,. On 6 February 1961, he was posted to the 4th Field Regiment, and the same year changed his surname to Badcoe. On training exercises, Badcoe was aggressive and energetic. He was also a quiet, gentle and retiring man who confided mainly in his wife and had a dry wit. His colleagues found him inscrutable. He avoided boisterous mess activities and preferred reading military history. Short and stocky, a teetotaller who did not smoke, he wore horn-rimmed spectacles and regaled his colleagues on military matters when off-duty. In June 1961, Badcoe was posted to the 103rd Field Battery as battery captain, and served a tour with them in the Federation of Malaya in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency. He was detached from Malaya to South Vietnam over the period 7‚Äì14 November 1962, and observed how that country was combating the Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese insurgency. During his visit, Badcoe sought opportunities to experience combat. He spent five days with an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion on operations in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, during which the unit had contacts with the enemy, including a pitched battle. During what was supposed to be a rest period, he arranged a helicopter flight to visit a Montagnard base in the Central Highlands. When his return to Malaya was delayed by an aircraft engine breakdown, he managed to join a heliborne operation of the 7th ARVN Division in the Mekong Delta. He returned to the 1st Field Regiment in November 1962 and remained with the unit until August 1965. At this point, Badcoe transferred from the artillery to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, and on promotion to temporary major on 10 August 1965, was posted to the Infantry Centre at Ingleburn, New South Wales. Badcoe successfully applied for a posting with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV), and attended adviser courses at the Intelligence Centre at Mosman, New South Wales, and Jungle Training Centre in Canungra, Queensland. He was promoted to provisional major in June 1966. Vietnam War South Vietnamese Territorial Forces soldiers undergoing training. Badcoe arrived in South Vietnam on 6 August 1966 as a member of the AATTV. He was posted as a sub-sector adviser in the Nam H√≥a District of Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. Sub-sector advisers worked at the district level with two elements of the Territorial Forces, the Regional Force (RF) and Popular Force (PF), which were both forms of full-time provincial militia under control of the provincial chief, who was also the military sector chief. Each sector corresponded with a province, and each sub-sector with a district. The sector and sub-sector advisers had several responsibilities: to accompany the RF/PF, colloquially known as \\"Ruff- Puffs\\", on operations; to provide on-the-job training to the RF/PF; to oversee security in the hamlets; and to liaise with the ARVN troops operating in the sector or sub-sector. In his first week at Nam H√≥a, Badcoe was advising an RF company on a clearing operation when it came under fire from VC irregulars in a treeline. As the company pressed forward, it came under fire from a bunker. Badcoe unsuccessfully tried to silence the bunker using his rifle and hand grenades, at which point the company commander suggested calling in close air support. Badcoe responded that air support was not necessary. He collected two jerrycans of petrol from a jeep following the company and then, circling around using cover, approached the bunker from outside its arc of fire. He poured both jerrycans over the bunker, backed off some distance and ignited it with a white phosphorus grenade, destroying the VC position and allowing the company to advance. Easily identified by the maroon paratroop beret he wore, Badcoe led from the front and gave the impression he believed himself invincible. According to the former AATTV adviser and military historian Ian McNeill, enthusiasm, courage and audacity were Badcoe's hallmarks, and those around him were often infected by his optimism. Badcoe was so fearless he appeared reckless, and was often cautioned by colleagues in this respect. Jim Pashen, a warrant officer serving with the AATTV, recalled Badcoe driving alone in a jeep from Hu·∫ø to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, and being shot at by snipers as he passed by. Badcoe was also very interested in Vietnam, its people and their customs, and was particularly fascinated by Hu·∫ø, the ancient royal city. He traded alcohol and souvenirs from the AATTV's canteen with US Marines to acquire equipment for RF units, and also donated food and supplies to an orphanage. In December 1966, Badcoe became the sector operations adviser at the provincial headquarters in Hu·∫ø. This role generally involved planning, liaison and staff work, but Badcoe interpreted his duty statement flexibly and led local forces into combat whenever he got the chance. According to a fellow AATTV officer, Captain Barry Rissel, he was a \\"veritable tiger\\" in combat, a characteristic that led his US allies to dub him \\"The Galloping Major\\". At his first meeting with Badcoe, Corporal Chris Black described the scene: On 23 February 1967, Badcoe and his United States Marine Corps deputy, Captain James Custar, were advising an RF company operation in the Phu Thu District. About on their flank was a PF platoon accompanied by two United States Army advisers, Captain Clement and Sergeant Thomas. Badcoe and Custar began to hear intermittent rifle fire, coming from the direction of the flanking platoon. Custar was monitoring radio transmissions when he heard that Clement had been wounded and Thomas was in danger. Badcoe ran across the intervening fire-swept ground to reach the PF platoon, with the enemy fire intensifying as he approached. He discovered that Clement was lying ahead of the platoon, and had been mortally wounded while going to assist a wounded PF soldier. Thomas had tried to reach Clement and had in turn been wounded and was lying in the open between Clement and the platoon, which had pulled back. Badcoe observed that the enemy were dug in along a small rise, and appeared to be in about company- strength and readying for an attack. He gathered the PF platoon and led a frontal assault on the enemy position, firing as he went. Dodging automatic fire, he charged a machine-gun position and shot the crew with his rifle. Led by Badcoe, the PF platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Once the PF platoon had consolidated its position, Badcoe went back, still under fire, to lift Clement and carry him out of the danger area. He then returned and assisted Thomas to a position from which he could be safely evacuated. The operation concluded successfully. Two weeks later, the sector RF reaction company was tasked to the Qu·∫£ng ƒêi·ªÅn District sub-sector on 7 March in response to an attack on its district headquarters by a VC force of about two battalions. Qu·∫£ng ƒêi·ªÅn District headquarters was in the eponymous village, about northwest of Hu·∫ø. Badcoe was travelling in a vehicle convoy with his deputy and another US officer, when their vehicle veered off the road into a ditch. His deputy was killed and Badcoe left the vehicle and joined the company commander as they drove towards the village. By the time Badcoe and the company arrived, the village was occupied by the VC, and they were attacking the district headquarters from three sides. Badcoe quickly formed the company up into platoons, then led them through enemy fire to a position which flanked the VC. Forming them into an extended line, he then led them in an assault across open ground against the main VC force. In the face of this attack, the VC withdrew in disarray and the garrison of the district headquarters was saved. Badcoe's intervention prevented serious losses and the capture of the district headquarters. Badcoe became disillusioned with the war during his service in South Vietnam. He was particularly affected by an incident in February 1967 in which the ARVN regiment he was working with called in a napalm strike on a VC-occupied village, whose population was strongly supportive of the government, instead of attempting to attack and dislodge the VC. Badcoe and other advisers attempted to stop the use of napalm, but the ARVN divisional headquarters overruled them. A total of 40 civilians were killed or wounded, and Badcoe spent the next day-and-a-half arranging the removal of bodies and new accommodation for the survivors. He eventually concluded that the conflict was an \\"unwinnable war\\". On 7 April, Badcoe, who wrote frankly to his wife and children, penned a letter to them expressing his \\"unease and cynicism\\" about the conduct of the war and indicating that he wished to come home. At this time Badcoe was planning to take a short break on the Japanese island of Okinawa starting the following day, with an Australian Army friend who had been visiting him, observing operations. Badcoe's grave in the Terendak Garrison Cemetery When he returned from the field early in the morning of 7 April, Badcoe was told that he was required to act as sector headquarters duty officer due to the illness of another adviser. He saw his friend off to Da Nang and returned to Hu·∫ø where he commenced duty, planning to join his friend once he had completed his shift. He soon became aware that an operation was going badly for an ARVN force at the hamlet of An Thuan in H∆∞∆°ng Tr√† District, about north of Hu·∫ø. The operation involved the elite Hac Bao (Black Panther) divisional reaction company of the 1st ARVN Division, along with a squadron of armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and two RF companies. They were attempting to eliminate a VC force of about two companies which was holding well-entrenched positions at An Thuan. The ARVN force had been met with intense fire and had suffered heavy casualties. Badcoe realised that the force did not have any advisers, because one of the Hac Bao advisers was ill, and advisers were required to work in pairs. Without any advisers, the ARVN were unable to access close air support to dislodge the VC. Badcoe decided that he needed to go out to the ARVN force and assist them. He arranged for relief as the sector duty officer, grabbed his weapons and equipment, and collected Sergeant Alberto Alvarado, his US Army deputy adviser and radio operator. They sped in their jeep towards An Thuan. Upon arrival, they found the ARVN force preparing for another assault, which was to consist of the APCs followed by the Hac Bao company. Badcoe and his deputy climbed aboard an APC and joined the attack. About from An Thuan, the force was moving through the hamlet's cemetery and hostile fire increased markedly, from recoilless rifles, mortars, machine guns and small arms. The APCs drove through the cemetery and deployed to suppress the enemy fire. The Hac Bao company pressed forward through the cemetery, at which time Badcoe and Alvarado dismounted and joined them. During the last stages of the attack, the two advisers were leading the infantry when the enemy fire became so heavy that both the APCs and infantry began falling back through the cemetery. Badcoe began rallying the ARVN soldiers to renew the assault, and artillery was called in on the enemy positions. After this, Badcoe and Alvarado again pushed forward, attempting to encourage the ARVN troops to press home the attack. The final stages of the line of assault crossed dry, open rice paddy fields with no cover. Enemy fire converged on Badcoe, Alvarado and the ARVN troops, who again went to ground. On this occasion, Badcoe refused to fall back. He headed straight for an enemy machine-gun position that was causing devastation among the ARVN force. Forced to ground by the intense fire, Badcoe was soon joined by Alvarado. Badcoe lifted himself up to throw a hand grenade, but was pulled down by Alvarado as bullets cracked overhead. When he rose to throw again, he was cut down by machine-gun fire and killed instantly. Alvarado attempted to recover his body, but was shot in the leg. He then used his radio to call in close air support and more artillery to suppress the enemy fire. The Hac Bao company, supported by the APCs, then moved forward and captured the objective. A military funeral for Badcoe was held in Hu·∫ø, the largest for any Allied soldier until that date. Badcoe was buried in the Terendak Garrison Cemetery in Malacca, Malaysia. The epitaph on his gravestone reads: \\"He lived and died a soldier\\". According to McNeill, Badcoe was highly respected by both South Vietnamese and US allies, and was an inspirational leader who had saved the lives of his comrades and turned defeat into victory on many occasions. Post-script alt=a bronze Cross patt√©e suspended from a crimson ribbon For his courage and leadership on 23 February, 7 March and 7 April 1967, Badcoe was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded at that time to a member of the Australian armed forces. The full citation for the award appeared in The London Gazette on 17 October 1967. It read, in part: Jubilee 150 Walkway plaque on North Terrace, Adelaide, commemorating Badcoe Denise Badcoe received her husband's Victoria Cross from the Governor-General, Lord Casey, at Government House, Canberra, on 5 April 1968. Badcoe was awarded the United States Silver Star with bronze oak leaf cluster, Air Medal and Purple Heart, and was made a Knight of the National Order of Vietnam. South Vietnam also awarded him the Cross of Gallantry with Palm, Gold Star, and Silver Star, the Armed Forces Honor Medal, First Class, Vietnam Campaign Medal and Wound Medal, and he posthumously received the Vietnam Medal and Australian Defence Medal from Australia. The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948‚Äì1975 judged that Badcoe was \\"a dedicated career soldier\\" who \\"quickly acquired an understanding of the Vietnamese people and their customs along with an affectionate respect for the Vietnamese territorials he trained and led\\". Members of the AATTV received many decorations, and the unit gained the distinction of being \\"probably the mostly highly decorated unit for its size in the Australian Army\\". Only four Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross in Vietnam; all went to members of the AATTV, two of them posthumously. An Australian and New Zealand soldiers' club in Vung Tau was named the Peter Badcoe Club in his honour in November 1967. At Portsea, the assembly room and library was named after him, complete with a portrait and bronze plaque. After Portsea closed in 1985, the main lecture theatre in the Military Instruction Block at Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra was named after him. In 1998‚Äì1999, a rest area in Badcoe's honour was established near Lake George on the Remembrance Driveway between Canberra and Sydney. In 1999, the Ex-Military Rehabilitation Centre moved to the \\"Peter Badcoe VC Complex\\" at Edinburgh, South Australia. Badcoe's medal group and personal memoirs were offered for sale by auction in Sydney on 20 May 2008 and were sold for A$488,000 to the media magnate and philanthropist Kerry Stokes in collaboration with the Government of South Australia. Badcoe's Victoria Cross and associated medals were displayed at the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, prior to being toured to 17 regional towns in South Australia between 21 March and 20 June 2009, before being displayed permanently at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra from 2016. His VC was the 71st of the 100 VCs awarded to Australians to be placed on public display there. The award for the player displaying the most courage, skill, self-sacrifice and teamwork in the Australian Football League match in Adelaide on Anzac Day each year is called the Peter Badcoe VC Medal. In 2015, the Australian government repatriated the remains of 22 Australian soldiers buried at Terendak, but the Badcoe family asked that he remain buried there. In 2016, the South Australian electoral district of Ashford was renamed Badcoe in his honour. In 2020, a 60-bed residential aged care facility named Peter Badcoe VC House is to be completed in Newcastle, New South Wales, by RSL LifeCare.

The OSPAAAL was founded in Havana in January 1966, after the Tricontinental Conference, a meeting of over 500 delegates and 200 observers from over 82 countries. Acting as the \\"key bridge\\" to unite liberation struggles and movements in the three continents, OSPAAAL's main objective is the promotion of anti-imperialism and socialism. The Organization of American States (OAS) called OSPAAAL \\"the most dangerous threat that international communism has yet made against the inter-American system\\". OSPAAAL's motto was \\"This great humanity has said: enough! And has started to move forward\\". Until 2019, it published the magazine Tricontinental as their main transnational communication tool. After the closing of OSPAAAL by the Cuban Government, the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research seeks to continue the heritage of the Tricontinental conference and the organization. They \\"stand, in the words of Franz Fanon, with the wretched of the earth to create a world of human beings.\\" History and context The OSPAAAL was born out of the Tricontinental Conference in Havana, which Mehdi Ben Barka was preparing before his October 1965 assassination. OSPAA gathered for the first time in Cairo, Egypt in 1957. 500 delegates from 35 countries represented their national liberation movements and parties rather than states. It was led by Isma√´l Tour√©, the brother of Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, president of Guinea. Isma√´l Tour√© presided the board responsible of the solidarity funds, assisted by two vice-chairmen: Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco and Chu Tzu-chi of the People's Republic of China. At that time, AAPSO (Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation) was debating the inclusion of Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America to the group, a question posed again in Cairo in June 1961 by the new commission, the Commission on Neocolonialism, which was presided by Ben Barka. While the Casablanca Group, founded in 1961, gathered \\"progressive states\\" (Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Libya, and Morocco), the OSPAAL was an organization of movements, which aimed at creating national economic development plans for the newly independent states and to break national isolation through internationalism. In exile, Ben Barka resided there six months in 1964. Am√≠lcar Cabral, Malcolm X, and Che Guevara lived in the city around that time. Henri Curiel was there organizing \\"solidarity networks,\\" which trained African National Congress activists. (The ANC had been prohibited in 1960, and Curiel would be murdered in 1978). Ben Barka was going to create an anti-colonialist magazine titled The African Review, but he decided to enlarge the union to Latin America. After the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, Fidel Castro moved even closer to the Soviet Union. In February 1962, Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States (OEA). On October 3, 1965, Ben Barka declared in a press conference prior to the Havana conference that the \\"two currents of the world revolution would be represented there: the current born with the October Revolution and the national liberation revolutions' currents.\\" The fourth congress of the OSPAA, in Accra from May 6 to May 9, 1965, finally agreed on including Latin America and to take in account the founding January 1966 conference in Havana. In July, Medhi Ben Barka, who was presiding the preparatory council, assured the support of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and defined the objectives of the new organization, summed up as \\"total liberation:\\" aid to national liberation movements (in particular to the Palestinian movement), intensification of violent and peaceful struggles on all three continents, support to the Cuban Revolution, suppression of foreign military bases, support of the nuclear disarmament option, and opposition to apartheid and racial segregation. In September, Ben Barka went to Havana to prepare the opening up of the conference on January 3, 1966. However, on October 29, 1965, he was disappeared in Paris, allegedly abducted by Moroccan secret agents. The Havana Conference thus took place without him, and the OSPAAAL was officially founded. Activities  OSPAAAL cultivated relationships with international trade unions and solidarity groups around the world. OSPAAAL had a working relationship with the Movement for Colonial Freedom (MCF) a London-based transnational solidarity group. Their communication with Barbara Haq, General Secretary of MCF, included sending posters and published materials in exchange for annual reports and publications from MCF. As part of the campaign efforts of OSPAAAL the Executive Secretariat released official declarations about international anti-colonial struggles. Their strong opposition to US President Nixon‚Äôs military actions during the Vietnam War, such as the total blockade of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Operation Pocket Money, lead to them to denounce him as ‚Äòthe unscrupulous assassin of millions of Vietnamese; he is as dangerous as the fascist Hitler of World War II‚Äô. Following on from the critique of US military action in Vietnam OSPAAAL also called for greater solidarity between countries around the world following victories against US forces in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Beyond solidarity with anti-colonial struggles on a nation-state level, OSPAAAL campaigned for individuals involved in independence and anti-imperialist activities. OSPAAAL on behalf of a member organization, the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, called for support for Puerto Rican independence fighter Humberto Pag√°n. Following his arrest in Canada, OSPAAAL called for ‚Äòall revolutionary and progressive countries, parties and organisations to declare solidarity with Humberto Pag√°n militantly in every way possible‚Äô. Their aim was to highlight the perceived injustice of the court proceedings and to prevent the extradition of Pag√°n in fear for his safety were he to return to Puerto Rico. After refusing to grant an extradition order, and upon appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, Humberto Pag√°n was cleared of all charges and the extradition request was denied. Posters From its foundation until the mid-1980s, OSPAAAL produced brightly coloured propaganda posters promoting their cause. Financial difficulty and ink shortages due to the US embargo against Cuba pushed the artists and printers to find ingenious solutions with unorthodox outcomes, although it ultimately forced the organization to stop producing these posters. However, these posters began to be printed again in 2000. These posters, as they intended to be internationalist, usually had their message written in Spanish, English, French, and Arabic. As opposed to being put up on walls around Cuba, these posters were instead folded up and stapled into copies of Tricontinental, so that they could be distributed internationally. This allowed OSPAAAL to send its message to its subscribers around the world. All OSPAAAL-Posters from the beginning until 2003 are documented and indexed in the book The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster. One American, Jane Norling, is among the artists who designed posters for OSPAAAL, and is one of eight women who contributed designs for 22 of the approximately 326 OSPAAAL posters.

On 16 May 1915 near Rue du Bois, France, Lance-Corporal Tombs, on his own initiative, crawled out repeatedly under very heavy shell and machine-gun fire to bring in wounded men who were lying about 100 yards in front of our trenches. He rescued four men, one of whom he dragged back by means of a rifle sling placed round his own neck and the man's body.The action was on 16 May 1915 not 16 June 1915 as stated in the citation published in the London Gazette.

Sand casting Brass foundry History and editorship The editors were John Mason Good, Olinthus Gregory, and Newton Bosworth, as well as other anonymous writers. Work had begun in 1802, by Gregory and Bosworth and an anonymous writer, who gave up after about a year. They were later joined by Good. The preface lists the subjects for which each editor was responsible. The appearance of rival works held up publication for some years. The work was published serially, and the dates on the plates indicate the first sections were published in 1808. 191 of the plates related to natural history, and the balance to miscellaneous subjects. A number of the latter, dealing with manufacture and inventions, were drawn by John Farey, Jr., and engraved by Wilson Lowry. The natural history drawings were mainly by Sydenham Edwards. A feature of the plates relating to engineering and manufacture was the use by Farey of the drawings of John Smeaton as the basis for his work. Seven advantages over rivals The editors claimed in the preface [ix] that the work had seven advantages over its rivals: *It explained English words as well as those of the arts and sciences, so avoiding the need to have a separate dictionary. *It appended English names to the Linneian ones in the natural history section, so helping non-scientific readers. *It had a more up to date arrangement of mineralogy, reflecting modern concepts of the field. *References were given at the ends of the more important articles. *The natural history plates were coloured. *To permit the greatest amount of text to be included, longer articles were in small print. *It included accounts of sports, games, recreations and pastimes, including the rules by which they were conducted.

Mitchell of Supermarine. It was a pusher floatplane biplane with the pilot and observer being seated ahead of the wings in a streamlined lightweight nacelle mounted in the gap between the upper and lower sets of wings.

Tests of this Supermarine-built prototype commenced in August 1916 (flown by Lieutenant- Commander John Seddon) but proved seriously underpowered and unsatisfactory. The engine was replaced with an AR.1 rotary engine (which was later redesignated the BR.1 for Bentley Rotary 1) and retested in May 1917. However, even without a military load and observer, the Navyplane's performance still proved to be poor,Mason 1994, p.65. and the design was abandoned on 27 August 1917, with no second prototype being produced. Supermarine attempted to design an improved version to replace the Short 184, the design, the Supermarine Patrol Seaplane, being powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Sunbeam engine.

When it first flew, it was the largest British aircraft yet to take to the air. Development The design of the AD.1 was by Harris Booth of the Admiralty's Air Department just prior to World War I. It was the world's first aircraft designed from scratch as a torpedo bomber, one of the three planned versions of the design. The other two were a bomber and an aircraft armed with a recoilless Davis 12-pounder gun (approximately 76 mm calibre). The aircraft was a float-equipped biplane of pod-and-boom design, with engines mounted at the front of both booms, as well as at the rear of the crew pod. Development began in 1915; it was completed and flown for the first time during the summer of 1916. It was found that the Davis gun would project a blast rearwards so the weapon was changed for a conventional 12-pounder 'Naval Landing Gun' though in practice a gun was never installed in the AD.1.

Biography He was born on 29 January 1774 at Yaxley in Huntingdonshire, the son of Robert, a shoemaker, and Ann, who also had three younger daughters: Harriet Euphrasia, Sophia (who died in 1783) and Marianna. Having been educated by Richard Weston, a Leicester botanist, Olinthus published a treatise, Lessons, Astronomical and Philosophical in 1793. After moving to Cambridge in 1796, Gregory first acted as sub-editor on the Cambridge Intelligencer, and then opened a booksellers shop. In 1802 he obtained an appointment as mathematical master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich through the influence of Charles Hutton, to whose notice he had been brought by a manuscript on the Use of the Sliding Rule; and when Hutton resigned in 1807 Gregory succeeded him in the professorship. Gregory combined his love of mathematics with an interest in music, but not in the melodious sense: music should be subject to rational principles. He proposed ‚Äúthe substitution of proper characters to denote the different kinds of musical time, instead of those vague indefinite ones, which are now in use.‚Äù No more 3/2 time, or Adagio and Allegro; rather, some absolute rate, based on the swing of a precisely-calibrated pendulum. Each composition should be played at its pre-defined speed, no matter who was conducting. In discussing Gregory's ideas, Werrett draws attention to the environment at Woolwich in which he developed them, and the use of the metronome to maintain a consistent rhythm in military music. Gregory favoured the establishment of a secular university in London. By the end of 1825 he was on a ten-man committee interviewing and selecting the teaching staff. His name was inscribed on the foundation stone of the new University, laid in Gower Street on 30 April 1827. Failing health obliged him to retire in 1838, and he died at his home at Queen's Terrace, Woolwich on 2 February 1841. Gregory's library was sold on 17 & 18 March 1842 by Southgate & Son of 22 Fleet Street. The esteem in which Dr Gregory was held can be judged from the following letter in 1841: :To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle. :Sir - I see by your paper of the 11th inst., that Doctor Olinthus Gregory, late Professor Mathematics, &c.; &c.;, :Royal Miltary Academy, Woolwich, has left his widow and family in any thing but affluent circumstances. :Now, I do trust, that out of the number of people who have experienced his exertions, as a Professor at :the Royal Miltary Academy, and also have benefitted by him as highly scientific individual, there may be :found some who will subscribe to the benefit of the widow and family of that excellent man. :I remain, sir, :C.

Cosmonauts Bykovsky and Jahn were greeted by resident crew Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov when they docked at the aft port of the Salyut 6 space station the next day. The visitors brought with them fresh onions, garlic, lemons, apples and other food for the long-duration crew, then in space for more than two months. The presence of the East German cosmonaut was seen as significant because of the presence of the MKF-6M camera on the space station, built by the Carl Zeiss works at Jena. Medical and biological experiments were carried out, including an audio experiment which tested sound and noise perception limits. An experiment called Berolina used the Splav furnace to process an ampoule of bismuth and antimonide with the material between two plates in the ampoule. The tree structure which resulted was four to six times larger than what had been produced on the ground. Another experiment tested using different photographic films on the station's interior. The Soyuz 31 crew swapped craft with the Soyuz 29 crew so as to supply the long-duration crew with a fresh craft. On September 2, the engines of Soyuz 29 were tested, 25 experiment containers with 100 experimental results were transferred, along with exposed film, and seat liners and centering weights were exchanged. The Soyuz 31 crew left in Soyuz 29 the next day and landed 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The standard recovery procedure was changed with this flight, observers noted. In the past, the recovery of a civilian Salyut crew had been made on the orbit following the one which provided a nominal launch opportunity to Salyut. With this and subsequent flights, the landing occurred during the orbit which provided the nominal launch opportunity. The effect of this change was to have a landing window open some two to three days earlier than otherwise. The crew on the station subsequently boarded the Soyuz 31 vehicle and redocked it to the forward port, thus freeing the aft port for a forthcoming Progress supply ship. They returned to Earth 2 November in the craft after setting a new space-endurance record of 139 days.

History In the 1920s, Supermercados Amigo was opened by Jose Marti Fuentes. During the company's formative years, it operated small supermarkets across the island; these would be located at small strip malls. Many towns in Puerto Rico had multiple Supermercados Amigo locations. =The transformation= After the Grand Union and Coop Supermarkets companies ceased operations in Puerto Rico, Amigo began plans to become a major player in Puerto Rico's supermarket industry. In 1989, they opened their first major store, located at Plaza del Carmen Mall, in Caguas. Subsequently, many other major stores were opened across Puerto Rico. A massive television campaign began, and their slogan, Amigo, lo mejor al mejor precio (Amigo, the best at the best prices) became a household phrase in Puerto Rico. =Economic problems= Amigo ran into serious economic problems in the 1990s, most of them having to do with employee salary. As a consequence, the company began losing money. There were several strikes, and these received wide media attention. =Walmart purchase= In July 2002, American retail giant Walmart purchased Supermercados Amigo, in what became a controversial business move. Claims of unfair competition and monopoly were instantly made by smaller supermarkets, because Amigo would be backed by the strong assets of Walmart. As part of the agreement made in order for the purchase to take place, various supermarket locations had to be closed (specifically if there was a Walmart or Sam's Club nearby). The closed Amigos became part of a new (at the time) supermarkets company known as \\"SuperMax\\" and \\"Pitusa Markets\\". The structure of the supermarkets themselves was not changed because of the purchase, the only exception being that now customers may pay for their purchases with their respective Sam's Club or Walmart Credit Cards. In January 2016, Walmart announced it would close four Amigo stores (plus all three Super Ahorros stores) located throughout the island, as part of a larger wave of store closures.

The parish had a recorded population of 782 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 852 at the 2011 census. The village of Sarre is part of the civil parish.St. Nicholas-at-Wade Parish website The village is best known locally for the local custom of Hoodening, a type of mumming, as well as for its prolific potato production. History The name derives from its location on the western border of the Isle of Thanet (originally separated from the Kent mainland). Before the channels of the River Wantsum and River Stour silted up, one would have been able to 'wade' at this point, over a ford. In Roman times the channel was navigable and the site likely very busy with the Saxon Shore forts of Regulbium (Reculver) and Rutupiae (Richborough) both close by. Remains of Roman shipbuilding yards are said to have been found between St. Nicholas-at-Wade and the nearby village of SarreHistorical notes: British History Online Village The village can be entered from either the A299 (Thanet Way) or the A28 (Canterbury Road). These approaches to the village stand out with their colourful planters welcoming visitors. St John's Green at the A28 entry point displays several items including a 1919 restored cultivator in its original makers colours. There are two public houses, 'The Bell' and 'The Sun'. There is also a post office, an antiques shop and a farm marketing office. One of the main potato suppliers in the country used to have its headquarters near St Nicholas Court in the northwest of the village, but the site closed in late 2015. Hedgend Industrial Estate is on the northern outskirts. There is the local St Nicholas CE Primary School.St Nicholas-at-Wade Primary School The village hall (dating from 1930) houses weekly events including various dance classes, keep fit, Art groups and senior citizens coffee mornings and is also used as a polling station. There is a static caravan park at Frost Farm and a camping site at Streete Farm. A sports field in Bell Meadow plays host to football and cricket matches, the cricket pavilion was constructed in the 1980s with the aid of Thanet District Council. Churches The 13th-century parish church of St Nicholas, after which the village and parish are named, was a chapel of ease for St Mary's Church at Reculver. The first rector is recorded as Adam de Brancestre in 1294. Built in flint, the church houses some fine 16th-century brasses, a carved oak pulpit dated 1615, and a coat of arms of King George III.Drawing of the church exterior The parish has twice been enlarged, firstly in medieval times, when it was separated from the parish of Reculver and joined with the little-known chapelry of All Saints, Shuart in 1310, and again in the mid-16th century, when it was joined with the parish of St Giles, Sarre.. The church is currently part of the Wantsum Benefice. St Nicholas Court has a fine example of a medieval underground chapel; however, little is known about the origins or past use of this building. The chapel is on private land but has been opened to visitors on some important local occasions.St Nicholas Court Farm Chapel References External links * St Nicholas-at-Wade with Sarre Parish Council Category:Villages in Kent Category:Civil parishes in Kent ","title":"St Nicholas-at-Wade"},{"id":"849158","text":"The Tamiami Trail () is the southernmost of U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) from Florida State Road 60 (SR 60) in Tampa to US 1 in Miami. A portion of the road also has the hidden designation of State Road 90 (SR 90). The north‚Äìsouth section (hidden SR 45) extends to Naples, whereupon it becomes an east‚Äìwest road (hidden SR 90) crossing the Everglades (and forming part of the northern border of Everglades National Park). It becomes Southwest 8th Street in Miami- Dade County, famous as Calle Ocho in the Little Havana section of Miami, before ending east of Miami Avenue as Southeast 8th Street at Brickell Avenue in Brickell, Downtown Miami. History Alligators are a common sight along the scenic Tamiami Trail from Miami to Naples. Unlike its sister Alligator Alley, the trail is only one lane in each direction and has no fences to keep wildlife from traversing it. Tamiami Trail seen toward east in the Big Cypress National Preserve, a few miles north of the Everglades National Park =Construction and early designations= The idea for a Trans-Peninsula Highway that connected the west and east coasts of Florida originated in April 1915 at an informal meeting in Tallahassee between then president of the Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce, Francis W. Perry, and James F. Jaudon of Miami after which they returned to their respective cities and began advocating for the construction of what was originally called the Miami to Marco Highway. At a subsequent meeting in Orlando, on June 10, 1915, of what became the Central Florida Highway Association, Perry introduced a resolution which was seconded by Tampa's E. P. Dickie, for the construction of the \\"Tamiam Trail\\", which was to run from Tampa through Riverview, Bradenton, Sarasota, Arcadia, Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs, Estero, Naples, Marco, then east directly across the state to Miami. Perry traced the route of the proposed Tamiami Trail on a map and accorded the credit for coining the word \\"Tamiam\\" to Dickie, although D. C. Gillett, who was president of the Tampa Board of Trade later claimed to have originally suggested the name. On August 3, 1915, the Board of Commissioners of Dade County agreed to fund part of the survey for the road by providing their county engineer. Two days later a team surveyed the first , and the work on the Tamiami Trail had officially begun. The team consisted of Hobart Crabtree (county engineer), James F. Jaudon, L. T. Highleyman, Van Cleve Hallowes, Wallace Culbertson, Walter Ludlam, J. T. Albritton, A. W. Frederick and one helper. At the time, Lee County was a much larger county (Collier and Hendry counties were created out of Lee County in 1923). In 1919, for financial reasons, Lee County was unable to complete its portion of the Tamiami Trail. Jaudon had already purchased of land, mostly in Monroe County. His company, the Chevelier Corporation, came to the rescue and offered to build a link of the highway through its holdings in Monroe County if Dade and Lee counties would agree to re-route the Tamiami Trail through Monroe County. The proposal was accepted; the Chevelier Corporation began laying out a new route for the road and in 1921 began construction on the new segment of the Tamiami Trail. This segment is today known as Loop Road (located in Big Cypress National Preserve). In 1922, the State of Florida ran out of construction funds for the east‚Äìwest portion. The following year, Barron Collier, an advertising mogul who had recently diversified his holdings by investing in various types of businesses and millions of acres of southwest Florida wilderness, pledged that he would bankroll the completion of the Tamiami Trail; in return, the State legislature would establish a new county and name it after him. So in 1923, Collier County was created out of the southern portion of Lee County. Almost immediately contention arose over the change of the route. The sponsors of the new county advocated for the original route, which was completely inside the boundaries of Collier County, and the State Road Department agreed with Collier County. Even so, the Board of County Commissioners of Dade County supported the Chevelier segment, since so much money had already been invested, and only a few miles of road were left to be completed. Despite this protest, the State Road Department reinstated the original route of the Tamiami Trail to be completed, and the already completed portion of roadway in Monroe County was accepted as a \\"South Loop\\" of the Tamiami Trail. As construction of the north‚Äìsouth section resumed, Collier hired A. R. Richardson to be the head engineer of the Naples-to-Miami section. A few months later, A. W. Frederick replaced Richardson, who returned to the Everglades Drainage District. Construction started on the east‚Äìwest stretch in 1923. An east‚Äìwest canal was created using explosives; the fill dirt was used to construct the roadway. In 1926, both the north‚Äìsouth section and the east‚Äìwest stretch were designated U.S. highways. Although the Trail was intended to be one road, the two sections received two different numbers: as each section was completed, the north‚Äìsouth portion received US 41 signs, and the east‚Äìwest stretch was designated US 94 upon completion (to comply with the route-numbering guidelines of AASHTO). In addition, both sections south of Fort Myers received the State Road 27 designation. North of Fort Myers, it was designated State Road 5. While a 1927 Rand McNally map indicated the southern terminus Fort Myers, US 41 signs had already been erected on the completed segment (south to Naples) in late 1926; US 94 signs made their appearances when the final section was completed in April 1928. The Tamiami Trail took 13 years, cost $8 million USD, and used 2.6 million sticks of dynamite in its construction. The Tamiami Trail officially opened on April 26, 1928. =US 94= U.S. Highway 94 sign, Upon the completion of the Tamiami Trail, U.S. Highway 94 (US 94) extended from the intersection of Ninth Street South and Fifth Avenue South in Naples (the southern terminus of US 41) to the intersection of South Eighth Street and Brickell Avenue (US 1) in Miami. At the time it was considered a major achievement of engineering that was the only route from Naples (and, by extension, from Tampa) to the southeastern coast of Florida. In 1945, a restructuring of Florida's State Road system resulted in the removal of the SR 27 signs from US 94 and the assignment of the hidden Florida Department of Transportation designation State Road 90, which continues to be applied to the east‚Äìwest stretch of highway to this day. The north-south section was assigned the designation State Road 45. In 1949, the US 94 signage was replaced with US 41 signs, over a decade after AASHO modified its guidelines to discourage short (under ) U.S. Highways that are entirely within one state. =After US 94= Roadside attractions, sometimes called tourist traps, were a part of the folk character of Tamiami before the interstates. Today, some of these attractions remain, including this greeter/creature at the Skunk-Ape Research Headquarters in Ochopee. A US 41 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 In the 1950s, the newly configured US 41 was extended eastward and northward, first to downtown Miami along US 1 in 1950, then to Miami Beach along US 1 and SR A1A in 1953. In 1965, US 41 was rerouted as a bypass along unsigned SR 45A around Venice Gardens, while Business US 41 signs grace the former alignment (which is still named Tamiami Trail). This configuration of US 41 south of Tampa remained intact until the U.S. Highway was truncated to US 1 and Southwest Eighth Street in Miami in 2001‚Äîthe historic eastern terminus of US 94, former SR 27, and current SR 90 (westbound US 41 and SR 90 now begin one block to the north, on Southwest Seventh Street, as the easternmost of the U.S. Highway now lie along a one-way pair). While US 41 and SR 90 have not significantly changed since the 1960s (aside from the widening to the east of SR 997 in Miami-Dade County in the 1970s and in 2002-2005), its importance to motorists of southeastern Florida has changed since the opening of Alligator Alley to the north in 1968. Since then, traffic on the Tamiami Trail across the Everglades has lessened significantly, while urban sections of the road are now often congested. In 1968, the Dade County Port Authority began construction on what was to become the world's largest airport. The Miami Jetport was located west of Miami, just across the Collier County line. It was to be a six runway supersonic airport. The project would also transform the Tamiami Trail into a multi-lane expressway. Conservationists were worried about the impact an airport that size would have on the environment of the Everglades and Big Cypress. After several court hearings, a ban was placed upon further development. The widening of Tamiami Trail as a part of the Jetport had been stopped. One runway had already been completed; so the runway was allowed to be used as a flight training center. The runway remains today as a part of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Tamiami Trail (US 41) northbound past SR 72 in Gulf Gate Estates Also in 1968, construction of an extension of Interstate 75 (I-75) south from Tampa to Miami was started, with an eye toward routing the freeway along an upgraded Tamiami Trail from Naples to a soon-to-be completed SR 836 whereupon it would continue on the east‚Äìwest highway to its intended terminus at an interchange with I-95. Plans for the I-75 extension changed for two reasons: Alligator Alley needed upgrading, as the then-narrow toll road was dangerous to both motorists and wildlife (most notably the Florida panther) alike, and SR 836, with its left exits and narrow lanes, was not being built to Interstate Highway standards. As a result, construction for a rerouted I-75 in southern Florida began in 1974, now with I-75 using Alligator Alley instead of US 41 to cross the peninsula. The configured Interstate would not be completed for another 19 years. Since then, the Tamiami Trail has been designated a National Scenic Byway by the United States Department of Transportation for its unique scenery in the Everglades and the Big Cypress National Preserve. Future =Plans= In 1928, the Tamiami Trail was considered a feat of engineering, although there appears to have been minimal consideration of the potential damage to the Everglades by the roadway and the Tamiami Canal. Both have acted as a dam to block water flow from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay at the southern tip of the peninsula. As a result, the Everglades‚Äîthe \\"River of Grass\\"‚Äîhas had its water flow greatly diminished over the years, resulting in a devastating effect on the ecology of the region. In the 1990s, a few canals were filled and additional culverts were constructed under US 41 to help regulate water flow. Yet, according to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, this was only a partial solution to the problems of the Everglades and the Tamiami Trail. In 2003, after considering a variety of plans involving the rebuilding of US 41/SR 90, the Corps recommended that a causeway be built near the Northeast Shark Slough northeast of Everglades National Park, all road fill removed that would otherwise be adjacent to the bridge, the 57 culverts that are already in place maintained, and the appropriate water flow rate maintained under the non- causeway portions of the Tamiami Trail crossing the Everglades. The proposed causeway is being called the Everglades Skyway by the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, World Wildlife Fund, and other organizations in an Internet-based effort to lobby Florida and United States government officials for project construction money. In December 2009, construction began on a project to lift a portion of the road to allow the more natural water flow into the southern Everglades. At the Everglades Foundation's America's Everglades Summit held in mid-May 2010, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, Thomas Strickland, revealed that the Interior Department's National Park Service released a draft Environmental Impact Statement recommending an additional of bridging the Tamiami Trail. The Everglades Foundation is a group that supports the Tamiami Trail bridging and dedicated to Everglades restoration. In 2013, Florida announced a $90 million commitment to elevate of the road to allow natural drainage into the Everglades and Everglades National Park. In June 2019, a $60 million grant was announced by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to Everglades National Park through the Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects program to complete the Tamiami Trail Next Steps project, intended to allow more north-to-south water flow into the Everglades. This grant matches a $43.5 million commitment by the State of Florida for the raising and reconstruction of the remaining 6.5 miles of the eastern Tamiami Trail roadway. As of September 2020, the plan to complete and finish the Tamiani Trail has been approved for the final steps of the project. Through the Trump Administration, The Florida Department of Transportation, and Everglades National Park, they have been able to finalize these plans. This will help improve water flow within the wetlands and to restore many parts of the Tamiani Trail and the Everglades National Park as a whole. These plans to begin the final steps will start November 2020 and should be finished by the end of 2024.

SAFEGE type monorail The preserved car and track of the Higashiyama Zoo Monorail in 2008 The preserved car and track of the Higashiyama Zoo Monorail in 2017 The Shonan Monorail in Japan SAFEGE gained international recognition for its design of a suspended monorail in the 1960s. The design team was headed by Lucien Chadenson. =Design concept= The design of the system entails suspending passenger cars beneath rubber-tired wheel carriages of the type used more conventionally in the Paris Metro. The carriages are enclosed and supported by a box-like track or beam, with an opening in the bottom. The rubber wheels of the train run inside the track, supported by flanges on the bottom of the beam. Unlike previous suspended monorails like the Schwebebahn in Wuppertal, Germany, the tracks are not exposed to inclement weather, and do not need any cleaning or ice-removal systems. This advantage enables them to run in cities where ice and other conditions would impair the reliability of the system. =Test installation= The test track built in France by SAFEGE in 1959, was a 1.4 kilometre monorail line that featured prominently in the 1966 movie adaptation of Fahrenheit 451, directed by Fran√ßois Truffaut. Although the track was dismantled not long thereafter, the original car survived longer. =Market position= SAFEGE systems are the leading type of suspended railway currently in transit use, though this consists of just four installations of two different systems. Its chief and more numerous competitor in modern monorail applications are variations of the German-designed ALWEG system, in which the vehicles run on top of, and straddle, a solid beam. =SAFEGE-type monorails in the world= Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan has developed a working system of SAFEGE- type suspended railways, and have made three such installations, two of which remain in operation today. *From early 1964 to December 1974, a single-line ran between Higashiyama Zoo and the nearby Botanical Gardens in Nagoya, Japan. While initially popular, it also suffered from mechanical problems and after the first two years of operation, the novelty wore off and it began making a loss. Plans to expand the zoo and gardens hastened its demise, although the car and a section of track is preserved at one of the stations. While it was initially marketed as a ride, rather than a means of transport, a fare was charged, making it the first revenue-earning SAFEGE/Mitsubishi-type monorail. *In 1970 the Shonan Monorail opened. It runs from ≈åfuna Station in Kamakura to Sh≈çnan-Enoshima Station in Fujisawa. *In 1988, the first stage of the Chiba Urban Monorail system opened, in Chiba. With a route length, it is currently the longest suspended monorail in the world. Siemens *Two Siemens SIPEM lines exist in Germany, one on the Dortmund University campus, the other at the D√ºsseldorf airport. Siemens no longer actively markets this system, but does still deliver the software for the automatic operation of a SIPEM network and vehicles. Unfulfilled proposals In 1966, a proposal was considered to construct a SAFEGE-type monorail in the City of Manchester. The line was planned to link Manchester Airport with the city and suburbs, with a tunnel under the city centre, but the scheme, along with the later Picc-Vic tunnel (which would be a conventional rapid transit line) was abandoned due to cost. The city eventually developed its own light rail network, Manchester Metrolink, of which one of its lines, opened in 2014, now links Manchester Airport to the city centre. In November 1967, General Electric proposed to construct a SAFEGE monorail from downtown San Francisco to San Francisco International Airport. The City of San Francisco studied the proposal, along with an extension of the Southern Pacific Railroad's Peninsula Commute commuter rail line and an extension of the BART rapid transit system. The proposal's incompatibility with other rail transit lines, the urban design concerns of an elevated guideway, and potential competitive impact on parallel rapid transit lines, led to its dismissal in favor of a BART extension. Ultimately, SFO was connected to downtown San Francisco via BART.  References   External links  * Monorail society: Technical Page - Safege.

The SIOP gave the President of the United States a range of targeting options, and described launch procedures and target sets against which nuclear weapons would be launched.Freedman 2003, p. 395 The plan integrated the capabilities of the nuclear triad of strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and sea-based submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). The SIOP was a highly classified document, and was one of the most secret and sensitive issues in U.S. national security policy.Burr 2004 Montage of submerged submarine launch to the reentry of the multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles of a Trident missile The first SIOP, titled SIOP-62, was finished on 14 December 1960 and implemented on 1 July 1961 (the start of fiscal year 1962).Kaplan 1991, p. 296 The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044.Kristensen 2004 Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment. Planning process While much of the United States' nuclear war planning process remains classified, some information on the former SIOP planning process has been made public. The planning process began with the President issuing a presidential directive establishing the concepts, goal, and guidelines that provided guidance to the nuclear planners.McKinzie 2001, p. 9 The Secretary of Defense then used the President's guidance to produce the Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy (NUWEP) that specified basic planning assumptions, attack options, targeting objectives, types of targets, targeting constraints, and coordination with combatant commanders. The NUWEP was then used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to create the \\"Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), Annex C (Nuclear).\\" This document established a more detailed and elaborate set of goals and conditions that included targeting and damage criteria for the use of nuclear weapons. The final stage in the planning process occurred when the Strategic Air Command (SAC) (from 1961 to 1992) or the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) (from 1992 to 2003) took the guidance from the JSCP and created the actual nuclear war plan that becomes the SIOP. Detailed planning was carried out by the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS) co-located with SAC Headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. As part of SIOP planning, Strategic Air Command (SAC, later USSTRATCOM) developed a set of plans and a series of options based on a target set known as the National Target Base (NTB). The number of targets in the NTB varied over time, from 16,000 in 1985 to 12,500 at the end of the Cold War in 1991, to 2,500 by 2001.McKinzie 2001, p. 10 The SIOP was primarily directed against targets in the Soviet Union (later Russia) but targets in the People's Republic of China, which had been part of the SIOP until the 1970s, were added back into the plan in 1997.Blaire 2000 In 1999, the NTB reportedly included targets in Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya.McKinzie 2001, p. 12 History SIOP, and its renamed successors, is most importantly an \\"integrated\\" plan that uses both Air Force and Navy delivery systems; it is \\"single\\" only in the sense that it comes out of one planning group. The \\"plan\\" actually contains multiple \\"attack options\\" that are themselves complex plans. =Early targeting after the Second World War= Truman There is no evidence that the Soviet Union's contingency plans from the end of World War II to 1950 were anything but routine and defensive, and the substantial postwar demobilization of the Soviet military supports the view that the USSR did not view a new war in Europe as likely. Although Soviet doctrine incorporated an assumption of innate hostility of the capitalist powers to Communism, Soviet leader Josef Stalin apparently believed that neither the USSR nor the West could afford to fight another world war, and was skeptical of the Western ability to raise an army large enough to occupy Soviet territory. Soviet planning thus emphasized defenses against nuclear bombing, and attacks on Western European bomber bases. Plans in 1946 and 1948 assumed that during war with an unspecified enemy, Soviet forces in Germany would assume defensive positions within the Soviet occupation zone and wait for reinforcements before counterattacking. Soviet conventional forces greatly outnumbered the West's, however, and United States strategic nuclear strike plans were developed accordingly. While the United States was the only nation with the atomic bomb, in 1946 it had only 17 Silverplate B-29 bombers and 11 atomic bombs. Many early American war plans were based on using hundreds of nonexisting weapons; for example, an autumn 1945 plan envisioned using 196 atomic bombs on Soviet industrial targets, but SAC could not deliver such quantities until 1952. The bombs were of the Mark 3 type, weighing five tons and requiring 39 men two days to assemble. The press reported that \\"atomic- capable\\" B-29s were deployed to Britain in mid-1948 during the Berlin Blockade, by which time the US possessed about 50 atomic weapons. The Soviets likely knew through espionage, however, that none of the aircraft was a Silverplate; rather, they would have been used as part of plan DOUBLEQUICK, involving World War II-like sustained conventional bombing raids on Soviet air bases in Eastern Europe. Other than increasing its anti-aircraft defenses, the Soviets did not change its military preparations in any way during the blockade, unlike the reaction in the West. Although the Soviets launched an intensive public relations effort in 1949, aided by sympathetic Western European fellow travelers, to oppose the formation of NATO, the new alliance's military strength was so weak that the Politburo did not bother to discuss it for six months after its formation. Strategic bombing during World War II of key transportation and energy sites was more effective than attacking cities, and early postwar non-nuclear war plans envisioned focusing on the Soviet petroleum industry. US war planners lacked updated maps of the USSR, however, and had to use pre-World War II maps‚Äîsome older than the Russian Revolution‚Äîor perhaps German aerial photos from the war. Due in part to the lack of updated intelligence, nuclear planning increasingly focused on urban areas, which were easier to target and offered the potential for \\"bonus damage\\". The early Plan Totality targeted 20 cities with the 30 nuclear bombs then available.Kaplan 1991, p. 41 Plan BROILER (November 1947) envisioned 34 bombs on 24 Soviet cities. It and later plans such as HALFMOON (May 1948; 50 bombs on 20 cities) and OFFTACKLE (December 1949; 104 urban targets, 220 bombs, 72 more reserved for follow-up attacks) envisioned Western forces in Europe slowly retreating while the United Kingdom was reinforced as an air base for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union. President Harry S. Truman hoped for an international ban on atomic weapons and believed that the American people would not support their use for \\"aggressive purposes\\", and ordered JCS to devise a plan for conventional war; however, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in July 1948 ordered it to stop and resume atomic war planning due to the Berlin crisis. Officials were pessimistic about the effectiveness of the atomic plans, however. Britain's December 1948 SPEEDWAY plan assumed that the Soviets would not have atomic weapons, but nonetheless forecast that the West could not \\"withstand a Russian advance in Western Europe, even with the full defence co- operation of the Western Powers\\", including 560 American and British atomic- capable bombers. The American TROJAN (December 1948) envisioned 133 bombs (although only 50 existed) hitting 70 cities. A committee led by General Hubert R. Harmon reported in May 1949 that even if all precisely hit their targets, the USSR would not surrender, its leadership would not be seriously weakened, and its military could still operate in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The attacks would reduce Soviet industrial capacity by 30 to 40%, but only temporarily without follow-up attacks. The Harmon report had three immediate results: 1) It supported those within the United States Navy and elsewhere who criticized the centrality of atomic bombs and mass attacks on cities in American war planning. 2) It led to a substantial rise in nuclear-weapons production. 3) It caused the Joint Chiefs of Staff to, in fall 1949, assign SAC with the duty of slowing a Soviet invasion of Western Europe as part of NATO. Erroneous US and British intelligence reports led to exaggerated NATO estimates of Soviet conventional forces. One 1951 estimate foresaw 175 combat divisions allegedly prepared to simultaneously attack Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the Balkans, the Middle East, and North America. The perceived imbalance in forces was so great that American planners feared that even Britain would have to be abandoned during the invasion, a possibility they did not discuss with their British counterparts. Stalin did consider the possibility of war in Asia, as opposed to Europe. In January 1950, he approved Kim Il Sung's proposal to conquer South Korea in what became the Korean War that summer, believing that victory there would discredit NATO. The gambit backfired, however; despite their initial optimism the Communists were unable to defeat the US-led forces in Korea, and the war greatly increased Western military spending, for the first time making NATO a significant threat against the Soviets in Europe. By late 1950, the USSR notified its Eastern European satellites to prepare for war by the end of 1952, a date matching Western estimates. In early 1951, based on an alleged NATO plan to launch a European war that year from Western proxy Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period as a response to its defeat in Korea, he ordered a massive increase in Eastern European forces that hurt the weaker Communist economies. Based on the Korean precedent, the Soviets apparently expected that the West would not use atomic weapons in a European war. During Stalin's lifetime, Soviet doctrine foresaw the next war as a more destructive version of World War II similarly decided by giant armies supported by massive home fronts, a type of conflict which benefited from the Soviet Union's innate strengths. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in 1949, but Stalin seems to have viewed possessing it as a political rather than military benefit, and he did not integrate atomic weapons into the Soviet military's equipment. A 1951 Warsaw Pact war plan for Poland was, Vojtech Mastny wrote, \\"unequivocally defensive\\" even while \\"NATO was haunted by the nightmare of armed communist hordes sweeping all but unopposed through Europe\\". The Soviets assumed that Western forces were ready to invade and that Eastern Europeans would see them as liberators; as in the West, the Soviets overestimated their enemies' strength. By this time, Truman was pessimistic about international arms control and told his advisors \\"Since we can't obtain international control we must be strongest in atomic weapons.\\" He approved the Harmon report's recommendation for increased weapons production, and approved another increase soon after the start of the Korean War. JCS decided to emphasize \\"the destruction of known targets affecting the Soviet capability to deliver atomic bombs\\", with refineries, chemical and power plants, and shipyards as secondary and tertiary targets. The three categories were codenamed BRAVO (blunting), ROMEO (retardation), and DELTA (disruption/destruction) of the Soviet ability to fight, and formed the basis of American nuclear targeting for almost a decade. When military theorist Bernard Brodie studied the resulting target list, however, he strongly criticized the planners' ignorance of actual Soviet military capacity and resulting failure to estimate what effect the attacks would have. Brodie later recalled that \\"There was no calculated strategy for destroying Soviet capability to make war. The planners \\"simply expected the Soviet Union 'to collapse' as a result of the bombing campaign.... People kept talking about the 'Sunday punch'.\\" He recommended that targets be chosen based on analysis of the results of their destruction, and that \\"city-avoidance\\" strategies be studied. Brodie presented his report in April 1951, but JCS found SAC head LeMay more persuasive. LeMay objected to the list because of the difficulty of attacking isolated targets and the requirement for pre- attack reconnaissance for many of them. He preferred attacking industrial targets in urban areas so that even if a bomb missed, \\"a bonus will be derived from the use of the bomb\\". The target panel agreed to have SAC review future target lists before sending them to JCS. Eisenhower By the end of 1953, SAC would have 1,000 nuclear-capable bombers and was deploying the B-47 jet bomber. In January 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower inherited the Truman administration's large defense budget. The new president believed such expenditures threatened the economy, and cut $5 billion in defense spending that spring. Based on extensive experience with nuclear strategy and targeting from his terms as Chief of Staff of the United States Army and NATO Supreme Allied Commander, the Eisenhower administration's NSC 162/2 of October 1953 chose a less expensive, defensive-oriented direction for the military that emphasized \\"massive retaliation\\", still primarily delivered by USAF, to deter war. The document formalized efforts begun under Truman to deploy newly developed tactical nuclear weapons small enough for most Air Force and Navy planes. The administration believed that they would be useful both during a general war and to deter a local one in Europe, and Eisenhower said of tactical weapons that \\"on strictly military targets and for strictly military purposes, I see no reason why they shouldn't be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else\\". The doctrine of massive retaliation meant that, for the first time, atomic weapons became the basis of NATO strategy rather than an option of last resort. Similarly, the Soviet doctrine of non- atomic warfare began to change after Stalin's death in March 1953. In September that year a general proposed in a military journal that new weaponry might end a war quickly unlike World War II, and in October the Soviet Army held its first military exercise based on the enemy using atomic weapons. In 1954 Soviet forces in Europe received their first tactical atomic weapons, by which time Soviet officers publicly debated in the journal the merits of preemptive war. =Prevention versus preemption= Many in the West also seriously discussed the idea of preventive and preemptive war. Truman rejected preventive war, stating that \\"[s]tarting an atomic war is totally unthinkable for rational men\\", but Attlee stated in 1945 that \\"twice is he armed who gets in the first blow\\". JCS proposed in 1947 that the president be authorized to use atomic bombs to prevent a nuclear attack. NSC 68 of April 1950 opposed \\"a military attack not provoked by a military attack on us or on our allies\\", but acknowledged \\"if possible\\" the benefits of preemptively \\"landing the first blow\\" before the Soviet Union did so. In August 1950 Secretary of the Navy Francis Matthews publicly advocated a preventive war, but NSC 68 forecast that even after a massive preventive attack the USSR would likely not surrender and its forces could still \\"dominate most or all of Eurasia.\\" A committee led by retired general Jimmy Doolittle suggested in spring 1953 that the administration study the possibility of giving the Soviets two years to cooperate, with the threat of possible war otherwise, and an Air Force study in August warned of \\"The Coming National Crisis\\" due to having to negotiate with a country run by \\"the whims of a small group of proven barbarians\\". Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles discussed that month their fears that, once the Soviets acquired fusion weapons, the resulting situation might force the United States into either war or dictatorship. While the president and other civilian and military leaders doubted the morality or legality of preventive war, preemptive war was much less problematic given that NSC 5410/1 March 1954 acknowledged that \\"the survival of the United States\\" was at risk. The Central Intelligence Agency believed that it could warn of a surprise Soviet attack days or even weeks ahead of time because of the necessary preparation time, and that up to 30 days would be needed to deliver all Soviet weapons. The BRAVO-ROMEO-DELTA targeting strategy continued, with tactical weapons to be used in Europe while SAC delivered strategic weapons to the USSR. SAC obtained almost independent target selection by 1955. The Air Force often used target lists to justify greater weapons production, then greater spending on delivery systems for the additional weapons. Although other services opposed such \\"bootstrapping\\", they did not have the IBM 704 computer that SAC used to analyze target priorities so could not offer competing selection lists. Its Basic War Plan of March 1954 planned for up to 735 bombers to simultaneously and massively attack all targets, military and urban, in the USSR. Eisenhower preferred to avoid civilian targets, and by 1954 several Air Force planners advocated a \\"no- cities\\" strategy. Other planners and USAF leadership, however, believed that the Soviet Union could support its \\"immense armed forces for at least two years of intensive warfare\\" if industrial and government centers were not attacked. The possibility existed, they believed, that SAC could in fact deliver a \\"decisive\\" attack on the USSR, a tempting idea given the power of the 15-megaton hydrogen bombs being tested. LeMay stated in a 1988 interview that Two studies soon concluded, however, that if such a window existed it had either closed or would soon. Weapons Systems Evaluation Group stated in February 1955 that destroying all known Soviet bases would require twice as large a force as the United States expected to field. A National Security Council study found that by mid-1958 the only defense against a devastating Soviet attack would be to attack first after being warned, which Eisenhower believed was impossible. Given the apparent impracticality of massive retaliation strategy, Army Chiefs of Staff Matthew Ridgway and his successor Maxwell Taylor argued within JCS that deterrence, instead of the \\"worst case\\" scenario of a full-scale nuclear war, should be the focus. More conventional forces were needed to prevent limited wars from leading to larger nuclear ones; similarly, tactical nuclear weapons should be avoided in local wars to prevent escalation. Eisenhower, however, believed that tactical weapons should be viewed similarly to very large conventional \\"blockbusters\\", and did not want American forces stalled within small wars. Massive retaliation remained the basis of American war planning; the Killian Committee reported in 1955 that \\"We have an offensive advantage but are vulnerable to surprise attack\\" (emphasis in original), and NATO estimated after the Hungarian revolution of 1956 that during wartime Western forces would retreat to the Rhine River within 48 hours. By the 1950s, around 5,500 targets were listed to receive SAC bomber strikes; these targets consisted primarily of industrial sites but included counterforce targets. These plans, primarily by the Air Force, tended to be based on selecting targets in order to use up the available weapons, rather than considering the desired effects or strategic outcomes.Moore 1957 From a 1957 letter from John H. Moore, former director of nuclear planning, air operations branch, United States European Command, Air Force target planning methodology can be inferred \\"blast damage frame,\\" with such references as \\"damage to concrete structures\\" and the requirement for a \\"high probability of cratering runways.\\" He cited the \\"destructive and disruptive nature of nuclear weapons\\" with megaton yields: \\"the cumulative or ancillary effects may be as great or greater than primary damage.\\" Specifically, he considered delayed radiation but not thermal effects, but called attention to the idea of \\"bonus\\" effects,Kahn 1968 in which the totality of weapons effects would allow lower-yield weapons to achieve the \\"desired destruction.\\" In the letter to the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, Moore noted that the Pentagon \\"rigorously suppressed\\" this study and destroyed all copies. Prior to the development of SIOP and survivable command and control, Eisenhower predelegated nuclear release authority to certain senior commanders.Burr 2001 In April 1956, for example, he authorized Air Defense Command to use Genie air-to-air and Nike Hercules surface-to-air missiles during a surprise attack. There have continued to be Continuity of Nuclear Operations Plans (COOP), which designated enough subordinates who, in the event of the National Command Authority and immediate successors being killed in a \\"decapitation\\" attack, could still retaliate. While the details have never been made public, Eisenhower's predelegation, and a Federation of American Scientists summary, give a framework. =Presidential involvement and start of civilian policy direction= In 1958, George Kistiakowsky, a key Manhattan Project scientist and Science Advisor in the Eisenhower Administration, suggested to the President that inspection of foreign military facilities was not sufficient to control their nuclear weapons. Kistiakowsky was particularly concerned with the difficulty of verifying the number, type, and deployment of nuclear-armed missiles on missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections.Keefer 1996, p. 192 He was also concerned with the short warning times available from intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches, which took away the lengthy decision time available when the nuclear threat came exclusively from manned bombers. Atlas, a first-generation ICBM Eisenhower sent Kistiakowsky to Strategic Air Command headquarters where he was, at first, rebuffed. At the same time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, USAF, sent a memorandum in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which suggested that the Strategic Air Command be formally assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. That had led to individual targets being multiply targeted by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting, as, for example, by the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a target deeper inland. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy. Eisenhower said he would not \\"leave his successor with the monstrosity\\" of the uncoordinated and non-integrated forces that then existed. When Kistiakowsky was not given access, Eisenhower sent him back with a much stronger set of orders giving SAC officers the choice to cooperate with Kistiakowsky, or resign. Kistiakowsky's report, presented on 29 November, described uncoordinated plans with huge numbers of targets, many of which would be attacked by multiple forces, resulting in overkill. Eisenhower was shocked by the plans, and focused not just on the creation of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), but on the entire process of picking targets, generating requirements, and planning for nuclear war operations. Separate operational plans from the Air Force and the Navy were combined to form the foundation of the SIOP. =The first SIOP= The first plan, following the White House policy guidance, was developed in 1960, consisting of a list of targets (the National Strategic Target List, or NSTL) and the assets to be used against each target. The targets themselves were pulled from the Bombing Encyclopedia, which listed over 80,000 targets of interest. This first SIOP was extensively revised by a team at the RAND Corporation to become SIOP-62, describing a massive strike with the entire US arsenal of 3,200 warheads, totaling 7,847 megatons, against the USSR, China, and Soviet-aligned states with urban and other targets being hit simultaneously. Nine weapons were to be \\"laid down\\" on four targets in Leningrad, 23 weapons on six target complexes in Moscow, 18 on seven target areas in Kaliningrad, etc. Weapon scientist, George Rathjens, looked through SAC's atlas of Soviet cities, searching for the town that most closely resembled Hiroshima in size and industrial concentration. When he found one that roughly matched, he asked how many bombs the SIOP \\"laid down\\" on that city. The reply: one 4.5 megaton bomb and three more 1.1 megaton weapons in case the big bomb was a dud (the Hiroshima bomb was 12.5 kilotons).Fred Kaplan, The Wizards of Armageddon, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), p 268-269. The execution of SIOP-62 was estimated to result in 285 million dead and 40 million casualties in the Soviet Union and China.David Rosenberg, \\"Constraining Overkill: Contending Approaches to Nuclear Strategy, 1955‚Äì1965,\\" (13 May 2014, Colloquium on Contemporary History Project, Naval History and Heritage Command, https://www.history.navy.mil/research/publications/colloquium-on-contemporary- history/more-bang-for-the-buck-/constraining-overkill.html) Presented with all the facts and figures, Thomas D. White of the Air Force found the Plan \\"splendid.\\"The Wizards of Armageddon, p 269. Disregarding the human aspect, SIOP-62 represented an outstanding technological achievement: The first SIOP, based on the massive retaliation doctrine, had little flexibility, treating all Communist countries as a uniform bloc. Document JCS 2056/220 expressed the concerns of U.S. Marine Commandant David Shoup that the 1961 draft was inconsistent with a 1959 NSC policy guidance paper approved by Eisenhower. Shoup was especially concerned with language in the draft SIOP that said The National Security Archive commentary reports that Shoup asked USAF/SAC Commander Thomas Power \\"...what would happen if Beijing was not fighting; was there an option to leave Chinese targets out of the attack plan?\\" Power was reported to have said that he hoped no one would think of that \\"because it would really screw up the plan\\"‚Äîthat is, the plan was supposed to be executed as a whole. Apparently, Shoup then observed that \\"any plan that kills millions of Chinese when it isn't even their war is not a good plan. This is not the American way.\\" SIOP-62 included the virtual obliteration of the tiny country of Albania because within its borders sat huge Soviet air-defense radar, which had to be taken out with high assurance. Power smiled at Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and said with a mock straight face: \\"Well, Mr. Secretary, I hope you don't have any friends or relations in Albania, because we are just going to have to wipe it out.\\"Cited in Fred Kaplan, The Wizards of Armageddon, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), p 271-272. McNamara was left with \\"macabre, shallow, and horrifying\\" impression.The Wizards of Armageddon, p 262. SIOP-63 During 1961‚Äì1962, the Kennedy administration revised this plan as supervised by McNamara. He aimed to change the doctrine from massive retaliation to flexible response. SIOP-63 took effect in July 1962 and remained mostly unchanged for more than ten years. Instead of one \\"spasm\\" attack, it proposed five escalating attack options: # Soviet nuclear missile sites, bomber airfields, and submarine tenders. # Other military sites away from cities, such as air defenses. # Military sites near cities. # Command- and-control centers. # Full-scale \\"spasm\\" attack. Many smaller target options were also created for possible use. The plan contemplated the possibility that options 1 and 2 be used to prevent an \\"impending major Sino-Soviet Bloc attack upon the U.S. or its allies\\". By 1963, however, McNamara concluded that such plans were useless, because the situations for which nuclear weapons might be used were so unpredictable that advanced planning was impossible. The five attack options did not address each target category (much less any subsets) separately. Rather, the options were cumulative, each adding a target category to the previous one. All required the expenditure of thousands of nuclear weapons and were subsequently criticized as \\"five options for massive retaliation.\\"Cited in David Alan Rosenberg, \\"Constraining Overkill: Contending Approaches to Nuclear Strategy, 1955‚Äì1965,\\" Colloquium on Contemporary History Project, Naval History and Heritage Command, (13 May, 2014), https://www.history.navy.mil/research/publications/colloquium-on-contemporary- history/more-bang-for-the-buck-/constraining-overkill.html By the mid-1960s both sides had much more accurate understanding of the opposition's forces. While the Soviets were catching up to the Americans' strategic nuclear weapons, NATO was catching up to the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces, in part with tactical nuclear weapons. This increased both sides' confidence; a 1964 Warsaw Pact plan for Czechoslovakia written as a result of the Berlin Crisis of 1961 assumed that the East could capture Lyon within two weeks after the start of hostilities, while contemporary NATO plans expected that it could stop the Warsaw Pact near the eastern border of West Germany, in contrast to the earlier fears of the English Channel if at all. The Warsaw Pact plan did not consider the possibility that American strategic weapons might have crippled the Soviet Union, assuming that superior Soviet air defenses would have stopped most enemy missiles while invading NATO troops would have, the plan stated, \\"suffered enormous losses from [Soviet] nuclear strikes\\". The Czechoslovakia plan was approved on 14 October 1964, the day Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was overthrown, and after the Prague Spring in 1968 the Soviets had to completely remove the Czech military from its plans. By the late 1960s they moved to a war strategy that lessened the dependence on nuclear weapons, resembling the West's flexible response. Warsaw Pact plans continued to assume, however, that NATO would make a surprise attack which it would repulse into the west; the East Germans even prepared occupation currency and new street signs. =Counterforce migrates to deterrence and warfighting= Studies began in 1972‚Äì1973 to provide more flexibility for the use of American nuclear weapons. In January 1974 President Richard M. Nixon approved NSDM-242, intended to add more \\"limited employment options\\" to help manage escalation, to SIOP-63. The related Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy (NUWEP) of April 1974 provided targets to achieve various goals; for example, the document stated that the United States nuclear forces must possess the ability to destroy 70% of the industrial capacity the Soviet Union needed to recover after a war. These documents formed the basis of SIOP-5 (January 1976), sometimes called the Schlesinger Doctrine after Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger. The ever-expanding target lists were split into classes of targets, with a wider range of plans matching strikes to political intentions from counterforce to countervalue, or any mix/withhold strategy to control escalation. Schlesinger described the doctrine as having three main aspects: :#The National Command Authority or its successors should have many choices about the use of weapons, always having an option to escalate. :#Targeting should make it very explicit that the first requisite is selective retaliation against the enemy's military (i.e., tailored counterforce). :#Some targets and target classes should not be struck, at least at first, to give the opponent a rational reason to terminate the conflict. Reduced collateral damage was another benefit of this \\"withhold\\" method. The SIOP policy was further modified during the Carter presidency under Presidential Directive 59, a key section of which stated > The employment of nuclear forces must be effectively related to operations > of our general purpose forces. Our doctrines for the use of forces in > nuclear conflict must insure that we can pursue specific policy objectives > selected by the National Command Authorities at that time, from general > guidelines established in advance. (S)In U.S. classified documents, > paragraphs and titles may have classification markings such as (S) for > SECRET, (U) for UNCLASSIFIED, (C) for CONFIDENTIAL, and (TS) for TOP SECRET. > Any of these letters may be followed with one or more control markings > (e.g., EYES ONLY, HANDLE THROUGH COMINT CHANNELS ONLY) or code > words/nicknames (e.g., UMBRA, POLO STEP) > These requirements form the broad outline of our evolving countervailing > strategy. To meet these requirements, improvements should be made to our > forces, their supporting C3 and intelligence, and their employment plans and > planning apparatus, to achieve a high degree of flexibility, enduring > survivability, and adequate performance in the face of enemy actions. The > following principles and goals should guide your efforts in making these > improvements. (S) In other words, PD59 explored a \\"warfighting\\" doctrine that suggested that nuclear plans might change during a war, and that nuclear weapons were to be used in combination with conventional weapons. Carter's Secretary of Defense, Harold Brown, emphasized selective counterforce, but also explicitly threatened the Soviet leadership themselves. Major improvements in U.S. command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I), including making elements survivable during a nuclear war, were instituted to make the PD-59 doctrine feasible. By 1982, SIOP-5 contained more than 40,000 possible targets in four categories: # Soviet nuclear forces. Examples: ICBM launch centers and control facilities, bomber airfields, ballistic-missile submarine bases. # Conventional forces. Examples: Supply depots, conventional airfields, ammunition storage, tank storage yards. # Military and political centers. Examples: Command posts, communications facilities. # Economic and industrial centers. Examples: Factories for ammunition and tanks, refineries, steel and aluminum plants, power plants. Whether Soviet military doctrine recognized the difference between counterforce and a general attack was unknown. A 1982 analysis stated, however, that the technically inferior Soviet attack- assessment system would likely have difficulty in differentiating between such attacks. In any case, given that the majority of Soviet nuclear airfields and missile sites were located west of the Ural mountains, many in major population centers, the analysis concluded that the American plans for flexible use of force were meaningless. The author was also skeptical of whether communications to manage escalation‚Äîwhether on the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline, or between command authorities and their deployed nuclear submarines and bombers‚Äîcould be maintained, and observed that use of nuclear weapons \\"are not suited to signalling any precise and unambiguous message\\". =Return to counterforce, with strategic defense= During the Reagan administration, there was a return to a strong counterforce strategy through NSDD-13. This included development of strategic weapons systems that were more accurate, more survivable, or both. Some of these systems eventually took the role of bargaining chips in arms control negotiations, although some, such as the B-2 \\"stealth\\" bomber remained highly classified as potential surprises in war. The B-2 was also seen as a counter to Soviet deployment of mobile missiles, which only a manned bomber could find and attack. In 1983, President Reagan gave a speech proposing, at the least, research and development into non-nuclear defense systems against nuclear-armed missiles. The idea of effective Strategic Defense Initiative was a potential disruption to the existing balance of Mutual assured destruction, even with its \\"warfighting\\" refinements. =Renaming and refocusing= On 1 March 2003, the SIOP was renamed \\"OPLAN 8022\\", and later CONPLAN (contingency plan) 8022. It went into deployment in July 2004, but it was reported cancelled in July 2007. It may have been superseded by an expanded CONPLAN 8044. Another set of \\"Global Strike\\" plans include a jointly coordinated a nuclear option, intended for other than the general nuclear war situations, principally with Russia but possibly also with China, postulated in OPLAN 8022. Global Strike plans are codified in CONPLAN 8044.  Executing the SIOP  The President, as a member of the National Command Authority, (NCA) may order the use of nuclear weapons. Subsequent to the President's decision, the release of nuclear weapons is governed by the two-man rule at all times. All military personnel that participate in loading, arming, or firing weapons, as well as transmitting launch orders, are subject to the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). Deputy's launch keyswitch in an old Minuteman ICBM launch control center. Commander's key was too far away to be turned by the same person. If the NCA decides that the United States must launch nuclear weapons, the decision is communicated to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and through him to the National Military Command Center (often called the \\"war room\\") via the Presidential Emergency Satchel, informally referred to as the \\"football.\\" Inside the football is a black book listing a menu of strike options and \\"The Biscuit,\\" a 3-by-5-inch card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. The menu of strike options include Major Attack Options (MAOs), Selected Attack Options (SAOs), and Limited Attack Options (LAOs). Individual countries or regions can be included in or withheld from nuclear attacks depending on circumstances. To communicate the order, the CJCS, or, in his absence, the senior officer in the NMCC verifies the President's identity with a \\"challenge code\\" and the President responds with the corresponding authentication code from the biscuit. Additionally, the message will go to the Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC), located in Raven Rock Mountain, Pennsylvania, and also to an airborne command post, either the presidential National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) or the military E-6 Mercury Looking Glass.20 If the NMCC is destroyed by a first strike, either the ANMCC, NAOC or Looking Glass can issue the orders to execute the SIOP. The senior NMCC officer directs preparation of the launch order in the form of an Emergency War Order (EWO) ‚Äì a message that contains the chosen war plan, time to launch, authentication codes and codes needed to unlock the missiles before firing them. A second officer will validate that order. The order is then broadcast to each worldwide command and directly to launch crews by releasing an Emergency Action Message (EAM) which is an encoded and encrypted message about 150 characters long. E-6 Mercury As the orders go down the chain of command, always subject to the two-man rule, intermediate headquarters, and eventually the nuclear delivery platforms themselves, will receive Emergency Action Messages (EAM) to arm or launch weapons. For most modern weapons, the EAM will also include codes for Permissive Action Links (PAL). At a minimum, a PAL code will actually arm a weapon for release. The circuitry controlling the PAL is deliberately positioned inside the warhead such that it cannot be reached without disabling the weapon, at a minimum, to a level that would require a full factory-level rebuild. There may be separate PAL codes for arming and launch. Some weapons have \\"dial-a-yield\\" functions that allow the power of the nuclear explosion to be adjusted from minimum to maximum yield. Most weapons have additional arming circuitry that, even if a valid launch code is entered, will not arm the warhead unless the weapon senses that it has been released on an expected delivery path. For example, the first steps of the final arming process for a ballistic missile depend on physical characteristics of the weapon release, such as the acceleration of a rocket launch, zero-gravity coasting, and various physical aspects of hypersonic reentry into the atmosphere. A gravity bomb dropped from an aircraft will detect the altitude of release and the decreasing altitude as it falls. Journalist Ron Rosenbaum has pointed out that the SIOP is entirely concerned with the identity of the commanding officer and the authenticity of the order, and there are no safeguards to verify that the person issuing the order is actually sane. \\"The president has supreme authority to decide whether to use America's nuclear weapons. Period. Full stop,\\" says the Arms Control Association's Kingston Reif. A president could only be stopped by mutiny, he explained, and more than one person would have to disobey the president's orders. Notably, Major Harold Hering was eventually forced out of the Air Force for asking during his missile training course how he could know that an order to launch his missiles was \\"lawful,\\" that it came from a sane president, one who wasn't \\"imbalance[d]\\" or \\"berserk.\\" United Kingdom participation Although after World War II the formal military alliance between the United States and United Kingdom no longer existed, American postwar war plans required using British air bases until the United States developed ICBMs and long-range bombers. American General Carl Spaatz and Chief of the Air Staff Lord Tedder informally agreed in 1946 to US aircraft using British bases. The discussions, and the subsequent actions such as extending runways, were so secret that it is unclear whether Prime Minister Clement Attlee was aware of them. By 1948, the year of the Berlin Blockade, British leaders expected that \\"in a future world conflict, US and British forces will find themselves fighting side by side\\" although the alliance had not been formally renewed. The two countries began coordinating their plans for a Soviet attack in Europe after the Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat of 1948, and later that year General Curtis LeMay, head of Strategic Air Command (SAC), asked Tedder to allow the basing of American atomic weapons in Britain. By the end of 1948, several British bases were atomic-capable or were close to being so, but the ability to fight an atomic war from Britain did not exist until April 1949 when Silverplate B-29 bombers began rotating through the bases, and no American atomic weapons were present in Britain until 1952. Aware that with or without bombs, the bases made Britain what Winston Churchill called a \\"bull's-eye\\" for Soviet attack, he and other British leaders made repeated unsuccessful attempts to learn details of American war plans, and not until 1951 did the United States formally, if vaguely, agree to consult with Britain before using atomic weapons based there. As Tedder complained during the Berlin crisis, when war at any moment seemed possible, the defense of the West relied \\"on the use of a weapon about which we in fact know very little\\". British plans such as SPEEDWAY, which discussed American-British-Canadian joint planning for the early part of a war over the next 18 months, likely incorporated some information informally sent by the United States, including projections on future bomb production and targets. The Chiefs of Staff Committee was dissatisfied, however, writing that \\"We are at a disadvantage in that ... we do not know the details of the number of [American] atomic weapons to be used and so cannot assess with any accuracy the results that can be achieved.\\" The Americans preferred that the British not develop atomic weapons at all, but as that was not possible, they decided that partnership was preferable to losing influence with the United Kingdom. The British sought an independent, domestic nuclear deterrent that by itself could persuade the USSR to not attack, in part because they feared that America might not be willing to defend Europe with its nuclear missiles once the USSR could attack the United States itself, or during wartime not prioritize targets that threatened the United Kingdom. In 1950 RAF Bomber Command asked for, and received, 70 B-29s from the United States after offering to place them under the control of SAC during wartime. The bombers were becoming obsolete, however. The British never made them nuclear-capable, and the RAF refused the US's request for SAC's complete targeting control over the sophisticated British-built V bombers which began deploying in 1955. Britain's goal of an independent deterrent aimed at Soviet cities was so important that, when it offered to place the V Bombers under SACEUR authority in 1953 in exchange for American financial aid to purchase new fighters, it refused to agree to them being used in a tactical role against Soviet targets in Europe. The agreement permitted Britain to commit only nominal forces to SACEUR, and presaged future technology and targeting cooperation. As the USAF began in 1955 helping the RAF to convert V bombers to carry American atomic weapons under Project E and hydrogen weapons under Project X, cooperation increased and the United States began sharing some war plan details. Although both nations remained reluctant to fully share their plans‚Äîas late as 1956, Britain did not have targeting information even for SAC aircraft it hosted‚Äîredundancies were eliminated by one side asking the other whether it planned to attack various targets. In February 1959, the USAF agreed to target 150 Soviet bases that threatened Britain with nuclear weapons, while V bombers would use nuclear weapons to attack Soviet air defenses before SAC arrived. The RAF retained a separate plan to attack 30 Soviet cities with hydrogen bombs. The agreement formed the basis for the ongoing nuclear-targeting cooperation between the two countries, and the different target types resembled the two nations' different priorities during the Combined Bomber Offensive of World War II. The Anglo-American dispute during the 1956 Suez Crisis only briefly disrupted the partnership, and the desire to restore relations to their former level, and the Sputnik crisis, increased American willingness to help Britain improve its atomic weaponry. In March 1957 the United States agreed to sell 60 Thor IRBMs, in 1958 American hydrogen-weapon designs, in 1960 the Skybolt ALBM, and after its cancellation the Polaris SLBM in 1962 as replacement. Polaris was especially notable; British officials initially refused to believe the Americans' offer of state- of-the-art submarine missiles at a moderate price, and one scholar later called it \\"amazing\\". While its contribution to SIOP was minor compared to the enormous SAC arsenal of 1,600 bombers and 800 missiles, as RAF officers who worked with the Americans rose to leadership positions their experience benefited later partnerships between the two countries. The joint targeting plan changed over time; the 1962 list for the RAF included 48 cities, six air- defense sites, and three bomber bases, and the 1963 list had 16 cities, 44 airfields and other offensive sites, 10 air-defense sites, and 28 IRBM sites. The degree of cooperation was such by the Cuban Missile Crisis that RAF officers visiting SAC headquarters in Nebraska reported being \\"treated just like Americans. We went all through their briefings, computers, top secret rooms and so forth\\". While some British officers emphasized the continuing importance of maintaining the ability to act alone with an independent deterrent if necessary, by 1962 the independent list was essentially the RAF portion of the joint plan and no active training was done. The British emphasis on retaining an independent capability, however, continued over several decades and changes in government. As the Defence Council stated in 1980, While current United Kingdom's nuclear forces‚Äîfour Trident s‚Äîare strictly under UK national control, they had two distinct roles under the SIOP. The first was part of a UK-only retaliatory response to a nuclear attack, whether a full strategic strike, or a limited tactical strike. The second role was one in which the Royal Navy participated in the SIOP, in effect becoming an extension of the U.S. Navy's Trident submarines. This role was to be part of a NATO response to a Soviet nuclear strike. The Royal Navy's contribution to the SIOP was small. The four Vanguard submarines could strike a maximum of 512 separate targets; equivalent to 7% of the total U.S. nuclear strike capacity. SIOP in fiction * In Dale Brown's novel Plan of Attack, it is revealed that Patrick McLanahan is one of the most highly valued personnel in the U.S. military because of his involvement in classified projects and knowledge of the American SIOP. However, because of McLanahan's involvement in controversial highly classified military actions, President Thorn largely ignores this fact and the warning of an imminent Russian attack until Russia launches a nuclear campaign against the US. * In Eric L. Harry's novel Arc Light, the President decides to execute \\"SIOP 6-C\\" in a counterforce strike against Russia after a Russian general gained control of the nuclear codes and launched a massive attack against the US. In the book, \\"SIOP 6-C\\" had six thousand nuclear warheads assigned to be used, some of which were held in reserve. * In William Prochnau's novel Trinity's Child, a Soviet nuclear sneak attack triggers US retaliation. There is discussion of SIOP among the unnamed US President, the military commander codenamed Alice on board the SAC Looking Glass aircraft who is advising the President, who has just been sworn in aboard Air Force One, and the President's primary military advisor. After the destruction of cities on both sides, Alice and the original President battle those on board Air Force One for control of the American missile submarine fleet. At stake is the expectation that launch of the Tridents as well as Soviet retaliation will raise the total death toll into the billions. * In What Ifs? of American History, edited by Robert Cowley, one essay (\\"The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust\\", by Robert L. O'Connell) outlines a scenario where the Cuban Missile Crisis leads, via miscalculations, incompetence, and trigger-happiness on both sides, to a two-day thermonuclear war, with horrific results in terms of both overkill and long-term effects on the world. * In Tom Clancy's novel Without Remorse, the US intelligence community learns that US Air Force Colonel Robin Zacharias, shot down over Vietnam and reported killed in action by the Vietnamese, is in fact alive and being held in a prisoner-of-war camp. He is being debriefed by a Russian military intelligence officer and there is particular concern because Zacharias has been involved in strategic war plans and has knowledge of the SIOP. * In Tom Clancy's novel The Sum of All Fears, is sailing in the Mediterranean when a nuclear bomb explodes in Denver. In response, the President orders DEFCON-2 for strategic forces and DEFCON-3 for the conventional ones. The crew's response to various perceived Soviet threats that arise after the alert is quite severe because supposedly by virtue of their geographic location they are now \\"part of SIOP\\" and so different, more aggressive rules of engagement apply (DEFCON-2 instead of DEFCON-3). * In Eric Swedin's work When Angels Wept, the Cuban Missile Crisis turns into a war and after the death of President Kennedy, President Johnson orders the execution of SIOP-63, resulting in the destruction of the Communist Bloc (Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China). * The movie WarGames involves eliminating the SIOP and placing the decision into the hands of a supercomputer, after a surprise drill sees one member of the two-man crew in a Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Facility refuses to follow orders to \\"launch\\" missiles. The computer is later led into a launch sequence, but since it is not given the proper launch codes, it begins a brute-force attack to determine the missile codes. After going to DEFCON 1, the computer realizes that war is futile, and ceases to follow its own attack.

The game was first printed commercially in June 1986. A Wizard deck consists of 60 cards: a regular set of 52 playing cards (replaced with custom symbols and colours in some editions), 4 Wizards and 4 Jesters. The Jesters have the lowest value, then the one up to thirteen, with Wizards highest in value. The game is licensed in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan. Gameplay The objective of the game is to bid correctly on the number of tricks that a player will take in the subsequent round of play. Points are awarded for a correct bid and subtracted for an incorrect bid. The player with most points after all rounds have been played is the winner. The game is played in a number of rounds from 10 to 20, depending on the number of players and each round consists of three stages: Dealing, Bidding, and Playing. In the first round every player gets one card. In the subsequent rounds the number of cards is increased by one until all cards are distributed. That means that three players play 20 rounds, four players 15 rounds, five players 12 rounds and six players 10 rounds. The top card of the remaining cards is turned over to determine the trump suit. If there are no cards left or a jester is turned, there is no trump suit, and only the wizards are trump. If a wizard is turned, the dealer picks a trump suit. After looking at their cards, starting with the player to the dealer's left, each player states how many tricks he believes he will take, from zero to the number of cards dealt. This is recorded on a score pad. The player to the left of the dealer plays a card, and then the others follow clockwise. If a card other than a wizard or jester is played, the players have to follow suit, but it is possible to play a jester or wizard although the player has the desired suit. The Wizard beats all other cards but the first one in a trick beats all others. The jester is beaten by all others, but if all cards in a trick are jesters the first one beats the others. If a jester is played as the first card the first suit card decides which suit has to be followed. If a wizard is played as the first card every player is free to play what they want regardless of the others. If the first card is a Jester and the second a Wizard, then the Wizard rule takes precedence and players are not required to follow suit. At the end of each round, each player is given a score based on his performance. For predicting the number of tricks taken correctly, a player receives 20 points plus 10 points for each trick taken. For predicting the number of tricks taken incorrectly, a player loses 10 points for each trick over or under. Variant card sets The German version of Wizard has a different design, with a fantasy-themed character on each card. Each character has a title such as der Krieger (the warrior) or die Priesterin (the priestess) printed at the top of the card. There are 2 male and 2 female versions of each character. The German decks contain four non-standard suits with values from 1 to 13, four Z cards labelled either der Zauberer (the sorcerer) or die Zauberin (the sorceress), and four N cards labelled der Narr or die N√§rrin (the fool). The German deck is distributed in the United States as \\"Fantasy Wizard\\", with an English box and rules. The cards are identical to the German ones, including the German abbreviations for Zauberer/Zauberin and Narr/N√§rrin. The Medieval deck of cards has a themed character on each card. The characters are: (2) Hermit, (3) Peasant, (4) Farmer, (5) Archer, (6) Blacksmith, (7) Merchant, (8) Bard, (9) Scholar, (10) Bishop, Knight, Queen, King, (Ace) Dragon. The cards are also color-coded: Hearts (Red), Spades (Black), Clubs (Green), Diamonds (Purple), Jesters (Brown), Wizards (Blue). Tournament play Regular tournaments are held online. World Championships began in 2010. Each nation is invited to send a maximum of two representatives to the annual event. World Championship locations have included: *2010: Frankfurt, Germany.

First hand probabilities Since there are no options for which card to play when a player is only holding one card, there is a statistically correct bid for any given card. This only truly applies if a player has the lead, and thus no information from other bids. Since a correct bid of 1 yields 30 points, and a correct bid of 0 only yields 20, a bid of 1 over time yields more points as long as the player has at least a 42.86% chance of winning the trick. The known cards are only a player's own card and the turn up, so with 58 unknowns, the odds that a hand will win in a three player game are calculated by the odds that both of the other hands lose to that player. That is, (x/58)*((x-1)/57), x=# of cards the player can beat. The calculation is similar for more players. Solving for x to yield 0.4286 or greater gives the minimum number of cards a player needs to be ahead of to justify a bid of 1. With the lead: *In a 3-person game, x=39, bid 1 with an offsuit Jack or stronger. *In a 4-person game, x=44, bid 1 with the 3 of trump or stronger, (4 of trump if the turn up is the 2 or 3). *In a 5-person game, x=49, bid 1 with the 9 of trump or better, (the 8 will do if the turn up is higher than the 8) *In a 6-person game, x=50, bid 1 with the 10 of trump or better (9 if turn-up is 10 or higher) *In the special case that a jester turns up and there is therefore no trump, and the player has the lead: always bid 1 in a 3 player game, With 4 - bid 1 on 3 or higher, with 5 - bid 1 with any 9 or higher, and with 6 players a 10 or higher.

Not including the similar and physically separate Berlin Wall, the border was long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia. It was formally established on 1 July 1945 as the boundary between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of former Nazi Germany. On the eastern side, it was made one of the world's most heavily fortified frontiers, defined by a continuous line of high metal fences and walls, barbed wire, alarms, anti-vehicle ditches, watchtowers, automatic booby traps, and minefields. It was patrolled by 50,000 armed East German guards who faced tens of thousands of West German, British, and US guards and soldiers.Faringdon (1986), pp. 282‚Äì84. In the hinterlands behind the border were more than a million North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Warsaw Pact troops. The border was a physical manifestation of Sir Winston Churchill's metaphorical Iron Curtain that separated the Soviet and Western blocs during the Cold War. It marked the boundary between two economic systems ‚Äì capitalism and communism. Built by East Germany in phases from 1952 to the late 1980s,Faringdon (1986), p. 284. the fortifications were constructed to stop the large-scale emigration of East German citizens to the West, about 1,000 of whom are said to have died trying to cross it during its 45-year existence.McDougall (2004), p. 40. It caused widespread economic and social disruption on both sides; East Germans living in the region suffered especially draconian restrictions.Czuczka (2000-01-13). The better-known Berlin Wall was a physically separate, less elaborate, and much shorter border barrier surrounding West Berlin, more than to the east of the inner German border. Berlin, which was entirely within the Soviet zone, had been similarly divided by the four powers after World War II, thus creating an exclave surrounded by East Germany that was closely aligned with (but not formally part of) West Germany. On 9 November 1989, the East German government announced the opening of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border. Over the following days, millions of East Germans poured into the West to visit. Hundreds of thousands moved permanently to the West in the following months as more crossings were opened, and ties between long-divided communities were re- established as border controls became little more than a cursory formality. The inner German border was not completely abandoned until 1 July 1990,The Record (1990-07-02). exactly 45 years to the day since its establishment, and only three months before German reunification formally ended Germany's division. Little remains of the inner German border's fortifications. Its route has been declared part of the European Green Belt linking national parks and nature reserves along the course of the old Iron Curtain from the Arctic Circle to the Black Sea. Several museums and memorials along the old border commemorate the division and reunification of Germany and, in some places, preserve elements of the fortifications.Cramer (2008), pp. 8‚Äì9. Development =Origins= The Allied zones of occupation in Germany, highlighting the inner German border (heavy black line), the originally Soviet-occupied zone (red) and the area from which UK/US troops withdrew in July 1945 (purple). The provincial boundaries in gray are those of Germany until 1933 prior to the Nazi party's rule, and differ from the modern federal states established later. The inner German border originated from plans by the Allies of World War II to divide a defeated Germany into occupation zones.Buchholz (1994), p. 56. Their boundaries were drawn along the territorial boundaries of 19th-century German states and provinces that had largely disappeared with the unification of Germany in 1871.Faringdon (1986), p. 282. Three zones were agreed on, each covering roughly a third of Germany: a British zone in the north-west, an American zone in the south and a Soviet zone in the East. France was later given a zone in the southwest of Germany, neighbouring with France, carved out of the British and American zones.Weinberg (1995), p. 804. The division of Germany was put into effect on 1 July 1945. Because of their unexpectedly rapid advances through central Germany in the final weeks of the war, British and American troops occupied large areas that had been assigned to the Soviet zone of occupation. The redeployment of Western troops prompted many Germans to flee to the West to escape the Soviet takeover of the remainder of the Soviet zone.Shears (1970), p. 29. The wartime Allies initially worked together under the auspices of the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany.Osma≈Ñczyk; Mango (2004), p. 77. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. In October, the Soviet zone was proclaimed the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.Shears (1970), p. 36. From the outset, West Germany and the Allies rejected East Germany's legitimacy.Joint statement of the Allied powers, 3 October 1954, quoted in Kindermann (1994), pp. 220‚Äì21. The creation of East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. The FRG regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to West and East German citizens. An East German who escaped or was released to the West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right to work, and (later) EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive to move to the West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.Gress (1985), pp. 15‚Äì16. The East German government sought to define the country as a legitimate state in its own rightLoth (2004), p. 274. and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland) ‚Äì a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.Schweitzer (1995), p. 50. =1945‚Äì1952: the \\"Green Border\\"= In the early days of the occupation, the Allies controlled traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers.Stacy (1984), p. 6. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone.Stacy (1984), p. 9. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6 million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.Stacy (1984), p. 8. The east‚Äìwest interzonal border became steadily more tense as the relationship between the Western Allies and the Soviets deteriorated.Stacy (1984), pp. 31‚Äì32. From September 1947, an increasingly strict regime was imposed on the eastern Soviet zone boundary. The number of Soviet soldiers on the boundary was increased and supplemented with border guards from the newly established East German Volkspolizei (\\"People's Police\\"). Many unofficial crossing points were blocked with ditches and barricades.Stacy (1984), p. 40. The West Germans also stepped up security with the establishment in 1952 of the Federal Border Protection force of 20,000 men ‚Äì the Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS; however, Allied troops (the British in the north, the Americans in the south) retained responsibility for the military security of the border.Stacy (1984), pp. 67, 69. The boundary line was nonetheless still fairly easy to cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live on one side and work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife.Berdahl (1999), p. 144. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000 people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.Cramer (2008), p. 15. =1952‚Äì1967: the \\"special regime\\"= The relative openness of the border ended abruptly on 26 May 1952, when East Germany implemented a \\"special regime on the demarcation line\\", justified as a measure to keep out \\"spies, diversionists, terrorists and smugglers\\".Stacy (1984), p. 50. The East German move was taken to limit the continuing exodus of its citizens, which threatened the viability of East Germany's economy.Shears (1970), p. 37. A ploughed strip wide was created along the entire length of the inner German border. An adjoining \\"protective strip\\" (Schutzstreifen) wide was placed under tight control. A \\"restricted zone\\" (Sperrzone) a further wide was created in which only those holding a special permit could live or work. Trees and brush were cut down along the border to clear lines of sight for the guards and to eliminate cover for would-be crossers. Houses adjoining the border were torn down, bridges were closed, and barbed-wire fencing was put up in many places. Farmers were permitted to work their fields along the border only in daylight hours and under the watch of armed guards, who were authorised to use weapons if their orders were not obeyed. Border communities on both sides suffered acute disruption. Farms, coal mines, and even houses were split in two by the sudden closure of the border.Manchester Guardian (1952-06-09)Cramer (2008), p. 143. More than 8,300 East German civilians living along the border were forcibly resettled in a programme codenamed \\"Operation Vermin\\" (Aktion Ungeziefer).Berdahl (1999), p. 67. Another 3,000 residents, realising that they were about to be expelled from their homes, fled to the West. The seal around the country was expanded in July 1962, when East Germany declared its entire Baltic coast a border zone subject to closures and restrictions.The Times (1962-07-21). The border between East and West Berlin was also significantly tightened, although not fully closed; East Germans were still able to cross into West Berlin, which then became the main route by which East Germans migrated to the West.Maddrell (2006), pp. 54, 56. Between 1949 and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, an estimated 3.5 million East Germans ‚Äì a sixth of the entire population ‚Äì emigrated to the West, most via Berlin. The railways between East Berlin and other important parts of East Germany went through West Berlin, so an easy way of going to West Berlin was leaving such a train. This railway configuration could not easily be changed, but a new long railway was built around West Berlin. Following the completion of the Berlin outer ring in 1961, sealing off the East German border with West Berlin became more feasible, and ultimately became a reality in August of that year. =1967‚Äì1989: the \\"modern frontier\\"= A Bundesgrenzschutz Alouette II helicopter patrols the West German side of the inner German border, 1985 Annotated diagram of the third-generation inner German border system c. 1984 East Germany decided to upgrade the fortifications in the late 1960s to establish a \\"modern frontier\\" that would be far more difficult to cross. Barbed-wire fences were replaced with harder-to-climb expanded metal barriers; directional anti-personnel mines and anti-vehicle ditches blocked the movement of people and vehicles; tripwires and electric signals helped guards to detect escapees; all-weather patrol roads enabled rapid access to any point along the border; and wooden guard towers were replaced with prefabricated concrete towers and observation bunkers. Construction of the new border system started in September 1967.Stacy (1984), p. 185. Nearly of new fencing was built, usually further back from the geographical line than the old barbed-wire fences. The upgrade programme continued well into the 1980s.Stacy (1984), p. 189. The new system immediately reduced the number of successful escapes from around 1,000 people a year in the mid-1960s to only about 120 per year a decade later.Mulligan (1976-10-28). The introduction of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik (\\"Eastern Policy\\") at the end of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East.Stacy (1984), p. 176.Fulbrook (2002), p. 170. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever. In 1988, the East German leadership considered proposals to replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.M√ºller-Enbergs (1988), p. 437.Koop (1996), p. Economic and social impact All that remains of the East German border village of Bardowiek, razed in the 1970s. The inscription on the lone transformer tower reads, \\"Bardowiek: mentioned in historical records since 1292; illegally destroyed between 1977 and 1989 during the 'DDR' regime.\\" The closure of the border had a substantial economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24 secondary lines, 23 autobahns or national roads, 140 regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When relations between the two states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police. The economic impact of the border was harsh. Many towns and villages were severed from their markets and economic hinterlands, which caused areas close to the border to go into an economic and demographic decline. The two German states responded to the problem in different ways. West Germany gave substantial subsidies to communities under the \\"Aid to border regions\\" programme, an initiative begun in 1971 to save them from total decline. Infrastructure and businesses along the border benefited from substantial state investment.Buchholz (1994), p. 59. East Germany's communities had a much harder time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay.August (1999), p. 28. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions. The GDR bore a huge economic cost for its creation of the border zone and the building and maintenance of its fortifications. The zone consumed around ‚Äì more than six per cent of the East's territory,Rottman (2008), pp. 20‚Äì21. within which economic activity was severely curtailed or ceased entirely. The actual cost of the border system was a closely guarded secret, and even today it is uncertain exactly how much it cost to build and maintain. The BT-9 watchtowers each cost around 65,000 East German marks to build and the expanded metal fences cost around 151,800 marks per kilometre. The implementation of the \\"modern frontier\\" in the 1970s led to a major increase in personnel costs. The total annual expenditure on GDR border troops rose from 600 million marks per annum in 1970 to nearly 1 billion by 1983. In early 1989, East German economists calculated that each arrest cost the equivalent of 2.1 million marks, three times the average value to the state of each working person.Hertle (2007), p. 97.  Tourism  The Berlin Wall was a specific piece of the Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45 km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120 km) around the edges of West Berlin, and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Although an exact number of visitors to the Berlin Wall cannot be given, as there were no official records at the time, estimates are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors.Eckert, Astrid M. \\"'Greetings from the Zonal Border' Tourism to the Iron Curtain in West Germany.\\" Zeithistorische Forschungen 8 (2011): 9‚Äì36. Views of the border The two German governments promoted very different views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state ‚Äì a defensive rampart against Western aggression.Lapp (1986), p. x. In Grenzer (\\"Border Guard\\"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described what they saw as the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.Synopsis of Grenzer (2009) However, West German propaganda leaflets referred to the border as merely \\"the demarcation line of the Soviet occupation zone\\", and emphasised the cruelty and injustice of the division of Germany.Ministry of Federal Affairs, Displaced Persons and Refugees, Bonn. \\"Attention Demarcation Line!\\". Leaflet published c. mid-1960s. Signs along the Western side of the frontier declared \\"Hier ist Deutschland nicht zu Ende ‚Äì Auch dr√ºben ist Vaterland!\\" (\\"Germany does not end here: the Fatherland is over there too!\\"Bailey (1983) p. 143.) Whereas East Germany kept its civilians well away from the border, West Germany actively encouraged tourism, and locations where the border was especially intrusive became tourist attractions. One example was the divided village of M√∂dlareuth in Bavaria. The Associated Press reported in 1976 that \\"Western tourists by the busload come out to have their pictures taken against the backdrop of the latest Communist walled city [and] the concrete blockhouse and the bunker-slits protruding from the green hillock where a collective's cows were grazing.\\" At Zimmerau, in Bavaria, a observation tower (the Bayernturm) was constructed in 1966 to give visitors a view across the hills into East Germany.Cramer (2008), p. 162. The inhabitants of the East German village of Kella found themselves becoming a tourist attraction for Westerners in the 1970s and 1980s. A viewing point, the \\"Window on Kella\\", was established on a nearby hilltop from which tourists could peer across the border with binoculars and telescopes.Berdahl (1999), p. 149. To the amusement of many, a nudist beach was opened on the Western side in 1975 immediately adjoining the border's terminus near the Baltic Sea port of Travem√ºnde. Visitors often sought to have a nude photograph taken below a looming East German watchtower; the West Germans noted \\"a lot more movement on that watchtower since the nudist beach opened\\".The Age (1975-08-18).Los Angeles Times (1977-07-07). Fortifications of the inner German border Preserved part of the border between Thuringia and Hesse: the border fence with a mined control strip behind it and a lane patrol road. The actual boundary was located above the wooded slope. In the rear of the open area on the slope, a cross marks the place where 34-year-old worker Heinz-Josef Gro√üe was shot on 29 March 1982 attempting Republikflucht (\\"flight from the republic\\"). The East German side of the inner German border was dominated by a complex system of fortifications and security zones, over long and several kilometres deep. The fortifications were established in 1952 and reached a peak of complexity and lethality at the start of the 1980s. The border guards referred to the side of the border zone facing the GDR as the freundw√§rts (literally \\"friendward\\") side and that facing the FRG as the feindw√§rts (\\"enemyward\\") side.Ritter; Lapp (2007), pp. 11, 92. =Restricted zone= A person attempting to make an illegal crossing of the inner German border around 1980, travelling from east to west, would first come to the \\"restricted zone\\" (Sperrzone). This was a wide area running parallel to the border to which access was heavily restricted. Its inhabitants could only enter and leave using special permits, were not permitted to enter other villages within the zone, and were subjected to night time curfews.Allinson (2000), p. 125.Buchholz (1994), p. 57. It was not fenced off, but access roads were blocked by checkpoints.Rottman (2008), p. 23. On the far side of the Sperrzone was the signal fence (Signalzaun), a continuous expanded metal fence long and 2 metres (6.6 ft) high. The fence was lined with low- voltage electrified strands of barbed wire. When the wire was touched or cut, an alarm was activated to alert nearby guards.Rottman (2008), p. 29. =Protective strip= On the other side of the signal fence lay the heavily guarded \\"protective strip\\" (Schutzstreifen), wide, which adjoined the border itself. It was monitored by guards stationed in concrete, steel and wooden watchtowers constructed at regular intervals along the entire length of the border. Nearly 700 such watchtowers had been built by 1989; each of the larger ones was equipped with a powerful 1,000-watt rotating searchlight (Suchscheinwerfer) and firing ports to enable the guards to open fire without having to go outside.Rottman (2008), p. 28. Their entrances were always positioned facing towards the East German side, so that observers in the West could not see guards going in or out. Around 1,000 two-man observation bunkers also stood along the length of the border. Guard dogs were used to provide an additional deterrent to escapees. Dog runs (Kettenlaufanlagen), consisting of a suspended wire up to long to which a large dog was chained, were installed on high-risk sectors of the border. The dogs were occasionally turned loose in temporary pens adjoining gates or damaged sections of the fence. A preserved section of the border fortifications at H√∂tensleben. The patrol road is on the left; the primary control strip runs parallel in the middle; beyond it rise a row of Czech hedgehog barricades and the border wall. The guards used an all- weather patrol road (Kolonnenweg, literally \\"column way\\") to patrol the border and travel rapidly to the scene of an attempted crossing. It consisted of two parallel lines of perforated concrete blocks that ran beside the border for around .Ritter; Lapp (2007), p. 69. Next to the Kolonnenweg was one of the control strips (Kontrollstreifen), a line of bare earth running parallel to the fences along almost the entire length of the border. There were two control strips, both located on the inward-facing sides of the fences. The secondary \\"K2\\" strip, wide, ran alongside the signal fence, while the primary \\"K6\\" strip, wide, ran along the inside of the fence or wall.Rottman (2008), p. 17. In places where the border was vulnerable to escape attempts, the control strip was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage), which were also used at points where rivers and streams crossed the border. Anyone attempting to cross the control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications. Anti-vehicle barriers were installed on the other side of the primary control strip. In some locations, Czech hedgehog barricades, known in German as Panzersperre or Stahligel (\\"steel hedgehogs\\"), were used to prevent vehicles being used to cross the border. Elsewhere, V-shaped anti-vehicle ditches known as Kraftfahrzeug-Sperrgraben (KFZ-Sperrgraben) were installed along of the border and were absent only where natural obstacles such as streams, rivers, gullies or thick forests made such barriers unnecessary.Rottman (2008), pp. 23‚Äì24. =Outer fence, walls and minefields= The outer fences were constructed in a number of phases, starting with the initial fortification of the border from May 1952. The first-generation fence was a crudely constructed single barbed-wire fence (Stacheldrahtzaun) which stood between high and was built very close to the actual border line.Rottman (2008), p. 16. This was replaced in the late 1950s with parallel rows of more strongly constructed barbed-wire fences, sometimes with concertina wire placed between the fences as an additional obstacle.Rottman (2008), p. 18. SM-70 tripwire-activated directional anti-personnel mine mounted on the fence. The cone contained an explosive charge which fired shrapnel fragments when activated. A \\"third-generation\\" fence, much more solidly constructed, was installed in an ongoing programme of improvements from the late 1960s to the 1980s. The fence line was moved back to create an outer strip between the fence and the actual border. The barbed-wire fences were replaced with a barrier that was usually 3.2‚Äì4.0 metres (10‚Äì13 ft) high. It was constructed with expanded metal mesh (Metallgitterzaun) panels. The openings in the mesh were generally too small to provide finger-holds and were very sharp. The panels could not easily be pulled down, as they overlapped, and they could not be cut through with a bolt- or wire-cutter. Nor could they be tunnelled under easily, as the bottom segment of the fences was partially buried in the ground. In a number of places, more lightly constructed fences (Lichtsperren) consisting of mesh and barbed wire lined the border.Rottman (2008), p. 25. The fences were not continuous and could be crossed at a number of places. Gates were installed to enable guards to patrol up to the line and to give engineers access for maintenance on the outward-facing side of the barrier. In some places, villages adjoining the border were fenced with wooden board fences (Holzlattenzaun) or concrete barrier walls (Betonsperrmauern) standing around high. Windows in buildings adjoining the border were bricked or boarded up, and buildings deemed too close to the border were pulled down. The barrier walls stood along only a small percentage of the border ‚Äì of the total length by 1989. Anti-personnel mines were installed along approximately half of the border's length starting in 1966; by the 1980s, some 1.3 million mines of various Soviet-made types had been laid.Rottman (2008), pp. 18‚Äì19. In addition, from 1970 the outer fence was booby-trapped with around 60,000 SM-70 (Splittermine-70) directional anti-personnel mines. They were activated by tripwires connected to the firing mechanism. This detonated a horn-shaped charge filled with shrapnel that was sprayed in one direction along the line of the fence. The device was potentially lethal to a range of around . The mines were eventually removed by the end of 1984 in the face of international condemnation of the East German government.Rottman (2008), p. 21. =Border line= Until the late 1960s, the fortifications were constructed almost up to the actual border line. When the third-generation fortifications were constructed, the fences were moved back from between to as much as . This gave the guards a clear field of fire to target escapees without shots landing in the West and provided a buffer zone where engineers could work on maintaining the outward face of the fence in East German territory. Access to the outer strip was very tightly controlled, to ensure that the guards themselves would not be tempted to escape. Although often described by Western sources as a \\"no-man's land\\", it was de jure wholly East German territory, and escapees could be arrested or shot.Rottman (2008), pp. 25‚Äì26. Westerners were prohibited from entering the area and thus could not go to the aid of escapees. The actual line between West and East Germany was located on the far side of the outer strip. It was marked by granite stones (Grenzsteine) with the letters \\"DDR\\" carved on the west-facing edge. Around 2,600 distinctive East German concrete \\"barber pole\\" (Grenzs√§ule or Grenzpf√§hle) markers were installed just behind the border line at intervals of about . A metal coat of arms of East Germany (Staatsemblem) was fixed to the side of the marker facing West Germany.Rottman (2008), p. 20. On the West German side, there were no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with messages such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! (\\"Danger! Zonal border!\\") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze (\\"Stop! Zonal border here\\") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of the distance to the border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free to go up to the border line, and there were no physical obstacles to stop their crossing it. East Germany's sea border The inner German border system also extended along the Baltic coast, dubbed the \\"blue border\\" or sea border of the GDR. The coastline was partly fortified along the east side mouth of the river Trave opposite the West German port of Travem√ºnde. Watchtowers, walls and fences stood along the marshy shoreline to deter escape attempts and the water was patrolled by high-speed East German boats. The continuous line of the inner German border ended at the peninsula of Priwall, still belonging to Travem√ºnde, but already on the east side of the Trave. From there to Boltenhagen, along some of the eastern shore of the Bay of Mecklenburg, the GDR shoreline was part of the restricted-access \\"protective strip\\" or Schutzgebiet. Security controls were imposed on the rest of the coast from Boltenhagen to Altwarp on the Polish border, including the whole of the islands of Poel, R√ºgen, Hiddensee, and Usedom as well as the peninsulas of Dar√ü and Wustrow. The GDR implemented a variety of security measures along its Baltic coastline to hinder escape attempts. Camping and access to boats was severely limited and 27 watchtowers were built along the Baltic coastline. If a suspected escape attempt was spotted, high-speed patrol boats would be dispatched to intercept the fugitives. Armed patrols equipped with powerful mobile searchlights monitored the beaches. Escapees aimed for the western (West German) shore of the Bay of Mecklenburg, a Danish lightship off the port of Gedser, the southern Danish islands of Lolland and Falster, or simply the international shipping lanes in the hope of being picked up by a passing freighter. The Baltic Sea was, however, an extremely dangerous escape route. In all, 189 people are estimated to have died attempting to flee via the Baltic.Dennis (2000), p. 100. Some East Germans tried to escape by jumping overboard from East German ships docked in Baltic harbours. So many East Germans attempted to flee this way in Danish ports that harbourmasters installed extra life-saving equipment on quaysides where East German vessels docked. The GDR's government responded by stationing armed Transportpolizei (Trapos) on passenger ships to deal forcefully with escape attempts. On one occasion in August 1961, the Trapos caused an international incident in the Danish port of Gedser, when they beat up a would-be escapee on the quayside and opened fire, hitting a Danish boat in the harbour. The next day, thousands of Danes turned out to protest against \\"Vopo (Volkspolizei) methods\\". The \\"boat-jumpers\\" were eventually stopped by further restricting the already limited travel rights of the GDR's population.Shears (1970), pp. 49‚Äì50. River borders The border also ran along part of the length of three major rivers of central Germany: the Elbe between Lauenburg and Schnackenburg (around ), the Werra and the Saale. The river borders were especially problematic; although the Western Allies and West Germany held that the demarcation line ran along the eastern bank, the East Germans and Soviets insisted that it was located in the middle of the river (the Thalweg principle). In practice, the waterways were shared equally but the navigation channels often strayed across the line. This led to tense confrontations as East or West German vessels sought to assert their right to free passage on the waterways.Cramer (2008), p. 52. The rivers were as heavily guarded as other parts of the border. On the Elbe, East Germany maintained a fleet of about 30 fast patrol boats and West Germany had some 16 customs vessels. The river border was closely watched for escapees, many of whom drowned attempting to cross.Shears (1970), pp. 90‚Äì91 Numerous bridges blown up in the closing days of the Second World War remained in ruins, while other surviving bridges were blocked or demolished on the East German side.Shears (1970), p. 173 There were no ferry crossings and river barges were rigorously inspected by the GDR border guards.Shears (1970), p. 138 To prevent escape attempts, the East German river banks were barricaded with a continuous line of metal fences and concrete walls. At one location, R√ºterberg on the Elbe, the border fortifications completely surrounded the village and sealed off the inhabitants from the rest of East Germany as well as the West.Cramer (2008), p. 51. Border guards of the inner German border The guards of the inner German border comprised tens of thousands of military, paramilitary and civilian personnel from both East and West Germany, as well as from the United Kingdom, the United States and initially the Soviet Union. =East Germany= Following the end of the Second World War, the East German side of the border was guarded initially by the Border Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by a locally recruited paramilitary force, the German Border Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control of the border to the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed Border Troops of the GDR (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's Border Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000 personnel.Rottman (2008), p. 42. Around half of the Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower proportion than in other branches of the East German armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany. They were all subjected to close scrutiny to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.Rottman (2008), p. 43. A special unit of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out potential defectors.Kellerhoff; Banse (2007-08-11). One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men were said to have been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.Rottman (2008), p. 48. The Grenztruppen were closely watched to ensure that they could not take advantage of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years,BBC (2001-08-07). and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt. The work of the guards involved carrying out repair work on the defences, monitoring the zone from watchtowers and bunkers and patrolling the line several times a day. Border Reconnaissance (Grenzaufkl√§rungszug or GAK) soldiers, an elite reconnaissance force, carried out patrols and intelligence-gathering on the western side of the fence. Western visitors to the border were routinely photographed by the GAKs, who also oversaw work detachments maintaining the fence. The workers would be covered by machine guns to discourage them from attempting to escape.Rottman (2008), pp. 52‚Äì53. =West Germany= West German Bundesgrenzschutz personnel, civilians and an East German border guard on opposite sides of the border line at Herrnburg near L√ºbeck A number of West German state organisations were responsible for policing the western side of the border. These included the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS, Federal Border Protection), the Bayerische Grenzpolizei (Bavarian Border Police) and the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration). West German Army units were not allowed to approach the border without being accompanied by BGS personnel. The BGS, established in 1951, was responsible for policing a zone deep along the border.Moncourt; Smith (2009), p. 22. Its 20,000 personnel were equipped with armoured cars, anti-tank guns, helicopters, trucks and jeeps. The BGS had limited police powers within its zone of operations to tackle threats to the peace of the border.Shears (1970), pp. 96‚Äì97. Until 1972 in addition to volunteers, conscripts could be drafted for the Compulsory Border Guard Service. The Bundeszollverwaltung (BZV) was responsible for policing much of the inner German border and manning the West German crossings. Its personnel lived with their families in communities along the border and carried out regular policing tasks in a zone about deep along the border. They had the power to arrest and search suspects in their area of operations with the exception of the section of border in Bavaria.Shears (1970), pp. 90‚Äì92. The BZV's remit overlapped significantly with that of the BGS, which led to a degree of feuding between the two agencies. The Bayerische Grenzpolizei (BGP) was a border police force raised by the Bavarian government to carry out policing duties along the inner German border's in Bavaria. By the late 1960s, the BGP had 600 men patrolling its sector of the border, alongside the BZV, BGS and US Army. Its duties were very similar to those of the BZV, leading to turf wars between the two agencies.Shears (1970), pp. 94‚Äì95. =Western Allies= The British Army conducted only relatively infrequent patrols along its sector of the inner German border, principally for training purposes and symbolic value. By the 1970s, it was carrying out only one patrol a month, only rarely using helicopters or ground surveillance radar and erecting no permanent observation posts. The British border zone was divided into two sectors covering a total distance of about along the border.Stacy (1984), pp. 263‚Äì64. Unlike the Americans, the British did not assign specific units to border duty, but rotated the task between the divisions of the British Army of the Rhine.Shears (1970), p. 100. The border was also patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service, the smallest of the Western border surveillance organisations. Its personnel served as a liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border.Stacy (1984), pp. 261‚Äì63. The BFS was disbanded in 1991 following Germany's reunification.\\"Grenzbewacher West\\". Zonengrenze-Museum, Helmstedt The United States Army maintained a substantial and continuous military presence at the inner German border throughout the entire period from 1945 to after the end of the Cold War. Regular American soldiers manned the border from the end of the war until they were replaced in 1946 by the United States Constabulary,Stacy (1984), p. 22. which was disbanded in 1952 after policing duties were transferred to the German authorities. It was replaced by three dedicated armoured cavalry regiments assigned to provide a permanent defence.Stacy (1984), pp. 62‚Äì63. The 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Bamberg, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Nuremberg and the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment based at Fulda ‚Äì later replaced by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment ‚Äì monitored the border using observation posts, ground and air patrols, countering intrusions and gathering intelligence on Warsaw Pact activities.Shears (1970), pp. 88, 98‚Äì99. =Cross-border contacts= There was little informal contact between the two sides; East German guards were under orders not to speak to Westerners.Bailey (1983), p. 61. After the initiation of d√©tente between East and West Germany in the 1970s, the two sides established procedures for maintaining formal contacts through 14 direct telephone connections or Grenzinformationspunkte (GIP, \\"border information points\\"). They were used to resolve local problems affecting the border, such as floods, forest fires or stray animals.Bailey (1983), p. 48. For many years, the two sides waged a propaganda battle across the border using propaganda signs and canisters of leaflets fired or dropped into each other's territory.Gordon (1988), p. passim. West German leaflets sought to undermine the willingness of East German guards to shoot at refugees attempting to cross the border, while East German leaflets promoted the GDR's view of West Germany as a militaristic regime intent on restoring Germany's 1937 borders.Shears (1970), pp. 164‚Äì65. During the 1950s, West Germany sent millions of propaganda leaflets into East Germany each year. In 1968 alone, over 4,000 projectiles containing some 450,000 leaflets were fired from East Germany into the West. Another 600 waterproof East German leaflet containers were recovered from cross-border rivers. The \\"leaflet war\\" was eventually ended by mutual agreement in the early 1970s as part of the normalisation of relations between the two German states. Crossing the inner German border Gesetz √ºber die Staatsgrenze der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (Law on the State Border of the GDR) (25 March 1982) West German trains ran through East Germany. This 1977 view shows how barriers were made near the tracks to keep people away. The inner German border was never entirely sealed in the fashion of the border between the two Koreas and could be crossed in either direction throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air ‚Äì the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin. The border could be crossed legally only through a limited number of air, road, rail and river routes. Foreigners were able to cross East German territory to or from West Berlin, Denmark, Sweden, Poland and Czechoslovakia. However, they had only limited and very tightly controlled access to the rest of East Germany and faced numerous restrictions on travel, accommodation and expenditure.Fowle (1981-02-08). Lengthy inspections caused long delays to traffic at the crossing points.Shears (1970), pp. 131‚Äì39, 141. Westerners found crossing the inner German border to be a somewhat disturbing experience; Jan Morris wrote: =Crossing points= Before 1952, the inner German border could be crossed at almost any point along its length. The fortification of the border resulted in the severing of 32 railway lines, three autobahns, 31 main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks.Shears (1970), p. 18. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.Rottman (2008), p. 40. The situation improved somewhat after the initiation of d√©tente in the 1970s. Additional crossings for so-called kleine Grenzverkehr ‚Äì \\"small border traffic\\", essentially meaning West German day trippers ‚Äì were opened at various locations along the border. By 1982, there were 19 border crossings: six roads, three autobahns, eight railway lines plus the Elbe river and the Mittellandkanal. The largest was at Helmstedt-Marienborn on the Hanover‚ÄìBerlin autobahn (A 2), through which 34.6 million travellers passed between 1985‚Äì89.Cramer (2008), p. 94. Codenamed Checkpoint Alpha, this was the first of three Allied checkpoints on the road to Berlin.Maguire (2009-10-20). The others were Checkpoint Bravo, where the autobahn crossed from East Germany into West Berlin, and most famous of all, Checkpoint Charlie, the only place where non-Germans could cross from West to East Berlin.The Sunday Telegraph (2004-05-30). It was not possible to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them.\\"Flucht und Ausreise\\". Gedenkst√§tte Deutsche Teilung Marienborn (Memorial to the division of Germany in Marienborn). Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead.Outline map. Gedenkst√§tte Deutsche Teilung Marienborn (Memorial to the division of Germany in Marienborn). Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28 years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.Cowell (1996-09-12). =Border crossing regulations= West Germans were able to cross the border relatively freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age.Shears (1970), p. 15. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.\\"The formalities to be carried out by citizens of the GDR wishing to enter the Federal Republic.\\" Grenzmuseum Eichsfeld (Border Museum Eichsfeld). The odds were against successful applications, and only approximately 40,000 a year were approved. Refusal was often arbitrary, dependent on the goodwill of local officials.Childs (2001), p. 29. Members of the Party elite and cultural ambassadors were frequently given permission to travel, as were essential transport workers. However, they were not permitted to take their families with them.Bailey (1983), p. 32. Until the late 1980s, ordinary East Germans were only permitted to travel to the West on \\"urgent family business\\", such as the marriage, serious illness or death of a close relative. In February 1986, the regime relaxed the definition of \\"urgent family business\\", which prompted a massive increase in the number of East German citizens able to travel to the West.McCartney (1988-04-16). The relaxation of the restrictions was reported to have been motivated by a desire on the part of the East German leadership to reduce their citizens' desire to travel and shrink the number applying to emigrate. In practice, however, it had exactly the opposite effect. =Emigrating from East Germany= Crossing the border by rail at Oebisfelde railway station, April 1990 There was no formal legal basis under which a citizen could emigrate from East Germany. In 1975, however, East Germany signed up to the Helsinki Accords, a pan-European treaty to improve relations between the countries of Europe.McAdams (1985), p. 148. An increasing number of East German citizens sought to use the Accords' provision on freedom of movement to secure exit visas. By the late 1980s, over 100,000 applications for visas were being submitted annually with around 15,000‚Äì25,000 being granted.Dale (2005), p. 87.Hertle (2007), p. 124. The GDR's government nonetheless remained opposed to emigration and sought to dissuade would-be √©migr√©s. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism.Dale (2005), pp. 87‚Äì88. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody on the grounds that they were unfit to bring up children.Childs (2001), p. 44. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000 applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.Hertle (2007), pp. 123‚Äì24. A report for the Central Committee's security section noted: \\"The emigration problem is confronting us with a fundamental problem of the GDR's development. Experience shows that the current repertoire of solutions (improved travel possibilities, expatriation of applicants, etc.) have not brought the desired results, but rather the opposite.\\" The agitation for emigration, the report concluded, \\"threatens to undermine beliefs in the correctness of the Party's policies.\\"Dale (2005), p. 89. =Ransoms and \\"humanitarian releases\\"= East German citizens could also emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German government in a process termed Freikauf (literally the buying of freedom).Buckley (2004), p. 104 Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755 political prisoners were ransomed. A further 2,087 prisoners were released to the West under an amnesty in 1972. Another 215,000 people, including 2,000 children cut off from their parents, were allowed to leave East Germany to rejoin their families. In exchange, West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM ‚Äì nearly $2.3 billion at 1990 prices ‚Äì in goods and hard currency.Hertle (2007), p. 117. Those ransomed were valued on a sliding scale, ranging from around 1,875 DM for a manual worker to around 11,250 DM for a doctor. The justification, according to East Germany, was that this was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000 DM worth of goods.Buschschluter (1981-10-11). The scheme was highly controversial in the West. Freikauf was denounced by many as human trafficking, but was defended by others as an \\"act of pure humanitarianism\\";Shackley; Finney (2005), pp. 100‚Äì01. the West German government budgeted money for Freikauf under the euphemistic heading of \\"support of special aid measures of an all-German character.\\" Escape attempts and victims of the inner German border =Refugee flows and escape attempts= Diagram summarising the numbers of people who succeeded in passing each element of the inner German border system, 1974‚Äì79 Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans migrated to the West; 3.454 million left between 1950 and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority of the total number of emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.Jarausch (1994), p. 17. The vast majority of refugees were motivated by economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of collectivisation and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges in the number of escape attempts.\\"The number of escapees\\". Grenzmuseum Eichsfeld (Border Museum Eichsfeld). Attempts to flee across the border were carefully studied and recorded by the GDR authorities to identify possible weak points. These were addressed by strengthening the fortifications in vulnerable areas. At the end of the 1970s, a study was carried out by the East German army to review attempted \\"border breaches\\" (Grenzdurchbr√ºche). It found that 4,956 people had attempted to escape across the border between 1 December 1974 and 30 November 1979. Of those, 3,984 people (80.4%) were arrested by the Volkspolizei in the Sperrzone, the outer restricted zone. 205 people (4.1%) were caught at the signal fence.Ritter; Lapp (2007), p. 72. Within the inner security zone, the Schutzstreifen, a further 743 people (15%) were arrested by the guards. 48 people (1%) were stopped ‚Äì i.e. killed or injured ‚Äì by landmines and 43 people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the fence. A further 67 people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229 people ‚Äì just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty ‚Äì made it across the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89 people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12 people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s booby-trap mines on the fences. Escape attempts were severely punished by the GDR. From 1953, the regime described the act of escaping as Republikflucht (literally \\"flight from the Republic\\"), by analogy with the existing military term Fahnenflucht (\\"desertion\\"). A successful escapee was not a Fl√ºchtling (\\"refugee\\") but a Republikfl√ºchtiger (\\"Republic deserter\\"). Those who attempted to escape were called Sperrbrecher (literally \\"blockade runners\\" but more loosely translated as \\"border violators\\"). Those who helped escapees were not Fluchthelfer (\\"escape helpers\\"), the Western term, but Menschenh√§ndler (\\"human traffickers\\").Detjen (2006), p. 113. Such ideologically coloured language enabled the regime to portray border crossers as little better than traitors and criminals.Nothnagle (1990), p. 31. Republikflucht became a crime in 1957, punishable by heavy fines and up to three years' imprisonment. Any act associated with an escape attempt ‚Äì including helping an escapee ‚Äì was subject to this legislation. Those caught in the act were often tried for espionage as well and given proportionately harsher sentences.Stokes (2000), p. 45. More than 75,000 people ‚Äì an average of more than seven people a day ‚Äì were imprisoned for attempting to escape across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. Border guards who attempted to escape were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.Hooper (2001-08-07). =Escape methods= Escapees used a variety of methods. The great majority crossed on foot, though some took more unusual routes. One of the most spectacular was the balloon escape in September 1979 of eight people from two families in a home-made hot-air balloon. Their flight involved an ascent to more than before landing near the West German town of Naila.The Prescott Courier (1979-09-17). The incident inspired the film Night Crossing. Other escapees relied more on physical strength and endurance. An escapee on August 26, 1987 used meat hooks to scale the fences,Sunday Star-News (1987-08-28). while in 1971 a doctor swam across the Baltic Sea from Rostock almost to the Danish island of Lolland, before he was picked up by a West German yacht.United Press International (UPI) (1971-08-04). Another escapee used an air mattress to escape across the Baltic on September 2, 1987.The Associated Press (1987-09-03). Mass escapes were rare. One of the few that succeeded took place on 2 October 1961, when 53 people from the border village of B√∂seckendorf ‚Äì a quarter of the village's population ‚Äì escaped en masse, followed by another 13 inhabitants in February 1963.Cramer (2008), pp. 122‚Äì23. An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14 East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being transported to the West.The Times (1964-09-11). The traffic was not one-way; thousands of people migrated each year from West Germany to the east, motivated by reasons such as marital problems, family estrangement and homesickness.The Associated Press (1963-07-07). A number of Allied military personnel, including British, French, German and American troops, also defected.The Times (1959-07-11). By the end of the Cold War, as many as 300 United States citizens were thought to have defected across the Iron Curtain for a variety of reasonsWalmer (1990-02-14). ‚Äì whether to escape criminal charges, for political reasons or because (as the St. Petersburg Times put it) \\"girl-hungry GIs [were tempted] with seductive sirens, who usually desert the love-lorn soldier once he is across the border\\". The fate of such defectors varied considerably. Some were sent straight to labour camps on charges of espionage. Others committed suicide, while a few were able to find wives and work on the eastern side of the border.Anderson (1964-06-14). =Order to fire= From 1945 onwards, unauthorised crossers of the inner German border risked being shot by Soviet or East German guards. The use of deadly force was termed the Schie√übefehl (\\"order to fire\\" or \\"command to shoot\\"). It was formally in force as early as 1948, when regulations concerning the use of firearms on the border were promulgated. A regulation issued to East German police on 27 May 1952 stipulated that \\"failure to obey the orders of the Border Patrol will be met by the use of arms\\". From the 1960s through to the end of the 1980s, the border guards were given daily verbal orders (Vergatterung) to \\"track down, arrest or annihilate violators\\". The GDR formally codified its regulations on the use of deadly force in March 1982, when the State Border Law mandated that firearms were to be used as the \\"maximum measure in the use of force\\" against individuals who \\"publicly attempt to break through the state border\\".\\"The Use of Firearms at the Border\\". Grenzmuseum Eichsfeld (Border Museum Eichsfeld). The GDR's leadership explicitly endorsed the use of deadly force. General Heinz Hoffmann, the GDR defence minister, declared in August 1966 that \\"anyone who does not respect our border will feel the bullet\\". In 1974, Erich Honecker, as Chairman of the GDR's National Defence Council, ordered: \\"Firearms are to be ruthlessly used in the event of attempts to break through the border, and the comrades who have successfully used their firearms are to be commended.\\"Hertle (2007), pp. 100‚Äì01. The Schie√übefehl was, not surprisingly, very controversial in the West and was singled out for criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schie√übefehl on occasions when it would have been politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.Shears (1970), p. 84. =Deaths on the border= It is still not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such information as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100 people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.Deutsche Welle (2005-08-09). There were many ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A substantial number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13 October 1961, Westf√§lische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border near the village of Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany.Cramer (2008), p. 82. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.Bild 175-P05-00002-0001 [Picture 175-P05-00002-0001] Bundesarchiv (Germany) . Last accessed: 26 October 2009. An Italian truck driver and member of the Italian Communist Party, Benito Corghi, was shot at a crossing point in August 1976; the GDR government was severely embarrassed and, unusually, offered an apology.The New York Times (1976-08-07). In one notorious shooting on 1 May 1976, a former East German political prisoner, Michael Gartenschl√§ger, who had fled to the West some years before, was ambushed and killed by a Stasi commando squad on the border near B√ºchen. The Stasi reported that he had been \\"liquidated by security forces of the GDR\\".Mielke (2002-05-06). Twenty-five East German border guards died after being shot from the Western side of the border or were killed by resisting escapees or (often accidentally) by their own colleagues.Baker (2004), p. 29. The East German government described them as \\"victims of armed assaults and imperialist provocations against the state border of the GDR\\"Neues Deutschland (1989-08-13/14), p. 9. and alleged that \\"bandits\\" in the West took potshots at guards doing their duty ‚Äì a version of events that was uncorroborated by Western accounts of border incidents. The two sides commemorated their dead in very different ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were set up on the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschl√§ger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Gro√üe in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border.Th√ºringen Journal (2009-09-18) After the policy of d√©tente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased. The taboo in East Germany surrounding escapees meant that the great majority of deaths went unpublicised and uncommemorated. However, the deaths of border guards were used for GDR propaganda, which portrayed them as \\"martyrs\\". Four stone memorials were erected in East Berlin to mark their deaths.Ladd (1998), p. 25. The regime named schools, barracks and other public facilities after the dead guards and used their memorials as places of pilgrimage to signify that (as a slogan put it) \\"their deaths are our commitment\\" to maintaining the border. After 1989 the memorials were vandalised, neglected and ultimately removed.Ladd (2004), p. 107. Fall of the inner German border A demonstration in Plauen on 30 October 1989 calling for democracy, freedom of the press and freedom to travel The fall of the inner German border came rapidly and unexpectedly in November 1989, along with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Its integrity had been fatally compromised in May 1989 when the Hungarian government began dismantling its border fence with Austria. The government was still notionally Communist but planned free elections and economic reform as part of a strategy of \\"rejoining Europe\\" and reforming its struggling economy.Meyer (2009), p. 114. Opening the Hungarian border with Austria was essential to this effort. Hungary was at that time a popular tourist destination for East Germans;Meyer (2009), p. 68. West Germany had secretly offered a much-needed hard currency loan of DM 500 million ($250 million) in return for allowing citizens of the GDR to freely emigrate.Meyer (2009), p. 105. Pictures of the barbed-wire fences being taken down were transmitted into East Germany by West German television stations.Meyer (2009), p. 90. This prompted a mass exodus by hundreds of thousands of East Germans, which began in earnest in September 1989. In addition to those crossing the Hungarian border, tens of thousands of East Germans scaled the walls of the West German embassies in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, where they were regarded as \\"German citizens\\" by the federal government, claiming \\"asylum\\".Childs (2001), p. 67. Czechoslovakia's hardline communist government agreed to close its border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East GermanyChilds (2001), p. 68. and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw them out of the windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500 East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.Sebasteyen (2009), pp. 329‚Äì31. The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into crowds of hundreds of thousands of people in cities across East Germany. The East German leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention.Childs (2001), p. 75. Reformist members of the East German Politb√ºro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.Childs (2001), pp. 82‚Äì83. The new government sought to appease the protesters by reopening the border with Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8 November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing across the country, the entire Politb√ºro resigned and a new, more moderate Politb√ºro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.Childs (2001), p. 85. =Opening of the border and the fall of the GDR= The East German government sought to defuse the situation by relaxing the country's border controls with effect from 10 November 1989;Hertle (2007), p. 147. the announcement was made on the evening of 9 November 1989 by Politb√ºro member G√ºnter Schabowski at a somewhat chaotic press conference in East Berlin, who proclaimed the new control regime as liberating the people from a situation of psychological pressure by legalising and simplifying migration. Misunderstanding the note passed to him about the decision to open the border, he announced the border would be opened \\"immediately, without delay\\", rather than from the following day as the government had intended. Crucially, it was neither meant to be an uncontrolled opening nor to apply to East Germans wishing to visit the West as tourists. At an interview in English after the press conference, Schabowski told the NBC reporter Tom Brokaw that \\"it is no question of tourism. It is a permission of leaving the GDR [permanently].\\"Childs (2001), p. 87. As the press conference had been broadcast live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed ‚Äì people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes ‚Äì were broadcast worldwide.Childs (2001), p. 88. While the eyes of the world were on the Mauerfall (the fall of the Wall) in Berlin, a simultaneous process of Grenz√∂ffnung (border opening) was taking place along the entire length of the inner German border. Existing crossings were opened immediately. Within the first four days, 4.3 million East Germans ‚Äì a quarter of the country's entire population ‚Äì poured into West Germany.Childs (2001), p. 89. At the Helmstedt crossing point on the Berlin‚ÄìHanover autobahn, cars were backed up for ; some drivers waited 11 hours to cross to the West.Jacoby (1989-11-08). The border was opened in stages over the next few months. Many new crossing points were created, reconnecting communities that had been separated for nearly 40 years. BBC correspondent Ben Bradshaw described the jubilant scenes at the railway station of Hof in Bavaria in the early hours of 12 November: Even the East German border guards were not immune to the euphoria. One of them, Peter Zahn, described how he and his colleagues reacted to the opening of the border: Zonen-Gaby's first banana: West German magazine cover satirising East Germans' banana-buying spree To the surprise of many West Germans, many of the East German visitors spent their DM 100 \\"welcome money\\" buying great quantities of bananas, a highly prized rarity in the East. For months after the opening of the border, bananas were sold out at supermarkets along the western side of the border as East Germans bought up whole crates, believing supplies would soon be exhausted.Adam (2005), p. 114. The rush for fruit made the banana the unofficial symbol of the changes in East Germany, which some dubbed the \\"banana revolution\\".Rodden (2002), p. 5 Some West German leftists protested at what they saw as rampant consumerism by tossing bananas at East Germans coming to visit the West.James (1992), p. 10 The easterners' obsession with bananas was famously spoofed by the West German satirical magazine Titanic on the front cover of its November 1989 edition, which depicted \\"Easterner Gaby (17), happy to be in West Germany: My first banana\\". Gaby was shown holding a large peeled cucumber.Fr√∂hling (2007), p. 183. The opening of the border had a profound political and psychological effect on the East German public. For many people, the very existence of the GDR, which the SED had justified as the first \\"Socialist state on German soil\\", came to be seen as pointless. The state was bankrupt, the economy was collapsing, the political class was discredited, the governing institutions were in chaos and the people were demoralised by the evaporation of the collective assumptions that had underpinned their society for 40 years. Membership of the Party collapsed and Krenz himself resigned on 6 December 1989 after only 50 days in office, handing over to the moderate Hans Modrow.Childs (2001), p. 90. The removal of restrictions on travel prompted hundreds of thousands of East Germans to migrate to the West ‚Äì more than 116,000 did so between 9 November and 31 December 1989, compared with 40,000 for the whole of the previous year.Childs (2001), p. 100. The new East German leadership initiated \\"round table\\" talks with opposition groups, similar to the processes that had led to multi-party elections in Hungary and Poland.Childs (2001), p. 105. When the first free elections were held in East Germany in March 1990, the former SED, which had renamed itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism, was swept from power and replaced by a pro-reunification Alliance for Germany coalition led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Chancellor Kohl's party. Both countries progressed rapidly towards reunification, while international diplomacy paved the way abroad. In July 1990, monetary union was achieved.Childs (2001), p. 140. A Treaty on the establishment of a unified Germany was agreed on in August 1990 and political reunification took place on 3 October 1990.Rottman (2008), p. 58. =Abandonment of the border= The abandoned border in Thuringia, December 1990 The border fortifications were progressively torn down and eventually abandoned in the months following its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports.Jackson (1990-02-12). The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; half were dismissed within five months of the opening.Koenig (1990-04-22). On 1 July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished; all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs. The Bundeswehr gave the remaining border guards and other ex-NVA soldiers the task of clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale of the task was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines.Rottman (2008), p. 61. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4 million mines laid by the GDR were supposed to have been removed during the 1980s, it turned out that 34,000 were unaccounted for.Freytag (1996), p. 230. A further 1,100 mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM 250 million,The Week in Germany (1996-05-13), p. 13. in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.Thorson (1995-11-11). The border clearers' task was aided unofficially by German civilians from both sides of the former border, who scavenged the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line. Border area today Very little remains of the installations along the former inner German border. At least 30 public, private and municipal museums along the old line present displays of equipment and other artifacts relating to the border. Among the preserved sites are several dozen watchtowers, short stretches of the fence and associated installations (some of which have been reconstructed), sections of the wall still in situ at H√∂tensleben and M√∂dlareuth, and a number of buildings related to the border, such as the GDR crossing point at Marienborn.Ritter; Lapp (2007), p. 179. Substantial sections of the Kolonnenweg remain in place to serve as farm and forestry access roads, though the accompanying anti-vehicle ditches, fences and other obstacles have been almost entirely removed. Artworks, commemorative stones, memorials and signs have been erected at many points along the former border to mark its opening, to remember its victims and to record the division and reunification of Germany. The closure of the border region for nearly 40 years created a haven for wildlife in some places. Although parts of the East German side of the border were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development. In December 1989, only a month after the opening of the border, conservationists from East and West Germany met to work out a plan to establish a \\"German Green Belt\\" (Gr√ºnes Band Deutschland) stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Czech border.Paterson (2009-05-17). The Bundestag voted unanimously in December 2004 to extend federal protection to the Green Belt and incorporate it into a \\"European Green Belt\\" being developed along the entire length of the former Iron Curtain. The German Green Belt now links 160 natural parks, 150 flora-and-fauna areas, three UNESCO biosphere reservations and the Harz Mountains National Park.Cramer (2008), p. 9. It is home to a wide variety of species that are rare elsewhere in Germany, including the wild cat, black stork, otter and rare mosses and orchids. Most of Germany's red kites ‚Äì more than half of the 25,000 that live in Europe ‚Äì live along the former border. The Bund Naturschutz, one of Germany's largest conservation groups, is campaigning to extend the area within the Green Belt designated as nature conservation zones.Hall (2008-05-19).

The name comes from the green hue imparted by the colour of the metamorphic minerals within the mafic rocks: the typical green minerals are chlorite, actinolite, and other green amphiboles. A greenstone belt is typically several dozens to several thousand kilometres long and although composed of a great variety of individual rock units, is considered a 'stratigraphic grouping' in its own right, at least on continental scales. Typically, a greenstone belt within the greater volume of otherwise homogeneous granite-gneiss within a craton contains a significantly larger degree of heterogeneity and complications and forms a tectonic marker far more distinct than the much more voluminous and homogeneous granites. Additionally, a greenstone belt contains far more information on tectonic and metamorphic events, deformations and paleogeologic conditions than the granite and gneiss events, because the vast majority of greenstones are interpreted as altered basalts and other volcanic or sedimentary rocks. As such, understanding the nature and origin of greenstone belts is the most fruitful way of studying Archaean geological history.  Nature and formation  Greenstone belts have been interpreted as having formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and island arc terranes. Greenstone belts are primarily formed of volcanic rocks, dominated by basalt, with minor sedimentary rocks inter-leaving the volcanic formations. Through time, the degree of sediment contained within greenstone belts has risen, and the amount of ultramafic rock (either as layered intrusions or as volcanic komatiite) has decreased. There is also a change in the structure and relationship of greenstone belts to their basements between the Archaean where there is little clear relationship, if any, between basalt-peridotite sheets of a greenstone belt and the granites they abut, and the Proterozoic where greenstone belts sit upon granite-gneiss basements and/or other greenstone belts, and the Phanerozoic where clear examples of island arc volcanism, arc sedimentation and ophiolite sequences become more dominant. This change in nature is interpreted as a response to the maturity of the plate tectonics processes throughout the Earth's geological history. Archaean plate tectonics did not take place on mature crust and as such the presence of thrust-in allochthonous greenstone belts is expected. By the Proterozoic, magmatism was occurring around cratons and with established sedimentary sources, with little recycling of the crust, allowing preservation of more sediments. By the Phanerozoic, extensive continental cover and lower heat flow from the mantle has seen greater preservation of sediments and greater influence of continental masses. Greenstones, aside from containing basalts, also give rise to several types of metamorphic rocks which are used synonymously with 'metabasalt' et cetera; greenschist, whiteschist and blueschist are all terms spawned from the study of greenstone belts. The West African early Proterozoic greenstone belts are similar to the Archean greenstone belts. These similarities include a decrease in the amount of ultramafic and mafic rocks as you move up the stratigraphic column, in addition to an increase in pyroclastics, felsic and/or andesite rocks. Also, the rock successions tend to have clastics in the upper portion and tholeiitic suites in the lower. Calc-alkaline dikes are common in these suites.  Distribution  Weathered Precambrian pillow lava in the Temagami Greenstone Belt of the Canadian Shield Archaean greenstones are found in the Slave craton, northern Canada, Pilbara craton and Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, Gawler Craton in South Australia, and in the Wyoming Craton in the US. Examples are found in South and Eastern Africa, namely the Kaapvaal craton and also in the cratonic core of Madagascar, as well as West Africa and Brazil, northern Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula (see Baltic Shield). Proterozoic greenstones occur sandwiched between the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons in Australia, and adjoining the Gawler Craton and within the extensive Proterozoic mobile belts of Australia, within West Africa, throughout the metamorphic complexes surrounding the Archaean core of Madagascar; the eastern United States, northern Canada and northern Scandinavia. The Abitibi greenstone belt in Ontario and Quebec is one of the largest Archean greenstone belts in the world. In Antarctica, the Fisher Massif, of Proterozoic age, closely resembles the composition and structure of a greenstone belt. Greenstone belts often contain ore deposits of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead. One of the best known greenstone belts in the world is the South African Barberton greenstone belt, where gold was first discovered in South Africa. The Barberton Greenstone belt was first uniquely identified by Prof Annhauser at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. His work in mapping and detailing the characteristics of the Barberton Greenstone belt has been used as a primer for other greenstone belts around the world. He noted the existence of pillow lavas, indicating a lava being rapidly cooled in water, as well as the spinifex textures created by crystals formed under rapidly cooling environments, namely water.

Notes from Underground (pre- reform Russian: ; post-reform Russian: ; also translated as Notes from the Underground or Letters from the Underworld) is an 1864 novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and is considered by many to be one of the first existentialist novels. It presents itself as an excerpt from the rambling memoirs of a bitter, isolated, unnamed narrator (generally referred to by critics as the Underground Man), who is a retired civil servant living in St. Petersburg. The first part of the story is told in monologue form through the Underground Man's diary, and attacks contemporary Russian philosophy, especially Nikolay Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?.Bird, Robert. \\"Introduction: Dostoevsky's Wager.\\" Pp. vii‚Äìxxiv in Notes from Underground, translated by B. Yakim. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans. p. x: \\"The views that brought Chernyshevsky to this vision were close to utilitarianism, meaning that actions should be judged in terms of their expediency. Naturally, utilitarians assumed that we can know the standard against which expediency can be measured: usually it was economic well-being. In Chernyshevsky's rational egotism [sic], utlitarianism as a method coincided with socialism as a goal: in essence, it is in everyone's individual self-interest that the whole of society flourish.\\" The second part of the book is called \\"Apropos of the Wet Snow\\" and describes certain events that appear to be destroying and sometimes renewing the underground man, who acts as a first person, unreliable narrator and anti- hero. Plot summary The novel is divided into two parts. =Part 1: \\"Underground\\"= Serving as an introduction into the mind of the narrator, the first part of Notes from Underground is split into nine chapters: * The introduction propounds a number of riddles whose meanings are further developed as the narration continues. * Chapters 2, 3, & 4 deal with suffering and the irrational pleasure of suffering. * Chapters 5 & 6 discuss the moral and intellectual fluctuation that the narrator feels along with his conscious insecurities regarding \\"inertia\\"‚Äîinaction. * Chapters 7, 8, & 9 cover theories of reason and logic, closing with the last two chapters as a summary and transition into Part 2. The narrator observes that utopian society removes suffering and pain, but man desires both things and needs them to be happy. He argues that removing pain and suffering in society takes away a man's freedom. He says that the cruelty of society makes human beings moan about pain only to spread their suffering to others. Unlike most people, who typically act out of revenge because they believe justice is the end, the Underground Man is conscious of his problems and feels the desire for revenge, but he does not find it virtuous; the incongruity leads to spite towards the act itself with its concomitant circumstances. He feels that others like him exist, but he continuously concentrates on his spitefulness instead of on actions that would help him avoid the problems that torment him. The main issue for the Underground Man is that he has reached a point of ennuiNotes from Underground, ch. 5: \\"and it was all from ennui, gentlemen, all from ennui ; inertia overcame me.\\" and inactivity.Chief among them is the Underground Man, who confesses to his own inertia (inercija), defined as \\"conscious-sitting-with- arms-folded\\" and also criticises his supposed antitheses, men of action and men of nature and truth for their active, machine-like existence. Knapp, Liza. 1985. \\"The Force of Inertia In Dostoevsky's Krotkaja.\\" Dostoevsky Studies 6:143‚Äì56. ‚Äì via University of Toronto. Archived from the original on 2013-11-01. He even admits that he would rather be inactive out of laziness. The first part also gives a harsh criticism of determinism, as well as of intellectual attempts at dictating human action and behavior by logic, which the Underground Man discusses in terms of the simple math problem: two times two makes four (cf. necessitarianism). He argues that despite humanity's attempt to create the \\"Crystal Palace,\\" a reference to a famous symbol of utopianism in Nikolai Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?, one cannot avoid the simple fact that anyone, at any time, can decide to act in a way that might not be considered to be in their own self-interest; some will do so simply to validate their existence and to protest and confirm that they exist as individuals. The Underground Man ridicules the type of enlightened self- interest that Chernyshevsky proposes as the foundation of Utopian society. The idea of cultural and legislative systems relying on this rational egoism is what the protagonist despises. The Underground Man embraces this ideal in praxis, and seems to blame it for his current state of unhappiness. =Part 2: \\"Apropos of the Wet Snow\\"= The second part of the story consists of three main segments that lead to a furthering of the Underground Man's consciousness.  First segment  The first segment is the Underground Man's obsession with an officer who has once disrespected him in a pub. This officer frequently passes by him on the street, seemingly without noticing his existence. He sees the officer on the street and thinks of ways to take revenge, eventually borrowing money to buy a higher class overcoat and bumping into the officer to assert his equality. To the Underground Man's surprise, however, the officer does not seem to notice that it even happened.  Second segment  The second segment is a going away dinner party with some old school friends to bid Zverkov, one of their number, goodbye as he is being transferred out of the city. The Underground Man hated them when he was younger, but after a random visit to Simonov's, he decides to meet them at the appointed location. They fail to tell him that the time has been changed to six instead of five, so he arrives early. He gets into an argument with the four of them after a short time, declaring to all his hatred of society and using them as the symbol of it. At the end, they go off without him to a secret brothel, and, in his rage, the underground man follows them there to confront Zverkov once and for all, regardless if he is beaten or not. He arrives at the brothel to find Zverkov and the others already retired with prostitutes to other rooms. He then encounters Liza, a young prostitute, with whom he goes to bed.  Third segment  The story cuts to Liza and the Underground Man lying silently in the dark together. The Underground Man confronts Liza with an image of her future, by which she is unmoved at first, but after challenging her individual utopian dreams (similar to his ridicule of the Crystal Palace in Part 1), she eventually realizes the plight of her position and how she will slowly become useless and will descend more and more, until she is no longer wanted by anyone. The thought of dying such a terribly disgraceful death brings her to realize her position, and she then finds herself enthralled by the Underground Man's seemingly poignant grasp of the destructive nature of society. He gives her his address and leaves. He is subsequently overcome by the fear of her actually arriving at his dilapidated apartment after appearing such a \\"hero\\" to her and, in the middle of an argument with his servant, she arrives. He then curses her and takes back everything he said to her, saying he was, in fact, laughing at her and reiterates the truth of her miserable position. Near the end of his painful rage he wells up in tears after saying that he was only seeking to have power over her and a desire to humiliate her. He begins to criticize himself and states that he is in fact horrified by his own poverty and embarrassed by his situation. Liza realizes how pitiful he is and tenderly embraces him. The Underground Man cries out \\"They‚Äîthey won't let me‚ÄîI‚ÄîI can't be good!\\" After all this, he still acts terribly toward her, and, before she leaves, he stuffs a five ruble note into her hand, which she throws onto the table (it is implied that the Underground Man engaged in sexual activity with Liza and that the note is compensation for her). He tries to catch her as she goes out to the street but cannot find her and never hears from her again. He tries to stop the pain in his heart by \\"fantasizing.\\" > And isn't it better, won't it be better?‚Ä¶ Insult‚Äîafter all, it's a > purification; it's the most caustic, painful consciousness! Only tomorrow I > would have defiled her soul and wearied her heart. But now the insult will > never ever die within her, and however repulsive the filth that awaits her, > the insult will elevate her, it will cleanse her‚Ä¶ He recalls this moment as making him unhappy whenever he thinks of it, yet again proving the fact from the first section that his spite for society and his inability to act like it makes him unable to act better than it. The concluding sentences recall some of the themes explored in the first part, and tells the reader directly, \\"I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you have not dared to carry even halfway.‚Äù The work as a whole ends with a note from the author that while there was more to the text, \\"it seems that we may stop here.\\"  Themes and context  The narration by the Underground Man is laden with ideological allusions and complex conversations regarding the political climate of the period. Using his fiction as a weapon of ideological discourse, Dostoevsky challenges the ideologies of his time, mainly nihilism and rational egoism. In Part 2, the rant that the Underground Man directs at Liza as they sit in the dark, and her response to it, is an example of such discourse. Liza believes she can survive and rise up through the ranks of her brothel as a means of achieving her dreams of functioning successfully in society. However, as the Underground Man points out in his rant, such dreams are based on a utopian trust of not only the societal systems in place but also humanity's ability to avoid corruption and irrationality in general. The points made in Part 1 about the Underground Man's pleasure in being rude and refusing to seek medical help are his examples of how idealised rationality is inherently flawed for not accounting for the darker and more irrational side of humanity. The Stone Wall is one of the symbols in the novel and represents all the barriers of the laws of nature that stand against man and his freedom. Put simply, the rule that two plus two equals four angers the Underground Man because he wants the freedom to say two plus two equals five, but that Stone Wall of nature's laws stands in front of him and his free will. = Political climate = In the 1860s, Russia was beginning to absorb the ideas and culture of Western Europe at an accelerated pace, nurturing an unstable local climate. There was especially a growth in revolutionary activity accompanying a general restructuring of tsardom where liberal reforms, enacted by an unwieldy autocracy, only induced a greater sense of tension in both politics and civil society. Many of Russia's intellectuals were engaged in a debate with the Westernizers on one hand, and the Slavophiles on the other, concerned with favoring importation of Western reforms or promoting pan-Slavic traditions to address Russia's particular social reality. Although Tsar Alexander emancipated the serfs in 1861, Russia was still very much a post-medieval, traditional peasant society. When Notes From Underground was written, there was an intellectual ferment on discussions regarding religious philosophy and various 'enlightened' utopian ideas. The work is a challenge to, and a method of understanding, the larger implications of the ideological drive toward a utopian society. Utopianism largely pertains to a society's collective dream, but what troubles the Underground Man is this very idea of collectivism. The point the Underground Man makes is that individuals will ultimately always rebel against a collectively imposed idea of paradise; a utopian image such as The Crystal Palace will always fail because of the underlying irrationality of humanity.  Writing style  Although the novel is written in first-person narrative, the \\"I\\" is never really discovered. The syntax can at times seem \\"multi-layered;\\" the subject and the verb are often at the very beginning of the sentence before the object goes into the depths of the narrator's thoughts. The narrator repeats many of his concepts. In chapter 11, the narrator refers to his inferiority to everyone around him and describes listening to people as like \\"listening through a crack under the floor.\\" The word \\"underground\\" actually comes from a bad translation into English. A better translation would be a crawl space: a space under the floor that is not big enough for a human, but where rodents and bugs live. According to Russian folklore, it is also a place where evil spirits live.  Legacy  The challenge posed by the Underground Man towards the idea of an \\"enlightened\\" society laid the groundwork for later writing. The work has been described as \\"probably the most important single source of the modern dystopia.\\" Notes From Underground has had an impact on various authors and works in the fields of philosophy, literature, and film, including: * the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche * The Metamorphosis (1915), a novella by Franz Kafka * Invisible Man (1952), by Ralph Ellison * Resurrection from the Underground: Feodor Dostoevsky (1963) by Rene Girard * Taxi Driver (1976), directed by Martin Scorsese * American Psycho (1991), by Bret Easton EllisA paragraph from Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground is quoted at the beginning of the first chapter of American Psycho. * Notes from Underground (1995), a film adaptation of Dostoevsky's novella, directed by Gary Walkow, with Henry Czerny and Sheryl Lee in the leading roles.. *Inside (2012), directed by Turkish filmmaker Zeki Demirkubuz, was inspired by Dostoevsky's novella.

Bronze wool is similar to steel wool, but is used in its place to avoid some problems associated with broken filaments: steel rusts quickly, especially in a marine environment. Furthermore, steel is magnetic and can affect the operation of marine equipment, such as a compass. Steel can also discolor some materials, such as oak. This discoloration results from a reaction between the tannates in the oak and the iron in the steel, forming iron tannate, a black compound. Bronze wool also has uses for filter elements, again when rusting would be a problem. The main US retail supplier of bronze wool is Homax Group, under their Rhodes American brand. Bronze wool has largely been replaced for cost reasons, by plastic mesh abrasives from makers such as Webrax and 3M Scotch-Brite.

The IPv6 stack also contains the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) routing protocol for low-power lossy IPv6 networks and the 6LoWPAN header compression and adaptation layer for IEEE 802.15.4 links. Rime is an alternative network stack, for use when the overhead of the IPv4 or IPv6 stacks is prohibitive. The Rime stack provides a set of communication primitives for low-power wireless systems. The default primitives are single-hop unicast, single-hop broadcast, multi-hop unicast, network flooding, and address-free data collection. The primitives can be used on their own or combined to form more complex protocols and mechanisms.. Low-power operation Many Contiki systems are severely power-constrained. Battery operated wireless sensors may need to provide years of unattended operation and with little means to recharge or replace batteries. Contiki provides a set of mechanisms to reduce the power consumption of systems on which it runs. The default mechanism for attaining low-power operation of the radio is called ContikiMAC.. With ContikiMAC, nodes can be running in low-power mode and still be able to receive and relay radio messages. Simulation The Contiki system includes a sensor simulator called Cooja, which simulates of Contiki nodes.. The nodes belong to one of the three following classes: a) emulated Cooja nodes, b) Contiki code compiled and executed on the simulation host, or c) Java nodes, where the behavior of the node must be reimplemented as a Java class. One Cooja simulation may contain a mix of sensor nodes from any of the three classes. Emulated nodes can also be used to include non-Contiki nodes in a simulated network. In Contiki 2.6, platforms with the TI MSP430 and Atmel AVR microcontrollers can be emulated. Programming model To run efficiently on small-memory systems, the Contiki programming model is based on protothreads. (PDF, Presentation slides).. A protothread is a memory-efficient programming abstraction that shares features of both multithreading and event-driven programming to attain a low memory overhead of each protothread. The kernel invokes the protothread of a process in response to an internal or external event. Examples of internal events are timers that fire or messages being posted from other processes. Examples of external events are sensors that trigger or incoming packets from a radio neighbor. Protothreads are cooperatively scheduled. Thus, a Contiki process must always explicitly yield control back to the kernel at regular intervals. Contiki processes may use a special protothread construct to block waiting for events while yielding control to the kernel between each event invocation.  Features  VNC server running on the Atmel AVR port of Contiki Contiki supports per-process optional preemptive multithreading, inter-process communication using message passing through events, as well as an optional graphical user interface (GUI) subsystem with either direct graphic support for locally connected terminals or networked virtual display with Virtual Network Computing (VNC) or over Telnet. A full installation of Contiki includes the following features: * Multitasking kernel * Optional per-application preemptive multithreading * Protothreads * Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) networking, including IPv6 * Windowing system and GUI * Networked remote display using Virtual Network Computing * A web browser (claimed to be the world's smallest) * Personal web server * Simple telnet client * Screensaver Contiki is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL, which includes a port in its 3.15.5 release.

The name is usually applied to the mountains to the north of Glen Torridon. They are among the most dramatic and spectacular peaks in the British Isles and made of some of the oldest rocks in the world. Many are over 3000 feet high, so are considered Munros.

View east from Sgurr Mh√≤r over the \\"Horns\\" Rock types These are mainly made of a type of sandstone, known as Torridonian sandstone (see Geology of Great Britain), which over time has become eroded to produce the unique characteristics of the Torridon Hills. In geology, Torridonian describes a series of proterozoic arenaceous sedimentary rocks of Precambrian age. They are amongst the oldest rocks in Britain, and sit on yet older rocks, Lewisian gneiss. Some of the highest peaks, such as Beinn Eighe are crowned by white Cambrian quartzite, which gives those peaks a distinctive appearance. Some of the quartzite contains fossilized worm burrows and known as pipe rock. It is circa 500 million years old. The strata are largely horizontal, and have weathered into terraces on the mountains. Each of the Torridon Hills sits very much apart from one another, and they are often likened to castles. They have steep terraced sides, and broken summit crests, riven into many pinnacles. There are numerous steep gullies running down the terraced sides from the peaks. The summit ridges provide excellent scrambling, and are popular with hillwalkers and mountaineers. However, like many ridge routes, there are few escape points, so once committed, the scrambler or hillwalker must complete the entire ridge before descent. There are numerous other mountains outside the immediate area of Loch Torridon which have the same characteristics, such as An Teallach near Ullapool. Major peaks Although many peaks in the Northwest Highlands exhibit Torridon geology, the Torridon hills are generally considered only to be those in the Torridon Forest to the north of Glen Torridon.

Oviraptorids are characterized by their toothless, parrot-like beaks and, in some cases, elaborate crests. They were generally small, measuring between one and two metres long in most cases, though some possible oviraptorids were enormous. Oviraptorids are currently known only from the Late Cretaceous of Asia, with the most well-known species and complete specimens found only in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and northwestern China.  Description  Skull of an undescribed species known as \\"Ronaldoraptor\\" The most characteristic feature of this group is the skull structure. Oviraptorids had short snouts and very deep mandibles. Some taxa (Oviraptor, Citipati, Rinchenia) had a midline crest on top of the skull, resembling that of a cassowary. Other distinguishing characteristics include a bony spike intruding on the mandibular fenestra, nostrils placed very high and far back on the snout, an extremely thin bony bar beneath the eye, and highly pneumatized skull bones. Like their relatives the caenagnathids, the jaws were edentulous (with no teeth), having instead two small bony projections on the roof of the mouth.  Classification and species  Oviraptorid profiles The classification of the oviraptorids has been controversial. Most studies divide oviraptorosaurs into two primary sub-groups, the Caenagnathidae and the Oviraptoridae. However, some phylogenetic studies have suggested that many traditional members of the Caenagnathidae may more closely related to the crested oviraptorids. Because of this, and the fact that at least one study found that Caenagnathus itself may not have been part of the 'caenagnathid' group, Tom Holtz (2010) placed that group close to the Oviraptoridae and termed it the Elmisauridae,Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix. though this idea has not gained consensus among other researchers. The Oviraptoridae itself is traditionally divided into two \\"subfamilies\\": the small, short-armed, and mainly crestless subfamily Heyuanniinae and the larger, crested, long-armed Oviraptorinae (Oviraptor + Citipati). Some phylogenetic studies have shown that Oviraptor is the most primitive known oviraptorid, thus making Citipati a closer relative of the \\"ingeniines\\" and this traditional division into crestless and crested forms artificial. Other possible oviraptorids include Nomingia gobiensis, Gigantoraptor erlianensis, Jiangxisaurus ganzhouensis and Shixinggia oblita. All four have been suggested to be oviraptorids, caenagnathids, or more primitive than either group. The below cladogram was found in the description of the genus Anzu. Paleobiology =Habitat= Almost all oviraptorids come from desert deposits of the Gobi Desert. Even in the late Cretaceous period, much of this area was desert, or at least very dry, habitat. In many of the localities where they are found, oviraptorids are among the most abundant dinosaurs present, second only to ankylosaurs and protoceratopsids. This is consistent with the idea that they were primarily herbivores, which tend to far outnumber carnivores in a given environment. Oviraptorids appear to have been far more abundant in arid habitats dominated mainly by small dinosaurs (such as those preserved in the Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations) than in wetter ecosystems where large dinosaurs are common (such as the Nemegt Formation). The same pattern holds true for protoceratopsids, indicating that both groups preferred dry, desert-like habitat, and fed mainly on the types of tough, low- growing plant life that grows in arid climates. =Diet= Skull of oviraptorid specimen GIN 100/42 The diet of oviraptorids is not fully understood. Though some appear to have been at least partially carnivorous, they were probably primarily herbivorous. Originally, oviraptorids were thought to be specialized egg raiders, based on a Mongolian find showing Oviraptor on top of a nest erroneously attributed to the ceratopsian dinosaur Protoceratops. However, discoveries in the 1990s, including Citipati specimens clearly brooding (rather than preying on) the same types of nests, and a Citipati embryo inside the same type of egg preserved in these nests, showed that the \\"specialized egg thief\\" idea was incorrect. Still, some scientists have suggested that oviraptorids may have fed on shelled food items like eggs or shellfish. However, animals specialized for eating shelled food typically have broad, crushing beaks or teeth. In contrast, the jaws of oviraptorids had thin, sharp edges probably supporting shearing beaks, ill-suited for cracking shells. Among other known animals, the beaks of oviraptorids most closely resemble those of herbivorous dicynodont synapsids, which are usually considered herbivorous. Their beaks also share similarities with the beaks of herbivorous parrots and tortoises. Evidence of partial carnivory among some oviraptorines comes from a lizard skeleton preserved in the body cavity of the type specimen of Oviraptor and two hatchling Byronosaurus skulls found in a Citipati nest.Bever, G.S. and Norell, M.A. (2009). \\"The perinate skull of Byronosaurus (Troodontidae) with observations on the cranial ontogeny of paravian theropods.\\" American Museum Novitates, 3657: 51 pp. Some scientists have also suggested that some oviraptorids (especially the small-handed, weak- clawed \\"ingeniines\\") fed mainly on plant material. =Reproduction= Nesting Citipati osmolskae specimen. Although fossilized dinosaur eggs are generally rare, oviraptorid eggs are relatively well known. Several oviraptorid nests, eggs, and embryos are known, mostly uncovered in the Gobi Desert. Some specimens of Oviraptor philoceratops, Citipati osmolskae, Nemegtomaia and cf. Machairasaurus have been found in brooding positions in association with nests.Clark, J.M., Norell, M.A., & Chiappe, L.M. (1999). \\"An oviraptorid skeleton from the Late Cretaceous of Ukhaa Tolgod, Mongolia, preserved in an avianlike brooding position over an oviraptorid nest.\\" American Museum Novitates, 3265: 36 pp., 15 figs.; (American Museum of Natural History) New York. (5.4.1999). All of the nesting specimens are situated on top of egg clutches, with their limbs spread symmetrically on each side of the nest, front limbs covering the nest perimeter. This brooding posture is found today only in birds and supports a behavioral link between birds and theropod dinosaurs. Oviraptorid eggs are shaped like elongated ovals (elongatoolithid) and resemble the eggs of ratite birds (such as ostriches) in texture and shell structure. In the nest, eggs are typically found in pairs and arranged in concentric circles of up to three layers, with complete clutches consisting of as many of 22 eggs in some species.Varricchio, D.J. (2000). \\"Reproduction and Parenting,\\" in Paul, G.S. (ed.). The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs. New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 279-293. The eggs of Citipati are the largest known definitive oviraptorid eggs, at 18 cm. In contrast, eggs associated with Oviraptor are only up to 14 cm long. Citipati osmolskae egg with preserved embryo. The first oviraptorid eggs (of the genus Oviraptor, which mean \\"Egg thief\\") were found in close proximity to the remains of the ceratopsian dinosaur Protoceratops and it was assumed that the oviraptorids were preying upon the eggs of the ceratopsians.Osborn, H.F. (1924). \\"Three new Theropoda, Protoceratops zone, central Mongolia.\\" American Museum Novitates, 144: 12 pp., 8 figs.; (American Museum of Natural History) New York. (11.7.1924). It was not until 1993, when a Citipati embryo was discovered inside an egg of the type assigned to Protoceratops, that the error was corrected. Norell et al., who recognized the embryo as oviraptorid, assigned it to the genus Citipati. The egg containing the embryo was smaller than most known Citipati eggs at only 12 cm, though it was partially eroded and broken into three pieces, making an accurate estimate of its original size difficult. The embryo-bearing egg was otherwise identical to other oviraptorid eggs in shell structure and was found in an isolated nest, again arranged in a circular pattern. Oviraptor philoceratops nest (AMNH FR 6508) An oviraptorosaurian specimen from China described in 2005 was found to have two unlaid eggs within the pelvic canal. This suggests that, unlike modern crocodilians, oviraptorosaurs did not produce and lay many eggs at the same time. Rather, the eggs were produced within the reproductive organs in pairs, and laid two at a time, with the mother positioned in the center of the nest and rotating in a circle as each pair was laid. This behavior is supported by the fact that the eggs oval shape, with the more narrow end pointing backward from the birth canal, matching their orientation toward the center of the nest after being laid. Heyuannia restoration with nest The presence of two shelled eggs within the birth canal shows that oviraptorosaurs were intermediate between the reproductive biology of crocodilians and modern birds. Like crocodilians, they had two oviducts. However, crocodilians produce multiple shelled eggs per oviduct at a time, whereas oviraptorosaurs, like birds, produced only one egg per oviduct at a time. In 2017, paleontologists discovered colored pigments in some fossilized oviraptorid embryos of the egg- shell genus Macroolithus (which may represent eggs of Heyuannia). Examinations of eggs attributed to Heyuannia by Jasmina Wiemann and Tzu-Ruei Yang et al revealed the eggs preserved the blue-green pigment biliverdin and the reddish- brown pigment protoporphyrin, the same pigments found in many modern birds' eggshells. The eggs are thought to have been a blue-green color, because biliverdin is preserved in much greater abundance the photoporphyrin. In modern bird eggs, coloration can camouflage the eggs or help parents identify eggs, and it is correlated with more intensive parental care. =Metabolism= A study by Robert Eagle et al. of the University of California-Los Angeles indicates that from specimens of eggs found in Mongolia and examination of the isotopes carbon-13 and oxygen 18 found within, Oviraptorids had body temperatures that could be elevated higher than that of the surrounding environment but lower than that of birds. This is very different from the isotope ratios of sauropod dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus, which had body temperatures of up to and were fully endothermic.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151013135543.htm =Feathers= Oviraptorids were probably feathered, since some close relatives were found with feathers preserved (including species of Caudipteryx, Protarchaeopteryx and Similicaudipteryx).Ji, Q., and Ji, S. (1997). \\"A Chinese archaeopterygian, Protarchaeopteryx gen. nov.\\" Geological Science and Technology (Di Zhi Ke Ji), 238: 38-41. Translated By Will Downs Bilby Research Center Northern Arizona University January, 2001 Another finding pointing to this is the discovery in Nomingia of a pygostyle, a bone that results from the fusion of the last tail vertebrae and is responsible in birds to hold a fan of feathers in the tail. Finally, the arm position of the brooding Citipati would have been far more effective if feathers were present to cover the eggs.Paul, G.S. (2002). Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Pathology The brooding oviraptorid specimen IGM 100/979 showed a callus and possible longitudinal groove left over from a healed fracture of the right ulna. Other oviraptorids have had pathological features reported in their phalanges but these have not been described in detail in the scientific literature.Molnar, R.

Mentha hirsuta Huds.Euro+Med Plantbase Project: Mentha aquatica ) is a perennial flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae. It grows in moist places and is native to much of Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia.Flora of NW Europe: Mentha aquatica  Description  Water mint is a herbaceous rhizomatous perennial plant growing to tall. The stems are square in cross section, green or purple, and variably hairy to almost hairless. The rhizomes are wide-spreading, fleshy, and bear fibrous roots. The leaves are ovate to ovate-lanceolate, long and broad, green (sometimes purplish), opposite, toothed, and vary from hairy to nearly hairless. The flowers of the watermint are tiny, densely crowded, purple, tubular, pinkish to lilac in colour and form a terminal hemispherical inflorescence; flowering is from mid to late summer. Water mint is visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome, but can also spread by underground rhizomes. All parts of the plant have a distinctly minty smell.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . Unbranched, hairless plants, with narrower leaves and paler flowers, native to areas of Sweden and Finland near the Baltic Sea, have been called Mentha aquatica var. litoralis. Mentha aquatica is a polyploid, with 2n = 8x = 96 chromosomes. Taxonomy Mentha aquatica was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. As with other Mentha species, it was subsequently re-described under a variety of different names; , Plants of the World Online listed 87 synonyms, including four forms or varieties that it does not recognize. The cultivated eau de Cologne mint (also known as bergamot mint) is considered to be a variety of this species. It hybridises with Mentha spicata (spearmint) to produce Mentha √ó piperita (peppermint), a sterile hybrid; with Mentha suaveolens (apple mint) to produce Mentha √ó suavis; with Mentha arvensis (corn mint) to produce Mentha √ó verticillata; and with both M. arvensis and M. spicata to give the tri-species hybrid Mentha √ó smithiana. Distribution and habitat Water mint is native to much of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia. It has been introduced to North and South America, Australia and some Atlantic islands. As the name suggests, water mint occurs in the shallow margins and channels of streams, rivers, pools, dikes, ditches, canals, wet meadows, marshes and fens. If the plant grows in the water itself, it rises above the surface of the water. It generally occurs on mildly acidic to calcareous (it is common on soft limestone) mineral or peaty soils. M. aquatica can occur in certain fen-meadow habitats such as the Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre plant association.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Marsh Thistle: Cirsium palustre, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Str√∂mberg It is a component of Purple moor grass and rush pastures - a type of Biodiversity ActPlan habitat in the UK. Uses It can be used to make a herbal tea. The cultivated variety known as eau de Cologne mint or bergamot mint, is used to produce mentha citrata oil, also known as bergamot mint oil, used in perfumery. Not to be confused with Bergamot essential oil.

It is situated 66 kilometers north of the state capital Trivandrum. The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake.Cities of KeralaKerala CitiesAlphabetical listing of Places in State of Kerala Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians and Romans. Fed by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.Kollam - Mathrubhumi Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam. In the 9th Century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin.Short History of Kollam Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St Thomas. V. Nagam Aiya in his Travancore State Manual records that in 822 AD two East Syriac bishops Mar Sabor and Mar Proth, settled in Quilon with their followers. Two years later the Malabar Era began (824 AD) and Quilon became the premier city of the Malabar region ahead of Travancore and Cochin. Kollam Port was founded by Mar Sabor at Tangasseri in 825 as an alternative to reopening the inland seaport of Kore-ke-ni Kollam near Backare (Thevalakara), which was also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils.Aiyya, V.V Nagom, State Manual p. 244 Mar Sabor and Mar Proth, According to Syrian Malabar Christian tradition,they were two Syrian missionaries, with a migrant group, landed in the port of Kollam in 823 AD. The mission is said to have received permission from the then king of Kerala to build a church in Kollam. General information Kollam is an ISO 9001:2015 certified city corporation for the best Municipal administration and services. As per the survey conducted by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on urban area growth during January 2020, Kollam became the 10th fastest growing city in the world with a 31.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020. It is a coastal city on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake that took the title God's Own Country. The Ashtamudi Lake lie about north of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam district and is a prominent trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is second highest among the 500 most populous cities in India. Kollam is one of the least polluted cities in India. Four major trading centers around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur and Karunagapally. Kollam is an ancient trading town ‚Äì trading with Romans, Chinese, Arabs and other Orientals ‚Äì mentioned in historical citations dating back to Biblical times and the reign of Solomon, connecting with Red Sea ports of the Arabian Sea (supported by a find of ancient Roman coins). There was also internal trade through the Aryankavu Pass in Schenkottah Gap connecting the ancient town to Tamil Nadu. The overland trade in pepper by bullock cart and the trade over the waterways connecting Allepey and Cochin established trade linkages that enabled it to grow into one of the earliest Indian industrial townships. The rail links later established to Tamil Nadu supported still stronger trade links. The factories processing marine exports and the processing and packaging of cashewnuts extended its trade across the globe. Major characteristics Kollam is the fourth largest city in Kerala and the fifth largest in terms of corporation area. It is known for cashew processing and coir manufacturing. Ashtamudi Lake is considered the southern gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination at Kollam. The Kollam urban area includes suburban towns such as Paravur in the south, Kundara in the east and Karunagapally in the north of the city.

Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial center in Southern Kerala. Toponymy In 825 CE, the Malayalam calendar, or Kollavarsham, was created in Kollam at meetings held in the city.ending with the Royal sanction of Tarissapalli copper plates to Assyrian Monks by Vaishnaite Chera King Rajashekara Varma, against the backdrop of a Shivite revival led by Adi Shankara among the Nampoothiri communities Kerala government website The present Malayalam calendar is said to have begun with the re-founding of the town, which was rebuilt after its destruction by fire. The name Kollam is believed to have been derived from the Sanskrit word Kollam, meaning pepper. History Kollam in the 1500s As the ancient city of Quilon, Kollam was a flourishing port during the Chera dynasty (c. 3rd century BC‚Äì12th century), and later became the capital of the independent Venad or the Kingdom of Quilon on its foundation in c. 825. Kollam was considered one of the four early entrepots in global sea trade during the 13th century, along with Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, the Chinese city of Quanzhou, and Malacca in the Malaysian archipelago =Chera rule= Capture of Kollam in 1661 Kollam in the 1700s Along with (Muziris), Quilon was an ancient seaport on the Malabar Coast of India from the early centuries before the Christian era. The city had a high commercial reputation from the days of the Phoenicians and Ancient Romans. Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 AD) mentions Greek ships anchored at Muziris and Nelcynda. There was also a land route over the Western Ghats. Spices, pearls, diamonds, and silk were exported to Egypt and Rome from these ports. Pearls and diamonds came to the Chera Kingdom from Ceylon and the southeastern coast of India, then known as the Pandyan Kingdom. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek Nestorian sailor, in his book the Christian Topography who visited the Malabar coast in 550, mentions an enclave of Christian believers in Male (Chera Kingdom). He writes, \\"In the island of Tabropane (Ceylon), there is a church of Christians, and clerics and faithful. Likewise at Male, where the pepper grows, and in the farming community of Kalliana (Kalliankal at Nillackal) there is also a bishop consecrated in Persia in accordance with the Nicea Sunnahadose of 325 AD.\\"Travancore Manual The Nestorian Patriarch Jesujabus, who died in 660 AD, mentions Kollam in his letter to Simon, Metropolitan of Persia. =Capital of Venad (9th to 12th centuries)= The port at Kollam, then known as Quilon, was founded in 825 by the Nestorian Christians Mar Sabor and Mar Proth with sanction from Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal, the king of the independent Venad or the State of Quilon, a feudatory under the Chera kingdom.Kerala Charithram P.59 Sridhara MenonV. Nagam Aiya (1906), Travancore State Manual, page 244 It is believed that Mar Sapor Iso also proposed that the Chera king create a new seaport near Kollam in lieu of his request that he rebuild the almost vanished inland seaport at Kollam (kore-ke-ni) near Backare (Thevalakara), also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils, which had been without trade for several centuries because the Cheras were overrun by the Pallavas in the 6th century, ending the spice trade from the Malabar coast. This allowed the Nestorians to stay in the Chera kingdom for several decades and introduce the Christian faith among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nair sub-castes in the St. Thomas tradition, with the Syrian liturgy as a basis for the Doctrine of the Trinity, without replacing the Sanskrit and Vedic prayers.History of Kollam city and Kollam Port Quilon.com The Tharisapalli plates presented to Maruvan Sapor Iso by Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal granted the Christians the privilege of overseeing foreign trade in the city as well as control over its weights and measures in a move designed to increase Quilon's trade and wealth. The two Christians were also instrumental in founding Christian churches with Syrian liturgy along the Malabar coast, distinct from the ancient Vedic Advaitam propounded by Adi Shankara in the early 9th century among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nair Sub Castes, as Malayalam was not accepted as a liturgical language until the early 18th century. Thus began the Malayalam Era, known as Kolla Varsham after the city, indicating the importance of Kollam in the 9th century. The Persian merchant Soleyman of Siraf visited Malabar in the 9th century and found Quilon to be the only port in India used by the huge Chinese ships as their transshipment hub for goods on their way from China to the Persian Gulf. The rulers of Kollam (formerly called 'Desinganadu') had trade relations with China and exchanged embassies. According to the records of the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì913),Travancore Manual, page 244 Quilon was their chief port of call before the 7th century. The Chinese trade decreased about 600 and was again revived in the 13th century.

The group was formed as a result of a 1999 talent contest called \\"Avex Dream 2000\\". Originally a three-piece group consisting of Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe, the group has undergone many changes since its debut in 2000 on the Avex Trax label, and none of the original trio remain. The original trio sold over 950,700 records, and in total the group has sold over 1,100,000 records over the span of 10 years. On July 7, 2002, the main lyricist Mai Matsumuro left the group to pursue a solo career. After Matsumuro's departure, Avex held another audition to replace Matsumuro. Instead of one, six new members won the audition, resulting in an eight-member (Dream) group with the debut single \\"Music is My Thing\\". On March 2004, Risa Ai left to pursue a solo career. They became a 7-member group as performed this way until 2007. During this time, the band's name changed from dream to DRM. In August 2008, Yu Hasebe left the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only original member of dream. Afterward, DRM became Dream again. In August 2010, Dream released their official major re-debut single, \\"My Way: Ulala\\" on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 24, 2010, Dream released their first album as a six-member group, titled Hands Up! on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 23, 2010, Tachibana announced that she would leave the group. This marked the departure of the last member of the original three-member group. She officially left the group on February 20, 2011. On March 30, 2012, Sayaka Yamamoto departed to pursue a solo career. History =Avex Dream 2000= In 1999, the Avex label organized a talent contest, called \\"Avex Dream 2000\\", looking for the next big hit idol group. Over 120,000 hopefuls auditioned in front of a panel of judges, notably including Kaori Mochida of the popular band, Every Little Thing. Another of the entrants was Kumi Koda, who placed second and is now a popular singer. The final winners of the competition were Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe. They formed Avex's idol group Dream. =Debut as 3-member Dream= On January 1, 2000, Dream debuted with the single \\"Movin' On\\", which charted within the top 15 on the Oricon charts. Their next few singles all charted in similar territory, failing to break the top 10 until their sixth single, \\"My will\\", made it to number 6 at the end of 2000. \\"My will\\" was the song that gave Dream newfound fame as it was the first ending theme to the popular anime Inuyasha. The group's next single peaked at number 36. On February 28, 2001, Dream released their debut album, Dear.... The album reached number 5 on the Oricon charts. Also on November 28, 2001, Dream released \\"Get Over\\", the first opening theme to the anime Hikaru no Go. It reached number 12 on the Oricon charts. On February 14, 2002, dream released their second album, Process, which reached number 8 on the charts. Following the release of Process, Matsumuro, who wrote most of the group's lyrics, announced that she was to leave in pursuit of a solo career. Dream then released their final single as a 3-member group, \\"Sincerely: Ever Dream\\". On June 26, 2002, Dream released their final release as a three-member group and their first best album, Eternal Dream. On July 7, 2002, Matsumuro left Dream. =8-member Dream= Following Matsumuro's departure, Avex held more auditions for a replacement, and ended up with six new girls. They were Risa Ai, Erie Abe, Aya Takamoto, Ami Nakashima, Shizuka Nishida, and Sayaka Yamamoto. The new eight-girl group \\"re-debuted\\" in 2003 with the single \\"Music is My Thing\\". In February 2003, the group released their third album, Dream World. The album reached number 23 on the Oricon charts. Following Dream World, Dream's popularity once again peaked. They participated in the first a-nation summer concert festival held by Avex. They appeared on popular singer Ayumi Hamasaki's TV show, Ayuready. Subsequently, dream's next single, \\"I Love Dream World\\", became their first single to chart within the Oricon top 10 since \\"My Will\\" in 2000. In 2004, following the release of Dream's fourth album ID, Ai left Dream to pursue a solo career, bringing the group's member count down to seven. =7-member Dream/DRM= From 2004‚Äì2005, Dream released the singles \\"Pure\\", \\"Love Generation\\", and \\"Soyokaze no Shirabe / Story\\". They also released two mini albums, Natsuiro and Boy meets Girl. In addition, Dream released a best album (777: Best of Dreams), an Avex cover album (Dream Meets Best Hits Avex), and a self cover album (777: Another Side Story). After a long period without much activity, Dream released 7th Anniversary Best (a best of album featuring songs from the group's debut as a three-member unit up till their latest single) and Greatest Live Hits (an album featuring recordings of their live performances) on January 1, 2007 (the group's 7th anniversary). DRM On June 27, 2007, Dream was \\"reborn\\" as the dance/chorus group DRM in an attempt to shed their image as idols. The group debuted with the mini album DRM. In 2008, DRM released four digital singles, the first being released in January and the last, in April. The singles were released on the 7th of each month (January 7, February 7, and so on). Like their mini album, the singles were not met with much success. =LDH and re-debut as Dream= On August 1, 2008, Yu Hasebe left DRM in pursuit of a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only member of the original Dream. The group changed its name back to Dream and their official fanclub (Live Your Dreams) closed down. Also, the group changed management from Avex to LDH (Love Dream Happiness). On September 9, 2009, the group released its first single as Dream and its first physical single since 2005's \\"Soyokaze no Shirabe / Story\\". The new single was titled \\"Perfect Girls / To The Top\\" and was sold exclusively at a series of free shows Dream performed throughout Japan as well as on mu-mo (an online store). As a special release, it did not chart on Oricon. To promote their comeback, Dream embarked on a nationwide tour of Japan, performing at free live appearances in numerous cities. Dream appeared on their first TV live on December 31, 2009 on CDTV Premium Live 2009>>2010, performing Perfect Girls. On March 1, 2010, Dream released their second single as a six-member group, titled \\"Breakout\\", another mu-mo exclusive. In May 2010, having completed their nationwide free performance campaign, Dream held a 3-date live tour titled Dream Live Tour 2010: Road to Dream.

On November 23, 2010, Kana Tachibana announced that she would leave the group on the group's official website. She officially graduated on February 20, 2011. The 5 member Dream provided the theme song to the drama Detective Conan. The new song, titled \\"To you...\\" aired on April 15, 2011. However, it was only available via Japanese mobile services. In 2011, the group became part of LDH's collaborative supergroup E-girls (which is the female counterpart of Exile) alongside Happiness and Flower. Sayaka Yamamoto officially left the group on March 31, 2012. In late 2016, Erie Abe announced that she would be leaving the entertainment industry by the end of year. Before that, Dream released their first photobook titled dream„ÅØDream„ÅÆÂ§¢„ÇíË¶ã„Çã„ÄÇ(dream wa Dream no yumewomiru„ÄÇ) after 14 years of the 4 members being together on November 30. The book describes the turbulent history of the group, the number of difficulties they had to face, the twists and turns in their career and the firm bond the members have. On December 31, 2016, Erie Abe officially left the group in hopes of studying abroad. = Disbandment = It was announced that Dream had disbanded due all members leaving to pursue on their own activities.

Stewart Brand later used the term independently in his 1987 book The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT to describe artificial-intelligence technology (in one application) to assist content selection ('hunting') and viewing ('grazing' or 'browsing'). \\\\- The Media Lab Review. L. McGuff. Beyond Cyberpunk, Gareth Branwyn, ed., 1991.

BitTorrent and RSS Create Disruptive Revolution EWeek.com, December 13, 2003. Retrieved on 2016-02-21. Scott Raymond described its specific application for gathering scheduled programming in an article entitled Broadcatching with BitTorrent.Raymond, Scott: Broadcatching with BitTorrent. scottraymond.net: 2003-12-16. The combination of these technologies allows a computer connected to the Internet to act like a digital video recorder (DVR) such as TiVo connected to cable. One of the first practical implementations was released in 2004. Programmer Andrew Grumet announced the release of a beta version of an RSS and BitTorrent integration tool for the Radio Userland news aggregator here. Today, content can be delivered to large groups at low cost through RSS-and-BitTorrent-based broadcatching. Large groups can be notified of new content through RSS, and bulky content can be distributed inexpensively through BitTorrent. Recipients subscribe to an RSS feed through which a content provider notifies recipients' software of new content, and that software uses BitTorrent to retrieve the content. Tags, be they applied by one user or many users, are also used to topically drive syndication of torrents.  Uses  Although broadcatching can be classified as a method independent of technology and implementation, today broadcatching finds much use with Internet television and Internet radio (also called podcasting or IPradio). Broadcatching is often used in situations where multicasting may be used but is cost prohibitive. =Broadcatching television broadcasts= Perhaps the most popular use of broadcatching is using a BitTorrent client with inbuilt RSS support to automatically download television episodes as they are 'released'‚Äîinternet users capture the broadcast as it is transmitted, then transcode it (typically after removing advertisements) and send it on to others. The practice has become quite popular, particularly in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom where television programs produced in the US tend to be aired more than six months after US broadcasts, if at all. , there has been no legal action taken against sharers of TV episodes (compared to distribution of copyrighted movies and music which the MPAA and RIAA have taken a strong stance against). Measurement Study Zhang et al. have evaluated Broadcatching using PlanetLab testbed in 2008. About 200 PlanetLab nodes all over the world were used in their study. Their results have demonstrated Broadcatching can greatly improve the performance of the BitTorrent system. Through this mechanism, every node is able to complete the file downing much faster.

B. Lippincott Company, 1902, page 1977 is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. The civil parish contains four settlements; Sandbach itself, Elworth, Ettiley Heath and Wheelock. Sandbach is perhaps best known as the original home of Foden and ERF lorries, though neither company now exists in the town, 12-times National Brass Band Championship winners Foden's Band, the ancient Saxon Sandbach Crosses, and Sandbach services on the M6 motorway. History Known as Sanbec in 1086, Sondbache (also Sondebache) in 1260, and Sandbitch in the 17th‚Äì18th centuries,Daniel King, William Smith, William Webb, The history of Cheshire: containing King's Vale-Royal entire, printed by John Poole, 1778, 994 pages. (page 82)\\"Sandbach (Settlement) located in the Parish of Sandbach \\", The Historical Gazetteer of England's Place-Names, referring to: John McN. Dodgson, The Place-Names of Cheshire, Part 2 (EPNS 45), Cambridge 1970. Sandbach derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon sand b√¶ce, which can mean \\"sand stream\\" or \\"sand valley\\".Nicolaisen, Gelling & Richards, The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain, p. 168 Traces of settlement are found in Sandbach from Saxon times, when the town was called Sanbec. Little is known about the town during this period, except that it was subjected to frequent Welsh and Danish raids. The town's inhabitants were converted to Christianity in the 7th century by four priests: Cedda, Adda, Betti and Diuma. The town has an entry in the Domesday Book from 1086, at which time it was sufficiently large to need a priest and a church. The entry states: > Sanbec: Bigot de Loges. 1 hide and 1¬Ω virgates pay tax. Land for 2 ploughs. > 1 Frenchman has ¬Ω plough, 3 slaves. 2 villagers have ¬Ω plough. Church. > Woodland. Value TRE 4s; now 8s. By the 13th century, during the reign of King John, much of the land around the township of Sandbach was owned by Richard de Sandbach who was the High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1230. Richard de Sandbach specifically owned a manor; he claimed an interest in the living of Sandbach. This claim against Earl Randle de Blundeville was unsuccessful. His son, John, however, was slightly more successful as he won an 'interest' temporarily against the Abbot of Dieulacres, only for it to be lost when it went to the King's Bench.Sandbach Official Guide 1970 Sandbach Town Crier at Sandbach Transport Festival The manor in Sandbach passed through numerous families, including the Leghs and Radclyffes. It was eventually bought by Sir Randulph (or Randle) Crewe, who became the Lord of the Manor. Sandbach has been a market town since 1579, when it was granted a Royal Charter by Elizabeth I due to the petitioning of Sir John Radclyffe of Ordsall who, as the largest landowner in Sandbach and the owner of the Sandbach Old Hall, encouraged the farmers of the area to hold a market in the town on Thursdays. The charter also allowed for right to establish a Court-leet and a Court of Pied-powder. The original charter is still preserved, and can be found in Chester; a reproduction can be found in the Sandbach Town Council chamber, which is at the Literary Institution. The charter also granted the town the right to hold two annual fairs, which lasted for two days, and were held around Easter and early September. The Thursday market is still held outdoors on Scotch Common, and in and around the town hall. =17th century to present day= During the 17th century, the town used to be famous for its ale: And about 1621 William Webb writes that \\"Our ale here at Sandbach being no less famous than that [at Derby] of a true nappe\\".Daniel King, William Smith, William Webb (gentleman.), The history of Cheshire: containing King's Vale-Royal entire, printed by John Poole, 1778. (page 217) During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, a Scottish army swept down into England before being forced to retreat at the Battle of Worcester. On 3 September 1651, the Sandbach summer fair was being held, and a Scottish army of around 1,000 exhausted cavalry men passed through the town under the command of David Leslie on their way back to Scotland. The town proved to be a difficult retreat route, however, as the people of Sandbach and the market stallholders attacked the Scottish army. A newspaper of the time said: > The dispute was very hot for two or three houres, and there were some > townsmen hurt and two or three slaine, the Townesman slew about nine or ten > and tooke 100 prisoners. This was the only notable event of the Civil War to have happened in Sandbach. As the fair and the fight took place on the common of the town, after this event the common gained the name Scotch Common. In 1836 Sandbach silk mills employed 554 people, including 98 boys and girls under 12 years old.James Wheeler, Manchester: its political, social and commercial history, Published 1836. 540 pages. (page 229) In 1801 the population was 1,844; by 1851 this had reached 4,659. The town centre is shown on an 1840 map.Sandbach 1840 town centre map, copy also at Sandbach Library Sandbach became a civil parish in 1866. The records from 1901 show a population of 5,568. The Sandbach Corn Mill was a three-story brick building built in the late 19th century, on what is now Mill Hill Lane.Owen Ashmore, The Industrial Archaeology of North West England, Manchester University Press ND, 1982, , , 241 pages (page 61) In 1933 the ERF lorry company was founded. In 1936 parts of the area of Bradwall, all of Elton and Wheelock were added, significantly increasing the size of the parish. The hamlets transferred from Bradwall were Boothlane Head, Brickhouses, Ettiley Heath, Forge Fields, Hindheath, Elworth and Marsh Green. By 1951 the population had reached 9,253. During Warship Week in December 1941 Sandbach adopted HMS Vimiera as its affiliated ship. The Vimiera was lost on 9 January 1942 when it was sunk by a mine in the Thames Estuary off East Spile Buoy with the loss of 96 hands. Governance Sandbach hosts the administrative headquarters for Cheshire East Council. For the Cheshire East unitary authority elections the town is divided into two wards. From 1875 until 1894 Sandbach was governed by Sandbach Urban Sanitary District. Between 1894 and 1974 the town was governed by Sandbach Urban District Council. In 1974, it was merged with other urban and rural councils to form Congleton Borough Council, which was later dissolved on 31 March 2009. The new authority Cheshire East took over its responsibilities and those of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 2009. Sandbach has a town council and youth council. Sandbach Town Council has jurisdiction over the parish of Sandbach, not just the town. All meetings are held in the Literary Institution in Sandbach. For the purposes of the town council and borough council elections Sandbach is divided into four wards: Elworth, Ettiley Heath and Wheelock, Sandbach Heath and East, and Town Ward, and town councillors are elected for terms of four years. A partnership of groups forms the Sandbach Partnership, which is part of the South East Cheshire Enterprise (SECE).Sandbach Partnership website =Constituencies= The town is in the Congleton constituency and the current MP is Fiona Bruce. Before the 2010 General Election the town's MP was Ann Winterton, who served the constituency since 1983. Before its current constituency, Sandbach has been part of five other constituencies: South Cheshire from 1832 to 1867, Mid Cheshire from 1868 to 1885, Crewe from 1885 to 1948, Knutsford from 1949 to 1954 and Crewe from 1955 to 1974. Geography As with most of the United Kingdom, Sandbach has an oceanic climate. The land area of Sandbach (including its four settlements) totals about 10.7 square kilometres (4.1 sq mi). The distance from London to Sandbach is . The nearest large town is Crewe, which is 6 miles (10 km) to the south-west by road and can be reached either via the A534 Wheelock/Haslington bypass or via Winterley and Haslington. The nearest city is Stoke-on-Trent in the neighbouring county of Staffordshire, approximately away by road. The town is served by the M6 motorway, junction 17 and Sandbach Station on the Crewe to Manchester mainline. Landmarks The Sandbach Crosses are an important historical feature on the cobbled market square: the two Saxon crosses, reportedly built in the 7th, 8th or 9th century, constitute a Scheduled Ancient Monument. A plaque near the crosses reads: :Saxon crosses completed in the 9th century to commemorate the advent of Christianity in this Kingdom of Mercia about AD 653 in the reign of the Saxon king Penda. They were restored in 1816 by Sir John Egerton after destruction by iconoclasts. Sandbach is also home to many listed buildings, including Sandbach School, St Mary's Church and the Old Hall Hotel. Many of the local public houses, which were formerly stage coach stops, are listed, for example the Lower Chequer. Many of the buildings of the town were designed by the renowned architect Sir George Gilbert Scott; he designed Sandbach Literary Institution, Sandbach School, St John's, Sandbach Heath and the Almshouses. He also restored St Mary's Church. The town has Methodist, Baptist, Anglican and Catholic churches. Natural England has designated Sandbach Flashes, a group of 14 separate waterbodies, as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), described as: :\\"a site of physiographical and biological importance. It consists of a series of pools formed as a result of subsidence due to the solution of underlying salt deposits [...] that show considerable variation in their plant and animal communities\\". At least 225 species of bird have been recorded on the Flashes. Economy Sandbach has been a market town since 1579 when it was granted a Royal Charter by Elizabeth I. Today the Thursday market is still held outdoors on Scotch Common, and in and around the town hall. Sandbach is probably best known as the original home of both Foden and ERF lorries, both companies founded by members of the Foden family. Neither company now exists in Sandbach, having been taken over and production moved elsewhere. As of 2007 there is no trace of Fodens within Sandbach, with the former mansion home of the Foden family at Westfields being demolished to make way for a new council building. However, Foden's Brass Band, originally created for employees, is still based in Sandbach. There is also a farmers' market which takes place on the second Saturday of each calendar month. There are a number of shops and bars concentrated in the town centre. Sandbach is now in large part a dormitory town for the adjacent conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the Potteries. A large number of people work at Cheshire East Council, which has its headquarters at Westfields. There is light industry, manufacturing and warehouses at Millbuck Industrial Area. Transport The town is served by Sandbach railway station, on the Crewe to Manchester Line, with services operated by Northern to and from as far north as Manchester Oxford Road although there is a branch line north of the station leading to Northwich which is mainly used by goods traffic and express passenger trains heading to Chester while the North Wales Coast Line is unavailable between the city and Crewe, although some organisations have been campaigning for a local passenger service between the two stations. The railway station itself is located to the west of the town in Elworth. Pressure of road traffic going from Greater Manchester to Crewe has forced the building of a bypass for Sandbach, Wheelock, Wheelock Heath, Winterley and Haslington for the A534. This is largely due to the M6 motorway which has a junction (J17) at Sandbach, which is close to the RoadChef service station. Local bus services are provided by Arriva Midlands and D&G; Bus. Public services In Sandbach water services are provided by United Utilities. Healthcare is provided at Ashfields Primary Care Centre. The primary care centre is overseen by Central and Eastern Cheshire Primary Care Trust. The nearest local hospital is Leighton Hospital in Crewe. Sandbach is served by the North West Ambulance Service. Policing is provided by Cheshire Constabulary. Cheshire Fire & Rescue Service runs the fire station in the town.

The school became a grammar school for boys after 1955. In 1979 the school became an independent comprehensive boys school, with charitable status, funded by Cheshire Local Education Authority but controlled by a board of governors. In September 2011, Sandbach School became a free school, one of the first free schools to be established in England. The school also contains a sixth form which is open to both boys and girls. Within Sandbach there is also a girls comprehensive school, Sandbach High. It was originally the town's mixed secondary modern when Sandbach School served as the boys' grammar school, but has been a single-sex comprehensive since 1979. It now has a college attached to it, which accepts boys as well as girls and offers a more vocational side of education along with A levels. =Cadets= 1873 (Sandbach) Squadron is the local squadron of the Air Training Corps.

History DBP Malaysia was established as Balai Pustaka in Johor Bahru on 22 June 1956, It was placed under the purview of the then Malayan Ministry of Education. During the Kongres Bahasa dan Persuratan Melayu III (The Third Malay Literary and Language Congress) which was held between 16 and 21 September 1956 in both Singapore and Johor Bahru, Balai Pustaka was renamed Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. Royal Prof Ungku Abdul Aziz Ungku Abdul Hamid was instrumental in setting up the institution. In 1957, DBP moved from Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. Through Ordinan Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka 1959, DBP was granted a charter with its own Board of Governors. With the charter, DBP has the power to form policies regarding the Malay language, responsible to spread the language and is able to go into book publishing business. On 31 January 1962, DBP moved to its own building at Jalan Lapangan Terbang Lama (now Jalan Dewan Bahasa). The building's architect was Lee Yoon Thim and the prominent mural was by Ismail Mustam. Later in 1977, it opened offices in Kota Kinabalu and Kuching, taking over the role of Borneo Literature Bureau in Sarawak. Soon after that, DBP had all the books in Iban language and other Bornean languages buried. However, some books were found and rescued. It was later alleged that all the books were burnt. Initially, DBP officials insisted on publishing works in national language (Malay language) or other vernaculars. However, soon after that DBP stated that they cannot publish books in regional languages because this would be against its own policy and is not economically sound in a small market of readers. Three other offices were established in Bukit Mertajam (1999), Kota Bharu (1999) and Johor Bahru (2003). The institution celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006. DBP also produces many talented novelists. Most outstanding DBP novel writers are Miss Siti Habsah Abdullah, Mrs. Malardevi Margamuthu, and Mr.Syed Satahkatulah Bin Mohamed Kalik. Dictionary and other publications DBP publishes the Kamus Dewan, for many years the prestigious dictionary of the Malaysian national language. The dictionary is not only descriptive, but rather it is also prescriptive, as it represents the results of the efforts of DBP to adapt the Malay language to accommodate the challenges of technology and science. DBP's role in developing and regulating the language may be likened to that of similar government bodies in other countries, for example the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. It also processes many books, mainly work books and novels.

It is bordered to the north by the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue in Ozone Park, to the south by Jamaica Bay in Broad Channel, to the east by 102nd‚Äì104th Streets in South Ozone Park, and to the west by 75th Street in East New York, Brooklyn. The area consists mostly of low-rise single-family houses. Howard Beach is located in Queens Community District 10 and its ZIP Code is 11414. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 106th Precinct. Politically, Howard Beach is represented by the New York City Council's 32nd District.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History Cross Bay Boulevard =Early development= Howard Beach was established in 1897 by William J. Howard, a Brooklyn glove manufacturer who operated a 150-acre (0.61 km¬≤) goat farm on meadow land near Aqueduct Racetrack as a source of skin for kid gloves. In 1897, he bought more land and filled it in and the following year, built 18 cottages and opened a hotel near the water, which he operated until it was destroyed by fire in October 1907. He gradually bought more land and formed the Howard Estates Development Company in 1909. He dredged and filled the land until he was able to accumulate 500 acres (2 km¬≤) by 1914. He laid out several streets, water mains and gas mains, and built 35 houses that were priced in the $2,500‚Äì$5,000 range. The Long Island Rail Road established a station named Ramblersville in 1905 and a Post Office by the same name opened soon thereafter. A casino, beach, and fishing pier were added in 1915 and the name of the neighborhood was changed to Howard Beach on April 6, 1916. Development continued and ownership was expanded to a group of investors who sold lots for about $690 each starting in 1922. Development, however, was limited to the areas east of Cross Bay Boulevard near the LIRR station now known as Bernard Coleman Memorial Square (then Lilly Place). The rest of Howard Beach consisted of empty marsh land except for the area to the south of Coleman Square, centered around Russell St. and 102nd St., which consisted of many small fishing bungalows that dotted alongside Hawtree Creek and Jamaica Bay. This area of Howard Beach would retain the name \\"Ramblersville.\\" Despite its close proximity to the Howard Beach station at Coleman Square, the LIRR would establish a station a quarter of a mile south down the line at Hamilton Beach in 1919. After World War II, Queens and Long Island went through a major suburban building boom leading to the marsh land west of Cross Bay Boulevard to be filled in. This led to the development of many Cape-Cod and High-Ranch style houses on 50 and 60 x 100 lots. This area was developed as \\"Rockwood Park\\" to the north and \\"Spring Park\\" to the south, together comprising what would be known as \\"New Howard Beach\\", while the area east of the boulevard became known as \\"Old Howard Beach.\\" In the early 1950s farm land north of Rockwood Park was developed with the building of many red-bricked two-story garden style cooperative apartments along with some six-story co-op and condo apartment buildings. A number of private two-family houses were also built in this neighborhood, which was named Lindenwood. The various neighborhoods continued to be developed through the 1960s and 1970s as Cross Bay Boulevard became the area's main shopping district. During the 1990s and 2000s, there was further high-scale development as many of the area's old houses were torn down and replaced with upscale million-dollar mini-mansions. =Post-1980s= Hate crimes In 1986 and 2005, two highly publicized hate crimes took place in Howard Beach. On December 20, 1986, one African-American man was killed and another was beaten in Howard Beach. The racially charged incident heightened racial tensions in New York City. The dead man was 23-year-old Michael Griffith, a Trinidadian native living in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He was killed December 20, 1986 when he was accidentally hit by a car after having been chased onto a highway by a mob of white youths who had beaten him and his friends for being in their neighborhood. On June 29, 2005, local white men in Howard Beach attacked three African-American men with baseball bats. One victim was injured seriously enough to be hospitalized, and the police arrested two of the perpetrators in the case. Nicholas Minucci claimed that the victims had attempted to rob him. On June 10, 2006, Minucci, 20, who had uttered a racial epithet during the baseball bat attack, was found guilty of robbery and the racially motivated assault of Glenn Moore. On July 17, 2006, Minucci was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Hurricane Sandy As Hurricane Sandy approached New York on October 28, 2012, city officials ordered the evacuation of residents of Zone A (low-lying, susceptible to storm surge) neighborhoods, which included Howard Beach's Hamilton Beach area. Most of the rest of Howard Beach lay in Zone B, whose residents were urged to voluntarily evacuate. Many residents decided to stay and ride out the storm, citing the relatively minor damage caused by the previous year's Hurricane Irene. Sandy made landfall on October 29, dragging inland a ten-foot-high storm surge from Jamaica Bay that flooded all of Old and New Howard Beach, plus the neighborhoods of Broad Channel and the Rockaways, along with some sections of Lindenwood and neighboring Ozone Park. The storm knocked out power to Howard Beach for three weeks. The flooding damaged most houses in the neighborhood, all of the stores along Cross Bay Boulevard, the Howard Beach‚ÄìJFK Airport subway station, and the IND Rockaway Line trestle that carries trains over Jamaica Bay into Broad Channel and the Rockaways. After Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the New York City Office of Emergency Management provisionally re-classified Howard Beach, along with the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Gerritsen Beach and Red Hook, as Zone A neighborhoods. On April 5, 2013, the Howard Beach post office reopened after extensive repairs. Geography Cross Bay Boulevard Coleman Square Like many New York City neighborhoods, Howard Beach is composed of several smaller neighborhoods ‚Äì Howard Beach, Old Howard Beach, Hamilton Beach, Ramblersville, Spring Park, Rockwood Park, Lindenwood, and Howard Park (Old Howard Beach, Ramblersville, Howard Park, and Hamilton Beach are sometimes all grouped together as \\"Old Howard Beach\\", instead of being referred to by their proper names). Howard Beach proper is a small peninsula bordered by the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue on the north, Jamaica Bay on the south, Hawtree Creek on the east, separating it from Hamilton Beach, and Shellbank Basin on the west, that separates it from Cross Bay Boulevard. Cross Bay Boulevard is the main commercial strip of Howard Beach; to the north it turns into Woodhaven Boulevard after Ozone Park. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the Boulevard was made up almost exclusively of locally owned shops and restaurants. Starting in the 1990s, chain stores and restaurants began moving in, and now many well- known franchises have sites on the boulevard. Entertainment venues on Cross Bay Boulevard, such as the Kiddie-Park and Cross-Bay Lanes, were popular until their collapse in the 1970s and 1980s. The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge (named for a deceased member of the United States House of Representatives who once represented the district that includes Howard Beach) carries the boulevard over Jamaica Bay, connecting mainland Queens to Broad Channel. Bernard Coleman Memorial Square (colloquially known as Coleman Square) is a small plaza near the Howard Beach ‚Äì JFK Airport station. A memorial was erected here to servicemen from Howard Beach who died in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. =Hamilton Beach= Hamilton Beach is a middle class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. Its boundaries are the 102nd Street Creek to the north, the IND Rockaway Line () tracks and JFK Airport to the east, Hawtree Creek to the west, and Jamaica Bay to the south. Hamilton Beach is one of the few communities in New York City that has its own volunteer fire department. Hamilton Beach is frequently referred to as West Hamilton Beach. East Hamilton Beach was on the east side of the Long Island Rail Road tracks, but the area was taken by the City for expansion of Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport) in the 1940s. Hamilton Beach bears no relation to the Hamilton Beach Company other than the name. The company is named after a Mr. Hamilton and a Mr. Beach. Until the mid-1950s there was a Hamilton Beach station on the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch. The station closed on June 27, 1955 in connection with the LIRR's sale of much of the branch's right of way to the New York City Transit Authority. Hamilton Beach is a small community that has one long strip (104th Street) with ten dead-end blocks connected to it. It is surrounded mostly by water. There is one way into Hamilton Beach by car and two ways in by foot. It is accessible by a boardwalk that stretches from the A train station at Coleman Square to 104th Street, or by the Hawtree Basin pedestrian bridge, which is between two of the ten blocks. This bridge connects Hamilton and Old Howard Beach. Hamilton has a small park at the southern end, which includes a 200-foot baseball field, a handball court, a small jungle gym area and beach. Gateways Hamilton Beach Park, just south of 165th Avenue, is the last stop for the Q11 bus. When unincorporated, Hamilton Beach was once an area with dirt roads, cottage or shack-type houses (bungalows), and no sewer system. Since the early 21st century, Hamilton Beach has been \\"building up\\", and new houses are under construction on almost every block. =Lindenwood= Lindenwood is a section of Howard Beach, developed in the 1950s and 1960s on landfill property. Lindenwood is considered to be part of New Howard Beach (the newer side, as opposed to Old Howard Beach). It is primarily made up of six-story, orange- or red-brick apartment buildings, constructed in the early to mid-1960s; smaller co-op \\"garden-apartments\\" (four-unit red-brick buildings) constructed in the 1950s, which can be seen from the Belt Parkway; and two- family homes (some attached) built in the 1960s. The \\"hi-rise\\" apartment buildings are co-op (red bricks) or condominiums (orange brick). Heritage House East and West (84-39 and 84-29 153rd Avenue) were among the first condominium apartment buildings in New York State. Additional townhouses near the Brooklyn border were built in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. The hi-rises used to be considered very family friendly. But since then, many of the apartment building playgrounds have been converted into sitting areas and no longer allow even dogs. Lindenwood's residents tend to be of mostly ethnic Jewish and Italians, along with some ethnic Hispanics. In the middle of the neighborhood is P.S. 232, an elementary school built in the early 1960s (and now known as the Walter Ward School, named after the neighborhood's late longtime City councilman) and the Lindenwood Shopping Center, which consists of a supermarket and about 20 stores. In the early 1970s, a second supermarket called the Village was located behind the shopping center. After failing, the building became a mall, flea market, bingo hall and private school before finally becoming a walk-in medical center. There is also a second small strip mall on Linden Boulevard, adjacent to the Lindenwood Diner. When the Jewish population was more numerous, they had a synagogue named Temple Judea in Lindenwood, located on 153rd Ave and 80th Street. The building was converted into apartments when the temple merged with what was then the Howard Beach Jewish Center in Rockwood Park. The neighborhood used to have two pool clubs, one on 88th Street and 151st Ave. These buildings were converted to walk-up apartments in the early 1970s. Another, across from 232, was redeveloped in 1980 into townhouses, adjacent to a branch of Queens County Savings Bank (formerly Columbia Savings Bank). There used to be a tennis \\"bubble\\" on 153rd Ave and 79th Street, that had been developed around 1980. =Old Howard Beach= Old Howard Beach is a section of Howard Beach that lies between Shellbank Basin and Hawtree Creek to the east of Cross Bay Boulevard. Coleman Square, Wetzel Triangle and Frank M. Charles Park are located in Old Howard Beach. The area is locally referred to as \\"Old Howard Beach\\" since it was the original place in which founder William Howard built his famous hotel, and later the area's first houses in the 1920s. The current housing in Old Howard Beach consists of several different types of houses. Those located near the former Howard Beach General Hospital (built in 1962) are mainly 1950s and 1960s detached two-family homes, while the areas near Coleman Square, Frank M. Charles Park, and Shellbank Basin contain primarily single-family homes. The Q11 bus serves the neighborhood. =Ramblersville= Circa 1900 photograph of Ramblersville by William M. Vander Weyde (1871‚Äì1929) Ramblersville is a section of greater Howard Beach, being a small neighborhood of about a dozen blocks between Hawtree Creek and JFK Airport.Six photographs by William M. Vander Weyde, American (1871(?)-1929) Ramblin' in Ramblersville, Forgotten New YorkNewman, Andy. \\"New York Today: Mr. de Blasio Goes to Albany\\". The New York Times. February 25, 2015. It is nearly surrounded by waterways leading into nearby Jamaica Bay. It is bordered by on the north by 160th Avenue, on the west by Hawtree Creek, across which is Old Howard Beach; on the east by the New York City Subway's Rockaway Line (, beyond which is Bergen Basin and the airport; and on the south by the 102nd Street Creek. Crossing the creek, 102nd Street reaches Hamilton Beach at Russell Street. The size of the neighborhood is about on each side, and it notably lacks the rectangular street grid of the surrounding neighborhoods. Ramblersville, which once considered itself independent of New York City when the city was first unified, is purportedly the oldest neighborhood in what later became known as Howard Beach. A 1905 article from The Washington Post said that all the houses were built on stilts and the population was one-thousand in the summer and a dozen in the winter.\\"Venice in New York: Oddities of Ramblersville on a Jamaica Bay Creek\\". The Washington Post. July 30, 1905. p. A8. In 1962, the neighborhood's private water mains were replaced by the city; the neighborhood had 130 families at the time.\\"Section of Queens to Get New Mains\\". The New York Times. July 7, 1962. p. 8. In 2001, The New York Times reported that the neighborhood \\"resembles a cozy fishing village with its pebbled streets and wooden bungalows built on pilings... [T]all grass... surrounds many of its marshy fields.\\" Fishing was a large industry in the tiny neighborhood. Ramblersville still has streets named Broadway, Church, and Bridge. Just north of Ramblersville is 159th Drive, also known as Remsen Place, named after Jeromus Remsen, a Revolutionary War officer. This area, near the current subway station, was known as \\"Remsen's Landing\\" at the time. Before the Howard Beach development was named in 1916, the entire area was commonly known as \\"Ramblersville\\", including Hamilton Beach to the south on Jamaica Bay, and Old Howard Beach to the west. The Howard Beach ‚Äì JFK Airport subway stop was originally the \\"Ramblersville Station\\" on the Long Island Rail Road. Ramblersville is the smallest neighborhood in New York City in terms of real estate per square foot. =Rockwood Park= Rockwood Park is a section of Howard Beach that mainly consists of single family homes and is considered to be a more upper class section of Howard Beach. It is part of what is commonly referred to as \\"New Howard\\" by many residents. The area is situated between 78th and 92nd Streets (these are north-south streets) and 156th and 165th Avenues (the east-west streets). The Q41 and Q21 serve Rockwood Park. To the west of 78th Street, the last street in the neighborhood, lies Spring Creek Park in which lies the border between Brooklyn and Queens. The area remained primarily undeveloped during the first half of the 1900s. After the Second World War marsh land west of Cross Bay Boulevard was filled in, which led to the building of many Cape Cod-style houses in the area, followed later on in the 1960s and 1970s by high ranch-style houses. Becoming known as a more upscale section of Howard Beach led the area to become the home of many known mob figures, most notably Gambino crime family boss John Gotti who lived on 85th Street. Starting in the late 1980s and through the 2000s, Rockwood Park began to go through another building boom. Many of the area's old Cape Cod- style houses were demolished and replaced with upscale million dollar mini- mansions. Another famous resident was folk singer Woody Guthrie, who lived at 159-13 85th Street with his family after moving from Coney Island.

Burt Kennedy directed the film based on a screenplay by Frank Cappello. The film was originally titled Urban Commando, and was intended for Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger. When these two opted to make Twins (1988), the script was bought by New Line Cinema as the follow-up to another Hulk Hogan film, No Holds Barred. Plot Interstellar warrior Shep Ramsey (Hulk Hogan) is on a mission to capture intergalactic despot General Suitor (William Ball). The general has kidnapped President Hashina, the ruler of an entire planet. Shep boards Suitor's flagship but is unable to rescue Hashina, who is killed by Suitor. Wounded by Hashina in the process, Suitor transforms into a berserk reptilian creature. Shep barely escapes, but is able to blow up the ship as he does so. Due to his failure to save the President, Shep's superior officer (Roy Dotrice) suggests that he is \\"stressed out\\" and should take a vacation. Annoyed, Shep accidentally smashes his control systems and is forced to crash land on Earth, where he realizes he will have to stay until his spaceship repairs itself. Shep has little knowledge of Earth's customs, and his temper and sense of justice cause problems with everyone he meets, especially a mime artist he tries to help in various comical fashions, such as freeing him from his 'invisible box'. Charlie Wilcox (Christopher Lloyd) is a weak-willed architect working for the fawning and hypocritical Adrian Beltz (Larry Miller). His wife Jenny (Shelley Duvall) unsuccessfully encourages him to stand up for himself and tell Charlie to ask Beltz for a raise since the bills are now very expensive. Charlie went to ask for a raise to Beltz, but he chickened out. In order to help out financially, she rents out Charlie's hobby shed as a vacation cabin, which Shep leases. Shep's appearance and behavior make Charlie nervous, and he begins to spy on his guest. He soon discovers Shep's advanced equipment and begins experimenting with it, not knowing that the power sources are traceable and its whereabouts tracked by Suitor's men. They send a pair of intergalactic bounty hunters after Shep. Shep also requires several rare crystals to fix his ship, the closest samples of which can be found in Beltz's office. Charlie helps Shep get into his boss's office during a company party before the bounty hunters corner them. After winning a furious fight, Shep and Charlie head home to repair the ship. After the bounty hunters' defeat, Suitor, who has escaped the destruction of his ship, arrives on Earth. He takes Charlie's family hostage, forcing Charlie to lead him to Shep. Suitor begins torturing Shep, enjoying himself before he intends to kill the warrior. Finding his courage, Charlie injures Suitor, who then turns into his monstrous form. Physically outmatched, Shep is forced to set his ship to self-destruct. He and Charlie manage to escape the ship's explosion, which destroys Suitor for good. Shep leaves Earth using the bounty hunters' ship. He takes Beltz's secretary, Margie, with him, hoping for a quiet family life. Charlie, however, has become bolder from his experiences; he appears in Beltz's office the following morning, shouting at his boss in front of witnesses, and finally quits his thankless job even after being loyal to him and not without raise or promotion. Later, Charlie solves his final problem by using one of Shep's weapons to destroy an annoying set of traffic lights that never changed at the right time, receiving cheers from the other motorists.

Roger Ebert noted, \\"This is the second feature starring Hulk Hogan, the man who looks like a comic strip hero. Hogan's range is limited, but not as limited as the movies he's appeared in. Despite the fact that his public image is often aimed at children - there's a whole line of Hulk Hogan toys - his first film, 'No Holds Barred' (1989) was surprisingly violent, sexist and blood-soaked. Now here's 'Suburban Commando,' which is at least innocuous, but which gives the Hulkster so little to do that his fans may wonder why he bothered.\\" Michael Wilmington opened his review for it in the Los Angeles Times by saying that all the main personnel were \\"likeable\\" but that \\"all that likability combined, or even cubed, doesn't create any pressing reason to pay admission to \\"Suburban Commando\\" (citywide)--unless you're an obsessed movie completist or a sudden cloudburst drives you to shelter.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times', noted that despite the fact that it \\"has little narrative continuity, it is well paced and has an amusingly sour performance by Larry Miller as the kind of boss you love to hate.\\" References External links  Category:1991 films Category:1990s science fiction comedy films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:American space adventure films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Burt Kennedy Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Internet memes Category:1991 comedy films ","title":"Suburban Commando"},{"id":"849322","text":"Chetham's Library in Manchester, England, is the oldest free public reference library in the English-speaking world.Nicholls (2004), p. 20. Chetham's Hospital, which contains both the library and Chetham's School of Music, was established in 1653 under the will of Humphrey Chetham (1580-1653), for the education of \\"the sons of honest, industrious and painful parents\\", and a library for the use of scholars. The library has been in continuous use since 1653. It operates as an independent charity, open to readers free of charge, Monday-Friday 09.00-12.30 and 13.30-16.30 by prior appointment. Tours of the Library for visitors are bookable online from 2 September 2019 via the Library website.

History The 15th-century Baronial Hall next to Chetham's Library The manor house of the Lord of the Manor, in the centre of the medieval town of Manchester, stood on a sandstone bluff, at the confluence of the River Irwell and the River Irk. In 1421 the rector of the parish church, Thomas de la Warre (Lord of the manor of Manchester), obtained a licence from Henry V to refound the church as a collegiate foundation. He donated his manor house for use as the college of priests' buildings for the collegiate church (later to be the cathedral). There was accommodation for the warden, eight fellows, four clerks, and six choristers. The Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys was built between the church and the college buildings between 1515 and 1518. The college was dissolved in 1547 by the Chantries Act and sold to the Earl of Derby. It was re-founded as a catholic foundation by Queen Mary and again disbanded by Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. In 1578 the collegiate church was re-founded by charter as Christ's College and re-occupied by the warden and fellows. In the Civil War it was used as a prison and arsenal. In 1653 the college buildings were bought with the bequest of Humphrey Chetham, for use as a free library and blue coat charity school. At that time there was no facility for independent study in the north of England and Chetham's will of 1651 had stipulated that the Library should be \\"for the use of schollars and others well affected\\", and instructed the librarian \\"to require nothing of any man that cometh into the library\\". The twenty four feoffees appointed by Humphrey Chetham set out to acquire a major collection of books and manuscripts that would cover the whole range of available knowledge and would rival the college libraries of Oxford and Cambridge. In order to protect the newly acquired books from rising damp the Library was housed on the first floor and, in accordance with the provisions of Chetham's will, the books were chained to the presses (bookcases). Twenty-four carved oak stools with 'S'-shaped hand-holds (which are still in use) were provided as seats for readers. In 1718 the feoffees offered the Manchester poet and inventor of a system of shorthand, John Byrom, the post of Library Keeper. Byrom, who was an avid collector of books, declined the offer but after his good friend, Robert Thyer, became Librarian in 1732, frequently acted as an agent for the library, purchasing books at London auctions. Byrom's library, which included the manuscript of his poem \\"Christmas Day\\" (which became the Christmas carol, \\"Christians Awake\\") and some 2,800 printed books, was presented to the library by his descendant, Eleanora Atherton, in 1870. The books were originally uncatalogued and placed in the presses in size order. The first catalogue wasn't produced until 1791, and then was written in Latin and only listed the size and subject of each book. The practice of chaining the books was abandoned in the mid eighteenth century when gates were erected to prevent theft. The window alcove in which Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels worked Chetham's was the meeting place of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels when Marx visited Manchester in the summer of 1845. Facsimiles of the economics books they studied can be seen on a table in the window alcove where they would meet. The research they undertook during this series of visits to the library led ultimately to their work, The Communist Manifesto. Therefore, the library acts as a site of historical importance for visiting communists. Additions were made to the buildings by J. E. Gregan (1850s), Alfred Waterhouse (1878) (grade II listed), and J. Medland Taylor (1883-95). Manchester Grammar School was extended along Long Millgate in 1870. Manchester Grammar School moved to Fallowfield in the 1930s, and after standing empty for many years the original building was destroyed during the Second World War, leaving only its new block. This became part of Chetham's School of Music in 1978. The old college building, which became the music school in 1969, still incorporates Chetham's Library and is Grade I listed. =Librarians= Past librarians include Robert Thyer (1709‚Äì1781), who became Librarian in 1732.Among his works was The Genuine Remains in Verse and Prose of Mr. Samuel Butler, author of Hudibras; Published from the original manuscripts, formerly in the possession of W.

Thomas Jones held the position from 1845 to 1875; during his time, the size of the library more than doubled (from 19,000 volumes to 40,000 volumes). He also produced a two-volume catalogue of the library's collection in 1862 and 1863.Radcliffe, John Bibliotheca chethamensis: Bibliothecae publicae Mancuniensis ab Humfredo Chetham, armigero fundatae catalogus, exhibens libros in varias classes pro varietate argumenti distributos; [begun by John Radcliffe, continued by Thomas Jones]. 5 vols.

Explorations P√©ron was born in C√©rilly, Allier, in 1775, the son of a tailor (not a harness maker as is frequently asserted). Although intended for the priesthood, due to the Revolution, P√©ron reluctantly joined the 2nd Allier Volunteer Battalion in 1792 and helped defend besieged Landau. In the following year he was wounded and taken prisoner by Prussian forces near Hochspeyer in the Pfalzwald. Imprisoned in the fortress of Magdeburg he was not repatriated to France until 1794. Having lost the sight of an eye, P√©ron was invalided out of the army. For two years he was Town Clerk in C√©rilly before gaining a scholarship to study medicine in Paris. In 1800, after an unhappy love affair, he sought to join Nicolas Baudin's expedition to Australian waters as an anthropological observer. Instead he was appointed as a trainee zoologist. During the voyage, which charted significant stretches of the Australian coast between 1801 and 1803, P√©ron clashed repeatedly with Baudin. When Stanislas Levillain and Ren√© Maug√© died, P√©ron rose to prominence as the sole remaining zoologist. (Baudin had already lost numerous officers, sailors, savants and artists who deserted in Mauritius.) With the aid of the artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur, P√©ron was largely responsible for gathering some 100,000 zoological specimens‚Äîthe most comprehensive Australian natural history collection to date. Although he died before he could fully study his specimens, P√©ron made a major contribution to the foundations of the natural sciences in Australia and was a prescient ecological thinker. He was also a pioneer oceanographer who conducted important experiments on sea water temperatures at depth. As a Corresponding Member of the Soci√©t√© des observateurs de l'homme, P√©ron wrote a great deal about the Tasmanian Aborigines of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, on south- eastern Tasmania. Within 30 years almost all were dead through disease and war. The Australian historian Edward Duyker has shown that he has been unfairly accused of polygenism and racism, mainly because of a mistranslation of extracts from one of his scientific papers. Baudin died before he could return to France, and it was P√©ron who began writing the official account of the expedition: Voyage de d√©couvertes aux Terres Australes. In doing so, he committed a great injustice to his former commander's memory by magnifying his faults and frequently distorting the historical record. In the wake of the resumed fighting between France and Britain, P√©ron also drafted a secret M√©moire sur les √©tablissements anglais √† la Nouvelle Hollande, which advocated a French conquest of Port Jackson with the aid of rebellious Irish convicts. P√©ron died of tuberculosis in his hometown of C√©rilly in 1810. He was just thirty-five years old. The task of completing the official account of the expedition fell to Louis de Freycinet.

The specific epithet also honors Charles Alexandre Lesueur of the Baudin expedition. Taxa described by P√©ron In the 1807 first volume of Voyage de d√©couvertes aux Terres Australes, P√©ron described a number of frog species collected on his travels, but most are considered incertae sedis today i.e. Rana pollicifera and Rana pustulosa in Anura, Hyla ianopoda, Hyla nebulosa, Hyla ocellata and Hyla rubeola in Hylidae : Pelodryadinae, and Bufo leucogaster and Bufo proteus in Myobatrachidae. Hyla cyanea was synonymised with Litoria caerulea (White, 1790) - White's treefrog, but Hyla citripoda does survive as a valid species, Litoria citropa (P√©ron, 1807) - Blue Mountains treefrog.

During his 40-year career, Bass worked for some of Hollywood's most prominent filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese. Among his best known title sequences are the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm for Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm, the credits racing up and down what eventually becomes a high-angle shot of a skyscraper in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and the disjointed text that races together and apart in Psycho. Bass designed some of the most iconic corporate logos in North America, including the Bell System logo in 1969, as well as AT&T;'s globe logo in 1983 after the breakup of the Bell System. He also designed Continental Airlines' 1968 jet stream logo and United Airlines' 1974 tulip logo, which became some of the most recognized airline industry logos of the era. He died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Los Angeles on April 25, 1996, at the age of 75. Early life Saul Bass was born on May 8, 1920 in the Bronx, New York, United States, to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents. He graduated from James Monroe High School in the Bronx and studied part-time at the Art Students League in Manhattan until attending night classes with Gy√∂rgy Kepes at Brooklyn College. In 1938, Saul married Ruth Cooper and they had two children, Robert in 1942 and Andrea in 1946. He began his time in Hollywood in the 1940s, designing print advertisements for films including Champion (1949), Death of a Salesman (1951) and The Moon Is Blue (1953), directed by Otto Preminger. His next collaboration with Preminger was to design a film poster for his 1954 film Carmen Jones. Preminger was so impressed with Bass's work that he asked him to produce the title sequence as well. This was when Bass first saw the opportunity to create a title sequence which would ultimately enhance the experience of the audience and contribute to the mood and the theme of the movie within the opening moments. Bass was one of the first to realize the creative potential of the opening and closing credits of a movie. Film title sequences Bass became widely known in the film industry after creating the title sequence for Otto Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm (1955). The subject of the film was a jazz musician's struggle to overcome his heroin addiction, a taboo subject in the mid-1950s. Bass decided to create an innovative title sequence to match the film's controversial subject. He chose the arm as the central image, as it is a strong image relating to heroin addiction. The titles featured an animated, white on black paper cut-out arm of a heroin addict. As he hoped, it caused quite a sensation. Screen image from Saul Bass's title sequence from Anatomy of a Murder For Alfred Hitchcock, Bass provided effective, memorable title sequences, inventing a new type of kinetic typography, for North by Northwest (1959), Vertigo (1958), working with John Whitney, and Psycho (1960). It was this kind of innovative, revolutionary work that made Bass a revered graphic designer. Before the advent of Bass's title sequences in the 1950s, titles were generally static, separate from the movie, and it was common for them to be projected onto the cinema curtains, the curtains only being raised right before the first scene of the movie. In 1960, Bass wrote an article for Graphis magazine called \\"Film Titles ‚Äì a New Field for the Graphic Designer,\\" which has been revered as a milestone for \\"the consecration of the movie credit sequence as a design object.\\" One of the most studied film credit designers, Bass is known for integrating a stylistic coherence between the designs and the films in which they appear. Bass once described his main goal for his title sequences as being to \\"try to reach for a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes the essence of the story\\".Kael, Pauline. \\"One, Two, Three.\\" Film Quarterly Vol. 15, No. 3. (Spring, 1962): 62‚Äì65 Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as \\"making the ordinary extraordinary\\" can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape.Bass, Saul (1977) Bass on Titles. Pyramid Films. Santa Monica, CA In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for the Best Picture Oscar winner Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences. In 1955, Elaine Makatura came to work with Bass in his Los Angeles office. With the opening to Spartacus (1960), she was directing and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the couple married, beginning more than 30 years of close collaboration. After the birth of their children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 30 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from Bunraku-style maneuvers in Spartacus (1960), live-action sequences in Walk on the Wild Side (1962), to time-lapse photography in The Age of Innocence (1993), and even chopped liver in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These \\"time before\\" title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to Grand Prix (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to The Big Country (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to The Victors (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins. From the mid-1960s to the late '80s, Saul and Elaine moved away from main titles to focus on filmmaking and their children. About this time away from title design, Saul said: In the 1980s, Saul and Elaine were rediscovered by James L. Brooks and Martin Scorsese, who had grown up admiring their film work. For Scorsese, Saul and Elaine Bass created title sequences for Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), The Age of Innocence (1993), and Casino (1995), their last title sequence. This later work with Martin Scorsese saw the Basses move away from the optical techniques that Saul had pioneered and move into the use of computerized effects. The Basses' title sequences featured new and innovative methods of production and startling graphic design. Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi said of Saul and Elaine Bass, \\"You write a book of 300 to 400 pages and then you boil it down to a script of maybe 100 to 150 pages. Eventually you have the pleasure of seeing that the Basses have knocked you right out of the ballpark. They have boiled it down to four minutes flat.\\"Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.263 In a sense, all modern opening title sequences that introduce the mood or theme of a film can be seen as a legacy of the Basses' innovative work. In particular, title sequences for some recent movies and television series, especially those whose setting is during the 1960s, have purposely emulated the graphic style of Saul Bass's animated sequences from the 1950s.

The most common cause of the end of a Bass corporate logo (in the selection analyzed) was the demise or merger of the company, rather than a corporate logo redesign. The average lifespan of a Bass logo is more than 34 years. In 2014, Frontier Airlines resurrected the stylized F logo originally designed for Frontier by Bass in 1978, and discontinued when the airlines when bankrupt in 1984. Movie posters The Man with the Golden Arm poster designed by Bass Saul Bass designed emblematic movie posters that transformed the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass's seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters were dominated by depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass's posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for The Man with the Golden Arm, with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic Vertigo (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), featuring the silhouette of a corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film's title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed. He created some of his best known posters for films directed by Otto Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and Stanley Kubrick among others. His last commissioned film poster was created for Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993), but it was never distributed.Kirkham, Pat & Jennifer Bass (2011) Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design (pp. 406 and 420). London: Laurence King His poster work spanned five decades and inspired numerous other poster and graphic designers. Bass's film posters are characterized by a distinctive typography and minimalistic style.

Designer Art Sims claimed that it was made as an homage, but Bass regarded it as theft.Schaefer, Stephen (September 08, 1995). \\"Poster Imposter\\". Entertainment Weekly. 2011-04-02. Many film posters have been considered to be homages to Saul Bass's posters. Some recent examples include the theatrical release poster for Burn After Reading (2008) which incorporates Bass's typography and style of figurative minimalism, and a poster for Precious (2009) which includes elements from several of Bass's posters, including Anatomy of a Murder. The cover art for The White Stripes' single The Hardest Button to Button is clearly inspired by the Bass poster for The Man with the Golden Arm. The comic book artist J. H. Williams III's designs for the Batman story \\"The Black Glove\\" pay homage to Bass's designs as well.Singer, Marc. Grant Morrison: Combining the Worlds of Contemporary Comics. (Univ. Press of Mississippi, Jackson, MS, 2012) p. 272. Link at Google Books. In addition to movie posters, Bass designed numerous posters for film festivals, and several magazine, book, and album covers. He also designed five Academy Award Presentation posters and the Student Academy Award for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\\"Student Academy Award\\". Oscars.org. Retrieved 2011-12-20. In 1962 he illustrated his only children's book, Henri's Walk to Paris, written by Lenore Klein. Filmmaker During the 1960s, Bass was asked by directors and producers to produce not only title sequences for their films, but also to visualize and storyboard key scenes and sequences within them. Bass has the unusual credit of \\"visual consultant\\" or \\"pictorial consultant\\" on five films. For Spartacus (1960), Bass as \\"visual consultant\\" designed key elements of the gladiator school and storyboarded the final battle between slaves and Romans. John Frankenheimer, the director of Grand Prix (1966), had Bass storyboard, direct, and edit all but one of the racing sequences for his film. For West Side Story (1961) Bass filmed the prologue, storyboarded the opening dance sequence, and created the ending title sequence. It is Bass's credited role as \\"pictorial consultant\\" for Alfred Hitchcock on Psycho (1960); however, that has caused some controversy and debate. Bass claimed that he participated in directing the highlight scene of Psycho, the tightly edited shower-murder sequence, though several on set at the time (including star Janet Leigh) disputed this claim.Harris, Aisha (February 20, 2014) \\"Did Saul Bass Direct the Shower Scene in Psycho?\\" Slate.com. Retrieved 2014-2-23 The research of several film scholars on Hitchcock's production of Psycho validates the claim that Bass in his capacity as a graphic artist did indeed have a significant influence on the visual design and pacing of that famous scene. Hitchcock had asked Bass to design and produce storyboards for the shower murder scene and for some other scenes in the film. For this, Bass received a credit as Pictorial Consultant as well as Title Designer. Janet Leigh told Donald Spoto that \\"the planning of the shower scene was left up to Saul Bass, and Hitchcock followed his storyboard precisely. Because of this ... [the shooting] went very professionally,\\"Spoto, Donald (1999 [1983]). The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcock. New York: Da Capo Press. (pp. 454‚Äì455) and she told Stephen Rebello that \\"Mr. Hitchcock showed Saul Bass's storyboards to me quite proudly, telling me in exact detail how he was going to shoot the scene from Saul's plans\\".Rebello, Stephen (1990). Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. (p. 102) . Bill Krohn has noted that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene introduced all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene ‚Äì most notably, the fact that the attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo.Krohn, Bill (2003). Hitchcock at Work. (pp. London: Phaidon Press. (p. 231) Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene. Bass introduced the idea of using a montage of fast cuts and tight framing to render a violent, bloody murder as an impressionistic and nearly bloodless one. Hitchcock felt uncertain about Bass's conception of the scene fearing that audiences might not accept such a stylized and quickly cut sequence. In an interview with film historian Pat Kirkham, Bass recalled, \\"Having designed and storyboarded the shower sequence, I showed it to Hitch. He was uneasy about it. It was very un-Hitchcockian in character. He never used that kind of quick cutting; he loved the long shot\\". To convince Hitchcock that the scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting of the final shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh's stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray of blood on the chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed. In 1964, Saul and his wife and creative partner Elaine directed the short film The Searching Eye shown during the 1964 New York World's Fair, co-produced with Sy Wexler. The Basses also directed a short documentary film called Why Man Creates which won the Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject in 1968.‚ÄúWhy Man Creates‚Äù: Saul Bass‚Äôs short film on the nature of creativity‚ÄîNight Flight An abbreviated version of that film was broadcast on the first episode of the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes. In 2002, this film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Saul and Elaine directed several other short films, two of which were nominated for Academy Awards: Notes on the Popular Arts, in 1977, and The Solar Film, in 1979. In 1974, Saul Bass made his only feature-length film as a director, the visually splendid though little-known science fiction film Phase IV, a \\"quiet, haunting, beautiful, ... and largely overlooked, science-fiction masterwork\\".Scalzo, Thomas (August 8, 2005). \\"Phase IV (review)\\".

History The command first appeared in Version 3 Unix and is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. The version of \`split\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund and Richard Stallman. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. Usage The command-syntax is: split [OPTION] [INPUT [PREFIX The default behavior of \`split\` is to generate output files of a fixed size, default 1000 lines. The files are named by appending aa, ab, ac, etc. to output filename. If output filename is not given, the default filename of x is used, for example, xaa, xab, etc. When a hyphen (-) is used instead of input filename, data is derived from standard input. The files are typically rejoined using a utilitity such as cat. Additional program options permit a maximum character count (instead of a line count), a maximum line length, how many incrementing characters in generated filenames, and whether to use letters or digits. = Split file into pieces = Create a file named \\"\`myfile.txt\`\\" with exactly 3,000 lines of data: $ head -3000 < /dev/urandom > myfile.txt Now, use the \`split\` command to break this file into pieces (note: unless otherwise specified, \`split\` will break the file into 1,000-line files): $ split myfile.txt $ ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 761K Jun 16 18:17 myfile.txt -rw-r-- r-- 1 root root 242K Jun 16 18:17 xaa -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 263K Jun 16 18:17 xab -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 256K Jun 16 18:17 xac $ wc --lines xa* 1000 xaa 1000 xab 1000 xac 3000 total As seen above, the \`split\` command has broken the original file (keeping the original intact) into three, equal in number of lines (i.e., 1,000), files: \`xaa\`, \`xab\`, and \`xac\`.

They mark the most eastern point of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Location  Old Harry Rocks lies directly east of Studland, about northeast of Swanage, and about south of the large towns of Poole and Bournemouth. To the south are the chalk cliffs of Ballard Down, much of which is owned by the National Trust. The rocks can be viewed from the Dorset section of the South West Coast Path.  Formation  The chalk of Old Harry Rocks used to be part of a long stretch of chalk between Purbeck and the Isle of Wight, but remained as a headland after large parts of this seam were eroded away. As the headland suffered hydraulic action (a process in which air and water are forced into small cracks by the force of the sea, resulting in enlarging cracks), first caves, then arches formed. The tops of the arches collapsed after being weakened by rainfall and wind, leaving disconnected stacks. One of these stacks is known as Old Harry. Old Harry's Wife was another stack which was eroded through corrosion and abrasion, until the bottom was so weak the top fell away, leaving a stump. Hydraulic action is the main cause of erosion (sheer force of the wave) that damaged the rock and caused it to fall away.  Geology  The downlands of Ballard Down are formed of chalk with some bands of flint, and were formed approximately 66 million years ago. The bands of stone have been gradually eroded over the centuries, some of the earlier stacks having fallen (Old Harry's original wife fell in 1509), while new ones have been formed by the breaching of narrow isthmuses. Across the water to the east The Needles on the Isle of Wight are usually visible. These are also part of the same chalk band and only a few thousand years ago were connected to Ballard Down. To form the stacks, the sea gradually eroded along the joints and bedding planes where the softer chalk meets harder bedrock of the rock formations to create a cave. This eventually eroded right through to create an arch. The arch subsequently collapsed to leave the stacks of Old Harry and his wife, No Man's Land and the gap of St Lucas' Leap. The large outcrop of rock at the end of the cliffs is often referred to as \\"No Man's Land\\". Old Harry is formed by erosion processes, which will eventually remove the stack, whilst new stacks develop. Some people desire to preserve the rocks and protect them from the erosive processes that formed Old Harry. The National Trust, who own the stacks in perpetuity, have experience in looking after the coast, and have found that \\"working with natural processes is the most sustainable approach\\".Shifting Shores. Living with a changing coastline (National Trust)  Legend  There are various stories about the naming of the rocks. One legend says that the Devil (traditionally known euphemistically as \\"Old Harry\\") slept on the rocks. Another local legend says that the rocks were named after Harry Paye, the infamous Poole pirate, whose ship hid behind the rocks awaiting passing merchantmen. Yet another tale has it that a ninth-century Viking raid was thwarted by a storm and that one of the drowned, Earl Harold, was turned into a pillar of chalk.

While toup√©es and hairpieces are typically associated with male wearers, some women also use hairpieces to lengthen existing hair, or cover a partially exposed scalp. The desire to wear hairpieces is caused in part by a long-standing bias against balding that crosses cultures, dating to at least 3100 BC. Toup√©e manufacturers' financial results indicate that toup√©e use is in overall decline, due in part to alternative methods for dealing with baldness, and to greater cultural acceptance of the condition.  Toup√©es and wigs  While most toup√©es are small and designed to cover bald spots at the top and back of the head, large toup√©es are not unknown. Toup√©es are often referred to as hairpieces, units, or hair systems. Many women now wear hairpieces rather than full wigs if their hair loss is confined to the top and crown of their heads. Etymology According to various sources referenced by Dictionary.com, toup√©e is related to the French words \\"top,\\" or \\"tuft;\\" tuft as the curl or lock of hair at the top of the head, not necessarily relating to covering baldness. Toup√©e is related to the diminutive toupe more recently (as of the 17th century).\\"toupee.\\" Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. 13 Aug. 2007. .\\"toupee.\\" Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 13 Aug. 2007. . History An engraving of Julius Caesar showing both pattern baldness and signature wreath, which he used to cover his scalp. While wigs have a very long and somewhat traceable history, the origin of the \\"toup√©e\\" is more difficult to define, but one can reasonably infer that the first toup√©e was a piece of hair, worn on the head, with the intention of deceiving the viewer into believing the hair was natural, rather than a wig worn for decorative or ceremonial purposes. =Use and attitudes in ancient history= The desire for men to wear hairpieces is a response to a long- standing cultural bias against balding men that crosses cultures. Between 1 BC and AD 1, the Roman poet Ovid wrote Ars Amatoria (\\"The Art of Love\\") in which he expressed \\"Ugly are hornless bulls, a field without grass is an eyesore, So is a tree without leaves, so is a head without hair.\\" Another example of this bias, in a later and different culture, can be found in The Arabian Nights (c. AD 800-900), in which the female character Scheherazade asks \\"Is there anything more ugly in the world than a man beardless and bald as an artichoke?\\"Book Review of Looking Good, author?, New York Times, date? (registration required) The earliest known example of a toup√©e was found in a tombThe Ancient Near East, Amelie Kuhrt, Routledge, September 1995, ISBN ? near the ancient Predynastic capital of Egypt, Hierakonpolis. The tomb and its contents date to ca. 3200 ‚Äì 3100 BC. At least two ancient Greek statues of men wearing toup√©es survive today, one identified as a Capitoline type, presently located in Thorvaldsens Museum in Copenhagen.Ancient Greek Portrait Sculpture: Contexts, Subjects, and Styles, Sheila Dillon, Cambridge University Press, 2006 ISBN ? Julius Caesar is known to have worn a toup√©e. In dismay at his pattern baldness, he tried both wearing a toup√©e, and shaving his head.\\"Change and Permanence in Men's Clothes\\", A. Hyatt Mayor, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 8, No. 9 (May, 1950), pp. 262-269 Some state that he wore his trademark ceremonial wreath to disguise his shrinking hairline. Roman men of the era were also known to paint their bald heads to appear to have locks of hair. =19th century= In the United States, toup√©e use (as opposed to wigs) grew in the 19th century. One researcher has noted that this is in part due to a shift in perceptions over the perceived value of aging that occurred at that time. Men chose to attempt to appear younger, and toup√©es were one method used. > ...since 1800, the U.S. Census generally shows far more 39-year-olds than > 40-year-olds. Furthermore, the costume of men switched from a design clearly > intended to make the young look older to one that was clearly intended to > make the old look younger. For example, this era saw the decline of the wig > and the rise of the toup√©e.TEXT ANALYSIS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES; Edited by > CARL W. ROBERTS; Iowa State University; LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOCIATES, > PUBLISHERS, 1997 Mahwah, New Jersey, page 19 > https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d;=88053789 =20th century= By the 1950s, it was estimated that over 350,000 U.S. men wore hairpieces, out of a potential 15 million wearers. Toup√©e manufacturers helped to build credibility for their product starting in 1954, when several makers advertised hairpieces in major magazines and newspapers, with successful results. Key to the promotion and acceptance of toup√©es was improved toup√©e craftsmanship, pioneered by Max Factor. Factor's toup√©es were carefully made and almost invisible, with each strand of hair sewed to a piece of fine flesh-colored lace, and in a variety of long and short hairstyles. Factor, also a Hollywood makeup innovator, was the supplier of choice for most Hollywood actors.\\"Glamour For Sale\\". Time. August 23, 1954 By 1959, total U.S. sales were estimated by Time magazine to be $15 million a year. Sears-Roebuck, which had sold toup√©es as early as 1900 via its mail order catalog, tried to tap into the market by sending out 30,000 special catalogs by direct mail to a targeted list, advertising \\"career winning\\" hair products manufactured by Joseph Fleischer & Co., a respected wig manufacturer.\\"Proper Toppers\\". Time. March 30, 1959 Toup√©es continued to be advertised in print, likely with heavier media buys taking place in magazines with the appropriate male demographic. A typical \\"advertorial\\" can be found in Modern Mechanix. By 1970, Time magazine estimated that in the U.S., toup√©es were worn by more than 2.5 million men out of 17‚Äì20 million balding men. The increase was chalked up once again to further improvements in hairpiece technology, a desire to seem more youthful, and the long hairstyles that were increasingly in fashion.\\"Rugs and Plugs\\". Time. June 10, 1970. =21st century= Toup√©e and wig manufacture is no longer centered in the U.S., but in Asia. Aderans, based in Japan, is one of the world‚Äôs largest wigmakers, with 35% share of the Japanese domestic market. From 2002 to 2004, new orders from Aderans's male customers (both domestic and international) slipped by 30%. Researchers at both the Daiwa Institute and Nomura Research ‚Äì two key Japanese economic research institutes ‚Äì conclude that there is \\"no sign of a recovery\\" for the toup√©e industry. Sales for male wearers have continued to fall at Aderans in every year since, aside from 2016 where they increased slightly. These numbers confirm the media consensus that toup√©e use is in decline overall. No reliable sources have stated numbers for the estimated population of toup√©e users in the U.S. or internationally, so comparisons to past eras are difficult to make with any accuracy. Regardless, hairpiece manufacturers and retailers continue to market their goods in print, on television, and on the internet. Manufacture Toup√©es are often custom made to the needs of the wearer, and can be manufactured using either synthetic or human hair. Toup√©es are usually held to one's head using an adhesive, but the cheaper versions often merely use an elastic band. Toup√©e manufacture is often done at the local level by a craftsman, but large wig manufacturers also produce toup√©es. Both individuals and large firms have constantly innovated to produce better quality toup√©es and toup√©e material, with over 60 patents for toup√©es. and over 260 for hairpieces filed at the U.S. Patent Office since 1790. The first patent for a toup√©e was filed in 1921, and the first patent for a \\"hairpiece\\" was filed in 1956. =Hair weaves= Hair weaves are a technique in which the toup√©e's base is then woven into whatever natural hair the wearer retains. While this may result in a less detectable toup√©e, the wearer can experience discomfort, and sometimes hair loss from frequently retightening of the weave as one's own hair grows. After about six months a person can begin to lose hair permanently along the weave area, resulting in traction alopecia. Hair weaves were very popular in the 1980s & 1990s, but are not usually recommended because of the potential for permanent hair damage and hair loss. Use and maintenance While toup√©e dealers attempt to match the toup√©e's color to the natural hair color of the wearer, sometimes the colors are not identical. This color mismatch is often exacerbated when a toup√©e is poorly cared for and fades, or the wearer's hair color turns gray while the toup√©e retains its original color. However a good salon will take this into account and will have the expertise to handle any problems. New technology has allowed hair manufacturers to mimic human hair, overcoming many of the weaknesses of human hair. While toup√©e dealers and manufacturers usually advertise their products showing men swimming, water-skiing and enjoying watersports, these activities can often cause irreversible wear to the toup√©e. Saltwater and chlorine can cause a toup√©e to \\"wear out\\" quickly. Many shampoos and soaps will damage toup√©e fibers, which unlike natural hair, cannot grow back or replace themselves. While dealers of toup√©es can in fact help many customers to care for their toup√©es and make their presence virtually undetectable, the hairpieces must be of very high quality to begin with, carefully fitted, and maintained regularly and carefully. Even the best-cared-for toup√©e will need to be replaced on a regular basis, due to wear and, over time, to the growing areas of baldness on the wearer's head and changes in the shade of remaining hair. Some recommend that if one chooses to use a toup√©e, three should be owned at any one time - one to wear while its counterpart is being cleaned, and a spare. Alternatives Men typically wear toup√©es after resorting to less extreme methods of coverage. The first tactic is to make remaining hair appear thick and widespread through a combover. Other alternatives include non-surgical hair replacement, which consists of a very thin hairpiece which is put on with a medical adhesive and worn for weeks at a time. =Medications and medical procedures= Propecia, Rogaine and other pharmaceutical remedies were approved for treatment of Alopecia by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s. These have proven capable of regrowing or sustaining existing hair at least part of the time. However, hair transplantation, which guarantees at least some immediate results, has often replaced the use of toup√©es among those who can afford them, particularly onscreen celebrities. =Baldness as fashion, acceptance of hair loss= Other trends leading to the decline in toup√©e use include a rise in acceptance of baldness by those men afflicted with it. Short haircuts, in fashion since the 1990s, have tended to minimize the appearance of baldness, and many balding men choose to shave their heads entirely. Chemotherapy and injury An important exception to the typical reasons for wearing a toup√©e is that recovering chemotherapy patients sometimes wear toup√©es. This type of hairpiece is technically referred to as a hair prosthesis. A positive self- image has often been said to assist in the recovery process, and doctors often help direct recovering patients to find hairpieces to help project their usual healthy appearance. This effort is particularly made when the recovering patient is a child, or a woman. Another exception is that if a person's head has been damaged by an accident, or through a surgical procedure, the victim or patient may wish to conceal scarring. Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band wore a toup√©e in his role on The Sopranos to cover scarring he had received after a car accident several years prior. While performing onstage, and in his personal life, Van Zandt favors a bandanna. There are at least four charities that specialize in providing hairpieces for children who have lost hair due to Chemotherapy, medical treatment or head injury: *Locks of Love - A charitable organization for children who have lost their hair after medical treatment *Wigs for Kids - A charitable organization for children who have lost hair due to chemotherapy *The American Cancer Society Tender Loving Care Wigs *Hair That Cares, Inc. - A charitable organization for adults and children who have lost their hair after medical treatment and Alopecia Humor Toup√©es have a long and often humorous history in Western culture. The toup√©e is a regular butt of jokes in many media, with a typical toup√©e joke focusing on the wearer's inability to recognize how ineffective the toup√©e is in concealing his baldness. An early instance of \\"toup√©e humor\\" was an illustration by George Cruikshank in \\"The Comic Almanack\\" in 1837, in which he drew the effect of a strong wind, with a man's toup√©e whipped from his head. In the 20th century, toup√©es were a source of humor in virtually all forms of media, including cartoons, films, radio and television. In the 21st century, toup√©es continue to be a source for humor, with a variety of internet sites devoted to toup√©es, with a special emphasis on suspected celebrity hairpiece wearers. Thaddeus Stevens, famed 19th century U.S. Congressman and abolitionist, was known for his humor and wit. On one occasion while in the Capitol, a woman requested a lock of his hair (collecting locks of hair was common at this time). Since he was bald and wearing a toup√©e, he ripped it off and gave it to her.Trefousse, Hans L. Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian (1997)  Known wearers  Film and television stars of both past and present often wear toup√©es for professional reasons, particularly as they begin to age and need to maintain the image their fans have become accustomed to.

Located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York, and used by an international team of researchers, it is the only operating particle collider in the US. By using RHIC to collide ions traveling at relativistic speeds, physicists study the primordial form of matter that existed in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. By colliding spin- polarized protons, the spin structure of the proton is explored. RHIC is as of 2019 the second-highest-energy heavy-ion collider in the world. As of November 7, 2010, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has collided heavy ions of lead at higher energies than RHIC. The LHC operating time for ions (lead-lead and lead-proton collisions) is limited to about one month per year. In 2010, RHIC physicists published results of temperature measurements from earlier experiments which concluded that temperatures in excess of 345 MeV (4 terakelvins or 7 trillion degrees Fahrenheit) had been achieved in gold ion collisions, and that these collision temperatures resulted in the breakdown of \\"normal matter\\" and the creation of a liquid-like quark‚Äìgluon plasma. In January 2020, the US Department of Energy Office of Science selected the eRHIC design for the future Electron‚Äìion collider (EIC), building on the existing RHIC facility at BNL. The accelerator RHIC is an intersecting storage ring particle accelerator. Two independent rings (arbitrarily denoted as \\"Blue\\" and \\"Yellow\\") circulate heavy ions and/or polarized protons in opposite directions and allow a virtually free choice of colliding positively charged particles (the eRHIC upgrade will allow collisions between positively and negatively charged particles). The RHIC double storage ring is hexagonally shaped and has a circumference of , with curved edges in which stored particles are deflected and focused by 1,740 superconducting magnets using niobium-titanium conductors. The dipole magnets operate at . The six interaction points (between the particles circulating in the two rings) are in the middle of the six relatively straight sections, where the two rings cross, allowing the particles to collide. The interaction points are enumerated by clock positions, with the injection near 6 o'clock. Two large experiments, STAR and PHENIX, are located at 6 and 8 o'clock respectively. The PHENIX experiment is presently undergoing a major upgrade to become sPHENIX. A particle passes through several stages of boosters before it reaches the RHIC storage ring. The first stage for ions is the electron beam ion source (EBIS), while for protons, the linear accelerator (Linac) is used. As an example, gold nuclei leaving the EBIS have a kinetic energy of per nucleon and have an electric charge Q = +32 (32 of 79 electrons stripped from the gold atom). The particles are then accelerated by the Booster synchrotron to per nucleon, which injects the projectile now with Q = +77 into the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), before they finally reach per nucleon and are injected in a Q = +79 state (no electrons left) into the RHIC storage ring over the AGS-to-RHIC Transfer Line (AtR). To date the types of particle combinations explored at RHIC are , , , , , , , , , and . The projectiles typically travel at a speed of 99.995% of the speed of light. For collisions, the center-of-mass energy is typically per nucleon-pair, and was as low as per nucleon-pair. An average luminosity of was targeted during the planning. The current average luminosity of the collider has reached , 44 times the design value. The heavy ion luminosity is substantially increased through stochastic cooling. One unique characteristic of RHIC is its capability to collide polarized protons. RHIC holds the record of highest energy polarized proton beams. Polarized protons are injected into RHIC and preserve this state throughout the energy ramp. This is a difficult task that is accomplished with the aid of corkscrew magnetics called 'Siberian snakes' (in RHIC a chain 4 helical dipole magnets). The corkscrew induces the magnetic field to spiral along the direction of the beam Run-9 achieved center-of-mass energy of on 12 February 2009. In Run-13 the average luminosity of the collider reached , with a time and intensity averaged polarization of 52%. AC dipoles have been used in non-linear machine diagnostics for the first time in RHIC.

There is one detector currently operating at RHIC: STAR (6 o'clock, and near the AGS-to- RHIC Transfer Line). PHENIX (8 o'clock) took last data in 2016. PHOBOS (10 o'clock) completed its operation in 2005, and BRAHMS (2 o'clock) in 2006. A new detector sPHENIX is under construction in the old PHENIX hall and is expected to being taking data in 2023. Among the two larger detectors, STAR is aimed at the detection of hadrons with its system of time projection chambers covering a large solid angle and in a conventionally generated solenoidal magnetic field, while PHENIX is further specialized in detecting rare and electromagnetic particles, using a partial coverage detector system in a superconductively generated axial magnetic field. The smaller detectors have larger pseudorapidity coverage, PHOBOS has the largest pseudorapidity coverage of all detectors, and tailored for bulk particle multiplicity measurement, while BRAHMS is designed for momentum spectroscopy, in order to study the so- called \\"small-x\\" and saturation physics. There is an additional experiment, PP2PP (now part of STAR), investigating spin dependence in p + p scattering. The spokespersons for each of the experiments are: *STAR: Helen Caines (Yale University) and Lijuan Ruan (Brookhaven National Laboratory) *PHENIX: Yasuyuki Akiba (Riken) *sPHENIX: Gunter Roland (MIT) and David Morrison (Brookhaven National Laboratory) Current results For the experimental objective of creating and studying the quark‚Äìgluon plasma, RHIC has the unique ability to provide baseline measurements for itself. This consists of the both lower energy and also lower mass number projectile combinations that do not result in the density of 200 GeV Au + Au collisions, like the p + p and d + Au collisions of the earlier runs, and also Cu + Cu collisions in Run-5. Using this approach, important results of the measurement of the hot QCD matter created at RHIC are: * Collective anisotropy, or elliptic flow. The major part of the particles with lower momenta is emitted following an angular distribution dn/d\\\\phi \\\\propto 1 + 2 v_2(p_\\\\mathrm{T}) \\\\cos 2 \\\\phi (pT is the transverse momentum, \\\\phi angle with the reaction plane). This is a direct result of the elliptic shape of the nucleus overlap region during the collision and hydrodynamical property of the matter created. * Jet quenching. In the heavy ion collision event, scattering with a high transverse pT can serve as a probe for the hot QCD matter, as it loses its energy while traveling through the medium. Experimentally, the quantity RAA (A is the mass number) being the quotient of observed jet yield in A + A collisions and Nbin √ó yield in p + p collisions shows a strong damping with increasing A, which is an indication of the new properties of the hot QCD matter created. * Color glass condensate saturation. The Balitsky‚ÄìFadin‚ÄìKuraev‚ÄìLipatov (BFKL) dynamics which are the result of a resummation of large logarithmic terms in Q¬≤ for deep inelastic scattering with small Bjorken-x, saturate at a unitarity limit Q_s^2 \\\\propto \\\\langle N_\\\\mathrm{part} \\\\rangle/2, with Npart/2 being the number of participant nucleons in a collision (as opposed to the number of binary collisions). The observed charged multiplicity follows the expected dependency of n_\\\\mathrm{ch}/A \\\\propto 1/\\\\alpha_s(Q_s^2), supporting the predictions of the color glass condensate model. For a detailed discussion, see e.g. Dmitri Kharzeev et al.; for an overview of color glass condensates, see e.g. Iancu & Venugopalan. * Particle ratios. The particle ratios predicted by statistical models allow the calculation of parameters such as the temperature at chemical freeze-out Tch and hadron chemical potential \\\\mu_B. The experimental value Tch varies a bit with the model used, with most authors giving a value of 160 MeV < Tch < 180 MeV, which is very close to the expected QCD phase transition value of approximately 170 MeV obtained by lattice QCD calculations (see e.g. Karsch ). While in the first years, theorists were eager to claim that RHIC has discovered the quark‚Äìgluon plasma (e.g. Gyulassy & McLarren ), the experimental groups were more careful not to jump to conclusions, citing various variables still in need of further measurement. The present results shows that the matter created is a fluid with a viscosity near the quantum limit, but is unlike a weakly interacting plasma (a widespread yet not quantitatively unfounded belief on how quark‚Äìgluon plasma looks). A recent overview of the physics result is provided by the RHIC Experimental Evaluations 2004, a community-wide effort of RHIC experiments to evaluate the current data in the context of implication for formation of a new state of matter. These results are from the first three years of data collection at RHIC. New results were published in Physical Review Letters on February 16, 2010, stating the discovery of the first hints of symmetry transformations, and that the observations may suggest that bubbles formed in the aftermath of the collisions created in the RHIC may break parity symmetry, which normally characterizes interactions between quarks and gluons. The RHIC physicists announced new temperature measurements for these experiments of up to 4 trillion kelvins, the highest temperature ever achieved in a laboratory. It is described as a recreation of the conditions that existed during the birth of the Universe. Possible closure under flat nuclear science budget scenarios In late 2012, the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) was asked to advise the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation how to implement the nuclear science long range plan written in 2007, if future nuclear science budgets continue to provide no growth over the next four years. In a narrowly decided vote, the NSAC committee showed a slight preference, based on non-science related considerations, for shutting down RHIC rather than canceling the construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). By October 2015, the budget situation had improved, and RHIC can continue operations into the next decade. The future RHIC began operation in 2000 and until November 2010 was the most powerful heavy-ion collider in the world. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN, while used mainly for colliding protons, operates with heavy ions for about one month per year. The LHC has operated with 25 times higher energies per nucleon. As of 2018 RHIC and the LHC are the only operating hadron colliders in the world. Due to the longer operating time per year, a greater number of colliding ion species and collision energies can be studied at RHIC. In addition and unlike the LHC, RHIC is also able to accelerate spin polarized protons, which would leave RHIC as the world's highest energy accelerator for studying spin- polarized proton structure. A major upgrade is the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the addition of a 18 GeV high intensity electron beam facility, allowing electron-ion collisions. At least one new detector will have to be built to study the collisions. A review is given by A. Deshpande et al. A more recent description is at:E. C. Aschenauer et al., ‚ÄúeRHIC Design Study: An Electron-Ion Collider at BNL,‚Äù 2014. On January 9th, 2020, It was announced by Paul Dabbar, undersecretary of the US Department of Energy Office of Science, that the BNL eRHIC design has been selected for the future Electron‚Äìion collider (EIC) in the United States. In addition to the site selection, it was announced that the BNL EIC had acquired CD-0 (mission need) from the Department of Energy.‚ÄúU.S. Department of Energy Selects Brookhaven National Laboratory to Host Major New Nuclear Physics Facility‚Äù 2020. Critics of high-energy experiments Before RHIC started operation, critics postulated that the extremely high energy could produce catastrophic scenarios, such as creating a black hole, a transition into a different quantum mechanical vacuum (see false vacuum), or the creation of strange matter that is more stable than ordinary matter. These hypotheses are complex, but many predict that the Earth would be destroyed in a time frame from seconds to millennia, depending on the theory considered. However, the fact that objects of the Solar System (e.g., the Moon) have been bombarded with cosmic particles of significantly higher energies than that of RHIC and other man-made colliders for billions of years, without any harm to the Solar System, were among the most striking arguments that these hypotheses were unfounded. The other main controversial issue was a demand by critics for physicists to reasonably exclude the probability for such a catastrophic scenario. Physicists are unable to demonstrate experimental and astrophysical constraints of zero probability of catastrophic events, nor that tomorrow Earth will be struck with a \\"doomsday\\" cosmic ray (they can only calculate an upper limit for the likelihood). The result would be the same destructive scenarios described above, although obviously not caused by humans. According to this argument of upper limits, RHIC would still modify the chance for the Earth's survival by an infinitesimal amount. Concerns were raised in connection with the RHIC particle accelerator, both in the media and in the popular science media. (And reply by F. Wilczek.) The risk of a doomsday scenario was indicated by Martin Rees, with respect to the RHIC, as being at least a 1 in 50,000,000 chance.Cf. Brookhaven Report mentioned by Rees, Martin (Lord), Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century?, U.K., 2003, ; note that the mentioned \\"1 in 50 million\\" chance is disputed as being a misleading and played down probability of the serious risks (Aspden, U.K., 2006) With regards to the production of strangelets, Frank Close, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, indicates that \\"the chance of this happening is like you winning the major prize on the lottery 3 weeks in succession; the problem is that people believe it is possible to win the lottery 3 weeks in succession.\\" After detailed studies, scientists reached such conclusions as \\"beyond reasonable doubt, heavy-ion experiments at RHIC will not endanger our planet\\" and that there is \\"powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous strangelet production.\\" The debate started in 1999 with an exchange of letters in Scientific American between Walter L. Wagner and F. Wilczek, in response to a previous article by M. Mukerjee. The media attention unfolded with an article in UK Sunday Times of July 18, 1999 by J. Leake, closely followed by articles in the U.S. media. The controversy mostly ended with the report of a committee convened by the director of Brookhaven National Laboratory, J. H. Marburger, ostensibly ruling out the catastrophic scenarios depicted. However, the report left open the possibility that relativistic cosmic ray impact products might behave differently while transiting earth compared to \\"at rest\\" RHIC products; and the possibility that the qualitative difference between high-E proton collisions with earth or the moon might be different than gold on gold collisions at the RHIC. Wagner tried subsequently to stop full-energy collision at RHIC by filing Federal lawsuits in San Francisco and New York, but without success. The New York suit was dismissed on the technicality that the San Francisco suit was the preferred forum. The San Francisco suit was dismissed, but with leave to refile if additional information was developed and presented to the court.United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Case No. 00CV1672, Walter L. Wagner vs. Brookhaven Science Associates, L.L.C. (2000); United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C99-2226, Walter L. Wagner vs. U.S. Department of Energy, et al. (1999) On March 17, 2005, the BBC published an article implying that researcher Hora≈£iu NƒÉstase believes black holes have been created at RHIC. However, the original papers of H. NƒÉstase and the New Scientist article cited by the BBC state that the correspondence of the hot dense QCD matter created in RHIC to a black hole is only in the sense of a correspondence of QCD scattering in Minkowski space and scattering in the AdS5 √ó X5 space in AdS/CFT; in other words, it is similar mathematically. Therefore, RHIC collisions might be described by mathematics relevant to theories of quantum gravity within AdS/CFT, but the described physical phenomena are not the same. Financial information The RHIC project was sponsored by the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear physics. It had a line-item budget of 616.6 million U.S. dollars. For fiscal year 2006 the operational budget was reduced by 16.1 million U.S. dollars from the previous year, to 115.5 million U.S. dollars. Though operation under the fiscal year 2006 federal budget cut was uncertain, a key portion of the operational cost (13 million U.S. dollars) was contributed privately by a group close to Renaissance Technologies of East Setauket, New York. RHIC in fiction * The novel Cosm () by the American author Gregory Benford takes place at RHIC. The science fiction setting describes the main character Alicia Butterworth, a physicist at the BRAHMS experiment, and a new universe being created in RHIC by accident, while running with uranium ions. * The zombie apocalypse novel The Rising by the American author Brian Keene referenced the media concerns of activating the RHIC raised by the article in The Sunday Times of July 18, 1999 by J.

It is defined as the state corresponding to the highest potential energy along this reaction coordinate. It is often marked with the double dagger ‚Ä° symbol. As an example, the transition state shown below occurs during the SN2 reaction of bromoethane with a hydroxyl anion: 700px DFT-determined geometry for the transition state of the above reaction.The calculation used a B3LYP functional and a 6-31+G* basis set. Distances are listed in angstroms. Note the elongated C-Br and C-O bonds, and the trigonal bipyramidal structure. The activated complex of a reaction can refer to either the transition state or to other states along the reaction coordinate between reactants and products, especially those close to the transition state.Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula, Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006), p.809 According to the transition state theory, once the reactants have passed through the transition state configuration, they always continue to form products.  History of concept  The concept of a transition state has been important in many theories of the rates at which chemical reactions occur. This started with the transition state theory (also referred to as the activated complex theory), which was first developed around 1935 by Eyring, Evans and Polanyi, and introduced basic concepts in chemical kinetics that are still used today.  Explanation  A collision between reactant molecules may or may not result in a successful reaction. The outcome depends on factors such as the relative kinetic energy, relative orientation and internal energy of the molecules. Even if the collision partners form an activated complex they are not bound to go on and form products, and instead the complex may fall apart back to the reactants.  Observing transition states  Because of the rules of quantum mechanics, the transition state cannot be captured or directly observed; the population at that point is zero. This is sometimes expressed by stating that the transition state has a fleeting existence. However, cleverly manipulated spectroscopic techniques can get us as close as the timescale of the technique allows. Femtochemical IR spectroscopy was developed for that reason, and it is possible to probe molecular structure extremely close to the transition point. Often, along the reaction coordinate, reactive intermediates are present not much lower in energy from a transition state making it difficult to distinguish between the two.  Determining the geometry of a transition state  Transition state structures can be determined by searching for first-order saddle points on the potential energy surface (PES) of the chemical species of interest. A first- order saddle point is a critical point of index one, that is, a position on the PES corresponding to a minimum in all directions except one. This is further described in the article geometry optimization.  The Hammond‚ÄìLeffler postulate  The Hammond‚ÄìLeffler postulate states that the structure of the transition state more closely resembles either the products or the starting material, depending on which is higher in enthalpy. A transition state that resembles the reactants more than the products is said to be early, while a transition state that resembles the products more than the reactants is said to be late. Thus, the Hammond‚ÄìLeffler Postulate predicts a late transition state for an endothermic reaction and an early transition state for an exothermic reaction. A dimensionless reaction coordinate that quantifies the lateness of a transition state can be used to test the validity of the Hammond‚ÄìLeffler postulate for a particular reaction.  The structure‚Äìcorrelation principle  The structure‚Äìcorrelation principle states that structural changes that occur along the reaction coordinate can reveal themselves in the ground state as deviations of bond distances and angles from normal values along the reaction coordinate. According to this theory if one particular bond length on reaching the transition state increases then this bond is already longer in its ground state compared to a compound not sharing this transition state. One demonstration of this principle is found in the two bicyclic compounds depicted below. The one on the left is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octene, which, at 200 ¬∞C, extrudes ethylene in a retro- Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. : Structure Correlation Principle Compared to the compound on the right (which, lacking an alkene group, is unable to give this reaction) the bridgehead carbon-carbon bond length is expected to be shorter if the theory holds, because on approaching the transition state this bond gains double bond character. For these two compounds the prediction holds up based on X-ray crystallography.  Implications for enzymatic catalysis  One way that enzymatic catalysis proceeds is by stabilizing the transition state through electrostatics. By lowering the energy of the transition state, it allows a greater population of the starting material to attain the energy needed to overcome the transition energy and proceed to product.

MAC hosts many swimming and water polo events but also hosts Lancashire County Championships and Age group North west Regionals for swimming. It was opened on 12 October 2000, by Queen Elizabeth II. Facilities The centre's facilities include: * Two 50 m swimming pools, each able to be split into sections of varying dimensions and depths with the help of moveable floors and booms. In fact, the centre has the world's largest area of movable floors and booms in a swimming facility. **The \\"main pool\\" on the ground floor is 50 m by 20 m with a maximum depth of 2 m. A sinkable boom can separate the pool into a 23 m by 21 m with constant depth between floor level and 2 m depth; and a 25 m by 21 m section at 2 m depth, which in turn can be separated by another sinkable boom to allow a section of 10 m by 21 m. The floors of these 3 sections can each be independently raised or lowered between very shallow and depth. 1,000 permanent spectator seats overlook the main pool hall. **The \\"training pool\\" is located in the basement and is 16 m by 50 m in size, with a constant depth of 1.8 m. A traversable boom allows separation into two 25 m length pools, one of which can be varied in depth from floor level to 1.8 m. The training pool's ceiling is in the shape of two long waves representing waves on water. *A 25 m diving pool (ground level) with movable floor to allow a maximum depth of 5.1 m. The pool is often also used for water polo, and scuba diving training. *A \\"leisure pool\\" (ground floor) ‚Äì a shallow water area suitable for younger pool users, with two water flumes and two bubble pools. * Workout and fitness studios (behind the spectator seating), a health suite including sauna and steam room. *Poolside cafe.

It can be congenital or caused by a penetrant injury. Isolated aniridia is a congenital disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development, but is a panocular condition with macular and optic nerve hypoplasia, cataract, and corneal changes. Vision may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently associated with a number of ocular complications: nystagmus, amblyopia, buphthalmos, and cataract. Aniridia in some individuals occurs as part of a syndrome, such as WAGR syndrome (kidney nephroblastoma (Wilms tumour), genitourinary anomalies and intellectual disability), or Gillespie syndrome (cerebellar ataxia). PAX6 Phenotypic expression of aniridia with PAX6 gene mutation. The aniridic probands showed typical features of sclerocornea with nystagmus in proband 28‚Äì1 (A); Foveal hypoplasia in proband 27‚Äì1 (B); Ptosis, microcornea with dislocated cataractous lens in proband 10‚Äì1 (C); Ectopia lentis in proband 16‚Äì1 (D). The AN2 region of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13) includes the PAX6 gene (named for its PAired boX status), whose gene product helps regulate a cascade of other genetic processes involved in the development of the eye (as well as other non-ocular structures). This PAX6 gene is around 95% similar to the pax gene found in zebrafish, a creature whose ancestors diverged from human evolutionary development around 400 million years ago. Thus the PAX6 gene is highly conserved across evolutionary lineages. Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular defects in mice (as well as Drosophila). Aniridia is a heterozygous disorder, meaning that only one of the two chromosome 11 copies is affected. When both copies are altered (homozygous condition), the result is a uniformly fatal condition with near complete failure of entire eye formation. In 2001, two cases of homozygous aniridia patients were reported; the fetuses died prior to birth and had severe brain damage. In mice, homozygous small eye defect (mouse Pax-6) leads to loss of the eyes and nose and the murine fetuses suffer severe brain damage. Types Aniridia may be broadly divided into hereditary and sporadic forms. Hereditary aniridia is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner (each offspring has a 50% chance of being affected), although rare autosomal recessive forms (such as Gillespie syndrome) have also been reported. Sporadic aniridia mutations may affect the WT1 region adjacent to the AN2 aniridia region, causing a kidney cancer called nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor). These patients often also have genitourinary abnormalities and intellectual disability (WAGR syndrome). Several different mutations may affect the PAX6 gene. Some mutations appear to inhibit gene function more than others, with subsequent variability in the severity of the disease. Thus, some aniridic individuals are only missing a relatively small amount of iris, do not have foveal hypoplasia, and retain relatively normal vision. Presumably, the genetic defect in these individuals causes less \\"heterozygous insufficiency,\\" meaning they retain enough gene function to yield a milder phenotype. * AN * Aniridia and absent patella * Aniridia, microcornea, and spontaneously reabsorbed cataract * Aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental deficiency (Gillespie syndrome) Mutational analysis Molecular (DNA) testing for PAX6 gene mutations (by sequencing of the entire coding region and deletion/duplication analysis) is available for isolated aniridia and the Gillespie syndrome. For the WAGR syndrome, high- resolution cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be utilized to identify deletions within chromosome band 11p13, where both the PAX6 and WT1 genes are located. Treatment In May 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the CustomFlex Artificial Iris, the first synthetic iris for use in adults and children with congenital aniridia or iris defects related to other conditions, such as albinism, traumatic injury, or surgical removal due to ocular melanoma. The artificial iris is a surgically implanted device made of thin, foldable, medical-grade silicone and is custom- sized and colored for each individual patient. The prosthetic iris is held in place by the anatomical structures of the eye or, if needed, by sutures.https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/897386 See also *WAGR syndrome *Scleral lenses References  External links  * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Aniridia * NCBI/Molecular diagnosis of aniridia * OMIM entries on Aniridia * GeneReviews/NIH/NCBI/UW entry on Wilms Tumor Overview Category:Genetics Category:Congenital disorders of eyes ","title":"Aniridia"},{"id":"849382","text":"Feed Me Weird Things is the debut studio album by English electronic musician Tom Jenkinson under the alias Squarepusher. It was released on 3 June 1996 by Rephlex Records. The album received positive reviews from critics and has been retrospectively cited as a landmark release in the drill 'n' bass subgenre.  Artwork  Jenkinson collaborated on the visuals for Feed Me Weird Things with Johnny Clayton. Clayton suggested that Jenkinson take inspiration from Jenkinson's hometown of Chelmsford. The packaging contains various photographs, taken by Jenkinson and edited by Clayton, of different locations in Chelmsford and London. Reception =Critical response= Muzik magazine's Calvin Bush praised Feed Me Weird Things as \\"the kind of album Miles Davis might have made if he had been wired into breakbeats, Aphex Twin and Ninja Tune\\". Ben Willmott of NME hailed it as Jenkinson's \\"most consistently varied, bedazzling and rounded deposit to date\\". Retrospectively, AllMusic editor John Bush wrote that its incorporation of \\"dense jungle percussion\\" makes for \\"a difficult, yet ultimately rewarding album.\\" The Wire listed Feed Me Weird Things as one of the 50 best records of 1996. In 2007, The Guardian listed it as one of \\"1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die\\". =Influence= Writing for American music magazine Spin, jazz writer Ken Micallef noted Feed Me Weird Things for its influence on the drill 'n' bass subgenre and stated that, with Feed Me Weird Things and its follow-up Hard Normal Daddy, Jenkinson \\"did to jungle what Frank Zappa did to rock‚Äîsatirized its excesses with a maze of neurotic, scurrying notes, while adding a nerdy musicality that practically invented a new genre.\\" AllMusic credited the 1996 releases of Feed Me Weird Things and Plug's Drum 'n' Bass for Papa as significant in breaking drill 'n' bass to a larger audience. In 2003, San Diego Union-Tribune critic AnnaMaria Stephens cited Feed Me Weird Things among the most important intelligent dance music albums.

It lies on the northwest bank of the River Medway at its lowest bridging point, and is part of the Rochester post town. Strood began as a manor then chapelry of Frindsbury until gaining its own parish status in 1193. Today Frindsbury is effectively, in all but a few associations such as in the Church of England, the northern part of Strood. Strood's history has been dominated by the river and facing port-associated towns, particularly its road and rail bridges since the Roman era to Rochester and the two other Medway Towns immediately adjoining and beyond from the north-east quarter of Kent to London and the rest of Britain. It has a mixed retail and leisure area at its heart. Most of its sources of employment are the other Medway towns, their associated commercial, industrial and logistics parks and London, as an outer commuter town. Among its broadest named neighbourhoods are the \\"Earl estate\\" and Marlowe Park, one named after a house builder, the other after the grounds of a former mansion house. History High Speed 1 and the M2 form the southwestern boundary of Strood. A Eurostar train passing Strood heading for the Medway Viaduct The River Medway and its marshes in Strood, showing Strood juxtaposed with Rochester The far end of Medway Valley Leisure Park. The Crispin and Crispianus pub is typical of the shiplapped houses in Strood on the higher ground, On 27 March 2011 the pub was set alight. =Pre-conquest= Strood was part of Frindsbury until 1193. It was named \\"Strodes\\" in the Textus Roffensis, though most early records use the spelling Stroud. The Old English name Str≈çd refers to a \\"marshy land overgrown with brushwood\\". The Romans built a stone bridge and laid a road on a causeway across the marshy ground. The foundations were about 8 ft below the level of the 1856 road. The road went up Strood Hill, and was called Watling Street, as it still is today. This is the A2 road. There is further evidence of a causewayed road leading along the bank towards the Frindsbury Peninsula leading to a villa, was found in 1819. The present road and field pattern suggest that there was a substantial Roman agricultural settlement centred near Frindsbury. In 764 AD Offa King of Mercia and Sigered King of Kent granted to Eardulph lands in Easlingham (Frindsbury). In 840, 994, and 998 AD Strood was pillaged by the Danes. In 960 AD a wooden bridge was built across the Medway. =Medieval= A small wooden church was erected at Strood in 1122, as a chapel of ease in the parish of Frindsbury. Land was granted in 1160 to the Knights Templar by King Henry II. The Manor House was used as a Lodging House. In 1193, Strood became a parish. It was run by the monks of Newark Hospital, and had its own burial grounds. Corruption in the finances of the Newark Hospital set in and worsened until reforms were put in place formally in 1330 by the Bishop of Rochester Hamo de Hethe. In 1291 there was an affray at Newark Hospital between the Monks of Strood and the locals from Frindsbury. In 1264 Simon de Montfort laid siege to Rochester Castle from the Strood Side. In the action the wooden bridge was destroyed by fire. After Simon's death a heavy fine was levied on Strood because he had stayed there during the siege. The Strood Quay and Strood Wharf had been built by Bishop de Glanville with rents going to Newark Hospital. In 1293 the Rochester wharf was in such disrepair that ships had to use the Strood facilities, however as the bridge was out of use, ferries had to be used to cross the river. In 1309, a harsh winter, the bridge was damaged by ice. In 1312 the Knight's Templar were suppressed and the Manor of Strood passed into private hands briefly before being passed on to the Abbess and Sisters Minorites of St. Clare of Denney in Cambridgeshire. In 1387 a stone bridge was built by John de Cobham and Robert Knolles. In 1460 Edward IV appointed a mayor of Rochester with jurisdiction over Strood river frontage and the houses there. =Early Modern= Strood was owned by the Rochester monastery from the 18th year of Edward III's reign until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, after which time as part of the Hundred of Sharnel (Shamwell) which included Cobham, it was passed to George Brooke, Lord Cobham. His grandson Henry Brooke lost his estates to James I in 1603 through a false charge of treason, although he escaped with his life. The Temple Manor thereafter was granted to Sir Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury (son of William, Lord Burleigh), who later became Lord Treasurer of England under Queen Elizabeth, and married Elizabeth, sister of Henry, Lord Cobham. In 1554 Thomas Wyatt of Allington on hearing that the queen intended to marry a Catholic gathered an army with the intention of marching on London. He took Rochester Castle and the bridge. According to Marsh there was to have been a battle at Strood, but the Queen's men deserted. However, Coulson records that Wyatt defeated the Duke of Norfolk and seized six cannon. Wyatt then marched on Cooling Castle. The rebellion fizzled out, and Wyatt was executed, along with the captain of the deserters. The parish accounts begin in 1555. Following the accession and marriage of Queen Mary (known as \\"Bloody\\" Mary) the country reconverted to Roman Catholicism and a considerable sum was spent re-converting the church. However just nine years later in 1565 a further five-year period of refurbishment was required to convert the church back to Protestant usage following the accession of Queen Elizabeth I. The parish registers start from this date. Possibly mindful of the changes, the churchwardens waited until 1574 before going to St. Dunstan's Fair in Rochester to sell \\"a cross and other relics of Roman superstition, formerly used in Strood Church\\". In the 1672 the parishes of St. Margaret's, Rochester and St Nicholas, Strood jointly applied to the Court of Chancery for a ruling which was decided in their favour to extend the area over which Watts charities could operate. The parish of Strood utilised some of the money to provide a workhouse for the poor. Above the door was set a stone slab which is now displayed in the Guildhall Museum, Rochester. The text is reproduced alongside. In 1769, under authority of the 1768 Paving Act, a tollgate was erected at The Angel Inn on North Street in Strood, to pay for improvements to the parish. Hasted, in his study of Kent (1778‚Äì99), said Strood's inhabitants were chiefly seafaring or fishermen, and engaged in dredging oysters. =Nineteenth century= Between 1804 and 1824 the Thames and Medway canal was dug. See below, under Transport for more details. =Twentieth century= The ancient City of Rochester merged with the borough of Chatham and part of the Strood Rural District in 1974 to form the Borough of Medway, later renamed the City of Rochester-upon-Medway. In 1998 another merger with the rest of the Medway Towns created the Medway unitary authority. =Twenty-first century= 21st century Strood has seen significant growth, due to its proximity to London and cheaper housing. Although Strood is a town in its own right with a population in 2019 estimated at 40,000, it is also officially a suburb of Rochester, albeit a very large suburb. Strangely, Strood the suburb is more heavily populated than its post town Rochester on the east side of the River Medway, the total population being around 68,000. Geography Strood lies on the edge of marshy land alongside the River Medway. The chalk hills of the North Downs have been breached at this point, forming a river cliff rising to 100 ft directly behind. Two gentle chalk valleys, or bournes, descend to the River Medway here, one takes the A2 towards London on its north slope. Another takes the road to Cliffe, and to Hoo. The land has been extensively quarried for chalk and the covering brickearth. These quarries have then been used for housing. The river frontage has been drained and infilled, firstly for industry, then for transport links, and finally for housing. To the north of Strood are the remains of the canal basin, and to the south the M2 motorway bridge and High Speed 1 bridge. Strood Fair An annual fair was instituted in 1206 during the seventh year of King John's reign to the priory of Rochester, to be held on 26 August, which continued well into the 18th Century, according to Hasted, the Kent historian. It was traditionally held over three days, and associated with Christian celebration of the Assumption (15 August). The Strood Fair was held regularly into the 1970s. The land used for the Strood Fair was sandwiched between Grange Road and Station Road, adjacent to Strood railway station. It was for many years part of a dairy farm, though by the 1970s the farm building had been turned into a motor repair business. The fair ground was passed on to the people who ran the Strood Fair. It was then used by them to stay through the winter months. The land is still occupied as winter quarters by the Showman's Guild with its running costs supported by an annual fair on the site. In June 2007, the motor repair building was demolished to be replaced by flats. Today's market is held on a Tuesday and Saturday, and a boot fair is held on a Sunday. Newark Hospital Gilbert de Glanvill, Bishop of Rochester, in 1190, early during the reign of Richard I founded a hospital in Strood, east of the church, which was afterwards called the Newark or Stroud Hospital, the Yoke or North Yoke being a small manor in Strood. Newark Hospital was important in raising the profile of Strood, however there was constant concern about it financial management, and the rivalry between it and the Rochester Priory. In 1830, under King Henry VIII, the hospital was under the control of the Dean and Chapter of Rochester.William Henry Ireland The location of the former Newark Hospital is now mainly a car park behind Strood High Street. The 19th century railway embankment carrying the Chatham Main Line cuts across the back of the old hospital site. Strood Market is held on part of this land, but was relocated to make way for a food store, Aldi. An archaeological dig of the site was done in the 1970s. Politics =Strood Rural District= Strood Rural District was a local government district of Kent from 1894 to 1974. It did not include Strood itself (which formed part of Rochester) and covered a wide area. The offices of Strood Rural District Council were in Frindsbury, Strood; they are now a nursing home called Frindsbury Hall. =Strood representation= Strood is part of the parliamentary constituency of Rochester and Strood. Local government was consolidated in the late 1990s into a single tier with the creation of Medway Council. Economy =Engineering= A Strood-built road roller,standing in the grounds of the former Aveling and Porter factory in 1993 Small enterprises were formed to service Chatham Dockyard. Joseph Collis started as a retail ironmonger in 1777. By 1865 he was a wholesaler specialising in zinc, iron, tinplate and locksmithery. By 1870, he and his partner Stace took over the Pelican Foundry and manufactured structural ironwork, toilet cisterns and manhole covers. Thomas Aveling built his traction engines at the Invicta Works next to Rochester Bridge from 1861. Later the works were acquired the Collis and Stace's Pelican Foundry. Avelings were noted for excellent employment practices, and made their premises available for meetings of co-operative and radical societies. Avelings in turn became Wingets factory, then the Rochester-upon-Medway Civic Centre which passed to Medway Council. Shorts, the seaplane manufacturer, used a yard on the Strood side for construction of the airframes of F3 and F5 flying boats. Other employers were Hobourn-Eaton, Kent Alloys, Fishers and the Co-operative bakery. =Retail= Strood Retail Park Settlement geography tells us that a bridging point becomes a route centre and a trading centre. Being a lowest bridging point of a critical prehistoric military route compounds the problem. Towns had to built above the flood plain at a pinch point and flat land on the Rochester side of the river was needed for a walled town with castle and cathedral, in effect sterilising the land that side of the river from future major development. The land was locked by the construction of the London, Chatham and Dover railway in an embankment and arches. Small shops grew up around \\"The Angel\\" in Strood forming the town centre. Further small rows were built within the housing along Gun Lane and at Darnley Road. By 2005 Strood was served by two supermarkets. Tesco acquired and demolished Temple Street and bought the freehold of all the other plots on the block for future expansion. Safeway in the High Street built on the site of small firms and the Budden and Biggs Brewery. Following the takeover by Morrisons the store was closed with a new, larger, site built at the far side of Jane's Creek. The town centre store lay empty until autumn 2008 when it was redeveloped by the marginal supermarket retailer Netto and discount chain Wilko (the Netto store has since been remodelled as an Asda following a buyout). Matalan moved to Strood Retail Park, extending the retail offer toward Jane's Creek. In 2009 the site was fully redeveloped with another two retail units on either side. KFC and Paul Simon moved in next to Matalan, extending the retail and leisure offer, and Subway moved into Strood High Street in 2011 giving the centre a more modern focus. Thompson Travel closed, and the empty unit sat there for around 8 months until Greggs took it over. Thus we see that the economics and demographics of the area were right for expansion. Tesco planned for a brand new store to be built on its acquired land in February 2013, but after a national policy change in March 2013 it announced that it would focus on smaller Express stores. The Tesco Store was to include a community hub and library which would be for Medway Council and would have replaced the annex at the previous Civic Centre site in Strood. An Aldi supermarket also opened on land opposite the Angel Corner (the former site of Strood Market) in November 2012, three years later than originally planned ‚Äì with locals opposed to the Tuesday and Saturday markets being relocated to the Commercial Road car park. Strood Retail Park has grown to include Next, Argos, Poundworld, Carpet Right, Matalan and KFC. The nature of the offer reflects the market's interpretation of the local economy. The Poundland store opened in the Retail Park in February 2015 in the former Paul Simons store. Poundland went into administration on 11 June 2018 though administrators are hoping for a rescue package. In March 2015 It was announced that B&Q; would be replaced with a Gym, Cafe and 3 shops. In January 2016 It was announced that Brantano would close due to going into administration. The store subsequently closed on 22 March 2016. A Poundworld store opened in the Retail Park in May 2016 in the former Brantano store. In early 2017 it was announced that an M&S; Foodhall, B&M; and a Maplin would open at the former B&Q; site. It was then later announced in July 2017 that Starbucks Coffee would be opening amongst the new retail units on Strood Retail Park. In February 2018 It was announced that Maplin would close due to going into administration. In June 2018 Following a ¬£15 million loan, it was announced that Carpetright was to restructure its Kent stores with the Strood store closing and everything being transferred to the Gillingham store. Transport 1863 Map of Strood and Frindsbury: note the undrained land between the railway and Frindsbury Hill, the creeks behind the Civic Centre and the lack of houses. 1909 Map of Strood and Frindsbury: note the growth in houses. There is no separation between Strood and Frindsbury, an extra church in Frindsbury parish to accommodate the new houses, and note also how Jane's Creek has been developed; later this will be back filled to provide land for retail. A British Rail Class 466 unit and a British Rail Class 395 unit at Strood railway station =River= Transport in Strood was dominated by the river. From the earliest times river transport used Strood, but before the coming of the Romans the area was marshy and not well populated. Once Strood started to be filled in various boatyards and ship repair businesses started up both on the river and in the creeks which drain the marshes. =Road= Although Strood must have lain on ancient tracks, the coming of the Romans started to fix the road pattern. The lowest bridging point of the River Medway is between Strood and Rochester, and the first bridge was built soon after the Battle of the Medway. This road from Dover via Longdon towards north Wales became known as Watling Street and forms two of the major highways of the Kingdom. The section from Dover to London became the A2 trunk road. The 20th century has seen a major expansion in road transport and the consequent building of the M2 motorway. The route roughly parallels the old A2 and has necessitated the building of two high level bridges in Strood to the south of the town. Beyond the M2 is the M20 motorway leading to the south of London and accessible by major roads from Strood. Strood is on National Cycle Route 1. =Canal= The Thames and Medway Canal was dug between 1804 and 1824 to provide a safe route between the rivers Medway and Thames. Barges were able to avoid the long passage into the Thames estuary and around the Isle of Grain. At the Strood end the canal was entered through a lock into Frindsbury basin and then entered a tunnel. It opened 4 October 1824. The canal was with headroom and wide, to take , 60-ton Thames Barges. It had a tow path its entire length. Spoil from the tunnel was used to infill the marshland between St Mary's Church Strood and the River Medway. Frindsbury Basin could handle vessels to 300 tons. A steam pump was installed there to keep the canal topped up. Commercially the venture was a failure, because tolls were high to recoup the cost, entry to the basins could only occur at high tides (making it quicker to sail the round the Isle of Grain). With the end of the Napoleonic wars the military justification had also been removed. In 1844 A single line railway was laid through the tunnel, part on the towpath and part on a timber structure over the canal. The canal was sold in 1845 to the South Eastern Railway (SER), who filled in the canal within the tunnel and laid a double track (see North Kent Line). =Rail= The South Eastern Railway terminated at Strood, with passengers taking a steamer or coaches to reach Rochester or Chatham. The station, completed 10 February 1856, was opposite The Railway Tavern. More recently it was called the Old Terminus. On 18 June 1856, the line was extended along the river bank to Maidstone, and Strood Station we see today, was opened (see Medway Valley Line). Also in 1856 the new road bridge over the Medway was opened, in its present position, back where the Roman bridge had been. In 1857 the mediaeval bridge was demolished the stone being used to build the Strood Esplanade in 1858. In 1860 the SER built the Strood pier. The East Kent Railway had permission to run a line from Faversham to Chatham, and intended to connect with the South Eastern Railway at Strood. When negotiations failed, the East Kent, now called the London Chatham and Dover (LCDR), linked with the Mid Kent Co. at Bromley (see Chatham Main Line). The East Kent Railway built a bridge over the Medway (1853) and taking their line to the North of the Angel, over Gun Lane, and Watling Street then south to Cuxton where it followed the Bush Valley and hence to Sole Street. The London Chatham and Dover built a station on the A2, adjacent to Canal Road, this was called *Strood Station, when it was built, then *Rochester Bridge Station,1 April 1861 *Rochester & Strood, 1 November 1861 *Rochester Bridge (Strood), 1862 *Rochester Bridge, 1905 The South Eastern Railway retaliated by building a parallel bridge (after 1866 and before 1909) and running a separate line into Chatham. To do this the Watermill was demolished and the Mill Pond filled in. Over the pond was built an Oil and Seed Mill with its own sidings. There was a loop between the lines at Strood, opened 29 March 1859 which closed in 1860. In 1875 Mayor N. E. Toomer forced the two companies to reopen the loop, now nicknamed Toomers Loop. The service resumed 1 April 1877. The SER and LCDR effectively merged on 1 January 1899 to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Subsequent rationalisation saw the closure of the SER branch to Chatham, and the closure of the LCDR Strood station. The SER bridge over the Medway was retained for the Chatham Main Line, and the LCDR bridge was abandoned (its piers were later used for the second road bridge). The link between the two lines was used to run services from the Chatham line onto the North Kent Line. For the current railway station see Strood railway station. River and the Strood Basin The remains of Jane's Creek in 2006 All Strood below The Angel Inn, on North Street, near Strood Post Office, was built on marshland which was fed by small creeks, these were excavated to make usable jetties and wharf. Two such creeks are well known, Janes Creek which once extended back to the Cricketers Inn, and Temple Creek. Joining Janes Creek, at a right angle was Pelican Creek which has been in-filled and now forms a car park and the foundations of B & M. Strood frequently flooded and the area around Temple Street (now a car park and a Tesco) was known as the 'Swamp'. In such a low-lying area, flooding is a danger. The reconstruction, after a flood, provides a boost to economy and the opportunity to effect structural change. Floods of significance have been recorded in Strood in the years 1158, 1235, 1309, 1682, 1735, 1791, 1854, 1874, 1887, 1953, 1968 and 1979. William Curel was Medway's oldest established barge builder, with two yards on the Strood bank. The Curel's Upper Yard was next to the Railway Tavern. In 1900 Gill and Son took over the yard, and it became a sail loft. Mills There was a windmill on Strood Hill, two on Broom Hill and five in neighbouring Frindsbury. * The Strood Hill Mill was a smock mill that was demolished in 1860. It was unsuitably sited, and suffered from variable winds The site now forms part of the Cedars Hotel. * Killicks Mill on Broom Hill cap was blown off for the second time in 1880. It was replaced and worked again for a year in 1890 but was unprofitable and was probably demolished in the 1920s. It had six sides rather than the usual eight. * Fields Mill on Broom Hill burnt down in 1875. In Dickens' times, the Miller was a Mr Clark, but the owner was Mr Field. Mr Field was an amateur musician, who kept a piano, a harp and a barrel organ in his sitting room. It is said that the organ was bought from Loose Church, and so fixed that the power from the mill turned the organ's handle. Dickens would visit the mill on his walks, and listen to the organ music. The Frindsbury Mills. * The oldest was a tripod ‚Äì or post mill. It was called the Quarry Mill and was 100 yards south east of the church. Destroyed in 1850. The other four mills were all owned by Mr Kimmins. * On Prospect Hill there were two mills. The first was called Manwaring Mill, or Little Mill. It was a black tarred smock mill, and it drove four sets of stones. Little Mill was struck by lightning and demolished in 1886. * Also on Prospect Hill was Great Mill or Rose's Mill. It was the highest in Kent with 40 feet by nine feet sweeps. Together the two mills produced 400 sacks of flour a week. Great Mill was demolished in 1890. * Kimmin's Mill on Frindsbury Hill was a smock mill with no base. The land became a brick field. A man was killed by its sweeps. * House Mill, also known as Kimmins Mill or Frindsbury Mill, stood on Frindsbury hill and was a black smock mill. It was demolished in 1931. There was a tidemill. When the tide was rising, water flowed into the mill pond driving a mill, when the tide was falling, water flowed back into the river, driving the mill. Horticulture The damson cultivar 'Farleigh Damson' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. *'Farleigh Damson' (syn. 'Crittenden's Prolific', 'Strood Cluster') is named after the village of East Farleigh in Kent, where it was raised by James Crittenden in the early 19th century. An 1871 letter to the Journal of horticulture and practical gardening claimed that the original seedling had been found by a Mr. Herbert, the tenant of a market garden in Strood, who had given it to Crittenden.Letter from Thomas Rivers, Journal of horticulture and practical gardening, Volume 20, (1871), 349 It has small, roundish, black fruit, with a blue bloom, and is a very heavy bearer.Hyams and Jackson, The orchard and fruit garden: a new pomona of hardy and sub-tropical fruits, Longmans, 1961, p.48 Its heavy cropping led to it being widely planted in England. Housing Work progresses on the foundations of the first houses in the Medway Gate Housing Development. The former Edwardian Aveling & Porter building March 2010 The area of Strood around Knight's Place and Temple Street, was referred to as the Swamp. On the floods Smetham wrote in 1899 in that woebegone spot the foul contents of water closets were washed into poor peoples homes, and an indescribable filth permeated the fetid spot for months. In 1912 there was a typhoid outbreak here, 56 people contracted it, and five died. In the 1880s, there was a major expansion of houses. Terraced houses were built on the hill, closing the gap between Strood and Frindsbury. The land around St Mary's, now drained and close to the station was used. There was a mix of house sizes, from the large detached to the small terraces that opened on the street. They were all built in local yellow brick, with detailing in reds. Following World War I, the city built 19 houses in Steele St, and 73 on Frindsbury Hill (Murray Road). Following World War II, under the Housing Act, 1946, and the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956 the city continued to build, including the triangle between the A228, Watling Street and the M2. With continuing population growth and pressure from commuters, more and more land has been developed by the private sector. By 2000, the riverside by the station had been developed. Kingswear Gardens off Canal Road is a social housing estate. Kingswear Gardens is a high crime area, and is prone to flooding. The chalkpit by the A228 at Merral's Shaw now has 400 dwellings on it, in spite of the massive infrastructure work needed, (roads and landscaping) this development is called Medway Gate. In 2009, plans were in existence to build over the Temple Marsh. Up to 620 homes are planned to be built and up to 12,300 sq metres of mixed-use employment and retail floorspace to develop. Now renamed as 'Temple Waterfront'. There are concerns for the architectural heritage in the area. A sad loss of an Edwardian gem occurred in 2010 when Medway Council demolished the Aveling & Porter building to make way for a car park.

Churches Grade II listed St Nicholas church, Strood Front elevation of Strood Methodist Church Plaque recording the use of the church as an auxiliary hospital during the Great War 1914‚Äì1918 The parish church for Strood is St Nicholas College Yard Strood which is Grade II listed building. St Mary's (notionally Frindsbury) was opened by Bishop Claughton in 1869 as a chapel of ease. It has subsequently closed as an Anglican church but has been taken over by the New Testament Church of God. The other Anglican church in the area is St Francis. There are two Catholic churches; English Martyrs and St Justus. The Methodist church in Stonehouse Lane has undergone two changes of name. First the road name changed to Cliffe Road and then the church changed from \\"Jubilee\\" to \\"Peninsular\\".Notice board outside main door During the First World War the church was lent to the St John's Voluntary Aid Department as an auxiliary hospital.Bronze plaque affixed to the front wall Protestant dissenters founded the Zoar chapel in 1782. There is a Gospel Mission Evangelical church in Brompton Lane and an Evangelical church in Darnley Road. Sport and leisure Non-League football club Rochester United F.C., formerly Bly Spartans, plays at Bly Spartans Sports Ground in Strood. The club is in the Kent League, at level nine of the English football league system. Gillingham FC, in EFL's League One is the local professional team, being located approximately three miles from central Strood. Strood boasts an impressive Sports Centre, complete with astroturf floodlit football pitches. People An illustration of flowers including Columbine and larkspur by Anne Pratt Anne Pratt (1806‚Äì1893), the botanist, was born in Strood. She wrote several books in the 19th century covering a wide range of botanical subjects. She was so well respected for her knowledge of wild flowers that she was granted an allowance from the Civil List. A portrait of her was placed in the Rochester museum. Her most famous work is The flowering plants, grasses, sedges, and ferns of Great Britain and their allies the club mosses, pepperworts, and horsetails. London: Frederick Warne and Co. Charles Roach Smith (1806‚Äì1890) notable amateur archaeologist, died in Strood. He was born at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, the youngest of 10 children. In 1826 he moved to London, and established his own business as a chemist in 1834. In 1876 he and his sister bought Temple Place in Cuxton Road, Strood, and some adjoining horticultural land. In London he made the first collection of Roman coins from London excavations which was bought by the British Museum. He subsequently pioneered 'urban site observation' and his 'Illustrations of Roman London '(1859) remained the principal work on the subject until 1909. He pioneered the statistic study of Roman coin hoards. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1836), London Numismatic Society (1837) and was founder member of the British Archaeological Association (1843). After his death, four streets in Strood were named in his honour, Charles Street, Smith Street, Roach Street and Antiquarian Street. Three of these still exist in the vicinity of the Tesco supermarket with Antiquarian Street being demolished and the area now being under the Tesco car park. Isaac Newell (Strood, 24 April 1853 ‚Äì Rosario, Argentina, 16 October 1907) a teacher and a pioneer of football in Argentina. He was the founder of the Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino and the founder of Argentinean football club Newell's Old Boys, which is named in his honour. This club is considered the sixth most important team of Argentina.

Such graphs are excellent spectral expanders. As Murty's survey paper notes, Ramanujan graphs \\"fuse diverse branches of pure mathematics, namely, number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry\\". These graphs are indirectly named after Srinivasa Ramanujan; their name comes from the Ramanujan‚ÄìPetersson conjecture, which was used in a construction of some of these graphs. Definition Let G be a connected d-regular graph with n vertices, and let \\\\lambda_1 \\\\geq \\\\lambda_2 \\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n be the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G (or the spectrum of G). Because G is connected and d-regular, its eigenvalues satisfy d = \\\\lambda_1 > \\\\lambda_2 \\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\geq \\\\lambda_n \\\\geq -d . Define \\\\lambda(G) = \\\\max_{i eq 1}\\\\lambda_i = \\\\max(\\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_n). A connected d-regular graph G is a Ramanujan graph if \\\\lambda(G) \\\\leq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. Many sources uses an alternative definition \\\\lambda'(G) = \\\\max_{\\\\lambda_i < d} \\\\lambda_i (whenever there exists \\\\lambda_i with \\\\lambda_i < d) to define Ramanujan graphs. In other words, we allow -d in addition to the \\"small\\" eigenvalues. Since \\\\lambda_n = -d if and only if the graph is bipartite, we will refer to the graphs that satisfy this alternative definition but not the first definition bipartite Ramanujan graphs. As observed by Toshikazu Sunada, a regular graph is Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analog of the Riemann hypothesis.  Examples and constructions  The complete graph K_{d+1} has spectrum d, -1, -1, \\\\dots, -1, and thus \\\\lambda(K_{d+1}) = 1 and the graph is a Ramanujan graph for every d > 1. The complete bipartite graph K_{d,d} has spectrum d, 0, 0, \\\\dots, 0, -d and hence is a bipartite Ramanujan graph for every d. The Petersen graph has spectrum 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -2, -2, -2, -2, so it is a 3-regular Ramanujan graph. The icosahedral graph is a 5-regular Ramanujan graph. A Paley graph of order q is \\\\frac{q-1}{2}-regular with all other eigenvalues being \\\\frac{-1\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{q}}{2}, making Paley graphs an infinite family of Ramanujan graphs. Mathematicians are often interested in constructing d-regular Ramanujan graphs for every fixed d. Current constructions of infinite families of such Ramanujan graphs are often algebraic. *Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak show how to construct an infinite family of (p+1)-regular Ramanujan graphs, whenever p is a prime number and p\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 4. Their proof uses the Ramanujan conjecture, which led to the name of Ramanujan graphs. Besides being Ramanujan graphs, their construction satisfies some other properties, for example, their girth is \\\\Omega(\\\\log_{p}(n)) where n is the number of nodes. * Morgenstern extended the construction of Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak. His extended construction holds whenever p is a prime power. * Arnold Pizer proved that the supersingular isogeny graphs are Ramanujan, although they tend to have lower girth than the graphs of Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak. Like the graphs of Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak, the degrees of these graphs are always a prime number plus one. These graphs have been proposed as the basis for post-quantum elliptic-curve cryptography. * Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava proved the existence of infinitely many d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graphs for any d\\\\geq 3. Later they proved that there exist bipartite Ramanujan graphs of every degree and every number of vertices. Michael B. Cohen showed how to construct these graphs in polynomial time. It is still an open problem whether there are infinitely many d-regular (non-bipartite) Ramanujan graphs for any d\\\\geq 3. In particular, the problem is open for d = 7, the smallest case for which d-1 is not a prime power and hence not covered by Morgenstern's construction.  Ramanujan graphs as expander graphs  The constant 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} in the definition of Ramanujan graphs is the best possible constant for each d and for large graphs: in other words, for every d and \\\\epsilon > 0, there exists n such that all d-regular graphs G with at least n vertices satisfy \\\\lambda(G) > 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - \\\\epsilon. (See below for more precise statements and proof sketches.) On the other hand, Friedman showed that for every d and \\\\epsilon > 0 and for sufficiently large n, a random d-regular n-vertex graph G satisfies \\\\lambda(G) < 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} + \\\\epsilon with high probability. This means that Ramanujan graphs are essentially the best possible expander graphs. Due to achieving the tight bound on \\\\lambda (G), the expander mixing lemma gives excellent bounds on the uniformity of the distribution of the edges in Ramanujan graphs, and any random walks on the graphs has a logarithmic mixing time (in terms of the number of vertices): in other words, the random walk converges to the (uniform) stationary distribution very quickly. Therefore, the diameter of Ramanujan graphs are also bounded logarithmically in terms of the number of vertices. =Extremality of Ramanujan graphs= If G is a d-regular graph with diameter m, a theorem due to Noga Alon. states :\\\\lambda_2(G) \\\\geq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - 1}{\\\\lfloor m/2\\\\rfloor}. Whenever G is d-regular and connected on at least three vertices, \\\\lambda_2 < d, and therefore \\\\lambda(G) \\\\geq \\\\lambda_2. Let \\\\mathcal{G}_n^d be the set of all connected d-regular graphs G with at least n vertices. Because the minimum diameter of graphs in \\\\mathcal{G}_n^d approaches infinity for fixed d and increasing n, this theorem implies an earlier theorem of Alon and Boppana which states : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\inf_{G \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}_n^d} \\\\lambda(G) \\\\geq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. A slightly stronger bound is :\\\\lambda_2(G) \\\\geq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} \\\\cdot \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{c}{m^2}\\\\right), where c\\\\approx 2\\\\pi^2. The outline of the proof is the following. Take k=\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor-1. Let T_{d,k} be the complete (d-1)-ary tree of height k (each internal vertex has d-1 children), and let A_{d,k} be its adjacency matrix. We want to prove that \\\\lambda_2(G)\\\\geq \\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k})=2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\cos\\\\theta, where \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{k+2}. Define a function g:V(T_{d,k})\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R by g(x)=(d-1)^{-\\\\delta/2}\\\\cdot \\\\sin((k+1-\\\\delta)\\\\theta), where \\\\delta is the distance from x to the root of T_{d,k}. One can verify that A_{t,k}g=\\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k})g and that \\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k}) is indeed the largest eigenvalue of A_{d,k}. Now let s and t be a pair of vertices at distance m in G and define : f(v)=\\\\begin{cases} c_1 g(v_s) & \\\\text{for } v \\\\text{ at distance } \\\\leq k \\\\text{ from } s, \\\\\\\\\\\\ -c_2 g(v_t) & \\\\text{for } v \\\\text{ at distance } \\\\leq k\\\\text{ from } t, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise,}\\\\end{cases} where v_s is a vertex in T_{d,k} which distance to the root is equal to the distance from v to s and the symmetric for v_t. (One can think of this as \\"embedding\\" two disjoint copies of T_{d, k}, with some vertices collapsed into one.) By choosing the value of positive reals c_1,c_2 properly we get f\\\\perp 1, (Af)_v\\\\geq \\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k})f_v for v close to s and (Af)_v\\\\leq \\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k})f_v for v close to t. Then by the min-max theorem we get\\\\lambda_2(G)\\\\geq fAf^T/\\\\f\\\\^2\\\\geq \\\\lambda_1(T_{d,k})\\\\approx 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{m}\\\\right)^2\\\\right),as desired.

Others were to join later. The ordination of bishops from within the apostolic succession was of major importance to this group, as also was having the church recognized as a lawfully constituted Religious denomination. The latter event occurred, at least tacitly, when an archdeacon from the group was exempted from World War I conscription in 1917 due to his clergy status, which would not have been permitted had the group not been considered a lawfully constituted denomination. Formation of the Church, 1897 In 1890 Bishop Leon Chechemian, who had been a priest (vardapet) in the Armenian Catholic Church and later emigrated to England, where he was consecrated as a bishop, created the Free Protestant Church of England. In 1897 his church united with two other churches; the Ancient British Church and the Nazarene Episcopal Church, thus creating the Free Protestant Episcopal Church of England, an Anglican church independent of the Church of England. Dr Chechemian was appointed the first Primus of the newly formed FPEC. History The church had traditionally been quite small. There are various reasons for this, but one of them seems to be that clergy had tended to pass through it as a church in which to be ordained by bishops from the historic apostolic succession before moving on to other, larger church bodies. More recently, the communion has evolved and grown, at present having twenty five (25) provinces in different USA states and countries. Leadership of the Church moved to the United States in 1978 but returned to the United Kingdom in 2015. =Links with Mar Georgius, 1956‚Äì1960= From 1956 to 1960, the FPEC was formally affiliated to the movement then led by Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius). Formal links ceased in October 1960. =Schism, circa 1978‚Äì2011= The FPEC has known internal dissension, some based on theological disputes and some on personalities. After a schism (circa 1978) in the communion, one of the factions led by Dr. Horst Block was renamed \\"The International Free Protestant Episcopal Church (TIFPEC)\\". On 12 February 2008 Dr. Block died and Bishop Peter Leers succeeded him as the Primus of TIFPEC. In February 2011 Leers dissolved that schismatic jurisdiction, ending the division. The original organization (FPEC) survived. Dr. Edwin Duane Follick was Primus at the time of the 2011 reconciliation, and thus he became Primus of the re-united body. =Schism of 2020= In 2020 a group of Bishops mostly from Latin America formally declared there intent to remove Archbishop Palmer this was done without the approval of the other Bishops within the Communion, and thus this group which continued to use the name Anglican Free Communion are considered a schismatic group by the original communion as can be read on the official .org.uk website used by the AFC. This Schismatic group would eventually add the name International to its name becoming the Anglican Free Communion International (AFCI), this group is headed by Archbishop Firestone but is not the original AFC despite its claims to the contrary. =Names= During the Bishops' Synod of 2012, in Bolivia, the organization adopted the new name \\"The Anglican Free Communion\\". Other names that have been used during the church's history include \\"Episcopal Apostolic Church of England\\" and \\"Ecumenical Church Foundation\\". Description The Free Protestant Episcopal Church (The Anglican Free Communion) is one of the oldest Anglican Communions in existence and is constituted by a large group of Anglicans of all varieties of churchmanship from Anglo-Catholic (High Church), Evangelical (Low Church), Latitudinarian (Broad Church), Charismatic and Liberal. All of the Provinces of the Communion are autonomous, comprising self-governing churches and families of churches around the world. As at 2016, Richard Arthur Palmer is the Primus. Richard Arthur Palmer was consecrated in the Liberal Catholic Church in 1997. He has subsequently been involved in the Reformed Liberal Catholic Church (Old Catholic), the Society for Independent Christian Ministry, the Open Episcopal Church and the United Episcopal Church. He was one of the founders of the Open Episcopal Church and for a five-year term he was its primate. The Free Protestant Episcopal Church is a communion of free Anglican churches around the world, living an Anglican reconciliation and unity. Apostolic succession The church claims valid apostolic succession derived from the Armenian Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Church of England (through the Reformed Episcopal Church of the United States of America). These lines were in the jurisdictions that united in 1897 to found the Free Protestant Episcopal Church. It is doubtful whether the line of succession from the Armenian Catholic Church is carries an un-broken episcopal succession. Leon Chechemian was a vardapet in the Armenian Catholic Church but evidence that he was ever a bishop in that church is lacking. For more detail, visit the wikipage of Leon Chechemain.

Cuddy and Keelor moved to New York City in the early 1980s to further their music careers. There they met keyboardist and fellow Canadian Bob Wiseman, who was at that time working as a producer. Upon returning to Toronto in the summer of 1984, the trio decided to form a band. The name \\"Blue Rodeo\\" had already been chosen for the new group when they met former David Wilcox drummer Cleave Anderson and asked him to join. Anderson in turn recommended his former bandmate in The Sharks, bassist Bazil Donovan, and the new band's lineup was essentially set. In 1985 Blue Rodeo played their first show together at The Rivoli in Toronto;Schneider, Jason Timeline: Blue Rodeo: Better Off as We Are at Exclaim! December 2009. one week later, they performed at Handsome Ned's \\"Honky Tonk Heart\\".\\"The birth of Blue Rodeo\\". The Globe and Mail, November 16, 2004. The band quickly earned a following in Toronto and was subsequently signed to Canadian independent record label Risque Disque. They entered the studio in 1986 with Rush producer Terry Brown and recorded several songs that would comprise Blue Rodeo's debut album, Outskirts. Released in March, 1987, Outskirts met with moderate success in Canada, until \\"Try\\" was released as a single in October of that year. The single was an immediate hit, going to number one on the RPM Country Tracks chart and number six on the RPM Top Singles chart, establishing Blue Rodeo as one of Canada's top new bands and carrying Outskirts to 4√ó Platinum status in sales. The music video for the single featured Keelor's then-girlfriend Michelle McAdorey, who soon had success with her own band, Crash Vegas. In 1992, the band's song After the Rain, written by Cuddy and Keelor, was the most-performed song in Canada. By 1999 the band had sold more than two million albums in Canada. Cuddy, Keelor, Donovan and Cripps have all released solo albums, and Glenn Milchem performs his own solo music under the pseudonym \\"the swallows\\". Keelor has also gone on to produce for other artists, notably alt-country group Cuff the Duke, who have also toured as support for Blue Rodeo. Blue Rodeo members have collaborated extensively with other notable Canadian artists, including Sarah McLachlan, The Tragically Hip, Burton Cummings, Great Big Sea, Jann Arden, The Sadies, Skydiggers, Cuff the Duke, Crash Vegas, Cowboy Junkies, Sarah Harmer, Jill Barber, and Kathleen Edwards. They have won many Canadian music awards, including twelve Juno Awards and seven SOCAN awards. On June 16, 2009, it was announced that the band would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009. They are the fifth band to receive the honour.

As of 2015, it is developed, maintained and owned by Miva Merchant, Inc., based in San Diego, California. Many web hosting companies support Miva Script on their servers, but it is significantly less widespread than other popular web languages. History The language was first developed under the name HTMLScript by Joe Austin and others in 1995, and a company, HTMLScript Corporation, was formed the following year.Joe Austin - history of miva The origins of Miva Script began in 1993 when David Haldy and Joseph Austin built the first version of HTMLScript. The first version was written in the programming language Perl, which was called Logic Enhanced HTML (LEHTML). Joseph Austin wrote a wrapper for it in the programming language C that let it start off as a root process and then downgrade itself immediately to the ownership and permissions of the owner of the script file. This wrapper made it suitable for use with his hosting service which was called Volant Turnpike at the time. Joseph Austin eventually sold Volant Turnpike to Dave Haldy. Perl allowed self-executing code, so LEHTML did not have its own expression analyzer and just parsed the expression into Perl syntax and then passed it into Perl. Volant Turnpike users liked using LEHTML, so Joseph Austin and Ron Ahern wrote an expression analyzer and re-implemented the LEHTML syntax in the C language. Joseph Austin called the end result HTMLScript and registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Joseph Austin, Troy McCasland and Derek Finley were the founders of the company called HTMLScript Corporation. HTMLScript did not have the concept of a \\"WHILE\\" or \\"FOR\\" loop because of the low server processing power at the time. It would be enough to bring the whole server down if even one program ran away. So, Joseph Austin did not implement a loop to make it impossible for an HTMLScript server process to run away. Also, he implemented the macro in the first version of HTMLScript so it would allow self-executing code. The macro was powerful, but it eventually had some security issues. In 1997, Jon Burchmore extensively rewrote the language to make it more syntactically consistent, although the new engine supported both old HTMLScript and new (named mivascript) syntaxes. Jon Burchmore rewrote HTMLScript with syntax that Joe developed with the help of SoftQuad, using the emerging XML standard. Jon Burchmore wrote the replacement for KoolKat which then became Miva Merchant. The new end-product supported both the old HTMLScript syntax and new (named Miva Script) syntaxes. On October 14, 1997, HTMLScript‚Äôs name was changed to Miva Script and the company name was changed to Miva. Soon afterward, Miva Merchant followed suit for the name of the product. The name Miva comes from the Egyptian hieroglyphics for the word cat. The word for cat is a combination of two symbols: milk basin followed by a quail. The milk basin is pronounced mee and the quail is pronounced waa which are combined to say cat. Joseph Austin thought this was clever, as they had called KoolKat ‚Äúan electronic (cat)alog.‚Äù Joseph showed it to a German friend who could not pronounce the waa sound and instead kept on pronouncing it as va. Joseph Austin registered the domain Miva.com and filed the trademark.HTMLScript History and How Miva Got Their Name In 1998, the firm was renamed Miva Corporation. In 1998, the first version of Miva Merchant came out. In 2002, the Miva Script compiler was delivered, and the HTMLScript syntax and macros were dropped from the engine. Miva Corporation was sold in 2003 to a mid-cap, public company called FindWhat.History of Miva Subsequently, FindWhat bought the name Miva.FindWhat.com Finds $8m for Miva In 2007, Russell Carroll and a group of investors bought the original Miva technologies and customer base from Miva and started Miva Merchant, Inc.Miva Small Business Solutions Acquired Language features Miva Script is often described as 'XML-like' although this is something of a misnomer.Miva Script 3.9 It consists of tags which may be interspersed with HTML and XHTML and which all start with Empresa In versions numbered less than 4.0, Miva Merchant Empresa is a script interpreter available for web servers running *nix and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The most recent interpreter version is 3.9705. Interpreted Miva Script is still widely supported by many web hosts. Versions numbered 3.9x are a transitional form of the language, implementing some (but not all) of the new features found in version 4, such as arrays. Since 4.0, Miva Merchant Empresa is a Virtual Machine for running compiled Miva Script, again available in versions for *nix and Microsoft Windows. The current version level 5.x added new language constructs, native SQL support, a new access-methodology for dbase3 tables, called MIVA-SQL, and a new templating syntax that the Empresa virtual machine can compile on the fly. Version 5.08 and later support the GD Graphics Library. =Miva Merchant Mia= Miva Merchant Mia is a version of the Empresa engine designed to run on a Windows PC as a localhost server watching a specified port, usually 8000 or 8080.Mia No other server software is needed unless the Post Office Protocol (POP) and SMTP functions are used. This provides a portable, stand-alone development environment. Miva Merchant Mia is updated with each Miva Merchant Empresa release. Like Empressa, versions pre-4 are interpreters while post-4.0 work only with compiled script. There are a few minor differences between. =Miva Merchant Script Compiler -- Miva Script= Miva Merchant Script CompilerCompiler was introduced in mid-2002, claiming to offer better performance and the closure of application source code. Compilability required some changes to the language, with support for the old HTMLScript syntax and macros evaluated at runtime (often considered a security risk) dropped. The compiler produces a platform-independent bytecode which runs on the Miva Merchant Empresa and Miva Merchant Mia Virtual Machines Minor variations exist between Empresa and Mia virtual machines. In May 2005, MIVA Corporation made the Script Compiler available free. In 2011, the built in licensing code was removed simplifying installation. In August 2007, Miva Merchant was separated from its parent company due to a management buy-out. (ref. press release) Miva Script 5.0 Introduced the a page template compiler command which is the basis for Miva Merchant Storemorph&trade; page template system. This compiler within a compiler offers a simplified subset of the full language, more suitable for end user creation and editing of web page templates. Storemorph&trade; pages allow modular components created in MivaScript, to be added to a template extending its capabilities. February 2011 introduced the new MivaScript.com website fully documenting the latest version of the language, including the GD Graphics Library.

He formed early punk band Buzzcocks with Howard Devoto in 1976, and became the lead singer and guitarist in 1977 when Devoto left. The group released their biggest hit \\"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\\" in 1978. The band broke up in 1981 and reformed at the end of the decade. Shelley also had a solo career; his song \\"Homosapien\\" charted in the US in 1981. Biography Shelley was born to Margaret and John McNeish at 48 Milton Street, in Leigh, Lancashire. His mother was an ex-mill worker in the town and his father was a fitter at Astley Green Colliery. He had a younger brother, Gary. Shelley's stage name is inspired by Percy Bysshe Shelley, his favourite Romantic poet. =Buzzcocks= Shelley formed Buzzcocks with Howard Devoto after they met at the Bolton Institute of Technology (now the University of Bolton) in 1975 and subsequently travelled to High Wycombe, near London, to see the Sex Pistols. The band included bass guitarist Steve Diggle and drummer John Maher; they made their first appearance in 1976 in Manchester, opening for the Sex Pistols. In 1977 Buzzcocks released their first EP, Spiral Scratch, on their independent label, New Hormones. When Devoto left the band in February 1977, Shelley took over as the lead vocalist and chief songwriter. Working with the producer Martin Rushent, the band created the punk/new wave singles \\"Orgasm Addict\\", \\"What Do I Get?\\" and \\"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\\", along with three LPs: Another Music in a Different Kitchen (1978), Love Bites (1978) and A Different Kind of Tension (1979). Difficulties with their record company and a dispute with Virgin Publishing over the UK release of their greatest hits record, Singles Going Steady, brought the band to a halt in 1981. Shelley developed a different personal image from many of his rebellious 1970s punk contemporaries, telling Melody Maker in 1978, \\"I won't be nasty. We‚Äôre just four nice lads, the kind of people you could take home to your parents.\\" =Solo career= Shelley's solo debut album Sky Yen was recorded in 1974 but remained unheard until it was released on 12\\" vinyl on Shelley's own label, Groovy Records, in March 1980. It was recorded as a continuous piece of music using a purpose-built oscillator, and used layered electronics and playback speed manipulation to achieve its experimental feel. Rooted in electronic music, it has been compared with krautrock.[ Sky Yen] from Allmusic.com Also released on Groovy Records was the soundtrack LP Hangahar by Sally Timms and Lindsay Lee, which included Shelley as a musician, and an album by artists Eric Random, Barry Adamson and Francis Cookson under the name Free Agents. Groovy Records did not release any other records. In 1981 Shelley released his first solo single, \\"Homosapien\\", produced by Rushent. On this recording he returned to his original interests in electronic music and shifted emphasis from guitar to synthesiser; Rushent's elaborate drum machine and synthesiser programming laid the groundwork for his next production, the chart-topping album Dare by the Human League. \\"Homosapien\\" was banned by the BBC for \\"explicit reference to gay sex\\". \\"Homosapien\\" peaked at number fourteen in the US dance chart. Shelley talked openly about his bisexuality at this time, which had been implicit in many of the songs he had written, but now came to wider attention due to \\"Homosapien\\" and the BBC ban. The single was followed by an LP of the same title. Shelley released his second LP XL1 in 1983 on Genetic Records. As well as the minor hit \\"Telephone Operator\\", the album included a computer program for the ZX Spectrum with lyrics and graphics that displayed in time to the music. XL1 was produced by Rushent and Shelley. Pete Shelley singing with Buzzcocks at Shepherds Bush Empire, 30 January 2009 In June 1986 Shelley released the single \\"Never Again\\", followed by the album Heaven and the Sea. In 1987 he followed the album with a new song, \\"Do Anything\\", for the film Some Kind of Wonderful. He composed the theme music for the intro of the Tour de France on Channel 4, which was used from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Shelley recorded a new version of \\"Homosapien\\", called \\"Homosapien II\\", in 1989. The single featured four mixes of the new recording. He played with various other musicians during his career, including the Invisible Girls who backed punk poet John Cooper Clarke. Shelley also formed a short-lived band called the Tiller Boys. He briefly reunited with Howard Devoto to make the LP Buzzkunst, released in 2002. Shelley appeared on the 2005 debut EP by the Los Angeles band the Adored, who toured with Buzzcocks the following year. =Buzzcocks reform= Buzzcocks reunited in 1989 and released a new full-length album, Trade Test Transmissions, in 1993. They continued to tour and record and released the album The Way in 2014. In 2005 Shelley re-recorded \\"Ever Fallen in Love\\" with an all-star group, including Roger Daltrey, David Gilmour, Peter Hook, Elton John, Robert Plant and several contemporary bands, as a tribute to John Peel; proceeds went to Amnesty International. Shelley performed the song live at the 2005 UK Music Hall of Fame.

His son was born in 1993. Shelley moved to Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012 with his second wife, Greta, an Estonian, preferring the less-hectic pace there to London where he had lived for nearly thirty years. He died there of a suspected heart attack on the morning of 6 December 2018. His brother, Gary McNeish, announced his death on Facebook. Tributes to Shelley came from a diverse range of music industry professionals, including Pearl Jam, Duff McKagan, Pixies, Billy Talent, Peter Hook, Duran Duran, Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Joyce, Gary Kemp, Flea, Mike Mills, Ginger Wildheart, Glen Matlock and Stuart Braithwaite. Musician Billy Bragg paid tribute to Shelley, covering Buzzcocks', \\"Ever Fallen in Love With Someone You Shouldn't Have Fallen in Love With\\", on 7 December 2018 at Meredith Music Festival. Following his death the Pete Shelley Memorial campaign was established in order to raise funds to create a lasting memorial in his hometown for his achievements and contributions to the music industry.

Rick has been a sidekick and friend to Bruce Banner / Hulk, Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mar-Vell / Captain Marvel, Rom the Spaceknight, and Genis-Vell / Captain Marvel. He has been an active participant in many significant Marvel Universe story lines including the Kree-Skrull War and the Destiny War. He later acquired powers, causing his learning capabilities to be greatly increased. He decided to direct his new ability towards communications technology, and ended up becoming a hacktivist known as the Whisperer.Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1. Marvel Comics. Publication history Rick Jones was created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in Hulk #1 (May 1962). Fictional character biography Rick Jones was born in Scarsdale, Arizona. He lost his parents at a young age and as a result grew up at an orphanage. Later, he accepts a dare to drive out to a bomb testing ground in New Mexico. As luck would have it, the gamma bomb designed by Dr. Robert Bruce Banner is being tested. Banner pushes Rick into a protective trench saving his life, but absorbing the gamma rays that transform Banner into the Hulk. Rick thus becomes the sole confidant of the Hulk's true identity.The Incredible Hulk Vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics. = Early days with the Hulk and the Avengers = Jones' guilt over causing the incident (and lack of any other place to go) leads him to stay close to Dr. Banner and the Hulk alter ego. In one story, he even gains mental control over Hulk. Eventually, the dangerous unpredictability of Hulk forces Rick to keep his distance. Later, Rick forms the Teen Brigade, a loose network of teenagers with ham radios throughout the United States. The first Teen Brigade played a role in the origin of the Avengers when the Norse god Loki tampered with the Teen Brigade's radio transmission. Originally, the Teen Brigade intended to bring the Fantastic Four together to battle the Hulk, but instead brought Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Thor together to form the Avengers.Avengers Vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics. After the Hulk's departure from the team, Rick becomes an honorary Avenger. He alerted the team to the Hulk's presence when they began searching for Hulk.Avengers Vol. 1 #3. Marvel Comics.Avengers Vol. 1 #4. Marvel Comics. He becomes close to the recently revived Captain America although his guilt leads him to leave the Avengers and seek out Banner and Hulk on his own.Avengers Vol. 1 #17; Tales to Astonish #69. Marvel Comics. Captain America rescues Rick from one of Hulk's rampages, and after that Rick becomes Captain America's sidekick, briefly taking the title and uniform of Bucky, Captain America's long-dead junior partner. This was on Jones' own insistence, but Captain America continues to have guilty objections, noting that others have lost partners and it was time to move on. Rick's brief time as Bucky gave him the training to survive around superheroes to this day.Captain America #110‚Äì116. Marvel Comics. When Rick believed Hulk to be dead (although Hulk had actually been sent to the future), he revealed the truth of Banner's condition to Col. Glenn Talbot, thus inadvertently making Banner a wanted fugitive by the US Military.Tales to Astonish #77. Marvel Comics. =Captain Mar-Vell= After being neglected by Captain America, Rick became fed up with the Captain's ego. After talking with Edwin Jarvis, Rick decided to leave the Avengers for good. Rick joined with the Kree Captain Marvel when he finds himself drawn to the mystical Nega-Bands. Donning the Bands, he is immediately linked to Captain Marvel. Once joined, one of the two remains in a protective bubble in the Negative Zone. After either the person not in the Negative Zone strikes the Nega-Bands together or a certain amount of time passes, the two switch places.Captain Marvel #17. Marvel Comics. Rick and Mar-Vell go on various adventures encountering many different heroes, such as the Hulk, Namor, and Captain America. Rick and Mar-Vell play a critical part in the Kree-Skrull War. Rick is freed from the Negative Zone through a portal in the Fantastic Four headquarters. Mar-Vell is released from the Negative Zone while Rick is still in the regular world without the use of the Nega-Bands. The bond between the two is broken. At the height of the conflict, the Kree Supreme Intelligence briefly unleashes the Destiny Force from within Rick. Rick uses his new-found ability to summon images of various Golden Age heroes. While at full power, Rick single-handedly stops both the Kree and Skrull fleets long enough to put an end to the conflict. Injuries that Rick sustains lead Mar-Vell to willingly bond with Rick in order to save his life.Avengers #89‚Äì97. Marvel Comics. Shortly after this the Captain Marvel series was re-launched and we found that Rick wasn't able to contain the energy of Mar-Vell. He was then bombarded with photonic energy, which saved him and enabled him to contain Mar-Vell safely. A consequence of this was that Mar-Vell gained the ability to absorb energy in addition to the nega-band energies to boost his strength and could fly with the photonic energy now.Captain Marvel vol 1 #22 (Sept. 1972). Marvel Comics. Rick and Mar-Vell serve as a duo for several years while Rick pursues his musical career and love life. Eventually, the two are again freed from their bond while aiding the Avengers against the Super-Adaptoid. Rick then parts company with Mar- Vell.Captain Marvel #50‚Äì51. Marvel Comics. Rick begins to spend his time with the Hulk again and briefly forms a new Teen Brigade, after which Rick finds himself again teamed with Mar-Vell, though not merged with him as they deal with a legacy left by the Mad Titan Thanos. Sometime after, Mar-Vell dies of cancer that he received when he was exposed to a deadly nerve gas stolen by the villain Nitro.Captain Marvel vol 1 #34. Marvel Comics. Note: Mar-Vell collapsed from the gas and was comatose until he was given an antidote to the gas. However, despite the antidote, Mar-Vell still developed cancer and there was some momentary concern that the link Rick shared with him could have caused himself to contract the condition. Rick was at Mar-Vell's bedside when he died.Marvel Graphic Novel #1. Marvel Comics. =Venturing with Rom= After Mar-Vell's death, Rick began to team with the Hulk again. Guilt over causing Banner to be hit with the gamma rays made Rick decide to expose himself to gamma rays in an attempt to become another Hulk-like being that could stop the Hulk. However this plan backfired and Rick was dying of gamma poisoning until Banner cured him. However, this too led to the consequence of Rick developing a form of blood cancer.Rom #56. Marvel Comics. Rick was going to undergo a massive blood transfusion to treat this ailment when the hospital was attacked by monsters created by the Dire Wraiths. Rick was saved by the Spaceknight Rom and began to team with Rom despite the fact that Rick was slowly dying.Rom #57. Marvel Comics. Upon the final defeat of the Wraiths, Rom banished them all to Limbo and then bade farewell to Rick Jones and Earth.Rom #70. Marvel Comics. Shortly after Rom left, Rick Jones met the alien called The Beyonder, who cured Jones of his cancer.Rom #72. Marvel Comics. =Reunion with the Hulk= Shortly after the encounter with the Beyonder, Rick once again teamed with the Hulk. This time, the Hulk had been split into two beings, Banner and Hulk, but the experiment was a failure and both were dying. General Ross tried to stop the process of remerging the two, and Rick intervened only to be dumped into the chemical nutrient bath that was fusing Banner and the Hulk again. This resulted in Rick somehow becoming a Hulk-like creature of his own and he took off into the desert on a savage rampage. Rick would be human at day and be his own green-skinned near mindless Hulk at night. With the Vision's help, Banner and the Hulk are made whole again, but, both are weak and still dying. As a result of a Nutrient Bath developed by Doc Samson, Banner/Hulk is reverted from Green Hulk into the Grey Hulk. During this time, Rick as Hulk battled the Grey Hulk, Zzzax, the Hulkbusters, and the Outcasts. The Grey Hulk is manipulated by Sam Sterns, along with Banner, into siphoning the radiation from Rick into Sterns. Sterns is then turned back into the Leader, drastically altering his appearance, and Rick is cured of his Hulk transformations.Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #324‚Äì329, 332. Marvel Comics. Rick stays with Banner, the Grey Hulk, Betty Banner, and Clay Quartermain for several months as they travel the country looking for a government supply of gamma bombs. The group splits after the Hulk's apparent death at the Leader's hands. Rick's psionic potential is later released by Moondragon against Atlantean invaders.Avengers Annual #18. Marvel Comics. Rick authors the book \\"Sidekick\\", an autobiography of his time with super-heroes. While on a book tour, he meets Marlo Chandler without realizing that she had only recently broken up with the Hulk (then acting as a Las Vegas thug with the alias Mr. Fixit). Rick is kidnapped by a Skrull vessel and the Hulk aids in Rick's rescue.Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #374‚Äì376. Marvel Comics. This starts another period with Rick and the Hulk, this time with Marlo and Betty. =Encounters with death= Rick came in touch with death in several ways during this time with the Hulk. First, Rick dies at the hands of Thanos, along with half of the universe, when Thanos uses the Infinity Gauntlet to impress Death.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics. Rick and the others are brought back in ensuing events.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 1 #6. Marvel Comics. Rick remembers meeting several deceased rock stars. Rick assisted the Hulk many times during his tenure with the Pantheon.Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #386‚Äì390. Marvel Comics. During the time, he guns down an insane killer, but is still wracked with remorse. Over time he bonds with Wolfsbane of X-Factor, who also killed another insane murderer during the same debacle (he even ends up inviting her to his wedding). Another major encounter with death occurs when Jackie Shorr (who is revealed to be a demented serial killer) comes into his life and claims to be his mother. It is still not known for sure whether this claim is true or not, as the same claim is made by many others. She, however, insists that those she killed and left mummified in her basement were substitutes for Rick, and that he is her real son. Shorr is discovered to be insane, but not until after she kills Marlo by stabbing her with a kitchen knife.Incredible Hulk #398. Marvel Comics. A horrified Rick refuses Reed Richards's offer to carry out a DNA test, saying that he does not want to know, especially if she is truly his mother.Incredible Hulk #399. Marvel Comics. Rick attempts to bring Marlo back using a resurrection device known as the \\"deus ex machina\\" that the Leader developed, but the Hulk, believing that the Leader's efforts are part of a bigger villainous plan, destroys the equipment part way through the process.Incredible Hulk #400. Marvel Comics. Marlo is left in a catatonic state.Incredible Hulk #401. Marvel Comics. Rick's care eventually helps Marlo return to full health despite the intervention of many other well-meaning friends and family, including Marlo's brothers and Captain America.Incredible Hulk #406. Marvel Comics. Shortly after Marlo is revived, the two become engaged and quickly marry.Incredible Hulk #409. Marvel Comics. Neither of them realizes, however, that a portion of Death remains in Marlo. This piece of Death attracted many strange visitors to the wedding, including Mephisto and Death herself.Incredible Hulk #418. Marvel Comics. The married couple soon finds success in a popular talk show, Keeping Up with the Joneses, but it is cut short when Rick is crippled by a Banner-less Hulk, that made a deal to work for Apocalypse and become his Horseman \\"War\\" if he would remove the shrapnel from the Hulk's brain. The injury confines Rick to a wheelchair and the debilitation strains his relationship with Marlo. The strain increases with the death of Betty Banner by radiation poisoning to the point that the couple split shortly thereafter. Rick joins Dr. Banner again after he returns to Earth and merges with the separated Hulk. His serious health problems force him to be brought by the Avengers to the now-captive Supreme Intelligence for aid, which marks the beginning of the Destiny War, as Kang the Conqueror's rejection of his apparent destiny to become Immortus results in Rick's access to the mysterious 'Destiny Force' being used to draw in a team of seven Avengers from different points in time to act as his protectors.Avengers Forever #1. Marvel Comics. Over the course of these events, Rick's injury is healed when he is able to channel the Destiny Force into himself,Avengers Forever #3. Marvel Comics. and after the final battle with the powerful Time Keepers,Avengers Forever #11. Marvel Comics. he is joined with Genis-Vell (the recently endowed Captain Marvel and son of Mar-Vell), due to a temporal paradox involving the future Genis-Vell linking with Rick to save his life.Avengers Forever #12. Marvel Comics. =Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell)= Rick's bond with Genis works in about the same way as his bond with Mar-Vell. The biggest difference is that the two switch in and out of the Microverse rather than the Negative Zone. Genis-Vell's unique birth and accelerated aging makes him the opposite of Rick: full of power but without experience. They compensate for each other's weaknesses with Rick taking on the role of mentor. He helped Genis learn to control his Cosmic Awareness and accept his role as a superhero. As Rick's confidence grew, he also attempted to rekindle his romance with Marlo. It wasn't until this point that Marlo's connection with Death is finally revealed. Thanos aids in separating the two, but Rick is prematurely aged and loses an arm in the process. He is later yanked back in time to the Destiny War, where he aids his younger self in the conflict leading to his bond with Genis. Marlo tries to aid the elderly Rick the way he had helped her when she was catatonic. Rick's pride, however, just causes more problems. The Supreme Intelligence attempts and fails to restore Rick to his normal condition, but he is spontaneously restored to his normal age and health shortly thereafter. Rick believes this was divine aid while Genis believes it was a delayed reaction to the Supreme Intelligence's procedure. No definitive explanation has yet been determined. For a while, Rick and Genis are yanked back and forth through time. Rick encounters two older versions of himself: one an aging collector surviving under the rule of the Maestro; the other a super-villain named Thanatos. The super-villain Rick was in the process of creating the \\"ultimate Rick Jones\\". He is stopped by the elder Rick's ability to wield Thor's hammer, Rick having been judged worthy for things the present Rick had yet to do and things that Thanatos would never achieve. It is, however, unclear if Rick will become either of these older versions of himself. It has been established that the specific timeline that the old Rick lived in will not come to pass due to the Hulk having been drawn into the future to defeat his future self. Rick and Marlo again split when Marlo becomes romantically involved with Moondragon. Shortly after, Genis goes insane when his cosmic awareness reaches its peak. Rick's attempts to continue as Genis' guide are fairly unsuccessful. Genis becomes a callous, homicidal maniac believing himself a god. Rick's friend even destroys the universe just to rebuild it with Rick and Genis as sole survivors. In the rebuilt reality, Genis again loses his mind. Rick develops an ability to mentally attack Genis through their psychic bond (although the pain is reciprocal). For a time, Genis uses this same link to control Rick. He goes as far as 'convincing' Rick to kill himself on a whim. Genis brings Rick right back to life just as easily. In part due to Rick's influence, Genis' madness calmed to a point where he was able to maintain a veneer of sanity, albeit with some unpredictability. He creates a recording studio for Rick that allows for fame and fortune at the sake of Internet-based sales of a song written for Marlo. The same song also acts as a catalyst for the two to reunite, with Marlo ending her relationship with Moondragon. At the end of the series, it is revealed that Rick has a \\"comic awareness\\" that the Captain Marvel comic series was coming to an end. He pushed for several of the loose ends of the series to be resolved: Rick and Genis were separated again, and Rick was reunited with Marlo at last report. This ability was primarily created for the needs of this one issue, and it seems unlikely that it will see future usage. =Runaways= Rick was revealed to be the mysterious benefactor of Excelsior. The group is composed of former teenage superheroes dedicated to reforming other super-powered kids from following down the same path. Their first targets are the underage Runaways patrolling Los Angeles in the wake of the supervillain power vacuum since the defeat of the Runaways' evil parents, The Pride, who once controlled the city. Rick tells Excelsior that he wanted the Runaways back in foster care because he didn't want them to go through the same experiences he went through. =Fallen Son: Death of Captain America= Rick served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America, along with Ben Grimm, Ms. Marvel, The Falcon, T'Challa and Tony Stark. When Sam Wilson (The Falcon) made his inspirational speech, he mentioned that Rick would know what it's like to have called Captain America a partner. Jones replied by saying \\"Right on.\\" Fallen Son (Iron Man) #5. Marvel Comics. =World War Hulk= Rick re-connects with the Hulk during the World War Hulk mini-series. He seeks out the Hulk and attempts to talk him down, telling his friend that, while he recognized that the Illuminati had been out of line in their decision to exile him to Sakaar and their apparent involvement with the deaths of thousands of innocent people on that planet, including the Hulk's wife and unborn child, his current blind quest for vengeance was not him, using Hulk's willingness to protect innocent people caught in the fight between him and a Zom-possessed Doctor Strange as proof that the Hulk was still a hero rather than a man blindly seeking vengeance. After the Hulk's climactic battle with the Sentry resulted in him reverting to Bruce Banner, one of the Hulk's associates, Miek (who witnesses and did not prevent the true cause of the deaths on Sakaar which was not the humans), impales Rick through the chest to provoke Bruce into turning back into the Hulk. Rick is seen being loaded into an ambulance.World War Hulk #1‚Äì5. Marvel Comics. =Becoming A-Bomb= Rick Jones as A-Bomb, from Hulk (vol. 2) #2 (April 2008). Art by Ed McGuinness. In the aftermath of \\"World War Hulk\\", a new Red Hulk emerged,Loeb, Jeph. Hulk #1 (March 2008). Marvel Comics. brutally beating and then shooting the Abomination to death. After this occurred, Jones escaped from a secret base in Alaska that had been destroyed in a \\"Hulk-like\\" manner. Following this, Red Hulk confronts Jones at Gamma Base, where Bruce Banner is being held. In defense, Jones inexplicably transforms into a creature resembling the Abomination, calling himself A-Bomb.Loeb, Jeph. Hulk (vol. 2) #2 (April 2008). Marvel Comics. During the fight, the base security measures activate, and giant android harpies (with the face of Betty Ross) attack the two, and attempt to remove them from the base. A-Bomb manages to disable one mid-flight, and they both crash to earth, the robot exploding as it does. Hulk #3 (May 2008). Marvel Comics. A-Bomb joined with several heroes including the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk and the Hulk to help stop an impending earthquake in San Francisco, which was caused by Red Hulk.Hulk #5 (August 2008). Marvel Comics. After the Red Hulk was defeated, A-Bomb reverted to Rick. He attempted to reveal who Red Hulk really was, but was shot and dragged away by Doc Samson.Hulk #6 (September 2008). Marvel Comics. In Incredible Hulk #600 it is revealed the reason Doc Samson shot Rick Jones is because he now has multiple personality syndrome. It's also revealed that MODOK was involved in Rick's new condition. After Red Hulk drained the gamma energy from Hulk, A-Bomb had enough intelligence to get Bruce Banner to safety.Incredible Hulk #600. Marvel Comics. In Incredible Hulk #604, A-Bomb was shown to be fully healed, participating along with Korg as Skaar's sparring partner to prepare him for the time when the Hulk will return. In the same issue, Rick was reunited with Marlo, who was transformed by the Leader into Harpy, whom Bruce mistakes for Betty Ross.Incredible Hulk #604. Marvel Comics. It was eventually revealed that Rick was transformed into A-Bomb by the Intelligencia under command of the Leader and MODOK. Using the Abomination's blood they changed him to become their weapon, but soon learned that he could not be controlled as easily as they planned. Instead, they gave him one simple command with a certain trigger‚Äîkill Bruce Banner. Suspecting this, Bruce was able to trigger Rick at an earlier time of his choosing and talk him down, thus preventing Rick from being triggered in the future when his plans were to be carried out. During the Chaos War storyline, A-Bomb and Korg assist the Hulks in fighting Abomination, a Zom-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.Incredible Hulk #618. Marvel Comics. It is later revealed that Rick is able to change between A-Bomb and his normal form.Incredible Hulk #635. Marvel Comics. When a new Hulk persona emerges as the result of an attempt to assassinate Bruce Banner and efforts to save his life using the Extremis virus, this new Hulk, calling himself \\"Doc Green\\", decides that gamma-powered superhumans are a threat to humanity that must be eliminated. Deriving a cure for others' gamma mutations from his own physiology, Green seeks out Rick as his first target. Though Rick resists transforming into A-Bomb to defend himself, Green is apparently successful in permanently reverting Rick to human form.Hulk (2014) #6 (September 2014). Marvel Comics. Afterward, Rick seeks out Betty (who had been revived from death by Intelligencia and transformed into the Red She-Hulk the same way Rick was transformed into A-Bomb), ostensibly in order to warn her about Doc Green's intentions.Hulk (2014) #7 (October 2014). Marvel Comics. When Green arrives and Betty assaults him as the Red She-Hulk, she finds herself reverting to normal involuntarily and realizes that Rick had dosed her with Green's cure during a meal they had shared earlier. Rick admits to anxieties over the possibility of losing control of his transformation, and an addiction to the \\"rush\\" of being A-Bomb. However, he was unwilling to aid Doc Green in curing Betty until Doc Green informed him that Betty, acting under orders from a watchdog group called The Order of the Shield, was behind the attempt on Banner's life. Rick is left behind with the equally powerless Betty as Doc Green continues on his mission.Hulk (2014) #8 (November 2014). Marvel Comics. =Working as Whisperer= As a side effect of losing his Hulk abilities, Rick briefly gains the ability to learn any task at lightning speed. He uses this ability to become a master hacktivist known as the Whisperer during the \\"Avengers: Standoff!\\" storyline and secretly aids the new Captain America. He uncovers a plot by Maria Hill called Project Kobik, which uses shattered Cosmic Cube remains to create a new cube.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1. Marvel Comics. Phil Coulson's group learns about Pleasant Hill and Rick's involvement. Deathlok, Daisy Johnson, and Jemma Simmons investigated Rick' house and discovered a hidden escape route. They follow Rick through the Morlock Tunnels and apprehend him. During an interrogation at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Battlecarrier, the New Avengers arrived to retrieve Jones from S.H.I.E.L.D.Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. #3. Marvel Comics. It turns out that the New Avengers were contacted by Rick through a pre-recorded video that was to be sent to them in the event that the alien nanobots he ingested noticed him being unconscious. The New Avengers invading the S.H.I.E.L.D. Battlecarrier to retrieve Jones prompts The Pentagon into retaliating by unleashing a monster called the American Kaiju on the New Avengers.New Avengers Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics. In the aftermath of the events that transpired at Pleasant Hill, Steve Rogers offers Rick the chance to join S.H.I.E.L.D. as part of his reparations for his hacktivism.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega #1. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, a hacker named Rashaun Lucas is entrusted with key data by Rick Jones that Jones says will prove the truth about Captain America, who at the time was reprogrammed by Red Skull's clone using the powers of Kobik into being a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America later sentences a captive Rick Jones to death by firing squad.Secret Empire #1. Marvel Comics. =Revival as Subject B= After his death, Rick Jones was buried at Severin Memorial Cemetery. The Immortal Hulk takes Doc Samson there in order to prove that he, Bruce Banner, Betty Ross, and Rick Jones are all connected to one constant theme: resurrection. They find Rick Jones' grave dug up and his body missing.Immortal Hulk #15. Marvel Comics. In the U.S. Hulk Operations' Shadow Base Site B, Rick Jones' corpse is used for gamma experiments by scientists led by Charlene McGowan and his whole body is covered in gamma energy, which resurrects him as an Abomination/A-Bomb-like creature with two faces and many finger-like structures surrounding his face called Subject B.Immortal Hulk #16-17. Marvel Comics. Using a camera placed inside Rick's head, the U.S. Hulk Operations dispatched Subject B to Reno, Nevada to draw out Hulk. After Subject B killed two bystanders, Hulk appeared to fight it thinking that it was a form of Abomination. He discovered that it was actually Rick as his two faces spoke short and tortured sentences.Immortal Hulk #18. Marvel Comics. Hulk had no other choice but to fight Rick's Subject B form. During the fight, Subject B shot acid at Hulk that dissolved part of his flesh and negated his ability to heal. Upon melting Hulk's limbs, Betty Ross' Harpy form appeared and ripped open Hulk in order to consume his heart.Immortal Hulk #19. Marvel Comics. This caused Rick Jones' Subject B to attack Betty Ross' Harpy. Hulk revives enough to regenerate his limbs and punch Subject B. Harpy then continues her attack on Subject B and rips at his stomach to prevent him from emitting acid. During the fight between Subject B and Harpy, Hulk got Jackie McGee to safety as two War-Wagons sent by Reginald Fortean arrive. When in the air, Harpy dropped Subject B onto one of the War-Wagons. After destroying the War-Wagons, Hulk ripped open Subject B's body to discover that it was a shell containing an emaciated Rick in his human form. With Rick in tow, Hulk, Harpy, and Jackie fled the area upon Hulk seeing Gamma Flight approaching.Immortal Hulk #20. Marvel Comics. Some days later, Rick was still emaciated and speaking broken words until a burst of energy awakens and restores him. Using what he had learned while being experimented on, Rick directed Hulk, Harpy, and Jackie McGee toward the U.S. Hulk Operations' base at Groom Lake in Area 51.Immortal Hulk #21. Marvel Comics. When Doc Samson and Gamma Flight confronted General Fortean at the U.S. Hulk Operations' base, Hulk, Rick, Harpy, and Jackie also show up as both sides see that General Fortean has merged with the Subject B body.Immortal Hulk #22. Marvel Comics. While Hulk and Gamma Flight fight General Fortean and the U.S. Hulk Operations' soldiers, Rick assisted Harpy and Jackie McGee where they found the gamma mutate Delbert Frye in a room with scientist and Charlene McGowan who tearfully accepted responsibility for what happened to Rick and Delbert. This caused Rick to spare her life.Immortal Hulk #23. Marvel Comics. Soon after, however, it is revealed that Rick's body is in fact a puppet controlled by The Leader.Immortal Hulk #33. Marvel Comics. During Hulk's photo op following the repairs of Georgeville, Iowa which was wrecked during Hulk's fight with the Avengers, Leader controlled Rick Jones into overflowing Hulk with gamma energy to kill him which caused an explosion.Immortal Hulk #35. Marvel Comics. Rick protected the people from the explosion, but was mutated into an elongated form with extra arms and legs in the process. Using Rick, Leader watched Hulk's fight with Gamma Flight. When Titania noticed that Rick made an unintelligent comment, Leader controlled Rick into knocking her down causing Absorbing Man to fight Hulk some more. Then Leader allows Rick to be teleported to Shadow Base just as he planned.Immortal Hulk #36. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Rick Jones is an athletic man who previously had no superhuman powers. He has received training in combat gymnastics by Captain America, making him a highly skilled martial artist. He is also a skilled self-taught folk and rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist/harmonica player. At one point Jones wielded the Destiny Force, a powerful ability utilized during the Kree-Skrull War storyline. With this power, through focus, he was able to perform amazing feats such as pull various members of the superhero team Avengers from the past, present and future, although this ability is generally random unless another controlling influence, such as Libra, is assisting him.Busiek, Kurt. Avengers Forever #1 (December 1998). Marvel Comics. Jones' latent psionic potential was once unleashed by the Kree Supreme Intelligence, but Jones is unable to utilize it at will. He was also for a time able to shift spatial/temporal positions with Mar-Vell, and later Genis-Vell. After being held captive and subjected to extreme experiments by the Intelligencia, Rick Jones has gained the ability to transform into a creature resembling the Abomination, granting him vast superhuman strength and durability (even the Red Hulk only caused superficial damage), but stunting his speech patterns in a similar manner to the classic Hulk persona. His scales can change color to blend in with his surroundings. Following experimentation on him by MODOK, Rick's human persona became dominant, but at the price of trapping him in A-Bomb form.Loeb, Jeph. Hulk vol. 2; #13 (October 2009). Marvel Comics. Bruce speculates in a later storyline that this is actually a deliberate, albeit subconscious, action on Rick's part stemming from his fear of allowing others to come to harm because he may be unable to help them, prompting him to remain A-Bomb so that he can always be ready to help.Incredible Hulks #618. Marvel Comics. Due to the Hulk's wish, Rick can now transform at will while maintaining his full intelligence and personality.Incredible Hulks #635. Marvel Comics. He would lose his powers as A-Bomb when the Hulk, under a new persona called \\"Doc Green,\\" decided to eliminate all the other Gamma powered people, and injected A-Bomb with a dose of the cure, which made Rick completely human once more.Hulk (Vol 3) #6. Marvel Comics. As a consequence of being depowered from his A-Bomb form, Rick's brain was changed. According to himself, he was now able to pick new skills up lightning-fast. With these new abilities, Rick decided to direct his new ability towards communications becoming an expert in technology and security hacking. As Subject B, Rick has super-strength, enhanced durability, claws on his fingers, and can shoot corrosive acid from either his hands or his two-faces that can melt flesh and negate healing factors. The amount of acid he shoots depends on how much he consumes. After being separated from the Subject B body, Rick Jones developed new powers like energy projection and flight.Immortal Hulk #22-23. Marvel Comics.

Marvel Comics. He was later revealed to be an alternate Rick Jones who had stayed with the Supreme Intelligence after the Kree-Skrull War. Thanatos wanted to merge various Ricks into an \\"Ultimate Rick Jones\\".

Born in Clintonville, Wisconsin, he had to combine his early schooling with working on the family farm, but earned a scholarship to Ripon College, receiving a bachelor's degree in physics in 1910 and working as a research assistant. After a few years at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1914 he joined the National Bureau of Standards, and while working there earned his PhD from Johns Hopkins University. His work in spectrochemistry is generally credited to have sparked interest in the field in the United States, leading to him being dubbed the Dean of American spectroscopists. In 1947 he received the Frederic Ives Medal. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1953. Since 1970, the Optical Society of America has awarded the William F. Meggers Award for outstanding work in spectroscopy. In 1965, Dr. Meggers and his wife, Edith R. Meggers, donated their coin and stamp collections to the American Institute of Physics, for the express purpose of establishing a biennial award program for the improvement of physics teaching at the high school level. Awards have been presented since 1994. The Meggers crater on the Moon is named in his honor. His daughter and oldest child was Betty J. Meggers, who also received her doctorate and became a noted archeologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, specializing in South American pre-Columbian archeology.

The system permits non- technically minded users to arrange content in pages and layouts, containing 'Assets' (applets) which permit website visitors to view and interact with various types of data from basic Articles to full-blown Content management system and custom applications. In July 2014, Scott Walters proposed a project on Kickstarter to bring the nascent Version 8 rewrite to a formal release with a supporting free software community. Version 8 is, according to the Kickstarter project page, \\"a massive modernization effort that reworked core to use Moose, Plack, Try::Tiny\\" along with a general code cleanup. The project achieved its crowd funding goal on July 16, 2014. Introduction WebGUI (pronounced web-GOO-E) is a system that gives web administrators the ability to manage the appearance and features available in the user interface to fit each user's skill level. Its users and groups system allows control over content editing and viewing privileges, and the versioning and workflow systems allow for content approval hierarchies and tracking of content as it moves through the site. Everything in WebGUI is a template which allows for customization, while keeping the site content and style separate. The system was originally built as an application framework by creator Plain Black Corporation to support their customer development work, but a majority of its current independent users utilize it as a CMS with the modules with which it ships. History In 1999 a development project called Web Done Right began in an effort to create a web application framework. Over the next several years, Web Done Right evolved and eventually became WebGUI. WebGUI and its parent company Plain Black Corporation were launched to the public in 2001. Features The WebGUI software can be used for: *Web-based Administrative Interface *WYSIWYG Rich Text Editor *Workflow Engine *Versioning *E-Commerce *User Management *Group Management *Search engine friendly URLs *Internationalization Architecture WebGUI is built as an application framework, and has a pluggable architecture to aid in the extensibility of applications. Developers can create custom applications and functionality that match an organization's processes. A pluggable macro architecture allows for even more extensibility and flexibility. WebGUI's modular design allows code to be easily accessed, changed, and replaced. WebGUI is a mod_perl application but there is a project codenamed PlebGUI to port WebGUI to PSGI, the Perl Web Server Gateway Interface, which enables deployment using CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, et al. Built in applications With WebGUI, users can create: * Online shops that accept credit cards. * Forums (Flat, Nested, and Threaded views) * SQL Reports (Drill down and hierarchical queries enabled) * Polls * Classifieds * Web Log (blogs) * Photo Galleries * News Listings * FAQs * Link Directories * Job Postings * User Contributions * Syndicated News (includes aggregation) * Events Calendars * Surveys * Self-Grading Tests * Articles * Search Engines * Web Services Front End * Matrix Comparison Systems * Weather Data * Stock Data * Dashboard (My Page) * In/Out Boards * Project Management * Time Tracking In addition, there are many user contributed applications available. Themes WebGUI comes with a number of built in themes, and additional themes are freely available in the add-ons section of the WebGUI website. Everything in WebGUI is a template, and templates are accessed through the admin user interface. Translation WebGUI has a translation server that allows anyone to contribute translated terms for any field label in the user interface. These translations can then be applied to a site and users can manage content in their native languages. WebGUI contains Dutch, German, English and Spanish translations. Licensing WebGUI is licensed under GNU General Public License, which means it is free to download and use. System requirements * Application Server: mod_perl * Database: MySQL * Operating System: Any * Programming Language: Perl * Root Access: Yes * Shell Access: Yes * Web Server: Apache =WebGUI runtime environment= To ease the installation of WebGUI's requirements, Plain Black distributes them inside of the WebGUI Runtime Environment (WRE). The WRE includes everything needed to run WebGUI, excepting some Perl modules that versions of WebGUI released after the WRE may require. The WRE is pre-compiled by Plain Black for their list of supported systems, and members of the community submit WRE binaries for other systems. In addition to the requirements, the WRE includes tools to administer WebGUI servers. The 0.8 version of the WRE introduced the WRE Console, which is a GUI tool (viewed with a web browser) to set up and manage WebGUI sites. Mascot Gooey, the mascot of WebGUI Gooey, the purple octopus is the mascot of WebGUI. It was created by Darci Gibson.

It is not uncommon for a push to be accompanied by a turn or a change in the wrestler's gimmick. This is essentially the opposite of a burial, which in contrast to the high profile of a push is typically done with little or no fanfare. Sometimes the fans generate the push for a wrestler themselves when their approval for the wrestler's work generates a positive reaction from them that is not anticipated. History In the Memphis territory, Nick Gulas began to push his son George to a main event spot despite having little in-ring experience and no athletic background. The fans quickly turned on him and the promotion, but Nick Gulas continued to push him despite the negative backlash and financial losses. In the end, Nick's insistence on keeping his son at the top of the card led to a hostile split of the territory.Kentucky Fried Rasslin' A push can also be attributed to a political shift in the promotion's offices. Cowboy Bill Watts, whose promotions always consisted of an African-American main event heroic character, began pushing Ron Simmons, a midcarder, to main event status and eventually to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship upon being put in charge of World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WWE, following the fallout from the Signature Pharmacy Scandal, smaller and less muscular wrestlers such as CM Punk and Jeff Hardy began to get pushed and Vince McMahon confirmed the paradigm shift by mentioning that today's fans are drawn by charisma and not size. In WWE, when the company was being built around fan favorite John Cena, shedding his edgy, freestyle rapping anti-establishment persona which was popular in favor of a more motivational \\"against all odds\\" one, was met with a negative reaction by the fans to the point where he became one of the most booed wrestlers in the promotion.

Antitrust law required General Mills to sell off some of the products, so the company kept the rights to refrigerated and frozen Pillsbury branded products, while dry baking products and frosting were sold by its Orrville, Ohio‚Äìbased Smucker company under license. Brynwood Partners agreed to purchase Pillsbury from Smuckers for 375 million in July 2018. In September 2018 the sale was completed along with other brands including Martha White and Hungry Jack. Advertising company Leo Burnett Worldwide created Pillsbury's Doughboy and Jolly Green Giant, which are two of the agency's top brand icons. and  History  = Founding and early development = Postcard featuring Pillsbury with the caption, \\"the Largest Flour Mill in the World, Minneapolis, Minnesota \\"C.A. Pillsbury and Company\\" was founded in 1872 by Charles Alfred Pillsbury and his uncle John S. Pillsbury. The company was second in the United States (after Washburn-Crosby) to use steel rollers for processing grain. The finished product required transportation, so the Pillsburys assisted in funding railroad development in Minnesota. In 1889, Pillsbury and its five mills on the banks of the Mississippi River were purchased by a British company. The company also tried to purchase and merge with the Washburn Crosby Company (a precursor of General Mills), but the principals at Washburn prevented the takeover. In 1923, the Pillsbury family reacquired \\"Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company, Limited\\" which subsequently was incorporated in 1935 as \\"Pillsbury Flour Mills Company\\". =1950s = A Pillsbury ghost sign in New Kensington, Pennsylvania In 1949, the company introduced a national baking competition, which came to be known as the Pillsbury Bake-Off; it was nationally broadcast on CBS for many years. Only seven products used the Pillsbury name in 1950, but the company began adding to its product line. The early 1950s brought the acquisition of Ballard & Ballard Company and the beginning of packaged biscuit dough, which would become one of the company's most important and profitable product lines in later decades. The company began advertising heavily on television. In 1957, Pillsbury commissioned a TV commercial jingle (from its advertising agency Leo Burnett) with the main lyrics \\"Nothin' says lovin/Like somethin' from the oven/And Pillsbury says it best\\". The jingle became a well- known signature of the company and was used, with modifications, for at least 20 years. Later corporate acquisitions included restaurants such as Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan's, Godfather's Pizza, H√§agen-Dazs, and Quik Wok, plus popular grocery store food brands such as Green Giant. =1960s = In the 1960s, Pillsbury added Sweet* 10 made with cyclamate, which became the most popular artificial sweetener. In 1964, Pillsbury introduced Funny Face Drink Mix with the names Goofy Grape, Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry, Freckle Face Strawberry, Loud Mouth Lime, Chinese Cherry (later Choo-Choo Cherry), and Injun Orange (later Jolly Olly Orange). Lefty Lemon followed in 1965, along with other flavors. The Funny Face characters, as well as the Funny Face brand were created in 1963 by Hal Silverman, a Creative Director at Campbell Mithun Advertising. When cyclamate was banned, Sweet* 10 and Funny Face were eliminated, resulting in a $4.5 million loss. Both products were re-introduced after changes, and the drinks became available sweetened and unsweetened. Another drink mix introduced in the 1960s was moo Juice, a flavored powder combined with milk in a shaker to produce a milkshake. Moo Juice was also created by Hal Silverman. Its TV commercial featured a talking animation of the product's cartoon cow head mascot voiced by Frank Fontaine. Moo Juice was short-lived, as its milkshakes tended to be thin compared to similar products such as Borden's Frosted and Birds Eye's Thick and Frosty. Among the other kid foods that Silverman created for Pillsbury was Nugget Town, chocolate flavored nuggets that came in eight different, collectable packages that when popped open and folded made into a whole western town. The TV commercial featured Buddy Hackett as the voice of the town's little bear sheriff. Also, there was Gorilla Milk‚Äî\\"...you'll go ape for Gorilla Milk, a glass in the morning and you'll swing all day\\"‚Äîa protein additive that turned milk into an instant breakfast. This product, aimed at teenagers, was not successful going against Carnation Instant Breakfast. That decade, Pillsbury also created Space Food Sticks to capitalize on the popularity of the space program. Space Food Sticks were developed by Robert Muller, the inventor of the HACCP standards used by the food industry to ensure food safety. When NASA astronaut Scott Carpenter launched into space on Mercury capsule Aurora 7 in 1962, he was carrying with him the first solid space food small food cubes developed by Pillsbury's research and development department. Taking Pillsbury scientists more than a year to develop, space food cubes were followed by other space-friendly foods, such as cake that was not crumbly, relish that could be served in slices and meat that needed no refrigeration. Pillsbury acquired the Burger King fast food chain in 1967. =1980s and after = The Pillsbury Company bought H√§agen-Dazs in 1983. In 1999, Pillsbury and Nestl√© merged their U.S. and Canadian ice cream operations into a joint venture called Ice Cream Partners. General Mills subsequently bought Pillsbury in 2001 and succeeded to its interest in the joint venture.[17][18] In 2001 Nestl√© exercised its contractual right to buy General Mills' interest in Ice Cream Partners, which included the right to a 99-year license for the H√§agen-Dazs brand.[19][20] Pursuant to that license, the Dreyer's subsidiary of Nestl√© has produced and marketed H√§agen-Dazs products in the United States and Canada. Then in 1985, Pillsbury acquired Diversifoods, the largest Burger King franchisee in the U.S. and parent company of Godfather's Pizza. In 1988, Pillsbury sold the Godfather's Pizza chain to a management-led group as part of the company's restructuring moves. In 1989, the British company Grand Metropolitan (later Diageo) purchased the food maker, and during this ownership period the company divested itself of all production and distribution facilities (contracting these functions to other companies), making itself simply a marketing entity for its own brands (Pillsbury, Green Giant, Old El Paso, Totino's, etc.) In 2001, Diageo sold Pillsbury to its old rival, General Mills. The baking products division was sold to International Multifoods Corporation, which was later acquired by Smucker's. Pillsbury sold all of their restaurant brands and exited the business completely by the late 1990s.  Notable achievements  Pillsbury on the Mississippi River in 1905 The Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill and neighboring Phoenix Mill in the early 1900s The Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill in 2006 Pillsbury once claimed to have the largest grain mill in the world at the Pillsbury A-Mill overlooking Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. The building had two of the most powerful direct-drive waterwheels ever built, each putting out 1200 horsepower (900 kW). The Pillsbury A-Mill was converted to artist lofts by the Dominium company in 2016. In 1960, Robert Keith, then Vice President of Pillsbury, published an article entitled the \\"Marketing Revolution\\" in the leading marketing journal, Journal of Marketing.Holloway, R.J., \\"Leaders in Marketing: Robert Keith,\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 32, July 1968, pp 74-75 The article, which was based on Keith's personal recollections, set out the way that the Pillsbury Company had evolved. He pointed out that the company had shifted from a focus on production in the 1860s to sales focus in the 1930s through to a consumer focus in the 1950s. The characteristics of these three distinct eras in Pillsbury's evolution include:Keith, R. J., \\"The Marketing Revolution,\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 24, No. 1; Jul 1959-Apr 1960, pp 35-38 the production oriented era from 1869 -1930s - characterized by a 'focus on production processes'; the sales oriented era from the 1930s to the 1950s - characterized by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits and the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the 1950s - characterized by a focus on the customer's latent and existing needs. In addition, Keith hypothesized that a marketing control era was about to emerge. Although Keith's article explicitly documented Pillsbury's evolution, the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at Pillsbury constitute a normal evolutionary path (production‚Üísales‚Üímarketing) for most large organizations.

It is very popular in northern China and is one of the most representative form of folk arts. It is popular in both the countryside and cities in northern China. It is especially popular among older people. Crowds of people will go out into the street in the evening and dance together in a line or a circle formation. Some dancers dress up in red, green, or other colorful costumes, and typically use a red silk ribbon around the waist. They will swing their bodies to music played by drum, trumpet, and gong. More people will join in as they see Yang Ge going on and dance along. Some dancers use props like the waistdrum, dancing fan, fake donkey, or litter. In different areas Yangge is performed in different styles, but all types express happiness. In the 1940s, the Chinese Communist Party launched the new yangge movement where the dance was adopted as a means of rallying village support. The dance was simplified into a pattern of three- quick-steps forward, one-step-backward, pause and repeat. This version of the dance incorporated socialist elements, for example the leader of the dance group would hold a sickle instead of umbrella, and it is also known as \\"struggle yangge\\" or \\"reform yangge\\".  Struggle (Reform) Yangge and the Chinese Communist Party  The new struggle yangge had roots in the traditional folk rite yangge that was performed in the rural parts of Northern China prior to the Japanese invasion of 1937 \\"Asian Dance Traditions.\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation, E-reference ed., e-book,New York, Oxford UP, 2009.. The folk rite was performative and was often associated with New Year‚Äôs celebrations, incorporating spirited dance, garish costumes, and loud music. The dance troupe was led by a leader dancer known as santou (umbrella head) and consisted of dancers, ranging from a few dozen to more than one hundred dancers. Simple plays were enacted during the dance, mostly about everyday life in rural China Hung, Chang-tai. Mao's New World: Political Culture in the Early People's Republic. E-book, Ithaca, Cornell UP, 2011.. The songs that accompanied the folk rite were conversations between young men and women about love or congratulatory greetings, and the swinging movements of the dances were generally sexually suggestive \\"Asian Dance Traditions.\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation, E-reference ed., e-book,New York, Oxford UP, 2009.. The struggle yangge that was popularized by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in urban settings from 1949 to 1951 was a political instrument used to communicate the socialist ideals of the CCP to the people. In fact, the dance limited artistic freedom and improvisation with specific guidelines that the dance must adhere to including: prohibition of male performers to dress as women; elimination of any flirtatious or erotic moves; forbiddened the portrayal of ghosts, deities, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests (elements that were common in rural yangge); no vulgarity or negative portrayals of the working class in the dances, and dancers were not permitted to wear excessive makeup. The power of the struggle yangge came from the dance‚Äôs simplicity and visibility, aimed at reaching a larger and wider audience. Unlike rural yangge with its complex and vast dance patterns, struggle yangge utilized simpler dance moves such as Double Cabbage Heart (spiraling move) and Dragon Waves Its Tail (snakelike movement) to, as one yangge dancer puts it, ‚Äúto express an exuberant mood and to invite as many people as possible to share in the joy‚Äù \\"Asian Dance Traditions.\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation, E-reference ed., e-book,New York, Oxford UP, 2009.. Struggle yangge‚Äôs purpose was to tell a story about the success of the CCP developments, of how the Communists came to power, about the valor and strength of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, the undying support of the Chinese people, the righteous leadership of the CCP, and the bright socialist future of China. The story was told in three musical performances, consisting of song and dance, with the production of these performances in chronological order to achieve maximum impact. The first was The Great Yangge of the Celebration of Liberation (Â∫ÜÁ•ùËß£ÊîæÂ§ßÁßßÊ≠å), which told the war of liberation from the Nationalists. The second piece was The Great Musical of Long Live the People‚Äôs Victory (‰∫∫Ê∞ëËÉúÂà©‰∏áÂ≤ÅÂ§ßÊ≠åËàû), which illustrated the remembrance of the people‚Äôs victory in the revolution. The last musical was The Great Yangge of Building the Motherland (Âª∫ËÆæÁ•ñÂõΩÂ§ßÁßßÊ≠å), which depicts the construction of a new socialist country under the leadership of the CCP \\"Asian Dance Traditions.\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation, E-reference ed., e-book,New York, Oxford UP, 2009.. The production of each performance was elaborate and complex, with shows lasting four to five hours \\"Asian Dance Traditions.\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and Dance Perspectives Foundation, E-reference ed., e-book,New York, Oxford UP, 2009.. Types There are two major types of yangge, one is Stilt Yangge which is performed on stilts, the other is Ground Yangge which is more common and is performed without stilts. Another version of the yangge is the village play, an anthology of which was published by Sidney D. Gamble in 1970, based on transcriptions made by Li Jinghan as part of the Ding Xian Experiment's surveys in the 1930s. The Yangge drama or Yangge opera () usually consists of a quatrain of seven stanzas or long and short sentences.China monthly review - Volumes 120 √† 121. An example is the founding piece of the China National Opera when it was founded in Yan'an in 1942, which was with a performance of a Yangge drama Brothers and Sisters Opening up the Wasteland (). The Yangko owed something to normal huaju spoken drama, but with dance, and songs added.Contemporary Chinese theatre - Page 8 Roger Howard - 1978 \\"1 The yangko dramas Brothers and Sisters Open up Wasteland and The White-haired Girl were produced by the Lu Hsun Academy in Yenan. These musical plays owed something to the modern drama (huachu) ‚Äî in particular in their more .\\" Regional variations =North Shaanxi= The dance may be in large groups of a dozen to a hundred people, or in two or three-person groups. The dancers move from location to location, visiting different parts of the town. The leader of the procession of dancers is called the santou or \\"Umbrella\\" who wields an umbrella to lead the movement of the group. He also sings, usually improvised, while the others will repeat his last line. Various characters may appear in the procession, such as the two comic characters Big-Headed Monk and Liu Cui (), and the Eight Immortals. The procession first follows the santou in a single file to form a large simple circle, and later then forms other more intricate patterns. =Shandong= The Shandong yangge is thought to be the purest forms of yangge. There are three major types of yangge in the Shandong province, the Haiyang yangge, Jiaozhou yangge, and the guzi ( \\"drum\\") yangge. In guzi yangge each dancer takes one of five roles - \\"Umbrella\\", \\"Drum\\", \\"Stick\\", \\"Flower\\", \\"Clown\\" - the first three are named after the props the dancer holds, while the fourth refers to a female dancer. =Liaoning= In Liaoning and Beijing, a popular form is the stilt yangge where the dancers perform on stilts. There are many types of stilt yangge, for example \\"Jietang\\" is a group dance performed in the street; \\"Jiaxiang\\" involves the formation of a pyramid of different poses; \\"Dachang\\" is group dance done in a large open air space; and \\"Xiaochang\\" characterized by its love-story plot. =Northeast China= The performers of Manchurian Yangge in Northeast China usually wear traditional Manchu clothes of the area. The movement is free and brisk, imitating the valor of a tribe excelling in horsemanship and marksmanship.

Trent Bridge is also the headquarters of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. As well as international cricket and Nottinghamshire's home games, the ground has hosted the Finals Day of the Twenty20 Cup twice and will host the final of the One- Day Cup between 2020 and 2024. In 2009, the ground was used for the ICC World Twenty20 and hosted the semi-final between South Africa and Pakistan. The site takes its name from the nearby main bridge over the Trent, and is also close to Meadow Lane and the City Ground, the football stadia of Notts County and Nottingham Forest respectively. History Trent Bridge circa 1890 Trent Bridge was first used as a cricket ground in the 1830s. The first recorded cricket match was held on an area of ground behind the Trent Bridge Inn in 1838. Trent Bridge hosted its first Test match in 1899, with England playing against Australia. The ground was first opened in 1841 by William Clarke, husband of the proprietress of the Trent Bridge Inn and himself Captain of the All England Cricket Team. He was commemorated in 1990 by the opening of the new William Clarke Stand which incorporates the Rushcliffe Suite. The West Park Sports Ground in West Bridgford was the private ground of Sir Julien Cahn, a furniture millionaire, who often played host to touring national sides. In 1950, an electronically-operated scoreboard was installed at this venue, then the world's largest at any cricket stadium.

It usually involves two performers, one male and one female. They sing and dance, using folded fans or square-shaped red handkerchiefs, which are twirled along as the songs are performed, during the dancing portion. It is very popular due to its humorous dialogue and sketches, which have eclipsed the old dances and songs. In earlier times, the Errenzhuan has been both criticized and loved due to its ‚Äúvulgarity,‚Äù which involves profanities and sex. This also led to the reforming works of Zhao Benshan, who made the genre more appealing to the modern crowd by making it \\"greener.\\" Errenzhuan is now becoming better known in the rest of China, because many Errenzhuan performers appear on television and act in TV serials.

It is part of the Endumeni Municipality, Umzinyathi District. It is very rich in coal deposits. More populous than the town of Dundee itself is its adjacent township named Sibongile. This township is now being extended with many residing zones, e.g. Lindelani. Dundee was originally established by Peter Smith, with land contributed by his son in-law. Dundee was established in 1882 after the realisation that the valley was a natural way for travellers into the interior of Africa. Traders, hunters explorers, missionaries and soldiers all made their way through here. A large fort, Fort Jones, housed British troops in the area during the Anglo Zulu War of 1879. The discovery of coal in the area dates from early Voortrekker records of 1838 and later geological surveys in the 1860s. It is named after the hometown of a pioneering Scottish settler, Peter Smith. At first, Dundee was a farm (Dundee farm), the property of Peter Smith, which he had bought from a Voortrekker settler, Mr Dekker. Three other men are also credited with the founding of Dundee; his son William Craighead Smith, son-in-law Dugald McPhail, and close family friend Charles Wilson. Geography The town lies nestled in a valley of the picturesque Biggarsberg and is surrounded by historical remarkable mountains of ‚ÄúIndumeni‚Äù (where the thunder rolls), ‚ÄúMpati‚Äù (The place of good waters), and ‚ÄúTalana‚Äù (The shelf where precious items are kept). Dundee has trails of the San people that lived here about 4 000 ‚Äì 5 000 years ago. Evidence of this is to be found in lifestyle and rock paintings in several caves and shelters. =Climate= Dundee has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with pleasant summers and cool, dry winters. The average annual precipitation is , with rainfall occurring mainly during summer. History * The Boers reported surface coal here and named one of the streams Steenkoolspruit (Afrikaans for Coal Stream). * Peter Smith, a Scottish settler started sending wagonloads of coal, which was discovered close to the surface, to be sold in Pietermaritzburg. This started the coal mining industry in Natal. * The first geological survey of the Natal coalfields was made in the 1860s and proved that there were workable coal deposits. * In 1882 a town was laid out and named after Smith‚Äôs Scottish hometown Dundee. * Smith, with partners Dougald McPhail and Charles Wilson, floated the Dundee Coal and Estate Company on the London Stock Exchange in 1899. *Second Boer War: The British started massing troops at Dundee and were given an ultimatum by the Boers to retreat with the troops. On 20 October 1899, the first shots of the war were fired. The news of this battle hit the headlines in Britain as the \\"Battle of Glencoe\\", which was corrected the following day to the \\"Battle of Dundee\\" and on the third day to the \\"Battle of Talana.\\" It was on the slopes of Talana Hill that the British army troops officially wore khaki uniforms for the first time in battle; it is also notable as the first indisputable use of indirect fire in modern warfare, and the tactic as applied by Boer field artillery had a devastating effect. After the battle, the British troops retreated to Ladysmith and Boer forces occupied the town, renaming it Meyersdorp. This occupation lasted seven months. Dundee was relieved after the battle of Helpmekaar in May 1900. Boers watch the fighting at Dundee in 1899 * The town's folk who had left before or shortly after the battle returned and the town began to flourish again.

It is primarily used with high-speed network interfaces, such as gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, where processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant. The term, TOE, is often used to refer to the NIC itself, although circuit board engineers may use it to refer only to the integrated circuit included on the card which processes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) headers. TOEs are often suggested as a way to reduce the overhead associated with Internet Protocol (IP) storage protocols such as iSCSI and Network File System (NFS). Purpose Originally TCP was designed for unreliable low speed networks (such as early dial-up modems) but with the growth of the Internet in terms of backbone transmission speeds (using Optical Carrier, Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet links) and faster and more reliable access mechanisms (such as DSL and cable modems) it is frequently used in data centers and desktop PC environments at speeds of over 1 Gigabit per second. The TCP software implementations on host systems require extensive computing power. In the early 2000s, full duplex gigabit TCP communication could consume more than 80% of a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 processor (see freed-up CPU cycles), resulting in small or no processing resources left for the applications to run on the system. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol which adds complexity and processing overhead. These aspects include: * Connection establishment using the \\"3-way handshake\\" (SYNchronize; SYNchronize- ACKnowledge; ACKnowledge). * Acknowledgment of packets as they are received by the far end, adding to the message flow between the endpoints and thus the protocol load. * Checksum and sequence number calculations - again a burden on a general purpose CPU to perform. * Sliding window calculations for packet acknowledgement and congestion control. * Connection termination. Moving some or all of these functions to dedicated hardware, a TCP offload engine, frees the system's main CPU for other tasks. As of 2012, very few consumer network interface cards support TOE. Instead of replacing the TCP stack with a TOE entirely, there are alternative techniques to offload some operations in co- operation with the operating system's TCP stack. TCP checksum offload and large segment offload are supported by the majority of today's Ethernet NICs. Newer techniques like large receive offload and TCP acknowledgment offload are already implemented in some high-end Ethernet hardware, but are effective even when implemented purely in software. =Freed-up CPU cycles= A generally accepted rule of thumb is that 1 Hertz of CPU processing is required to send or receive 1 bit/s of TCP/IP. For example, 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s) of network traffic requires 5 GHz of CPU processing. This implies that 2 entire cores of a 2.5 GHz multi-core processor will be required to handle the TCP/IP processing associated with 5 Gbit/s of TCP/IP traffic. Since Ethernet (10GE in this example) is bidirectional it is possible to send and receive 10 Gbit/s (for an aggregate throughput of 20 Gbit/s). Using the 1 Hz/(bit/s) rule this equates to eight 2.5 GHz cores. Many of the CPU cycles used for TCP/IP processing are \\"freed-up\\" by TCP/IP offload and may be used by the CPU (usually a server CPU) to perform other tasks such as file system processing (in a file server) or indexing (in a backup media server). In other words, a server with TCP/IP offload can do more server work than a server without TCP/IP offload NICs. =Reduction of PCI traffic= In addition to the protocol overhead that TOE can address, it can also address some architectural issues that affect a large percentage of host based (server and PC) endpoints. Many older end point hosts are PCI bus based, which provides a standard interface for the addition of certain peripherals such as Network Interfaces to Servers and PCs. PCI is inefficient for transferring small bursts of data from main memory, across the PCI bus to the network interface ICs, but its efficiency improves as the data burst size increases. Within the TCP protocol, a large number of small packets are created (e.g. acknowledgements) and as these are typically generated on the host CPU and transmitted across the PCI bus and out the network physical interface, this impacts the host computer IO throughput. A TOE solution, located on the network interface, is located on the other side of the PCI bus from the CPU host so it can address this I/O efficiency issue, as the data to be sent across the TCP connection can be sent to the TOE from the CPU across the PCI bus using large data burst sizes with none of the smaller TCP packets having to traverse the PCI bus. History One of the first patents in this technology, for UDP offload, was issued to Auspex Systems in early 1990. United States Patent: 5355453 \\"Parallel I/O network file server architecture category\\" Auspex founder Larry Boucher and a number of Auspex engineers went on to found Alacritech in 1997 with the idea of extending the concept of network stack offload to TCP and implementing it in custom silicon. They introduced the first parallel-stack full offload network card in early 1999; the company's SLIC (Session Layer Interface Card) was the predecessor to its current TOE offerings. Alacritech holds a number of patents in the area of TCP/IP offload. United States Patent: 6247060 \\"Passing a Communication Block from Host to a Local Device such that a message is processed on the Device\\" By 2002, as the emergence of TCP-based storage such as iSCSI spurred interest, it was said that \\"At least a dozen newcomers, most founded toward the end of the dot-com bubble, are chasing the opportunity for merchant semiconductor accelerators for storage protocols and applications, vying with half a dozen entrenched vendors and in-house ASIC designs.\\"\\"Newcomers spin storage network silicon \\", Rick Merritt, 10/21/2002, EE Times In 2005 Microsoft licensed Alacritech's patent base and along with Alacritech created the partial TCP offload architecture that has become known as TCP chimney offload. TCP chimney offload centers on the Alacritech \\"Communication Block Passing Patent\\". At the same time, Broadcom also obtained a license to build TCP chimney offload chips. Types of TCP/IP offload =Parallel-stack full offload= Parallel-stack full offload gets its name from the concept of two parallel TCP/IP Stacks. The first is the main host stack which is included with the host OS. The second or \\"parallel stack\\" is connected between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer (TCP) using a \\"vampire tap\\". The vampire tap intercepts TCP connection requests by applications and is responsible for TCP connection management as well as TCP data transfer. Many of the criticisms in the following section relate to this type of TCP offload. =HBA full offload= HBA (Host Bus Adapter) full offload is found in iSCSI host adapters which present themselves as disk controllers to the host system while connecting (via TCP/IP) to an iSCSI storage device. This type of TCP offload not only offloads TCP/IP processing but it also offloads the iSCSI initiator function. Because the HBA appears to the host as a disk controller, it can only be used with iSCSI devices and is not appropriate for general TCP/IP offload. =TCP chimney partial offload= TCP chimney offload addresses the major security criticism of parallel-stack full offload. In partial offload, the main system stack controls all connections to the host. After a connection has been established between the local host (usually a server) and a foreign host (usually a client) the connection and its state are passed to the TCP offload engine. The heavy lifting of data transmit and receive is handled by the offload device. Almost all TCP offload engines use some type of TCP/IP hardware implementation to perform the data transfer without host CPU intervention. When the connection is closed, the connection state is returned from the offload engine to the main system stack. Maintaining control of TCP connections allows the main system stack to implement and control connection security. Support in Linux Unlike other kernels, the Linux kernel does not include support for TOE hardware.\\"Linux and TCP offload engines\\", August 22, 2005, LWN.net Not to be confused with other similarly named offloads, like TCP Segmentation Offload which is extensively supported\\"Linux and TCP offload engines discussion\\". While there are patches from the hardware manufacturers such as Chelsio or Qlogic that add support, the Linux kernel developers are opposed to this technology for several reasons, including. * Security ‚Äì because TOE is implemented in hardware, patches must be applied to the TOE firmware, instead of just software, to address any security vulnerabilities found in a particular TOE implementation. This is further compounded by the newness and vendor-specificity of this hardware, as compared to a well tested TCP/IP stack as is found in an operating system that does not use TOE. * Limitations of hardware ‚Äì because connections are buffered and processed on the TOE chip, resource starvation can more easily occur as compared to the generous CPU and memory available to the operating system. * Complexity ‚Äì TOE breaks the assumption that kernels make about having access to all resources at all times ‚Äì details such as memory used by open connections are not available with TOE. TOE also requires very large changes to a networking stack in order to be supported properly, and even when that is done, features like Quality of Service and packet filtering typically do not work. * Proprietary ‚Äì TOE is implemented differently by each hardware vendor. This means more code must be rewritten to deal with the various TOE implementations, at a cost of the aforementioned complexity and, possibly, security. Furthermore, TOE firmware cannot be easily modified since it is closed-source. * Obsolescence ‚Äì Each TOE NIC has a limited lifetime of usefulness, because system hardware rapidly catches up to TOE performance levels, and eventually exceeds TOE performance levels. Suppliers Much of the current work on TOE technology is by manufacturers of 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface cards, such as Broadcom, Chelsio Communications, Emulex, Mellanox Technologies, QLogic.

Yellowfin is often marketed as ahi, from the Hawaiian ahi, a name also used there for the closely related bigeye tuna. The species name, albacares (\\"white meat\\") can also lead to confusion: in English, the albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) is a different species, while yellowfin is officially designated albacore in French and referred to as albacora by Portuguese fishermen. Malayalam (language)-kera,manjha choora Description The yellowfin tuna is among the larger tuna species, reaching weights over , but is significantly smaller than the Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas, which can reach over , and slightly smaller than the bigeye tuna and the southern bluefin tuna. The second dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of sickles or scimitars. The pectoral fins are also longer than the related bluefin tuna, but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is a very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines. Reported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as in length and in weight. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species stands at for a fish caught in 1977 near San Benedicto Island in the Pacific waters of Mexico. In 2010, a 184-kg yellowfin was caught off the tip of Mexico's Baja Peninsula, long with a girth of . The catch is still pending verification by the IGFA. In 2012, a fisherman in Baja California caught a 193-kg yellowfin. If the catch is confirmed by the IGFA, the fisherman will receive a prize of $1 million.\\"Record Tuna Catch Could Fetch $1 Million\\" KTLA, 9 October 2012 Habitat Yellowfin tuna are epipelagic fish that inhabit the mixed surface layer of the ocean above the thermocline. Sonic tracking has found that although yellowfin tuna, unlike the related bigeye tuna, mostly range in the top of the water column and penetrate the thermocline relatively infrequently, they are capable of diving to considerable depths. An individual tagged in the Indian Ocean with an archival tag spent 85% of its time in depths shallower than , but was recorded as having made three dives to 578, 982, and . Yellowfin tuna jumping Schooling yellowfin tunaalt=Photo of a few dozen fish swimming in dark water Behavior Although mainly found in deep offshore waters, yellowfin tuna may approach shore when suitable conditions exist. Mid-ocean islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago, other island groups in the Western Pacific, Caribbean, and Maldives islands Indian Ocean, as well as the volcanic islands of the Atlantic such as Ascension Island and Saint Helena, often harbor yellowfin feeding on the baitfish these spots concentrate close to the shoreline. Yellowfin may venture well inshore of the continental shelf when water temperature and clarity are suitable and food is abundant. Yellowfin tuna often travel in schools with similarly sized companions. They sometimes school with other tuna species and mixed schools of small yellowfin, and skipjack tuna, in particular, are commonplace. They are often associated with various species of dolphins or porpoises, as well as with larger marine creatures such as whales and whale sharks. They also associate with drifting flotsam such as logs and pallets, and sonic tagging indicates some follow moving vessels. Hawaiian yellowfins associate with anchored fish aggregation devices and with certain sections of the 50-fathom curve. Diet and predation Yellowfin tuna at an aquarium in Japan Yellowfin tuna prey include other fish, pelagic crustaceans, and squid. Like all tunas, their body shape is particularly adapted for speed, enabling them to pursue and capture fast-moving baitfish such as flying fish, sauries, and mackerel. Schooling species such as myctophids or lanternfish and similar pelagic driftfish, anchovies, and sardines are frequently taken. Large yellowfins prey on smaller members of the tuna family such as frigate mackerel and skipjack tuna. In turn, yellowfin are preyed upon when young by other pelagic hunters, including larger tuna, seabirds, and predatory fishes such as wahoo, shark, and billfish. Adults are threatened only by the largest and fastest hunters, such as toothed whales, particularly the false killer whale, pelagic sharks such as the mako and great white, large Atlantic blue marlin and Pacific blue marlin, and black marlin. The main source of mortality, however, is industrial tuna fisheries. Yellowfins are able to escape most predators, because unlike most fish, tuna are warm-blooded, and their warm muscles make them extremely strong swimmers, with yellowfin tuna reaching \\"speeds of up to 50 miles per hour\\". (They can navigate enormous distances, sometimes crossing entire oceans.) Commercial fishery Palabuhanratu, West Java Modern commercial fisheries catch yellowfin tuna with encircling nets (purse seines), and by industrial longlines. In 2010, 558,761 metric tons of yellowfin tuna were caught in the western and central Pacific Ocean. =Pole and line= Formerly, much of the commercial catch was made by pole-and-line fishing, using live bait such as anchovy to attract schools of tuna close to the fishing vessel that were then taken with baited jigs on sturdy bamboo or fiberglass poles or on handlines. This fishery, which targeted skipjack and occasionally albacore, as well as yellowfin, for canning, reached its heyday between World War I and the 1950s before declining. The most well-known fleet of pole-and-line boats sailed from San Diego in California and exploited abundant stocks in Mexican waters, as well as further south to Panama, Costa Rica, and the Galapagos Islands. Pole- and-line fishing is still carried out today in the Maldives, Ghana, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. Few pole-and-line boats now specifically target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch is a mix of skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often associate with them. =Purse seining= Juvenile yellowfin caught with purse seine near the Philippines A yellowfin being weighed at the General Santos Fish Port Complex in General Santos City, the center of the tuna industry in the Philippines which is the world's 4th largest producer of canned and fresh-chilled tuna products Purse seining largely took over commercial tuna fisheries in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, purse seines account for more of the commercial catch than any other method. The purse-seine fishery primarily operates in the Pacific Ocean, in the historic tuna grounds of the San Diego tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific, and in the islands of the western Pacific, where many U.S. tuna canneries relocated in the 1980s, but significant purse-seine catches are also made in the Indian Ocean and in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially in the Gulf of Guinea by French and Spanish vessels. Purse-seine vessels locate tuna using onboard lookouts, as was done in the pole-and-line fishery, but they also employ sophisticated onboard electronics, sea-surface temperature and other satellite data, and helicopters overhead. Once a school is located, the net is set around it. A single set may yield . Modern tuna seiners have a capacity up to , reach speeds of over , and carry multiple spotting helicopters. Purse seining for yellowfin tuna became highly controversial in the late 1970s when it became apparent that the eastern Pacific fishery was killing many spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, and other cetaceans (often called \\"porpoises\\" by the tuna fleet) that accompany the fish. This association has been long- recognized by commercial tuna fishermen. Dolphin-friendly labeling Since the introduction of \\"dolphin-friendly\\" labeling, an increasing number of purse seine sets are now made on \\"free schools\\" unassociated with dolphins, as well as schools that associate with floating objects‚Äîanother long-understood association that has grown in importance in tuna fisheries. The latter practice in particular has a major ecological impact because of the high proportion of bycatch, including manta rays, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, billfish, and other threatened marine species taken by setting nets around logs and other floating objects. Such tuna are often significantly smaller than the larger adult tuna associated with dolphins. The removal of huge numbers of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have yet to reach breeding age has major potential consequences for tuna stocks worldwide. =Longline= Most of the commercial catch is canned, but the sashimi marketplace adds significant demand for high-quality fish. This market is primarily supplied by industrial tuna longline vessels. Industrial longlining was primarily perfected by Japanese fishermen who expanded into new grounds in the Western Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Longlining has since been adopted by other fishermen, most notably South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. Tuna longlining targets larger sashimi- grade fish around and up that swim deeper in the water column. In tropical and warm temperate areas, the more valuable bigeyes are often the main target, but significant effort is also directed towards larger yellowfins. Longlining seeks areas of higher ocean productivity indicated by temperature and chlorophyll fronts formed by upwellings, ocean current eddies, and major bathymetric features. Satellite imaging technology is the primary tool for locating these dynamic and constantly changing ocean areas. Bycatch is a major environmental issue in the longline fishery, especially impacting billfish, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, and seabirds. =Artisanal fisheries= Besides the large-scale industrial purse seine and longline fisheries, yellowfin tuna also support smaller-scale artisanal fisheries that have often supplied local domestic markets for generations. Artisanal fisheries now also often fish for the lucrative sashimi market in many locations where international air shipment is possible. Artisanal fishermen tend to employ assorted hook-and- line gear such as trolling lines, surface and deep handlines, and longlines. By far, the largest fishery using artisanal methods exists in Philippine and Indonesian waters where thousands of fishermen target yellowfin tuna around fish aggregation devices or payaos, although this fishery far exceeds the artisanal scale in terms of tonnage caught and the numbers of participants involved, and should more properly be considered a commercial handline fishery. General Santos City is the most important Philippine port for the landing and transhipment of catches. Catches that qualify as sashimi-grade are mostly shipped to the Japanese market; those that do not meet the grade are sold locally or canned. Elsewhere in the Pacific, small-boat fishers in Hawaii, Tahiti, and other Pacific islands supply local and in some cases foreign markets with fresh yellowfins. Handline-caught yellowfin tuna is one of the few exports of the economy of St. Helena. Sport fishing alt=Photo of 6 men, four of whom are holding up tuna Yellowfin tuna probably first came to the attention of sports fishermen when they appeared on the tuna grounds of Catalina Island, California, only a few years after pioneering fishermen invented the sport, targeting the Pacific bluefin tuna. These tuna were of the same species caught by commercial fishermen in Japan and the western Pacific, but the reason for their appearance was not known at the time. Later, warmer water species such as yellowfin tuna, dorado and striped marlin were found to enter southern California waters in seasons having favorable ocean conditions, particularly during the El Ni√±o phenomenon, which brings warmer water up North America's western coast. Yellowfin tuna were subsequently discovered by sport fishermen in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hawai'i, and many other parts of their range. Larger adult fish which had developed distinctively long sickle fins were initially thought to be a different species and were known as Allison tuna (a name first given by the then curator of the Bermuda Aquarium, Louis Mowbray, in 1920). Such destinations as Hawai'i and Bermuda became famed for their catches of these beautiful fish. In Hawai'i, various styles of feather lures served as bait, but in Bermuda, chumming techniques from boats anchored on productive banks were evolved to target not only Allison tuna, but also wahoo and the smaller blackfin tuna. Bermudian experts developed techniques to take all these fish on light tackle, and for many years the International Game Fish Association records for yellowfin tuna were dominated by entries from Bermuda in the lighter line classes, with fish in the and larger class from Hawai'i taking most of the heavier line-class records. Today, yellowfin tuna are a major sport fish pursued by sport fishermen in many parts of the world. Thousands of anglers fish for yellowfin tuna along the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly in North Carolina and New England. Yellowfin are also a popular gamefish among anglers fishing from US Gulf Coast ports, San Diego, and other ports of southern California. Larger \\"long-range\\" boats in the San Diego fleet also fish in Mexican waters, searching for yellowfin tuna in many of the grounds that the San Diego pole-and-line tuna clippers used to fish. The yellowfin tuna is also a highly prized catch in the offshore sport fisheries of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Sport fishing for yellowfin tuna exists on a smaller scale in many other parts of the world. Cuisine According to the Hawaii Seafood Buyers Guide, yellowfin tuna is widely used in raw fish dishes, especially sashimi. This fish is also excellent for grilling. Yellowfin is often served seared rare. Yellowfin buyers recognize two grades, \\"sashimi grade\\" and \\"other\\", although variation in the quality of \\"other\\" grades occurs. Different seafood sustainability guides come to different conclusions about whether yellowfin fishing is sustainable. The Audubon's Seafood Guide (a guide for what types of marine food products are not ecofriendly) lists troll-caught tuna as \\"OK\\", but labels long-line caught as \\"Be Careful\\". Yellowfin is becoming a popular replacement for the severely depleted supplies of southern bluefin tuna. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list. The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a \\"list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries\\".

Introduced in Italy in 2001, Shell relaunched the fuel in March 2008, under the name Nitrogen- Enriched Shell V-Power, with nitrogen-containing detergents. Initially used for higher octane Super Unleaded petrol/gasoline (formerly known as Optimax in some regions), it is now additionally used for high specification diesel fuel. V-Power petrol Petrol or gasoline is assessed, categorised and sold by an octane rating. Generally, in most areas of the world, the Research Octane Number (RON) is used, but in North America, the Anti-Knock Index (AKI) is used. Conventional 'standard' \\"Super Unleaded\\" petrol in Europe, South Asia and Australia has an octane rating of 95 RON, and in North America \\"Premium Unleaded\\" is AKI/RdON/PON 91-93 (RON 96‚Äì98). However, higher octane \\"Super Plus Unleaded\\" - often formulated with higher quality additives, is usually set at around 98 RON in mainland Europe; but this can vary by market. Most oil/petroleum companies now 'market' their own Super Plus Unleaded petrols under a unique name - and the current name for Shell Super Unleaded fuel is \\"V-Power\\". Like most Super Plus Unleaded petrols, V-Power also contains higher concentrations of detergents and other additives to help clean the engine and smooth its operation.https://www.shell.co.uk/motorist/shell-fuels/shell-v- power/shell-v-power-unleaded.html In the United Kingdom and Denmark (where Super Plus Unleaded must be a minimum of 97 RON), V-Power has a rating of 99 RON (whereas V-Power's predecessor Shell Optimax was rated at 98 RON). There are two other 99 RON fuel available in the UK, namely Tesco MOMENTUM99 and more recently Costco Premium Unleaded (99 RON) . In The Netherlands, V-Power used to have a 95 RON rating, although officials from Shell stated it effectively had a 97 RON rating. Due to the limited categories of 92 RON, 95 RON, 98 RON and 100 RON., it was officially rated at 95. These days, the RON rating of the V-power petrol in the Netherlands is rated at 98. In Germany, all Shell stations offer V-Power Racing 100, rated at 100 RON. In Greece, all Shell stations offer V-Power rated at 97 RON. Most Shell stations also offer V-Power Racing (100 RON). In Australia, from October 2006, Shell and Coles Express re-branded Optimax to V-Power (98 RON). V-Power Racing, the ultra-high performance variant has a rating of 100 RON although Shell have decided to phase out V-Power Racing from 21 July to mid August 2008, instead recommending V-Power. The previously obtainable higher grade V-Power Racing which contained 5% ethanol to boost V-Power's octane rating to 100 RON has now been phased out by Shell due to a \\"changing market\\". In the United States (U.S.), around 2004, all U.S. Shell \\"Premium\\" gas was rebranded as \\"V-Power\\". In 2015, Shell re- branded V-Power to the newly launched V-Power Nitro+. In Canada, from June 2005, Shell Canada re-branded Optimax Gold to V-Power. In 2015, Shell Canada re-branded V-Power to V-Power Nitro+.. In Canada, Shell V-Power NiTRO+ premium gasoline does not contain ethanol.https://www.shell.ca/en_ca/motorists/shell- fuels/shell-vpower-nitro-plus-faqs.html In Hong Kong, as there is no oil refinery plant located in Hong Kong, Gasoline was imported from Singapore, which is 98 RON. However, V-Power sold in gas stations rumored reach 167 RON (the highest native RON for consumer grade commercial petrol across worldwide). Such figure is not supported by actual test, nor is it confirmed by Shell and which is contradicted from a reading material for Legislators of Legislative Council. In New Zealand, from 2007, Shell rebranded 95 Premium Unleaded as V-Power. It was still rated at 95 RON. Shell sold its New Zealand retail operations in 2010, to a consortium which later became Z Energy, and upon re-branding Shell V-Power was replaced with ZX Premium Unleaded. In Sweden, Shell V-Power was previously 99 RON, but is now been re-branded under the new owner St1 from June 2011, to \\"Shell V-Power E5\\" making it 98 RON with a mix of 5% ethanol. In Argentina, from 2009, Shell rebranded 95 Super fuel as V-Power and also the Diesel premium for V-Power diesel. In the Philippines, Pilipinas Shell launches the new Shell V-Power (replacing Shell Velocity) in 2006. On June 1, 2012, Shell Philippines launches the premium fuel grade, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Gasoline (formerly Shell Super Premium) and Shell V-Power Nitro+ Racing (formerly Shell V-Power). In Indonesia, from April 2013, Shell rebranded 95 Super Extra as V-Power with additional additives. While it is still rated at 95 RON. In Malaysia, it is RON97 but in Singapore, where Shell offers RON98, the octane is higher for V-Power Racing. In Philippines, on June 8, 2017, V-Power Nitro+ was replaced with V-Power with Dynaflex technology. In Russia, all Shell stations offer V-Power rated 95 RON, some stations also offer V-Power Racing (98 RON). V-Power Diesel Audi R10 TDI LMP race car, fueled on Shell V-Power Diesel V-Power Diesel is Shell's version of an enhanced diesel fuel, similar, say to BPs 'Ultimate Diesel'. Like BP Ultimate Diesel, Shell V-Power Diesel is designed for modern compression-ignition diesel engines, to facilitate enhanced engine performance along with increased engine protection, for more consistent operation and engine longevity.Shell.com - One characteristic of V-Power diesel is that it is a lot clearer and odourless than normal diesel, mainly due to the synthetic gas to liquid (GTL) component. The fuel is slightly less dense than regular diesel so, per volume, the unit energy is actually lower than regular diesel. This is offset, as the fuel tends to ignite more readily (and thus has a higher cetane rating) than regular diesel, and a side benefit of this is that it tends to produce less soot during combustion. Shell also markets a different \\"premium\\" diesel in Canada labeled V-Power, which they state \\"Is specially formulated for year-round Canadian weather conditions, with a cetane improver, a de-icer and a corrosion inhibitor.\\". This Canadian V-Power diesel is dispensed from a dedicated pump that injects a measured amount of NEMO 2061 additive into the diesel supply shared with the other diesel pumps at the service station., which would tyipically be reflected by an increase in cetane rating of 1-2 points, but it is worth noting that unlike European V-Power diesel, it contains no GTL components beyond those that may already exist in the shared diesel supply. Effective June 1, 2012, Pilipinas Shell launches the new premium diesel fuel grade, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel (formerly Shell V-Power Diesel). On June 8, 2017, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel was renamed back as Shell V-Power Diesel. Development in motorsports Since 2004, Shell V-Power has been sponsoring Scuderia Ferrari that participates in Formula One. Shell V-Power also sponsored Audi Sport Team Joest factory team until 2009. Part of the campaign, especially targeted to sell \\"V-Power Nitro+\\" brand of the fuels (higher priced than usual and similar to blend used on the track) is organizing Formula One events in cities without a track. For example, on the streets of Warsaw, Poland, where Scuderia Ferrari driver Felipe Massa drove the race car used in 2013 Formula One Championship.

The law was formulated by Henry Darcy based on results of experiments on the flow of water through beds of sand, forming the basis of hydrogeology, a branch of earth sciences.  Background  Darcy's law was first determined experimentally by Darcy, but has since been derived from the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations via homogenization methods. It is analogous to Fourier's law in the field of heat conduction, Ohm's law in the field of electrical networks, and Fick's law in diffusion theory. One application of Darcy's law is in the analysis of water flow through an aquifer; Darcy's law along with the equation of conservation of mass simplifies to the groundwater flow equation, one of the basic relationships of hydrogeology. Morris Muskat first refined Darcy's equation for a single phase flow by including viscosity in the single (fluid) phase equation of Darcy. This change made it suitable for researchers in the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results by his colleagues Wyckoff and Botset, Muskat and Meres also generalized Darcy's law to cover a multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized multiphase flow equations by Muskat and others provide the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.

Darcy's law, as refined by Morris Muskat, in the absence of gravitational forces and in a homogeneously permeable medium, is given by a simple proportionality relationship between the instantaneous flux q (q = Q/A, unit: (m3 of fluid/s) / m2) through a porous medium, the permeability k of the medium, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid \\\\mu, and the pressure drop abla p over a given distance, in the form : q =- \\\\frac k {\\\\mu } abla p\\\\,. This equation, for single phase (fluid) flow, is the defining equation for absolute permeability (single phase permeability). With reference to the diagram to the right, the flux q, or discharge per unit area, is defined in units (m/s), the permeability k in units (m^2), the cross-sectional area A in units (m^2), the total pressure drop \\\\Delta p = p_b - p_a in units (Pa), the dynamic viscosity \\\\mu in units (Pa \\\\cdot s), and L is the length of the sample in units (m). A number of these parameters are used in alternative definitions below. A negative sign is used in the definition of the flux following the standard physics convention that fluids flow from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. Note that the elevation head must be taken into account if the inlet and outlet are at different elevations. If the change in pressure is negative, then the flow will be in the positive direction. There have been several proposals for a constitutive equation for absolute permeability, and the most famous one is probably the Kozeny equation (also called Kozeny‚ÄìCarman equation). The integral form of the Darcy law is given by: : Q = \\\\frac{k A}{\\\\mu L} \\\\, {\\\\Delta p}\\\\, where (units of volume per time, e.g., m3/s) is the total discharge . By considering the relation for static fluid pressure (Stevin's law): : p = \\\\rho g h one can deduce the representation : Q = \\\\frac{k A g}{ u L} \\\\, {\\\\Delta h}\\\\, where ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity. The corresponding hydraulic conductivity is therefore: : K = \\\\frac{ u L}{k A g} This quantity K, often referred to as the Darcy flux or Darcy velocity, is not the velocity at which the fluid is traveling through the pores. The flow velocity () is related to the flux () by the porosity () and takes the form : u=\\\\frac q \\\\varphi \\\\,. Darcy's law is a simple mathematical statement which neatly summarizes several familiar properties that groundwater flowing in aquifers exhibits, including: * if there is no pressure gradient over a distance, no flow occurs (these are hydrostatic conditions), * if there is a pressure gradient, flow will occur from high pressure towards low pressure (opposite the direction of increasing gradient ‚Äî hence the negative sign in Darcy's law), * the greater the pressure gradient (through the same formation material), the greater the discharge rate, and * the discharge rate of fluid will often be different ‚Äî through different formation materials (or even through the same material, in a different direction) ‚Äî even if the same pressure gradient exists in both cases. A graphical illustration of the use of the steady-state groundwater flow equation (based on Darcy's law and the conservation of mass) is in the construction of flownets, to quantify the amount of groundwater flowing under a dam. Darcy's law is only valid for slow, viscous flow; however, most groundwater flow cases fall in this category. Typically any flow with a Reynolds number less than one is clearly laminar, and it would be valid to apply Darcy's law. Experimental tests have shown that flow regimes with Reynolds numbers up to 10 may still be Darcian, as in the case of groundwater flow. The Reynolds number (a dimensionless parameter) for porous media flow is typically expressed as : \\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac{u d }{ u}\\\\,, where is the kinematic viscosity of water, is the specific discharge (not the pore velocity ‚Äî with units of length per time), is a representative grain diameter for the porous media (the standard choice is d30, which is the 30% passing size from a grain size analysis using sieves ‚Äî with units of length).  Derivation  For stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, i.e. , the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation simplifies to the Stokes equation, which by neglecting the bulk term is: : \\\\mu abla^2 u_i -\\\\partial_i p=0\\\\,, where is the viscosity, is the velocity in the direction, is the gravity component in the direction and is the pressure. Assuming the viscous resisting force is linear with the velocity we may write: : -\\\\left(k_{ij}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\mu\\\\varphi u_j-\\\\partial_i p=0\\\\,, where is the porosity, and is the second order permeability tensor. This gives the velocity in the direction, : k_{ni}\\\\left(k_{ij}\\\\right)^{-1} u_j= \\\\delta_{nj} u_j = u_n = -\\\\frac{k_{ni}}{\\\\varphi\\\\mu} \\\\partial_i p\\\\,, which gives Darcy's law for the volumetric flux density in the direction, : q_n=-\\\\frac{k_{ni}}{\\\\mu} \\\\, \\\\partial_i p\\\\,. In isotropic porous media the off-diagonal elements in the permeability tensor are zero, for and the diagonal elements are identical, , and the common form is obtained : \\\\boldsymbol{q}=-\\\\frac{k}{\\\\mu} \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} p \\\\,. The above equation is a governing equation for single phase fluid flow in a porous medium.  Use in petroleum engineering  Another derivation of Darcy's law is used extensively in petroleum engineering to determine the flow through permeable media ‚Äî the most simple of which is for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock formation with a single fluid phase and constant fluid viscosity. Almost all oil reservoirs have a water zone below the oil leg, and some have also a gas cap above the oil leg. When the reservoir pressure drops due to oil production, water flows into the oil zone from below, and gas flows into the oil zone from above (if the gas cap exists), and we get a simultaneous flow and immiscible mixing of all fluid phases in the oil zone. The operator of the oil field may also inject water (and/or gas) in order to improve oil production. The petroleum industry is therefore using a generalized Darcy equation for multiphase flow that was developed by Muskat et alios. Because Darcy's name is so widespread and strongly associated with flow in porous media, the multiphase equation is denoted Darcy's law for multiphase flow or generalized Darcy equation (or law) or simply Darcy's equation (or law) or simply flow equation if the context says that the text is discussing the multiphase equation of Muskat et alios. Multiphase flow in oil and gas reservoirs is a comprehensive topic, and one of many articles about this topic is Darcy's law for multiphase flow.  Additional forms  = Quadratic law = For flows in porous media with Reynolds numbers greater than about 1 to 10, inertial effects can also become significant. Sometimes an inertial term is added to the Darcy's equation, known as Forchheimer term. This term is able to account for the non-linear behavior of the pressure difference vs flow data. : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{k}q-\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{k_1}q^2\\\\,, where the additional term is known as inertial permeability. The flow in the middle of a sandstone reservoir is so slow that Forchheimer's equation is usually not needed, but the gas flow into a gas production well may be high enough to justify use of Forchheimer's equation. In this case the inflow performance calculations for the well, not the grid cell of the 3D model, is based on the Forchheimer equation. The effect of this is that an additional rate-dependent skin appears in the inflow performance formula. Some carbonate reservoirs have many fractures, and Darcy's equation for multiphase flow is generalized in order to govern both flow in fractures and flow in the matrix (i.e. the traditional porous rock). The irregular surface of the fracture walls and high flow rate in the fractures, may justify use of Forchheimer's equation. = Correction for gases in fine media (Knudsen diffusion or Klinkenberg effect) = For gas flow in small characteristic dimensions (e.g., very fine sand, nanoporous structures etc.), the particle-wall interactions become more frequent, giving rise to additional wall friction (Knudsen friction). For a flow in this region, where both viscous and Knudsen friction are present, a new formulation needs to be used. Knudsen presented a semi-empirical model for flow in transition regime based on his experiments on small capillaries. For a porous medium, the Knudsen equation can be given as :N=-\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{p_a+p_b}{2}+D_\\\\mathrm{K}^\\\\mathrm{eff}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\mathrm{g}T}\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathrm{b}-p_\\\\mathrm{a}}{L}\\\\,, where is the molar flux, is the gas constant, is the temperature, is the effective Knudsen diffusivity of the porous media. The model can also be derived from the first-principle-based binary friction model (BFM). The differential equation of transition flow in porous media based on BFM is given as : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}=-R_\\\\mathrm{g}T\\\\left(\\\\frac{k p}{\\\\mu}+D_\\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right)^{-1}N\\\\,. This equation is valid for capillaries as well as porous media. The terminology of the Knudsen effect and Knudsen diffusivity is more common in mechanical and chemical engineering. In geological and petrochemical engineering, this effect is known as the Klinkenberg effect. Using the definition of molar flux, the above equation can be rewritten as : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}=-R_\\\\mathrm{g}T\\\\left(\\\\frac{k p}{\\\\mu}+D_\\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\dfrac{p}{R_\\\\mathrm{g}T}q\\\\,. This equation can be rearranged into the following equation : q=-\\\\frac{k}{\\\\mu}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{D_\\\\mathrm{K}\\\\mu}{k}\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}\\\\,. Comparing this equation with conventional Darcy's law, a new formulation can be given as : q=-\\\\frac{k^\\\\mathrm{eff}}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x}\\\\,, where :k^\\\\mathrm{eff}=k\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{D_\\\\mathrm{K}\\\\mu}{k}\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right)\\\\,. This is equivalent to the effective permeability formulation proposed by Klinkenberg: : k^\\\\mathrm{eff}=k\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{b}{p}\\\\right)\\\\,. where is known as the Klinkenberg parameter, which depends on the gas and the porous medium structure. This is quite evident if we compare the above formulations. The Klinkenberg parameter is dependent on permeability, Knudsen diffusivity and viscosity (i.e., both gas and porous medium properties). = Darcy's law for short time scales = For very short time scales, a time derivative of flux may be added to Darcy's law, which results in valid solutions at very small times (in heat transfer, this is called the modified form of Fourier's law), : \\\\tau \\\\frac{\\\\partial q}{\\\\partial t}+q=-k abla h\\\\,, where is a very small time constant which causes this equation to reduce to the normal form of Darcy's law at \\"normal\\" times (> nanoseconds). The main reason for doing this is that the regular groundwater flow equation (diffusion equation) leads to singularities at constant head boundaries at very small times. This form is more mathematically rigorous, but leads to a hyperbolic groundwater flow equation, which is more difficult to solve and is only useful at very small times, typically out of the realm of practical use. = Brinkman form of Darcy's law = Another extension to the traditional form of Darcy's law is the Brinkman term, which is used to account for transitional flow between boundaries (introduced by Brinkman in 1949), : -\\\\beta abla^2 q +q =-\\\\frac{k}{\\\\mu} abla p\\\\,, where is an effective viscosity term. This correction term accounts for flow through medium where the grains of the media are porous themselves, but is difficult to use, and is typically neglected. For example, if a porous extracellular matrix degrades to form large pores throughout the matrix, the viscous term applies in the large pores, while Darcy's law applies in the remaining intact region. This scenario was considered in a theoretical and modelling study. In the proposed model, the Brinkman equation is connected to a set of reaction-diffusion-convection equations. Validity of Darcy's law Darcy's law is valid for laminar flow through sediments. In fine-grained sediments, the dimensions of interstices are small and thus flow is laminar. Coarse-grained sediments also behave similarly but in very coarse-grained sediments the flow may be turbulent. Hence Darcy's law is not always valid in such sediments. For flow through commercial circular pipes, the flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than 2000 and turbulent when it is more than 4000, but in some sediments it has been found that flow is laminar when the value of Reynolds number is less than 1.

The file browser is hidden inside a disclosure widget. An \\"open\\" file dialog opened from a web browser on Windows 10. In computing, a file dialog (also called File Selector/Chooser, file requester, or open and save dialog) is a dialog box-type graphical control element that allows users to choose a file from the file system. File dialogs differ from file managers as they are not intended for file management (although some offer simple operations such as folder creation), rather they are intended for the opening and saving of files. Before file dialogs, most programs requested files as a command line argument or as an exact file path. Others required users to select a file from the file manager. A file dialog allows an application to access individual files in a standardized and secure way, with the user in control of what files to share with the application. Mobile phone operating systems lack file selection dialogs. Instead users are expected to give applications control over the whole file system.  Types  File Dialog Box is a box where it contains files. There are several types of file dialogs. The two most common being a two column view file dialog and a mini file browser dialog. Others include thumbnail view (for photos) and metadata (for music). There are several reasons for the many varieties of dialogs. First of all there is no single standard design, so a program may implement their own for any purpose. Many GUI toolkits do not provide a file dialog, so an application is forced to use its own. = Two column view = The two column view is one of the primary file dialog types. It uses two columns. One for folders, and another for files. Other common features include the current folder name, a searchbox and buttons for basic file manipulation. = Mini file manager = A mini file manager is often used. It represents the normal file manager, but it is restricted in its operations. = Thumbnails = Usually used by image related applications, a gallery of files are shown which allow a file to be chosen graphically.  Usability  File dialogs have been a subject of much usability debate. As a graphical control element receiving constant use, ease of use is a major factor in their design. The most common reasons for file dialog usability problems include: * File system limitations, * Wrong type of dialog for the application (e.g. no thumbnail view in a Wallpaper Selector, As in GNOME 2.6), * Horizontal scrolling (As in Windows file dialogs), * Uses non standard terminology (Commonly in ports from other operating systems) Many widget libraries toolkits such as Motif and GTK+ have been criticized for their lack of it. Early versions of Microsoft Windows also suffered from problems, mainly from the DOS legacy behind it. However, most of these are being addressed as more legacy programs are being converted to use newer, more usable file dialogs.  Powerbox  A file powerbox is a file which is dynamically grant the application that opened it the right to access the file that the user chooses. This means that an application does not have to run with the user's full authority. In other words, the application does not have to have the right to access all the user's files. An important aspect of the powerbox interface is that it can look to the user just like any other insecure file dialog, but can act to protect the bulk of the user's files from potentially untrustworthy software such as Trojan horses or other forms of Malware. With a powerbox system, the file dialog is implemented as a trusted part of the system. It runs in a protection domain separate from the application. The powerbox component has access to all the user's files, whereas the application does not. Powerbox systems have been implemented in Apple Mac OS X Lion.

After leaving Edinburgh University, where he had been Vice President of the Students Representative Council, he became a full-time organiser for the IMG in Glasgow in 1978-79 but left that organisation in May 1979, joining the Socialist Workers Party seven months later. In 1981, he became the SWP's Glasgow organiser. In 1983, he moved to London as an organiser for the SWP, was elected a member of its Central Committee in 1987 and became its National Organiser shortly afterwards, a position which he held to 2004 when he replaced Chris Harman as editor of Socialist Worker. In 2001, he led the International Socialist Tendency at the Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest in Italy with fellow SWP member Alex Callinicos. After considerable political tension within the SWP regarding the party's response to the economic crisis, Bambery made public his resignation letter to SWP National Organiser Charlie Kimber on 11 April 2011. His resignation was joined by 38 other party members, based in Scotland, who shared Bambery's analysis that the SWP had retreated from building a political opposition to austerity and the recession along the lines of the highly successful Stop the War Coalition which the SWP was heavily involved with in its first decade. Following his resignation from the SWP, Bambery was a founding member of the International Socialist Group, an organisation set up by the 39 former SWP members to formulate a united front approach to the recession and to develop a Left argument for Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum.Michael Theodoulou, 'Iran lambasts UK's 'lavish' diamond jubilee celebrations', The National (Abu Dhabi), 6 June 2012.

It is quite similar to historical scouting tankettes in size, form and function, and is the only true modern tankette in use in Western Europe. The Wiesel has been used in several of the Bundeswehr's missions abroad (UNOSOM II, IFOR, SFOR, KFOR, TFH, ISAF). History The Wiesel was developed for the German Army to meet a requirement for an air-transportable light armored vehicle for use by its airborne troops, as the infantry of the German Bundeswehr, especially airborne infantry, were considered unprepared to successfully fight enemy main battle tanks (MBT) in the 1970s. The requirements were that the vehicle should fit in common NATO transport planes and could eventually be air-dropped. It should be able to fight infantry as well as enemy tanks or aircraft. Porsche produced some prototypes of the future fighting vehicle for the Bundeswehr in 1975, but the Bundeswehr stopped the project in 1978 due to lack of funds. Nevertheless, Porsche continued development, because of interest from other countries. The Bundeswehr eventually ordered 343 of the vehicles in 1985. The Wiesel was introduced as a new weapon system for the Bundeswehr with deliveries beginning in the late 1980s. The vehicle was named Wiesel (\\"weasel\\") because of its small size and agility, which make it very difficult to detect on the battlefield. Production of the Wiesel 1 ended in 1993. Of 343 Wiesel 1 vehicles, 210 were armed with Raytheon TOW wire-guided anti-tank guided missile system and 133 have the one- man KUKA turret E6-II-A1 armed with the dual-feed Rheinmetall Mk 20 RH-202 20 mm autocannon. Germany deployed both types to Somalia in 1993 as part of the United Nations forces intervention in the Somali Civil War (UNISOM II). The Wiesel 2 is an enlarged and extended version of the Wiesel 1 with five road wheels instead of four, and a more powerful engine. The Bundeswehr ordered 178 of the new vehicle in various types, including air defense, radar, and anti- aircraft missile launcher, 120 mm mortar carrier, command and fire control, and ambulance variants. The Wiesel 2 entered service in 2001.Military- Today.com: Wiesel 2. Airportable armored vehicle. Configuration Wiesel 1 MK20 (1991) Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden. The vehicle behind is the Panzerhaubitze 2000 Depending on the exact configuration, the Wiesel 1's length is about 3.55 meters, height 1.82 meters, and width 1.82 meters. At only 2.75 metric tons, it weighs less than the armored variant of the U.S. Humvee military light truck. The engine is a 64 kW (86 hp) Audi 2.1-litre diesel engine giving a top speed of 70 km/h (45 mph). The Wiesel can ford 0.5 m deep and cross a 1.2 m trench. It was manufactured by Rheinmetall AG. The chassis is made of steel armour and can resist common 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm small arms ammunition and shell splinters. Air dropping the vehicle from a plane with parachutes was tested, but was not successful; four test-vehicles were destroyed. Nevertheless, the Wiesel can easily be flown in by transport helicopters, a single CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter can fly in two at once, and common transport planes can carry four or more Wiesel vehicles. The larger Wiesel 2 has almost twice as much internal volume as its predecessor, and is about 4.78 meters long, 2.17 meters high (depending on type), and 1.87 meters wide. Its weight is 4.78 metric tons (about 10,500 lbs) in its heaviest configuration.

He served as Secretary of State for Air under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and between 1929 and 1930, when he was killed in the R101 disaster.  Early life  Born in Nasik (now Nashik) in the Bombay Presidency of India to a military family, Thomson attended Cheltenham College. His father was Major- General David Thompson, Royal Engineers, and his mother was the daughter of Major-General Christopher Birdwood; William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood was another grandson of Major-General Birdwood.Masefield 1982, p.15  Career  = Military = After graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1894, Thomson was commissioned into the Royal Engineers. He served first in Mauritius and then saw action during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) during which he was in command of a field company section and was mentioned in dispatches. He also had his first encounter with aviation when he was detailed to help with the RE Balloon Section outside Kimberley.Masefield 1982, p. 14 After the war he became an instructor at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham and then at Sierra Leone. He was promoted to captain and brevet major in 1904 and in 1909 joined the Army Staff College in Camberley. In 1911 he went to the War Office, and in 1912 Thomson was appointed military attach√© with the Serbian army during the first and Second Balkan Wars, after which he returned to the War Office in 1913.Onslow, rev. Robin Higham \\"Thomson, Christopher Birdwood, Baron Thomson (1875‚Äì1930)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 2 June 2014 During the First World War Thomson first served at the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters and was Chief Military Interpreter between Sir John French and General Joffre. In 1915 he was sent to Bucharest as military attach√© on Kitchener initiative to bring Romania into the war. But when there he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on three fronts against Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria would be a liability rather than an asset to the allies. This view was brushed aside by Whitehall, and he signed a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916. By the end of 1916 he had to alleviate the consequences of Romania's capitulation, and he supervised the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to Germany.Sir Peter G. Masefield, To Ride the Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101, p.15-17 (1982, William Kimber, London) From 27 August 1917 to 27 May 1918 Thomson served as Commander Royal Engineers (CRE) of 60th (2/2nd London) Division in Palestine, commanding the divisional engineers in the Battle of Beersheba, the attack on the Sheria position, and the Capture of Jerusalem. He distinguished himself at the Capture of Jericho.Edwards, pp. 77‚Äì87.Dalbiac, pp. 110‚Äì197. After a distinguished wartime career both behind the lines and at the front, Thomson formed part of the British delegation at the Versailles conference, but condemned the Versailles terms as \\"containing the seeds of another war.\\" As in Romania where he followed a policy (of making Romania an ally) that he did not agree with, he found both experiences profoundly negative.Obituary, Daily Telegraph = Politics = After Versailles Thomson made the decision to enter politics, and joined the Labour Party and Fabian Society. He stood as Labour candidate in two Tory strongholds, Bristol Central in 1922 and St Albans in 1923, but failed to win either seat.Masefield 1982, p.21 In 1924, however, newly elected Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald elevated him to the peerage as Baron Thomson, of Cardington in the County of Bedford. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. He served as Secretary of State for Air in Macdonald's first short lived Labour administration of 1924 \\\\- interrupting briefly Sir Samuel Hoare's seven year grip on the post. The fall of the government meant that it was not until 1929 that he regained the position, once again serving under Macdonald. In the interim he had maintained his air interests acting as chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Society and the Royal Aero Club, and patron of the Air League.Masefield 1982, p.35 Private life Thomson was known as Kit to his family and C. B. to his friends. In March 1915 while British military attache in Bucharest, he met the (married) French- Romanian author Princess Marthe Bibesco, and remained devoted to her for the rest of his life. They corresponded regularly. She dedicated four books to \\"C.B.T.\\" and visited the site of the R101 accident with their mutual friend the Abb√© Mugnier in December 1930.Masefield 1982, pp. 18-20, 36, 415  Death  His second term in office was cut short by tragedy as Thomson died in the crash of the R101 airship, a government designed dirigible, on its maiden flight to Karachi in October 1930. The accident, caused partly by pressure put on by Lord Thomson to make the maiden flight before safety checks were complete and adequate flight testing, claimed the lives of 48 people and led to the cancellation of the British airship programme by Thomson's successor as air minister, Lord Amulree.

He is also leader of the multi-genre outfit Secret Chiefs 3. Originally a guitarist and trumpeter, Spruance later began playing vintage electronic organs, saz, santur, electric sitar, tar, pipa, and various other string and percussion instruments. Spruance's playing and composition style is influenced by many diverse genres of music, such as surf rock, Anatolian folk, death metal, film music, Afghan rebab music, ska, funk, space rock, jazz and Japanoise. Musique concr√®te and foley work also play a large role in his recordings. History Spruance was a founding member of Mr. Bungle, along with Mike Patton and Trevor Dunn. He has focused on his band Secret Chiefs 3 for the last 15 years (though it began in 1996), and its seven \\"satellite\\" groups first introduced on the 2004 album Book of Horizons. Though once secular, Spruance began exploring religious and philosophical themes in Mr. Bungle and Secret Chiefs 3 in the mid-1990s, after joining the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since 2007 Spruance has performed with Secret Chiefs 3 in over 50 countries. In 2013 he arranged his music for the 61-piece Traditional Russian Orchestra of Krasnoyarsk and performed with them in Kansk, Siberia, alongside other members of Secret Chiefs 3. He has performed regularly with John Zorn and has arranged two releases of works from Zorn's Masada Songbooks for Secret Chiefs 3: \\"Xaphan\\" in 2007, and \\"Beriah\\". He contributed guitar and tubular bells to two albums by the drone metal band Asva, with whom he toured the US and Europe. He also recorded with Patton and Faith No More on their 1995 album King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime. Spruance has also composed scores for two animated films by his friend Tawd B. Dorenfeld, The Anna Cabrini Chronicles and Aylaqruh:hurqalyA. As a producer Besides his own bands, Spruance has also worked as a producer for others.

The Soyuz 32 crew was the third long-duration crew to man the space station. Cosmonauts Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin spent 175 days in space, setting a new space endurance record. Because of the failure of a visiting crew to successfully dock and the resultant decision to send an uncrewed Soyuz craft as a replacement return vehicle, the Soyuz 32 crew had no visitors in the Salyut 6 space station. Crew =Backup crew= Mission parameters *Mass: *Perigee: *Apogee: *Inclination: 51.61¬∞ *Period: 89.94 minutes Mission highlights =Launch and station activation= Soyuz 32 was launched with its two-man crew on 25 February 1979. The crew's main mission was to overhaul the Salyut 6 space station's systems and prepare it for further long-duration crews. They would also attempt a new record duration flight. Soyuz 32 docked with Salyut 6 the next day, and Lyakhov and Ryumin, the third long-duration crew at the station, commenced de-mothballing the facility which had been vacant since November. When the hatch to the station was opened, the cosmonauts smelled burnt steel, a scent Ryumin called the odor of space. The crew started routine activities and two types of medical exams. The first included daily checks of mood, their accomplishments and food intake. The second checked their psychological condition via observing their frequent communication sessions. Their cardiovascular systems were checked every 8 to 10 days, and their body masses measured. By the second week, they exercised 2.5 hours a day, averaged 3,100 calories of daily food intake with 2.5 litres of water. The orbit of the station was raised by the Soyuz craft's propulsion system 1 March. What the Soviets did not then report was that the Salyut station's propulsion system was having problems. Experiments included hatching quail eggs, but the chicks grew much slower than on Earth, and lacked heads. A videotape recorder was fixed 6 March using a soldering iron, the first time such repair equipment had been used in space. =Progress 5 arrives= Progress 5, an uncrewed supply tanker, was launched 12 March and docked with the station two days later. The crew spent four days unloading the vehicle. Supplies delivered included parts for station repair, an extra storage battery, a television monitor, a new Kristall furnace to replace the old one which had broken, a gamma ray telescope and food. A total of 300 items weighing 1,300 kg were delivered. The tanker also delivered 1,000 kg of propellant for the station. The Soviets revealed the propulsion problem on 16 March. They said a Salyut fuel tank was leaking fuel into the nitrogen bellows which pressurized the fuel. The station's engine systems were not affected, but valves and regulators in the pressurization system were at potential risk. Accordingly, the crew shut down the tank and used a reserve tank. The crew attempted to drain the leaking tank by rotating the station and succeeded by 23 March, purged the tank with nitrogen and closed it off. On the same day they cleared the tank, the crew used the station's shower for the first time, wearing scuba masks to keep the water out of their eyes. A milestone was reached 24 March when the cosmonauts installed a television monitor which allowed a two-way television link with ground control. For the first time, cosmonauts received television pictures in space. Seeing family, instead of just hearing them, was considered to have great psychological importance, especially as longer flights were contemplated. On 30 March, Progress 5 boosted the station's orbit, then Soyuz 32 boosted the orbit again 6 April in preparation for the forthcoming Soyuz 33 crew. Progress 5 was undocked 3 April and deorbited two days later. =Soyuz 33 mission failure= Soyuz 33 was launched 10 April with the fourth international crew in the Soviet Intercosmos program. Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov joined commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov as the craft proceeded normally towards the space station. But, as the craft approached to 1,000 metres, the engine failed and shut down after three seconds of a planned six-second burn. Rukavishnikov had to hold the instrument panel as the craft violently shook. A second firing attempt was made, but the engine shut down again, and Ryumin, observing from the station, reported an abnormal lateral glow from behind the Soyuz during the burn. Mission control accordingly aborted the mission and told the crew to prepare to return to Earth. It was the first in-orbit failure of the Soyuz propulsion system. It was only in 1983 that the Soviets revealed how serious the situation was. The craft had a back-up engine but it was feared that it may have been damaged by the main engine, potentially leaving the crew stranded with five days of supplies while it would take ten days for the orbit to decay. The station could have been moved to within 1,000 m of the craft, but the two craft were drifting apart at 28 metres per second, and time was needed to calculate the manoeuvres. In any event, four crew on the station with one malfunctioning Soyuz and a second Soyuz (Soyuz 32) with a now-questionable engine (it had the same type as Soyuz 33) was not considered the best option. In the end, the backup engine did fire, though for 25 seconds too long, resulting in an unusually steep trajectory and loads of 10 Gs to be endured by the crew. Rukavishnikov and Ivanov were safely recovered. =Progress 6, uncrewed Soyuz launched= The failure of a prestigious international mission was an embarrassment to Soviet authorities and also had a negative effect on the morale of Ryumin and Lyhakov, both of whom had been looking forward to receiving visitors. News of the cancellation of the Soyuz 33 flight was greeted by a series of grunts followed by the termination of all voice communication by the Salyut 6 crew. Their bad mood persisted for several days. After the Soyuz 33 failure, the station crew were stuck with a suspect craft. The Soyuz 33 craft was intended to be swapped for the Soyuz 32, but the failure called into question the reliability of Soyuz 32's main engine. Until the design was corrected and a new vehicle launched, the crew was safe on Salyut with the Soyuz usable in an emergency. The fifth international flight, scheduled for 5 June, was postponed. Lyakhov and Ryumin continued their station activities, including experiments intended to be carried out with the visiting crew (which had been delivered aboard the Progress 5 flight), such as one called Pirin which investigated the formation of metal whiskers on zinc crystals, and another which made multi-spectral measurements of the daylight atmosphere. They were given five days off for the May Day holiday. Progress 6 was launched 13 May and delivered some 100 items. The Soyuz 33 engine failure did not affect the supply tanker as it differed in its design. Unloading took two days, a new navigational unit was installed, and the tanker raised the station's orbit on 22 May. Refueling was completed by 28 May, more orbital adjustments were made 4 and 5 June, and Progress 6 was undocked 8 June. Soyuz 34, launched uncrewed on 6 June, docked at the just-vacated aft port of the space station on 9 June. The Soyuz had a new engine system, and its successful test flight gave the Salyut 6 crew a reliable return vehicle. Since the craft was uncrewed, some biological samples for experiments were included on the flight. Soyuz 32 was loaded with 130 kg of replaced instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight equal to that of the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it undocked and returned to Earth uncrewed 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7. =Progress 7, radio telescope deployed, return to Earth= Progress 7 was launched 28 June and docked at Salyut 6 two days later. It carried 1,230 kg of supplies including food, plants, mail and a 10-metre diameter radio telescope. The station's orbit was raised 3 and 4 July to a 399‚Äì411 km orbit, the highest at which a Salyut had operated. This was because no more Progress flights were planned for 1979 and the Salyut's propulsion system was suspect, so the decision was to raise the station's orbit as high as possible before the crew returned to Earth. Propellant was transferred by 17 July. When the Progress craft undocked, the wire mesh parabolic telescope was unfurled. A camera aboard the tanker beamed the scene to Earth. The KRT-10 radio telescope was deployed out the rear docking port, but results proved disappointing and the cosmonauts ejected it on August 9. Trouble happened again when the antenna became snared on the port, forcing the tired cosmonauts to perform an unscheduled space walk on 15 August to cut it loose. Ryumin, attached to a tether, used hand rails to get to the antenna and cut it away. Then he and Lyakhov retrieved a materials experiment left on the station's exterior. Because the space walk was so late in the mission, the crew was apprehensive as they were not in the best physical condition to carry it out, so they left letters in the Soyuz return vehicle in case they did not survive. They packed several experiments in Soyuz 34 and departed the space station 19 August, reentering two days later and landing 170 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. Because the cosmonauts were so weakened from six months in zero gravity (a bouquet of flowers presented to them reportedly felt like \\"a ton of bricks\\"), a system of slides and chutes had to be deployed for them to exit the Soyuz descent module. Lyakhov lost 5.5 kg during the flight (Ryumin's weight was the same) and both experienced a 20% reduction in lower leg volume. They recovered in seven days, several days faster than expected. The mission had lasted 175 days, a new endurance record surpassing the 139-day mission by the Soyuz 29 crew in 1978.

Classic FM has called him ‚Äúone of the greatest violinists in the world.‚Äù Biography Vengerov was born the only child of Aleksandr and Larisa Borisovna, oboist and orphanage children‚Äôs choir director respectively. He began studying the violin at age 5 with Galina Turchaninova. At the age of 10, Vengerov won the 1984 International Karol Lipi≈Ñski and Henryk Wieniawski Young Violin Player Competition. For the next five years he was a pupil of Zakhar Bron, who in 1987 left the Soviet Union to teach at the Royal Academy of Music in London. When Bron relocated to the Musikhochschule L√ºbeck, Vengerov followed suit. In 1990, Vengerov won the International Carl Flesch Competition in London, which led to his recording contract with Teldec and the launch of his international career. In 1997, Vengerov became the first classical musician to be appointed an International Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF,, performing for children in Uganda, Thailand, and Kosovo. Playing by Heart, an American television production on NBC about the violinist‚Äôs meetings with young musicians during his master classes, was screened at the 1999 Cannes Festival. He later took a two-year course in Baroque violin performance practice and repertoire. In 2010, he was appointed the first chief conductor of the Menuhin Festival Gstaad Orchestra. He continued his conducting studies with Yuri Simonov, and graduated with a diploma of excellence from the Ippolitov-Ivanov State Musical Pedagogical Institute in June 2014. Vengerov then enrolled in a further two- year program of opera conducting. Vengerov's work with contemporary composers has included premiering the violin concerto La Joie de la souffrance by Qigang Chen. During 2019‚Äì20, he was artist-in-residence with the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra. Currently he is Ambassador and Visiting Professor at the Menuhin Music Academy in Switzerland (IMMA) and Polonsky Visiting Professor of Violin at the Royal College of Music, London. Aside from teaching, Vengerov has also served on numerous competition juries, including the Donatella Flick conducting competition, the Menuhin Violin Competition, and also as chairman of the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in 2011 and 2016. In May 2013, he conducted the finals of the Montreal International Violin Competition. Across his career Vengerov has earned numerous awards including the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (with Orchestra) (2003), two Gramophone Classical Music Awards (1994, 1995), a Classic Brit Award (2004), five Edison Classical Music Awards (1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2004), two Echo Music Prizes (1997, 2003), and a World Economic Forum Crystal Award (2007).

The area consisted of what is now the cities of Pontiac, Auburn Hills, and Lake Angelus. Pontiac Township was bordered on the north by Brown Road and Dutton Road, on the east by South Adams Road (including a line extending north from South Adams Road), on the south by South Boulevard, and on the west by Telegraph Road. History In 1818, Colonel Stephen Mack purchased 1280 acres (5.2 km¬≤) of land that was to become the city of Pontiac. In 1820, Pontiac became the county seat of Oakland County. Pontiac incorporated as a village in 1837 and later as a city in 1861. The township was organized as a civil entity in 1827. Under Michigan law, cities are independent of township governance, while villages may continue to receive some services from the township. Thus, as Pontiac grew, it annexed land from the township. The village of Auburn was platted in 1826 and was renamed Amy in 1880. In 1917, it was renamed again as Auburn Heights. Pontiac Township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but the request was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, it formally became the city of Auburn Hills and included Auburn Heights. Lake Angelus incorporated as a village in 1930 and became a city in 1984. Although the township no longer exists as a civil entity, it is still used as a survey township for land use purposes.

It was the first failure of a Soyuz engine during orbital operations. Soyuz 33 descent module in Aviation museum Plovdiv The two-man crew, commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov and Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov, suffered a steep ballistic re-entry, but were safely recovered. The original intention of the mission had been to visit the orbiting crew for about a week and leave a fresh vehicle for the station crew to return to Earth in. The mission failure meant that the orbiting Salyut 6 crew lacked a reliable return vehicle as their Soyuz had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. A subsequent crewed flight was canceled and a vacant craft with a redesigned engine was sent for the crew to use.

Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov joined commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov as the craft proceeded normally towards the Salyut 6 space station. Rukavishnikov was the first civilian to command a Soviet spacecraft, and Ivanov the first Bulgarian in space. At 9 km distance from the station, the Igla automatic docking system was activated. But, as the craft approached to 1,000 metres, the engine failed and automatically shut down after three seconds of a planned six-second burn. Rukavishnikov had to hold the instrument panel as the craft shook so violently. After consulting with ground control, the docking system was activated again, but the engine shut down again, and Valery Ryumin, observing from the station, reported an abnormal lateral glow from behind the Soyuz during the burn. Mission control accordingly aborted the mission and told the crew to prepare to return to Earth. It was the first in-orbit failure of the Soyuz propulsion system. The failure was determined to be a malfunction of the main engine. A pressure sensor in the combustion chamber was shutting down the engine when it seemed normal combustion pressure was not being reached. This shut-down mechanism was designed to prevent propellants from being pumped into a damaged engine thus risking damage or an explosion. The crew requested another attempt at an engine burn, but were denied and told to sleep. A recovery attempt could not be made for another day. Rukavishnikov could not sleep, however, and thought about the novel Marooned, which featured an American space crew stranded in orbit. It was only in 1983 that the Soviets revealed how serious the situation was. The craft had a backup engine but it was feared that it may have been damaged by the main engine, potentially leaving the crew stranded with five days of supplies while it would take ten days for the orbit to decay. One option to return the crew if the backup engine was inoperable would have been to use attitude control thrusters to slow the Soyuz below orbit velocity, but it was not known if there was enough propellant to do this, and the landing point would have been unpredictable even if it had worked. Another option was to move the station to the Soyuz. The station could have been moved to within 1,000 m of the craft, at which point Soyuz 33 could be docked using its thrusters, but the two craft were drifting apart at 28 meters per second, and time was needed to calculate the maneuvers. In any event, four crew on the station with one malfunctioning Soyuz and a second Soyuz (the station crew's Soyuz 32, already docked at Salyut 6) with a now-questionable engine (it had the same type as Soyuz 33) was not considered the best option. The main option was to fire the backup engine, but this option was not guaranteed to work, even if the engine fired. The nominal burn time was 188 seconds, and as long as the burn lasted more than 90 seconds, the crew could manually restart the engine to compensate. But this would mean an inaccurate landing. If the burn was less than 90 seconds, the crew could be stranded in orbit. A burn longer than 188 seconds could result in excessive G-loads on the crew during reentry. In the end, the backup engine did fire, though for 213 seconds, 25 seconds too long, resulting in the craft taking an unusually steep trajectory and the crew having to endure an acceleration of 10 gs. Rukavishnikov and Ivanov were safely recovered. It was the second ballistic entry reported by the Soviets, Soyuz 1 being the first (although Soyuz 18a was a ballistic reentry, and Soyuz 24 reportedly also was one). The high G-loads during reentry were a mix of crew error and a design flaw in the autopilot; because the backup engine produced less thrust than the main engine, the autopilot tried to run it until the proper delta V was achieved, but the cosmonauts issued a manual shutoff command after 213 seconds of burn time. This unwise decision resulted in a ballistic reentry. This would have caused the Soyuz to land uprange of the planned landing point, but the low delta-V (as the result of the crew manually shutting off the engine early) resulted in the opposite effect and instead, the capsule touched down very close to the target area. An investigation lasted a month and found that the part that failed had been tested 8,000 times previously without failing, and the Soyuz engine had fired some 2,000 times since 1967, also without a single failure. But the engine was modified for the next flight, and a vacant Soyuz with the newly modified engine, Soyuz 34, was sent to the orbiting Salyut for the crew there to return with.

Along with U.S. Route 20 (US 20), Route 2, and Interstate 90, Route 9 is one of the major east‚Äìwest routes of Massachusetts, and like the others its eastern terminus is in Boston. Starting at Copley Square and passing along Huntington Avenue, Route 9 is a limited access route through the MetroWest suburbs to Worcester, and is also a major alternative to the Pike's toll road west of the city. After passing along major city streets in Worcester, the road becomes a country route, passing through the central Worcester Hills, the Pioneer Valley, and the city of Northampton, and into The Berkshires. The road ends near the center of the city of Pittsfield. Route description Route 9 passes through six counties and twenty-eight cities and towns. It begins in the western Massachusetts city of Pittsfield, at U.S. Route 20. After separating from US-20, it has a brief .2 mile concurrency with U.S. Route 7 through the center of that city, then continues east, passing through the towns of Dalton and Windsor, wherein the route reaches its highest point at 2033 ft, in Berkshire County. It continues its winding pass through the small towns of The Berkshires in Berkshire and western Hampshire Counties before passing through the center of Northampton, passing Smith College before its first interstate junction, at Interstate 91. It then crosses the Connecticut River at the Calvin Coolidge Bridge, just downstream from Elwell Island. It goes past the retail area of Hadley before passing the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Amherst College. From Amherst, it winds its way into western Worcester County, south of the Quabbin Reservoir, through small towns until it makes its way into the city of Worcester. Once in Worcester, Route 9 becomes a major thoroughfare through the city, as Park Avenue, Highland Street (which passes Major Taylor Boulevard), before passing over Interstate 290 and Belmont Street, where University of Massachusetts Medical School and the former Worcester State Hospital are located. At its intersection with McRae Ct., it becomes a divided highway with raised median. From Worcester, it crosses Lake Quinsigamond into Shrewsbury. At this point, Route 9 becomes the main retail artery of the MetroWest region. Several plazas and chain stores are located along the route as it makes its way towards Northborough, where it crosses U.S. Route 20; Westborough, where it crosses Interstate 495; and eventually in the Golden Triangle retail area of Framingham and Natick, after crossing the Massachusetts Turnpike. It passes Shopper's World and the Natick Mall, New England's largest mall. Beginning in the Golden Triangle, Route 9 becomes one of the major routes into Boston, serving as a valuable bypass to the Mass Pike and its tolls. It crosses Interstate 95 (also known as Massachusetts Route 128) in Wellesley before crossing the Charles River into Newton and Brookline as Boylston Street. It enters the city of Boston by crossing over Brookline's former namesake, the Muddy River, part of the Emerald Necklace. at this point it becomes Huntington Avenue, also known as \\"Avenue of the Arts.\\" It loses its raised median briefly between its intersection with S. Huntington Ave. and Brigham Circle. It passes the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, which includes Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School and other hospitals; the Museum of Fine Arts; and several colleges and universities, including Northeastern University. This stretch is also a major site of baseball history; the first game of the 1903 World Series, baseball's first true World Series, was played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds, the original home of the Boston Red Sox. (The site is now part of Northeastern's campus.) The E branch of the MBTA Green Line roughly follows Huntington Avenue underground from Copley Square until it rises above ground at the Northeastern portal. It then operates in a dedicated median of Huntington Avenue between Northeastern University and the Brigham Circle stop, where trains begin street running in mixed traffic to a terminus at Heath Street. Route 9 continues past Symphony Hall and The First Church of Christ, Scientist, which is the mother church of Christian Science. It then passes Copley Place and the Prudential Center complex, before splitting, the eastbound half onto Stuart Street, the westbound onto Saint James Street, past Copley Square; both the eastbound and westbound segments of Route 9 end at Route 28. History Route 9 was established in 1933. It took over the alignment of what was Route 115 from Kenmore Square in Boston to Route 22 in North Grafton, part of the original route of US 20 between North Grafton and West Brookfield and the original Route 109 between West Brookfield and US 7 in Pittsfield. Route 9's original route in Boston was along Brookline Avenue from Kenmore Square turning west onto its current path along Boylston Street.Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Works, 1932 Road Map and Detour Bulletin. Between Worcester and Boston, Route 9 follows the path of the 19th-century Worcester Turnpike, opened in 1810. This route originally included a floating bridge over Lake Quinsigamond in Shrewsbury. From Dalton to Goshen in the Berkshires, the road follows the old Berkshire Trail. The massive expansion of the University of Massachusetts Amherst transformed that part of Route 9 in the late 20th century; this otherwise rural part of the route now has several shops, restaurants, and the mid-sized Hampshire Mall. In the 20th century, Route 9 became the focus for urban sprawl in towns like Newton and Wellesley. Further west, in Framingham, Route 9 was home to one of the first modern shopping malls, the aptly named Shoppers' World. In Natick, Route 9 is officially the \\"Ted Williams Highway\\", named after the Red Sox sports legend Ted Williams, who sported that number. In Newton, it is officially the \\"United Spanish War Veterans Highway\\". From 1903 to 1932, the Boston and Worcester Street Railway ran mostly via Route 9. Today the E branch of the MBTA's Green Line follows Route 9 along Huntington Avenue.

The film was based on the novel The Looters by John H. Reese. Plot Charley Varrick is a crop- duster and former stunt pilot. Charley, his wife Nadine, longtime accomplice Al Dutcher, and youngster Harman Sullivan, rob a bank in the rural community of Tres Cruces, New Mexico. While Nadine waits in the getaway car, the heavily disguised Charley and his two accomplices draw their guns and begin the heist. A police officer passing by recognizes the getaway car. When the officers approach Nadine, she shoots at them, killing one instantly and seriously wounding the other, but the second officer returns fire, wounding her. The melee outside distracts the robbers, enabling the bank guard to kill Dutcher. Sensing that the bank manager is concealing something, Charley forces him to reveal two large satchels of cash. Charley, Harman, and Nadine flee, but Nadine dies soon thereafter. Charley and Harman swap vehicles and prepare to blow up the getaway car, with Nadine's body inside. They are stopped by another police officer, but before he can search their van, the explosion goes off and the officer races away. When they count the money, it totals $765,118, much more than expected. After a local news broadcast reports that only $2,000 was stolen, Charley says the bank must be involved in a money laundering operation. He warns Harman that the Mafia will pursue them relentlessly and that their only chance of surviving is by laying low and not spending the money for three or four years, but Harman insists that he should be free to spend his share on women and good times. Meanwhile, Maynard Boyle, president of the bank, dispatches tall, burly hitman Molly to recover the money. Realizing that Harman's rashness will get them both killed, Charley double- crosses him. Charley knows that he, Nadine, and Harman all had dental work done recently, so he breaks into the dentist's office, stealing his and Nadine's X-rays and swapping Harman's for his. To obtain passports, Charley contacts Tom, an old accomplice of Dutcher, who directs him to local photographer Jewell Everett. He has his photograph taken, but he also gives her Harman's driver's license, thereby ensuring that Molly will find Harman. Tom immediately informs on Charley. Jewell also betrays Charley, but he never returns for the passports. Molly arrives at Charley's trailer and tortures Harman to get information about the money, then beats Harman to death. Boyle meets secretly with Tres Cruces bank manager Harold Young, advising Young that his Mafia superiors will suspect that the robbery was an inside job, because it occurred during the brief period when the money was there. He suggests that Young will be tortured. Young, terrified, commits suicide. Charley purchases dynamite, then flies to Reno, where he has flowers delivered to Boyle's secretary, Sybil Fort, so he can identify her and follow her home. He seduces Fort in her apartment. Fort warns Charley not to trust her boss. Charley then contacts Boyle, offering to return the money. He arranges a meeting at a remote automobile wrecking yard and insists that Boyle come alone. Charley overflies the wrecking yard and spots Molly's car. After landing, Charley hugs the confounded Boyle, acting overjoyed; Molly falls for the ruse and assumes that Boyle is Charley's accomplice, so he runs Boyle down with his car, killing him. Molly then chases Charley, who tries to fly away, but Molly damages the crop-duster's tail with his car and the aircraft flips over. Trapped in the wreckage, Charley tells Molly that the money is in the trunk of a nearby car. However, Charley had flipped his aircraft on purpose. When Molly opens the trunk, he sees Harman's body, wearing Charley's wedding band, and the bank satchels; an instant later, he is killed by a booby trap. Charley throws a wad of hundred-dollar bills toward the burning car, then, after a couple of false starts, drives away.

The motto appears on the film poster and briefly as a subtitle in the film trailer. When the hitman Molly arrives at Jewell's photo studio and introduces himself, Jewell sarcastically replies, \\"Yeah, I didn't figure you for Clint Eastwood\\". The role of Varrick was written for Eastwood, who turned it down, reportedly because he could not find any redeeming features in the character. Matthau was also reported to have been unimpressed by the film, and Siegel later claimed that Matthau hurt the film's box-office by publicly stating that he neither liked the film nor understood what it was about. Matthau sent Siegel a note that said, \\"I have seen it three times, and am of slightly better than average intelligence (IQ 120) but I still don't quite understand what's going on.

It premiered on November 16, 1998, as part of the show's structural change and originally ran fifteen minutes at the end of each episode until 2009, but was then rebooted in 2017. It was designed to appeal to younger viewers and to increase ratings, which had fallen in the past decade. The segment is presented from the perspective of a three-year-old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, performed by Kevin Clash in the original series and Ryan Dillon in the 2017 reboot. The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied the changes in the viewing habits of their audience, and the reasons for the show's lower ratings. Elmo's World used traditional elements of production, but had a more sustained narrative. In 2002, Sesame Streets producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers' sophistication. Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up with the concept of Elmo's World, and writer Tony Geiss and executive producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism of the rest of the show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like \\"a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life\\"Clash, p. 75 created by the host, and with \\"a stream-of-consciousness feel to it\\". Elmo's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. A brief clip from Elmo's World appears in Sesame Street's 2002-2006 intro. In 2009, Elmo's World temporarily ceased production and was replaced by \\"Elmo the Musical\\" in 2012, until returning in 2017. Background By the early 1990s, Sesame Street had been on the air for over 20 years and was, as author Michael Davis put it, \\"the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television\\".Davis, p. 317 The show's dominance began to be challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as Barney & Friends and Blue's Clues, by the growth of the children's home video industry, and by the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable.Davis, p. 320Davis, p. 338 Sesame Streets ratings declined, so the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) (now Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible for putting the show on the air, responded by researching the reasons for their lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Streets content and structure, and studied how children's viewing habits had changed. The analysis was conducted during a series of two-week-long workshops and was completed in time for the show's 30th anniversary in 1999. The CTW found that although the show was produced for children between the ages of three and five, their viewers had become more sophisticated since its debut and began to watch the show sooner, as early as ten months of age.Clash, p. 76Fisch & Bernstein, pp. 44‚Äì45 The producers found that the show's original format, which consisted of a series of short clips similar to the structure of a magazine, was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers' attention. They also found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention with Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes. The first way the CTW addressed the issues brought up by their research was by lowering the target age for Sesame Street, from four years to three years. In late 1998, they created a new 15-minute segment entitled Elmo's World, hosted by the Muppet Elmo, that was shown at the end of each episode. The segment used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative.Fisch & Bernstein, p. 45 Elmo's World followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. It focused on child-centered topics such as balls and dancing, from the perspective of a three-year-old child, and was \\"designed to foster exploration, imagination, and curiosity\\". Instead of an adult providing narration, Elmo led the child through the action. In 2002, Sesame Streets producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic and increase in their viewers' sophistication. They decided, after the show's 33rd season, to expand upon the Elmo's World concept by, as San Francisco Chronicle TV critic Tim Goodman called it, \\"deconstructing\\" the show. They changed the structure of the entire show to a more narrative format, making the show easier for young children to navigate. Arlene Sherman, a co-executive producer for 25 years and one of the creators of Elmo's World, called the show's new look \\"startlingly different\\". Development and filming Long-time Sesame Street writer Judy Freudberg came up with the idea of creating a segment with \\"an entirely different format\\"Davis, p. 339 from the rest of the show during the CTW's workshops, and writer Tony Geiss further developed the idea with her. Freudberg stated that the concept \\"was radical because we had never veered from that magazine mosaic and had never given any character more than another character to do\\". Elmo, with his portrayer, Kevin Clash, in 2010. Animator Mo Willems came up with the idea of creating a less-realistic setting compared to the rest of the show. The segment presented Elmo, first portrayed by Kevin Clash and then by Ryan Dillon after its revamp in 2017, moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like \\"a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life\\" created by the host, and with \\"a stream- of-consciousness feel to it\\". The segment was filmed at a different time than the rest of the season, much of it in front of a blue screen, with animation and digital effects added later.Gikow, p. 168Herman, event occurs at 2:53 For more complicated shots that showed Elmo's entire body, a puppet called \\"Active Elmo\\" was operated with assistance from other puppeteers; the puppet was also filmed in front of a blue screen and edited later.Gikow, p. 194 In addition to Freudberg and Geiss, other writers of Elmo's World included Emily Kingsley and Molly Boylan. The theme song was based upon a song Geiss wrote called \\"Elmo's Song\\", with lyrics changed to fit the segment.Herman, event occurs at 0:43 Writer Louise Gikow and The New York Times called it \\"a show within a show\\". Clash called it \\"a playdate between the child and Elmo\\", and felt that its intimacy provided an effective teaching tool. He also called it \\"an instant success\\".Clash, p. 77 Davis compared Elmo's World with the Saturday Morning children's TV show Pee-wee's Playhouse. The CTW, as it has done throughout its existence and for all the shows it produced, conducted extensive studies on Elmo's World. They found that the segment had high appeal for children, regardless of their age, sex, and socioeconomic background. Attention and participation such as hand-clapping, moving along with the music, and counting along with the characters increased with repeated viewing. Characters The Muppet Elmo, who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of Elmo's World because he had always tested well with Sesame Streets younger viewers. Elmo was created in 1979 and was performed by various puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer Kevin Clash called a \\"phenomenon\\"Borgenicht, David (1998). Sesame Street Unpaved. New York: Hyperion Publishing, p. 9. until Clash took over the role in 1983. Elmo became, as writer Michael Davis reported, \\"the embodiment\\" of Sesame Street, and \\"the marketing wonder of our age\\"Davis, p. 249 when five million \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" dolls were sold in 1996. Clash believed the \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the Elmo's World segment.Clash, p.47 Clash called Elmo's World \\"a colorful, lively celebration of creativity\\" and \\"one of the most imaginative endeavors I've ever been involved in\\". He stated that the segment provided him with new challenges and opportunities for \\"creative risk-taking\\". According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards. Mr. Noodle was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had previously worked with Sherman in short films for Sesame Street.Herman, event occurs at 3:31 When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle.Herman, event occurs at 5:10 Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, until his death in 2003. Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle's sister Ms. Noodle, and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle's other sister Miss Noodle. As of January 2017, Daveed Diggs and comedian Daniel Koren, have played two more of Mr. Noodle's brothers. According to Freudberg, \\"Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he's never seen one before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can't.\\" End of production and return In 2009, when Elmo's World temporarily ceased production, the producers of Sesame Street began taking steps to increase the age of their viewers and to increase their ratings. By the end of the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, 3-year-old viewers had increased by 41 percent, 4-year-olds by 4 percent, and 5-year-olds by 21 percent. According to The New York Times, executive producer Carol-Lynn Parente \\"was itching to revamp the final segment\\" even before production of Elmo's World ended, but was prevented by the apparent satisfaction of the viewers and by tight budgets. They were also reluctant to replace the segment; as writer Joey Mazzarino explained, it was \\"an emotionally charged process\\" because Freudberg had become ill and was not present for the discussions about it. Elmo's World was replaced by \\"Elmo the Musical\\" in 2012. Elmo's World continued to appear on repeats of Sesame Street, on DVDs, and on the show's website, which sold products related to the segment. In 2017, the 47th season of Sesame Street began airing on the cable subscription service HBO; Elmo's World returned, in a newly designed segment that ran five minutes at the end of each episode. Steve Youngwood, the Sesame Workshop's CEO, called it \\"fresh, contemporary\\".

Mission control decided to re-design the engine used on Soyuz craft as a result of the Soyuz 33 failure, and to return the Soyuz 32 craft which transported Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin to the space station to earth uncrewed as it had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. Soyuz 34 successfully returned the crew to earth 73 days after launching. Crew Mission parameters *Mass: *Perigee: *Apogee: *Inclination: 51.62¬∞ *Period: 88.91 minutes Mission highlights Soyuz 34 had been intended to have been launched around 6 June 1979 with a two-man Hungarian/Soviet crew. That crew would have presumably returned in Soyuz 33 which had been planned to be docked at the Salyut 6 space station. Suspicions this was originally to be a Hungarian/Soviet flight were confirmed in 1980 when press releases for an upcoming joint mission were still dated June 1979. However, the engine failure during Soyuz 33's flight in April necessitated a shuffling of planned missions. Because the engine used in that flight was the same model already docked at the space station on Soyuz 32 and the resident crew of Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin needed a reliable craft to return to Earth in, it was decided that the engine needed to be modified and a fresh return vehicle sent to the station - vacant. Soyuz 34 was launched uncrewed on 6 June, and docked at the aft port of the space station on 9 June. The flight itself was a test of the new engine and its success meant the crew had a reliable return craft. Since the craft was uncrewed, some biological samples for experiments were included on the flight. Soyuz 32 was loaded with 130 kg of replaced instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight equal to that of the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it undocked and returned to Earth uncrewed 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The craft was found to be in good condition. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7, a supply tanker. On 19 August, the resident crew returned to earth in Soyuz 34, establishing a new space-endurance record of 175 days, surpassing the 139-day mission by the Soyuz 29 crew in 1978.

All territories with the exception of Brazil (where UCI cinemas are owned by Paramount Pictures' owner ViacomCBS's owner National Amusements) are owned by Odeon Cinemas Group whose ultimate owner is AMC Theatres. History The organization was announced in October 1988 as a joint venture between United Artists, Cinema International Corporation (a partnership of Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios), and AMC Theatres, to operate, under the AMC brand, 200 screens in the UK and Ireland with 3 new cinemas opening in Bochum, Bremen and Cologne in West Germany and a further 150 screens planned in the UK and Ireland by 1991. However, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity for $98 million instead and withdrew from the UK market, with the joint venture now known as Cinema International Corp./United Artists Communications Inc. The name was shortened the following year to United Cinemas International and they were based in Manchester, England, operating 86 cinemas initially. The chain managed CIC's flagship cinemas in London, the Empire, Leicester Square and the Plaza, however, these were still owned by CIC. In the UK, the company operated cinemas under the UCI and (later) thefilmworks brands, and initially enjoyed a sizeable market share. They took over the first multiplex cinema opened in the UK by AMC at The Point in Milton Keynes in 1985, and were one of the first to purchase a digital projector ‚Äì costing a massive ¬£130,000 ‚Äì one out of only 30 worldwide. This enabled them to download films via satellite, and also play digital media disks rather than film. Under chairman Tom McGrath, the group expanded to build and operate cinemas in Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, and the UK. The cinemas were, by and large, fairly simplistic in design and seemed steeped in 1980s traditions that quickly became dated. However, a later purchase by Terra Firma (see below) saw the chain merged with Odeon cinemas and henceforth adopting the far plusher Odeon style. In late 2004, the European division of UCI was bought by Terra Firma Capital Partners, along with rival chain Odeon Cinemas. The majority of UK UCI and thefilmworks cinemas were re-branded to use the Odeon name. As a condition of the merger with Odeon Cinemas (imposed by the Office of Fair Trading), UCI Clydebank, UCI Poole, UCI Sutton, UCI Basildon, The Empire Leicester Square and thefilmworks High Wycombe were sold to Empire Cinemas. Since the merger has been completed, few elements of former UCI cinemas still retain the UCI look and feel, they now almost all share the standard Odeon design cues, except for a handful of the former \\"Filmworks\\" brand whose designs did not lend themselves well to an Odeon \\"look\\". The UCI, UCI/Kinowelt and Cinesa brands will remain in Ireland and the rest of Europe. UCI Hull was evicted at around this time due to redevelopment. As there was already an Odeon there, it was not replaced. Irish cinemas, although retaining the UCI name, were managed as part of Odeon Cinemas and introduced parts of their offer, such as Premier seating and the Odeon inhouse magazine, \\"Onscreen\\". Advertising contained the Odeon logo font in many cases. In August 2007, UCI launched a new Irish website with an identical layout to odeon.co.uk. The Irish cinemas were sold to an Irish group, Entertainment Enterprises, in September 2006, but continued to be run by Odeon under a management contract. In April 2008, Entertainment Enterprises announced that it would be acquiring the Storm Cinemas chain with the exception of the Belfast cinema, and would be contracting the management of the cinemas to Odeon. UCI's Tallaght cinema, the first opened in the country, was closed on 8 March 2010 after the landlords gave the company notice that their lease would not be renewed. . On 31 May 2011, Odeon announced that it had bought back the UCI chain in Ireland (including the Storm Cinemas-branded locations) from Entertainment Enterprises.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0601/1224298206049.html Irish cinemas were re-branded under the ODEON name in 2012 to coincide with the new cinema opening at the Point Village in Dublin, as of the end of 2013 the UCI name is no longer used in any cinemas in the UK & Ireland, all are now branded ODEON. The ODEON in-house magazine \\"Onscreen\\" was re-branded and re- launched as \\"ODEON\\" magazine in 2012. UCI have invested heavily in the \\"Customer Experience\\". This forms a focal point of the staff training all around the globe, and looks at impressions offered to the customer at all times throughout their visit to any one of their cinemas. In early 2019, the three cinemas in Austria were sold and rebranded as part of Cineplexx Cinemas.

In the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, the centre is within the Trafford Park industrial estate, five miles west of Manchester city centre. The Trafford Centre opened in 1998 and is the third largest shopping centre in the United Kingdom by retail size. It was developed by the Peel Group and sold to Capital Shopping Centres (later to become Intu in 2013) following a ¬£1.65 billion sale in 2011 ‚Äì the largest single property acquisition in British history. As of 2017, the centre has a market value of ¬£2.312 billion. The site was owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company until 1986, when the company was acquired by John Whittaker of Peel Holdings, who had plans to build an out-of-town shopping centre. The planning process was one of the longest and most expensive in the history of the United Kingdom; concerns surrounded the effect the shopping centre might have on retailers in smaller towns and villages in Greater Manchester and potential traffic problems caused by its proximity to the M60 motorway. The matter was decided by the House of Lords in 1996.House of Lords (1995) \\"Opinions of the Lords of Appeal for Judgment in the cause Bolton Metropolitan District Council and others (respondents) versus Secretary of State for the Environment and others (appellants)\\" 24 May, written by Lord Lloyd of Berwick.Trafford Centre (1997) \\"From de Trafford to the House of Lords\\" Trafford Centre Insight, Brochure. Twelve years after the Trafford Centre was first conceptualised by the Peel Group, it opened on 10 September 1998. Construction took 27 months at a cost of ¬£600 million - approximately ¬£1 billion in 2016. Two further extensions have since opened, Barton Square and the Great Hall in 2008, at a combined cost of over ¬£100 million. Its rococo/late baroque architectural style pays homage to the history of the area. The Orient food hall is themed as a steam ship, reflecting the centre's proximity to the Manchester Ship Canal. quote: \\"For acknowledging an area's past while providing retail and services for today. Trafford Centre's architecture is inspired by classicism, while the food court is anchored by a travelling steamship that acknowledges the Industrial Revolution development of the city.\\" Ten per cent of the UK population live within a 45-minute drive of the shopping centre, which attracts more than 35 million visits annually. It has Europe's largest food court in The Orient and the UK's busiest cinema, attracting more than 28,500 visitors each week. There are over 11,500 car parking spaces. The Trafford Park Line forms a direct Metrolink tram connection from the Trafford Centre to Manchester city centre via - construction began in 2016, and the extension opened on 22 March 2020. History Trafford Centre, bottom of the image, was built on land previously owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company Satellite image of the Trafford Centre Manchester City Council retained seats on the board of the Ship Canal Company until the mid-1980s. By then the arrangement had become \\"meaningless\\", as the majority of the company's shares were controlled by property developer, John Whittaker. Crucially, the council were powerless and Peel held voting rights due to majority shareholding. In 1986, the council gave up all but one of its seats for a payment of ¬£10 million and extricated itself from a possible conflict of interest, as Whittaker was proposing to develop the large out-of-town shopping centre on company land at Dumplington, which became the Trafford Centre. Manchester City Council opposed the development, believing it would impact negatively on the city centre economy, but accepted it was \\"obviously in the interests of the shareholders\\". The company paid ¬£7 million in cash and ¬£3 million was invested in a joint venture company, Ship Canal Developments, set up by Whittaker and the council to provide resources and development expertise for the regeneration of east Manchester. Peel Holdings submitted a planning application to Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council for a development on approximately 300 acres of land in 1986. The application was \\"called in\\" by the Secretary of State for the Environment and legal disputes ensued requiring two public inquiries before planning permission was granted. Issues involved congestion on the M60 orbital motorway, and some believed the development would have adverse consequences on shopping centres throughout Greater Manchester region and beyond. Planning permission was granted in 1993 before being rejected by the Court of Appeal. It was reinstated in 1995 when the House of Lords gave approval for the development.http://www.poptel.org.uk/trafford.park/7.HTM Construction began in 1996 and the centre opened on 10 September 1998 becoming the UK's first \\"mega mall\\" which combined retail, dining and leisure facilities. On opening, the Trafford Centre was the largest shopping centre in the UK but lost the title to Bluewater in Kent in 1999. However, due to numerous expansions since 2006, the Trafford Centre is now larger than Bluewater. Due to further expansions at the Metrocentre in Gateshead, it has once again been reduced to the second largest of its kind in the UK. The Peel Group sold the centre to Capital Shopping Centres (CSC) in January 2011 for ¬£1.6 billion and John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Group, became deputy chairman of CSC. Peel owner John Whittaker later said the company could have sold the centre for over ¬£2 billion if they had received cash but the ¬£1.6 billion deal remained the largest property transaction in British history, and the biggest European property deal of 2011. The Trafford Centre is valued at ¬£1.7 billion by its owners, Capital Shopping Centres, and has an annual income of ¬£85.3 million, a ¬£400 headline rent and has an ABC1 visitor percentage of 71%. The centre was re-branded as intu Trafford Centre in mid-February 2013 by parent group Capital Shopping Centres, at a cost of ¬£7 million, and all remaining centres owned by that company followed suit. On 26 June 2020, the Trafford Centre's owner, Intu Properties, entered administration although the Centre was operationally unaffected and remained open. The Trafford Centre was widely recognised as the prime asset in Intu's portfolio of 17 shopping centres with a valuation of ¬£1.65 billion. It is expected that the centre will be sold at a later date with interest from British Land and Peel Group. The centre was put up for sale on 13 August. Architecture Looking up into the main dome of the Trafford Centre, decorated at a cost of ¬£5 million The Trafford Centre's unorthodox style of architecture was prompted by the wish to offer a unique shopping experience. John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Holdings, had to convince architects that a lavish design would not alienate shoppers. Peel Holdings were keen to avoid the problem that afflicts many shopping centres after years in use whereby they become dated and stale, this has become a problem for many dilapidated shopping centres in the United Kingdom that were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Although the extravagant Rococo and Baroque design may be viewed as gaudy the prospect of the shopping centre ageing and becoming dated is greatly mitigated. The design was a collaboration between the architectural practices of Chapman Taylor and Manchester-based Leach Rhodes Walker. The construction contractor was Bovis Lend Lease, with structural engineering services provided by the WSP Group. Such was the size and detailing of the building, architects ended up producing over 3,000 separate shop drawings on the drawing register and the construction process required twenty-four chartered architects to work on the project full-time to monitor the construction and interior design process. The centre has four main areas across two floors, Peel Avenue, Regent Crescent, the Dome, and the Orient, and was designed so that visitors enter on both main shopping floors in equal numbers. This avoids the problem where visitors do not visit the upper floors and retailers avoid upper floor units. The ODEON Cinema is on the third floor along with other leisure facilities such as Laser Quest. The Trafford Centre was built to be \\"future-proof\\" in the words of developer John Whittaker with the infrastructure for an additional fourth floor built during construction. The Trafford Centre is Rococo/late Baroque in design, with eclectic elements of Art Deco and Egyptian Revival. It is decorated primarily in shades of white, pink and gold with ivory, jade and caramel coloured marble throughout. There are three domed atria along the length of the mall, and Peel claim the middle dome is bigger than that at St Paul's Cathedral. The central dome cost ¬£5 million to construct. The Trafford Centre has 45,000 square metres of marble and granite flooring from Montignosa and Quarlata in Italy at a cost of ¬£5.8 million (1996 value) and gold leaf adorns the building's columns. The marble floors and handrails are polished nightly to maintain the centre's opulent appearance. The Trafford Centre has features which pay homage to the local area and North West England. The Orient food hall is themed around a steam ship, paying homage to the Industrial Revolution and the nearby Manchester Ship Canal. The Lancashire Rose also permeates the d√©cor on window panes and interior cornices. Mythical griffin statues adorn the exterior, the heraldic symbol of the de Trafford baronets who historically owned much of the land in modern-day Trafford. Others, however, have criticised the deception of the fake palm trees and neo-classical decorative pillars which are not made of marble but decorated medium-density fibreboard. Architecture critic John Parkinson-Bailey described the Trafford Centre as a building which \\"will not appeal to purists\\" and the range of interior architecture as \\"bewildering\\". The Peel Group say that the striking and extrovert architecture is aimed at providing visual delight, to make the visitor's shopping experience more vivid. Since it opened in 1998, advances have been made in lighting design and efficiency such as the growth of LED lighting. Since 2009, incandescent light bulbs have been phased out in favour of LED lighting allowing different shades of hue as well as greater efficiency. Portraits around the walls of the mall depict members of the Whittaker family, founders of owner Peel Holdings. A Mercedes car belonging to the mother of Peel Holdings' chairman, John Whittaker, is displayed on the first floor mall outside . =Sculpture= A feature of the centre is many statues and other sculptures. There are over 100 figures mainly in the style of classical (Greek and Roman) or Art Nouveau statues and decorations, particularly in Barton Square and the connecting bridge to it. In addition there are fountains with sculptures and individually commissioned pieces. Sculptor Colin Spofforth created bronze figures of a jazz band by the New Orleans themed area, and also the Trafford Crest, above the main entrance. This features a griffin, a unicorn and a Roman centurion, based on the arms of the de Trafford family. The centurion is holding two lightning bolts to represent the electricity industry, held to make an X, the Roman numeral for 10.

The Orient incorporates designs from around the world including China, New Orleans, Egypt, Italy, America and Morocco. On two floors, it has restaurants and bars including the Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Five Guys, TGI Fridays, Coast to Coast (Restaurant), Costa, Est Est Est, All Bar One, Nando's and Yang Sing Cathay, Bills, Wetherspoons Mardi Gras, Wagamama. There are several fast food outlets ‚Äì McDonald's, KFC, Subway, Harry Ramsden's and Pizza Hut among others. Burger King moved into the Trafford Centre in November 2011. There is also a giant screen which is used for advertising and events. Great Hall =Great Hall= The Great Hall opened in March 2007, although a Costa Coffee outlet opened earlier in January 2007. This glazed structure houses five restaurants and cafes. Construction took 18 months at a cost of ¬£26 million. It houses a sweeping staircase featuring hundreds of metres of marble balustrade from China and what the centre claims to be the largest chandelier in the world. It was designed by English lighting consultants and manufactured in China; assembly and installation was done by local contractors. The chandelier has three levels of plant walkways inside, is around 11 m (36 feet) wide and 15 m (49 feet) high, weighs around five tonnes. Facilities =Shopping= Peel Avenue Shops inside the centre Peel Avenue is home to high street shops such as an Apple Store, H&M;, and Boots and department stores, John Lewis which opened in 2005 the four-storey Marks and Spencer, Selfridges and Debenhams. The retail unit now occupied by John Lewis was previously a market-themed area for independent stores named the Festival Village. Marks and Spencer has an outside entrance to the foodhall. The dome in the middle of the centre is home to more upmarket stores such as the first Selfridges outside London. Regent Crescent Regent Crescent is home to stores such as Karen Millen, Jane Norman and Gap. It also houses Waterstones bookshop, and Debenhams. Other lifestyle and fashion retailers include Reiss, Mango, Monsoon, Coast, French Connection and All Saints. The crescent leads down to the main dome. Barton Square Entrance to Barton Square Planning permission was granted for further expansion in October 2005. Construction started in November 2006 Barton Square covering cost ¬£70 million, opened on 20 March 2008. Its name relates to Barton-upon-Irwell and Peel's City Airport & Heliport, which was originally Barton Aerodrome. It is linked to the centre by a glazed bridge. Its architecture is based on an Italian square and includes a large fountain and a campanile tower. Within Barton Square This section of the centre targets high-quality homewares market with units offering furniture, kitchens, bathrooms and home furnishings. Retailers operating are Next Home, BHS Home (which closed in 2016), Dwell, Laura Ashley and M&S; Home (since closed). A further 630 free parking spaces have been provided. Barton Square has struggled to be economically viable since its opening in 2008. In 2009, it made an accumulated loss of ¬£512,000 and this worsened in 2010 to ¬£1.3 million. To entice shoppers from the main mall, new facilities such as a Legoland were built. In 2011, planning permission was approved to add an additional level of retail to Barton Square as well as a glazed barrel vaulted roof similar to the one that covers the main mall. The ¬£75 million renovation commenced in mid 2018. As part of this, M&S; Home will leave Barton Square when their lease expires in 2018, consolidating their homeware products with the existing Marks & Spencer in the main mall. Primark will open a new anchor store in Barton Square from March 2020. The Primark opening, along with the newly enclosed mall, was delayed due to Coronavirus until 15 June 2020. The first floor extension will eventually create 110,000 sq ft of new retail floor space meaning the Trafford Centre will surpass the MetroCentre as the second largest retail shopping centre in the United Kingdom upon completion. =Leisure= Leisure facilities include a 20-screen Odeon multiplex cinema, a Laser Quest arena, Paradise Island miniature golf, a Namco Funscape with dodgems, bowling and arcade games. The adjacent Trafford Quays Leisure Village has a Chill Factore, Trafford golf centre, a skydiving centre, and an indoor football facility. A Sea Life Centre aquarium opened in Barton Square in June 2013. Future expansion atria Developer John Whittaker, stated in 2011 that it is \\"future proof\\" with areas available on the third floor for possible new developments. After CSC's takeover in November 2010, chief executive, David Fischel, signalled a desire to expand the centre. Immediate plans include constructing a roof over Barton Square and expanding the John Lewis and Marks & Spencer outlets, large anchor stores. Long-term plans include expanding Barton Square retail space, building retail areas on unused land and attracting retailers that currently do not have a presence. Plans include utilising vacant space on upper floors to create new retail opportunities. CSC applied for planning application to increase retail space on the 2nd floor in Barton Square from 18,580m2 to 28,966m2 in September 2011 which would increase the Trafford Centre's retail size from 185,000m2 to approximately 195,000m2. Accommodation Intu Trafford Centre has four hotels on site: * Premier Inn Trafford Centre North * Premier Inn Trafford Centre South * Premier Inn Trafford Centre West * Travelodge Trafford Park Travel and transport Trafford Centre car entrance =Road= The Trafford Centre has 12,500 car spaces and 350 coach spaces and is off the M60 (Junctions 9 and 10). Its popularity has resulted in traffic congestion on the M60's Barton High-Level Bridge, requiring a link road adjacent to the M60 crossing the ship canal on a new lift bridge. All vehicles entering the centre have number plate details recorded via automatic number plate recognition. Since its introduction in 2003 at a cost of ¬£220,000 the system has reduced the number of thefts of and from vehicles to a level described as \\"negligible\\". The ANPR tracks cars which have been used for serious offences and details of any car with such a number plate can then be passed to Stretford Police Station. =Bus= There is a bus station at the west end of the Trafford Centre with services to most towns in Greater Manchester. The most frequent routes are Stagecoach Manchester: * X50: Manchester Piccadilly Gardens - Manchester United - Salford Quays - Trafford Centre * 250: Manchester Piccadilly Gardens - Manchester Metropolitan University - Hulme - Manchester United - Trafford Park - Trafford Centre =Coach park= There is a coach park adjacent to the John Lewis store. =Light rail= The Trafford Centre is served by its own Metrolink tram stop The centre is served by two stops in the Trafford Park Line of the Manchester Metrolink network since its opening in March 2020. The terminating Intu Trafford Centre tram stop serves the west of the centre while the Barton Dock Road tram stop serves the east of the centre and Barton Square. Until 2020, the nearest Metrolink stop to the site was Stretford, and a shuttle bus had historically connected the two. In popular culture The Trafford Centre sponsors Salford Red Devils rugby league club. Shortly after its opening, it was the setting for Shopping City, a BBC2 daytime programme. The Trafford Centre and Trafford Park were featured in the 2008 BBC documentary series, Britain From Above, which highlighted the transition from industry to services. In 2008 the Orient food court was used as a location in the post-apocalyptic drama Survivors. In 2010, the shopping centre was the focal point of the BBC's The Apprentice in which during week 5 both teams had to sell designer clothes in the centre for one day. The Lancashire Hotpots song 'Trafford Centre' is about shopping at the centre at Christmas time.

He was one of the most significant voices in late 20th-century Irish writing and has been called \\"Munster's de facto poet laureate\\". Early life and background Michael Harnett was born in Croom Hospital, County Limerick.Hartnett liked to cite his birth in Croom hospital, as Croom was an area connected with the ancient Gaelic poets Although his parents' name was Harnett, he was registered in error as Hartnett on his birth certificate. In later life he declined to change this as his legal name was closer to the Irish √ì hAirtn√©ide. He grew up in the Maiden Street area of Newcastle West, Co. Limerick, spending much of his time with his grandmother Bridget Halpin, who resided in the townland of Camas, in the countryside nearby. Hartnett claimed that his grandmother, was one of the last native speakers to live in Co. Limerick, though she was originally from North Kerry. He claims that, although she spoke to him mainly in English, he would listen to her conversing with her friends in Irish, and as such, he was quite unaware of the imbalances between English and Irish, since he experienced the free interchange of both languages. When he began school, he claims that he was made aware of the tensions between both languages, and was surprised to discover that Irish was considered an endangered language, taught as a contrived, rule-laden code, with little of the literary attraction which it held for him. He was educated in the local national and secondary schools in Newcastle West. Hartnett emigrated to England the day after he finished his secondary education and went to work as a tea boy on a building site in London. Early writings Hartnett had started writing by this time and his work came to of the poet John Jordan, who was professor of English at University College Dublin. Jordan invited Hartnett to attend the university for a year. While back in Dublin, he co-edited the literary magazine Arena with James Liddy. He also worked as curator of Joyce's tower at Sandycove for a time. He returned briefly to London, where he met Rosemary Grantley on 16 May 1965, and they were married on 4 April 1966. His first book, Anatomy of a Clich√©, was published by Poetry Ireland in 1968 to critical acclaim and he returned to live permanently in Dublin that same year. He worked as a night telephonist at the telephone exchange on Exchequer Street. He now entered a productive relationship with New Writers Press, run by Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. They published his next three books. The first of these was a translation from the Irish, The Old Hag of Beare (1969), followed by Selected Poems (1970) and Tao (1972). This last book was a version of the Chinese Tao Te Ching. His Gypsy Ballads (1973), a translation of the Romancero Gitano of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was published by the Goldsmith Press. A Farewell to English In 1974 Hartnett decided to leave Dublin to return to his rural roots, as well as deepen his relationship with the Irish language. He went to live in Templeglantine, five miles from Newcastle West, and worked for a time as a lecturer in creative writing at Thomond College of Education, Limerick. thumb In his 1975 book A Farewell to English he declared his intention to write only in Irish in the future, describing English as 'the perfect language to sell pigs in'. A number of volumes in Irish followed: Adharca Broic (1978), An Phurg√≥id (1983) and Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn (1984). A biography on this period of Michael Hartnett's life entitled 'A Rebel Act Michael Hartnett's Farewell To English' by Pat Walsh was published in 2012 by Mercier Press. Later life and works In 1984 he returned to Dublin to live in the suburb of Inchicore. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of Inchicore Haiku, a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including A Necklace of Wrens (1987), Poems to Younger Women (1989) and The Killing of Dreams (1992). He also continued working in Irish, and produced a sequence of important volumes of translation of classic works into English. These included √ì Bruadair, Selected Poems of D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair (1985) and √ì Rathaille The Poems of Aodhagh√°n √ì Rathaille (1999). His Collected Poems appeared in two volumes in 1984 and 1987 and New and Selected Poems in 1995. Hartnett died from Alcoholic Liver Syndrome. A new Collected Poems appeared in 2001. √âigse Michael Hartnett Every April a literary and arts festival is held in Newcastle West in honour of Michael Hartnett. Events are organised throughout the town and a memorial lecture is given by a distinguished guest. Former speakers include Nuala O'Faolain, Paul Durcan, David Whyte and Fintan O'Toole. The annual Michael Hartnett Poetry Award of 4000 euro also forms part of the festival. Funded by the Limerick City and County Council Arts Office and the Arts Council of Ireland, it is intended to support and encourage poets in the furtherance of their writing endeavours. Previous winners include Sin√©ad Morrissey and Peter Sirr. During the 2011 √âigse, Paul Durcan unveiled a bronze life-sized statue of Michael Hartnett sculpted by Rory Breslin, in the Square, Newcastle West. Hartnett's son Niall spoke at the unveiling ceremony. Family life He had a daughter Lara (1968) who he wrote a poem about and a son Niall (1971) who he also wrote a poem about.

The original facility (spelled Shoppers' World) is of historical significance as one of the first suburban shopping malls in the United States upon opening in 1951; it was demolished and replaced by the current open-air facility in 1994. The retail park, with the adjacent Natick Mall in Natick, are major components of the Golden Triangle shopping district in the center of MetroWest, situated between Route 9 and Route 30. History and layout Shoppers' World in early 1974 One of the earliest suburban shopping malls in the United States, Shoppers' World (spelled with an apostrophe and possessive \\"s\\" in the plural form) opened on October 4, 1951 with 44 stores, 25,000 people, and State Treasurer John E. Hurley present.\\"Shoppers' World Now Open\\". (October 4, 1951). Framingham News, pp. 1 This futuristic concept mall was designed to be the mecca of suburban shopping between Boston and Worcester, as the area around its original property remains today. At the time the term \\"mall\\" was not yet in use as a term for an enclosed shopping center, but articles about the center spoke of its \\"mall\\", in the original sense of \\"promenade\\" or \\"walkway\\", along which the stores were arranged. The large Jordan Marsh dome on the southern end was the sole anchor store for the mall in the earliest days. The dome was visible from the air and was used on aeronautical charts as a visual reporting point for aircraft approaching Boston's Logan Airport. It was reputed to be the third largest (in diameter) unsupported dome in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and St. Paul's Cathedral in London. There were two long, flanking two-level wings separated by a two-story open courtyard mall surrounded by large, open parking lots. The original design included a multipurpose theater at one end of the mall. Originally called The Cinema, the house contained a large orchestra seating section, a balcony, and a full stage with a fly area for curtain, scenery, and lighting grid. Early stage crews at The Cinema are credited with coining the now-standard industry term Best Boy to describe an assistant to the chief electrician. In addition to movies, in the 1950s the theater was the site of many live summer theater productions such as Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie and George Abbott and John Cecil Holm's Three Men on a Horse. It was the first movie theater in the country to take advantage of the mall parking lots to provide ample parking during evening hours. In later years, The Cinema became strictly a movie house under the ownership of General Cinema. The Cinema would add a second theater in 1963, and two more in 1974. In the mid-1970s, the first two auditoriums were split in half, bringing the Cinema to a total of 6 screens. Later, a Stop & Shop and Jordan Marsh's Basement Store were added to anchor the opposite northern side of the mall. As the mall grew, it eventually took the shape of many newer malls but remained roofless. The mall's layout consisted of a two-level, open-middle, long rectangle shape. However, by having no main roof over the central mall area, customers had to walk outside to get from store to store. To keep people from getting wet in the rain and snow, the mall management covered the perimeter walkways by extending the roof line of the stores all the way around the mall. The lower walkway was covered by the top walkway. To walk between levels, shoppers used three large , wide, paved, covered ramps placed so customers were never too far from one. Kids often ran up and down them (away from consenting parents) as well as rode bikes and skateboards. Throughout the years, the courtyard area always had several areas of interest and events going on. The southern end contained a permanent water fountain with synchronized colored lights and a garden area with seasonal plantings of flowers, picnic tables, and sun umbrellas. In the 1950s, several kiddie rides including a small Ferris wheel, merry-go-round, and a boat ride were in the north end of the courtyard. In 1961, a Stop & Shop grocery store was built at the northwest side of the mall. The store was eventually replaced in the late 1970s by a Toys 'R Us, which remained a tenant until the entire chain was shuttered in 2018. During the holidays, the mall put up decorations that included several giant wooden soldiers around the inner concourse, and artistic flower arrangements and banners. Santa Claus appeared with live reindeer in the courtyard in front of Jordan Marsh Basement Store every Christmas. In the early 1950s, an Easter egg hunt was held, but the practice was abandoned after children searching for the hidden candy eggs tore up shrubbery and landscape in their search. Other zoo animals and many special attractions, like Flipper and spaceship rides, were displayed throughout the year. Automotive events, such as autocross racing and motorcycle riding school took place in the parking lot. In the 1980s, the gazebo area was constructed where the kiddie rides once were. Ragtime and brass bands played regularly by the gazebo in the 1980s and 1990s. Shoppers' World was the first shopping center to have a musical water fountain show, a feature famously used by The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles. The \\"Dancing Waters\\" attraction was based on the fountains at the 1939 New York World's Fair and was programmed to music and colored lights. There was also a train/tram that brought customers around the mall. In 1967, the Jordan Marsh Basement Store was built at the north end of the mall. Jordan Marsh's original main store, located on the south end, had a remote underground entry point in the middle of the parking lot near the bus stop. Shoppers could enter a small enclosure and walk down two flights of stairs to arrive in the lower level of the Jordan Marsh store. Jordan Marsh also had a separate tire store that stood alone across the street on the west side of the mall. The large yellow smokestack on the outer west side originally had \\"Sears\\" written on it but was removed when the store moved to the newer Natick Mall in 1965. Replacement While the mall had enjoyed several decades of success from shoppers and retailers alike, the overall facility was beginning to show its age by the early 1980s. Aside from the additions of the Stop & Shop and Jordan Marsh Basement Store anchors, the original mall itself had changed very little since opening in 1951. In 1983, Shopper's World was sold to Melvin Simon and Robert Campeau, who proposed to replace it with a new enclosed, multi-floor structure with four anchor stores. Construction on the new Shopper's World was slated to begin in late 1980s. However, Robert Campeau's Campeau Corporation went bankrupt before plans could be finalized and the expansion begun. Adding to this, a series of lawsuits over the nature of the project between Simon and Campeau delayed development plans. In 1992, the mall was sold to the Sears real estate division, Homart Development Company. Homart, who also purchased the adjacent Natick Mall property, canceled the expansion plans for both mall complexes and developed two new concepts for a completely rebuilt, enclosed mall on the larger Shopper's World property and a power center at the Natick Mall location. However, one of the major tenants, Filene's, had completely remodeled and expanded its Natick location as part of the former Natick Mall expansion plans and was unwilling to spend more capital on constructing a new building at Shopper's World. In response, Homart reversed the plans and developed the concepts that became the new Natick Mall and Shoppers' World. The original mall's tenants were moved into the Shopper's World complex in 1993, and the mall torn down. A new, modern two-story Natick mall with over 200 stores was built and opened in late 1994. After tenants were moved to the new Natick Mall, the original Shopper's World closed in August, 1994, and demolition occurred in the following months. The new Shopper's World was reopened as a modern, U-shaped power center in 1995. The new Shopper's World (the possessive \\"s\\" was changed to the singular form), a strip mall that features of retail space. Stores include Best Buy, John Harvard's Brew House, Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Chipotle, The Paper Store, Nordstrom Rack, and many others. The center is also home to the first HomeSense in the United States and opened alongside Sierra Trading Post in August 2017, replacing a Sports Authority store. On January 24, 2018, it was announced that Toys \\"R\\" Us' sister store, Babies \\"R\\" Us would be closing as part of a plan to close 182 Toys \\"R\\" Us and/or Babies \\"R\\" Us stores nationwide due to bankruptcy. The Babies \\"R\\" Us store closed in April 2018. On March 14, 2018, Toys \\"R\\" Us announced that they would be closing all 1,795 locations Worldwide, including the Shopper's World Toys \\"R\\" Us location. The store closed on June 27, 2018. Toy City moved in place in September. On November 25, 2019, It was announced that A.C. Moore will be closing all 145 stores, including the one at Shoppers World in Framingham.

It was the 10th mission to and eighth successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 35 crew were the fourth long-duration crew to man the space station.The mission report is available here: http://www.spacefacts.de/mission/english/soyuz-35.htm Cosmonauts Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin spent 185 days in space, setting a new space endurance record. Ryumin had completed a previous mission only eight months before. They hosted four visiting crews, including the first Hungarian, Cuban and Vietnamese cosmonauts. As long-duration crews now routinely swapped spacecraft with incoming crew, the Soyuz 35 craft was used to return the visiting Soyuz 36 crew to Earth, while the resident crew returned in Soyuz 37. Crew =Backup crew= Mission parameters *Mass: *Perigee: *Apogee: *Inclination: 51.65¬∞ *Period: 88.81 minutes Crew launch, station activation Soyuz 35 was launched 9 April 1980 with Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin aboard for a planned rendezvous with the orbiting Salyut 6 space station. The launch followed increased recent activity with the uncrewed space station. An uncrewed test craft, Soyuz T-1, spent several months docked to the station until it was undocked 23 March and deorbited 25 March. Progress 8, an uncrewed supply tanker, was launched almost immediately afterwards, on 27 March, and it docked with the rear dock port of the two-dock facility. Several manoeuvres were carried out by 2 April using the Progress to adjust the station's orbit. Valentin Lebedev had been scheduled to be Popov's flight engineer, but he was disqualified from launch after suffering a knee injury in a trampoline accident. As none of the back-up crew had previous flight experience (required since the failure of the Soyuz 25 mission), Ryumin had been given the choice of replacing Lebedev or delaying the mission. This despite having completed a six-month mission only the previous August. Ryumin's family was upset by this turn of events. The Soyuz 35 crew docked with and entered the space station on 10 April, using the vacant front port. Ryumin read the traditional note left by the previous crew, a note he had written with no expectation he would be the one receiving it. With Salyut 6 now entering its fourth year in orbit, some signs of wear and tear were becoming evident. Ryumin noted that the two viewports in the transfer compartment had lost their transparency. The windows also had many chips in them caused by micrometeoroids and orbital debris. The cosmonauts replaced components of the attitude control system and life support system, installed a new caution and warning system, synchronized the station's clocks with those in the TsUP Mission Control Center, added an storage battery, and used Progress 8 to refill the life support system's oxygen and nitrogen tanks. On 15 April, Progress 8's mission was completed. The crew loaded it with garbage, after which it was undocked and deorbited three days later. Then Progress 9 was launched, docking with the facility on 29 April. The next day, the first- ever transfer of water between a tanker and a Salyut station was completed. Cargo transfers and refuelling operations were completed by 12 May. With this flight, the resupply of the Salyut was complete for the long-duration crew. Minor repair work was carried out by the crew and \\"Lotos\\" was carried out, an experiment involving using special moulds to make plastic items with a quick- setting material. Additional experiments involved production of polyurethane foam, exploring its utility in assembling structures in orbit. Soyuz 36 and Soyuz T-2 crews visit Progress 9 was undocked 20 May, leaving the rear port vacant for the arrival of the next crew. Soyuz 36 was launched 26 May with Valery Kubasov and Hungarian cosmonaut Bertalan Farkas. The flight was originally scheduled for 5 June 1979, but was cancelled due to the Soyuz 33 failure. The launch was a part of the Soviet Intercosmos program whereby guest cosmonauts from allied nations would visit the space station, typically for about a week. Upon boarding, the visiting crew carried out some Hungarian experiments, including one measuring radiation doses received by the crew and another studying the formation of interferon in human cells under weightless conditions. Kubasov and Farkas returned to Earth in Soyuz 35, leaving the resident crew with the fresh Soyuz 36, which they then flew around to the front port of Salyut 6, a maneuver taking about 90 minutes. The rapid switch of ferry vehicles, along with the launch of Soyuz 36 at almost the earliest possible date to allow a crew recovery in the nominal window, caused observers to speculate the secretive Soviets were possibly planning a second Intercosmos mission to recoup the time lost after the Soyuz 33 failure. A launch indeed was soon in the offing, but not the predicted mission. Soyuz T-2 was launched 5 June with Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov on what turned out to be the first crewed mission of the new Soyuz T variant. The craft docked at Salyut 6's rear port the next day. As they were merely testing the Soyuz, the mission lasted just two days after which they departed and returned to Earth. The resident crew carried out repairs of the station's Kaskad attitude control system and performed materials processing experiments. On 1 July, Popov and Ryumin received Progress 10 at the station. Replacement equipment was unloaded from the supply tanker, as were regular crew supplies. Supplies included a Polaroid camera, a color television monitor, and tapes of Soviet pop music. The tanker was undocked from the complex on 17 July after refuelling the station and deorbited 19 July. Also on July 19, Popov and Ryumin sent their greetings from the station to the 1980 Summer Olympics, wishing the athletes happy starts in a live communication between the station and the Central Lenin Stadium where the opening ceremony was held. They appeared on the stadium's scoreboard and their voices were translated via loud speakers. First Asian and Cuban cosmonauts, end of mission Observers anticipated a Cuban Intercosmos mission for the approaching launch window, but were proven wrong when the first Asian cosmonaut, Pham Tuan of Vietnam, was launched aboard Soyuz 37 with Viktor Gorbatko on 23 July. The launch was timed to take advantage of the world's focus on the Soviet Union during the Olympic games. The visiting crew swapped craft and left on the docked Soyuz 36 craft, returning to Earth on 31 July. Pham Tuan's flight also had political implications as he was a decorated flying ace from the Vietnam War and had shot down several American aircraft, a fact that the Soviet media readily pointed out. The mission was interpreted as a subtle means of retaliation against the United States for boycotting the Olympics. The following day, Popov and Ryumin boarded Soyuz 37 and redocked it to the front port, suggesting to observers that another crew's launch was coming shortly. That was not to occur, nor was another Progress supply tanker soon launched. The crew performed a joint experiment with scientists on the ground, using their Yelena-F gamma ray telescope. The experiment was designed to compare measurements with another telescope on the ground, but the weather balloon the experiment was using malfunctioned and thieves stole much of the equipment before ground crews could locate it. The next landing window was now 2‚Äì15 October, suggesting the anticipated Cuban launch would be 24 September, but observers were caught off guard once again when Soyuz 38 was launched 18 September, almost a week earlier than anticipated. Cuban Arnaldo Tamayo M√©ndez, the first space-farer of African descent, was accompanied by Yuri Romanenko into space, the fourth crew to visit the resident crew. The early launch date was intended to allow Cubans to be able to see their countryman overhead. Twenty-seven material processing and medical experiments were carried out by the visiting crew. As the Soyuz 35 crew were returning to Earth soon, the Soyuz 38 crew didn't swap their craft when they returned on 26 September. The launch, therefore, of Progress 11 on 28 September came as surprise to observers, as it was assumed cosmonauts due to return to Earth would not need fresh supplies. Indeed, by the time the Soyuz 35 crew returned on 11 October, the Progress was only partially unloaded. In fact the real purpose of Progress 11 was to boost Salyut 6 into a higher orbit during the six months between crew residencies, since its defective propulsion system could no longer be used. The crew set a new space endurance mark of 185 days, but the record was not recognized by the IAF as it had not exceeded the previous 175-day record by the required minimum of 10 per cent. Ryumin had become by far the most experienced space-farer to that date, with a total of 352 days spent in space over three missions. Unusually, the crew had gained an average of 2 kg during the flight. This was explained by the crew's strict adherence to exercises and diet. By the day after landing, they were able to walk for half an hour. By 15 October, they were playing tennis. Thousands of Earth resources photographs were taken, as were more than 40,000 spectrograms. The fourth Salyut 6 residency was at last a complete success after the numerous technical malfunctions that dogged the first three crews.

The flight was originally scheduled for 5 June 1979, but was cancelled due to the Soyuz 33 failure. They successfully docked at the aft port the day after launching. The flight was the fifth Intercosmos flight whereby guest cosmonauts from Soviet allied nations would visit the space station, typically for about a week. The flight was only the second time a Soviet mission had a civilian commander. Upon boarding, the visiting crew carried out Hungarian experiments, so many that the visiting crew sometimes only got three hours of sleep. One experiment was Pille, which measured radiation doses received by the crew with miniature thermoluminescent devices attached to their clothing and to the walls of the station. Another three experiments studied the formation of interferon in human cells under weightless conditions. Earth resources work using the on-board cameras were carried out, in coordination with ground crews, airplanes and helicopters. Farkas was said by the Hungarian press to have adjusted far quicker than Kubasov to the weightless conditions. The Soyuz craft was used to boost the station's orbit on 29 May, then Kubasov and Farkas swapped Soyuz craft with the long-duration crew, exchanging seat liners, pressure suits and personal items, before departing the station in Soyuz 35 on 3 June and landed 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The Soyuz 36 spacecraft was later used to return the crew of Soyuz 37 to earth.

He threw and batted right-handed. He played for the Florida Marlins, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Boston Red Sox, the Atlanta Braves, the Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants and Cincinnati Reds. Born in Barranquilla, Colombia, Renter√≠a was signed by the Florida Marlins in 1992. He debuted with them in 1996, and he finished second to Todd Hollandsworth in Rookie of the Year Award balloting. In 1997, his RBI single off Charles Nagy in the eleventh inning of Game 7 of the 1997 World Series won the first World Series in Marlins' history. He was selected to his first All-Star Game in 1998, and he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals following the season. He was the starting shortstop for the Cardinals for six years, and he was selected to the All-Star Game in 2000, 2003, and 2004. In 2002 and 2003 he won the Silver Slugger and Gold Glove Awards. Following the 2004 season, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. After a year with them, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves. He was selected to another All-Star Game in 2006, but following the 2007 season he was traded to the Detroit Tigers. After 2008, he became a free agent, and he signed with the San Francisco Giants. In the 2010 World Series, Renter√≠a won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award after he hit game-winning home runs in Game 2 and Game 5. He became a free agent again after the season, and he signed with the Cincinnati Reds. Early years Renter√≠a was born on August 7, 1975, in Barranquilla, Colombia. As a youth, he attended Instituto Los Alpes High School in Barranquilla. After high school, he was signed by the Florida Marlins at the age of sixteen by scout Levy Ochoa. Playing career =Minor leagues= Renter√≠a started his professional career in 1992 with the Gulf Coast League Marlins. He had a .288 batting average and 47 hits in 43 games that year. However, his fielding percentage was only .897, and he made 24 errors. In 1993, he played for the Kane County Cougars of the Midwest League. He only batted .203 in 116 games with them, but he only committed 34 errors that year, and his fielding percentage increased to .934. In 1994, Renter√≠a was promoted to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League. His average went up to .253 and his fielding percentage climbed to .959. 1995 saw Renter√≠a have a breakout season with the Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League. He batted .289 with them, and he hit seven home runs and stole thirty bases. Entering the 1996 season, Baseball America ranked Renter√≠a as the best prospect in the Marlins' organization. He started the season with the Charlotte Knights of the International League, and he batted .278 with two home runs and fifteen runs batted in in 28 games with them. =Florida Marlins= 1996 On May 9, Renter√≠a was called up to the Marlins following an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4‚Äì2 win over the Colorado Rockies, when he entered the game in the ninth inning as part of a double switch. He did not have any at bats in that game, though, and he was just a backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Renter√≠a replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3‚Äì2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game for the first time on June 10 in a 5‚Äì2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3‚Äì2 loss. Renter√≠a did so well as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Renter√≠a strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5‚Äì3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in .

In Game 1 of the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), Renter√≠a's RBI single in the bottom of the ninth off Roberto Hern√°ndez gave the Marlins a 2‚Äì1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The Marlins swept the Giants in the series and defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to face the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. In Game 7, with the score tied at two and two out in the eleventh inning, Renter√≠a hit an RBI single off Charles Nagy to score Craig Counsell. The hit won the game 3‚Äì2 and won the first World Series in Marlins' history. 1998 In 1998, Renter√≠a had a .302 batting average by the All- Star break, and he was the only Marlin selected to the MLB All-Star Game. His RBI single in the eleventh inning on May 1 gave the Marlins a 6‚Äì5 victory over the San Diego Padres. He had a fourteen-game hitting streak from June 8 to 22, which was the longest by a Marlin in 1998.

He had four hits again on August 31 in an 8‚Äì1 victory over the Marlins. On September 5, he stole four bases in a 13‚Äì9 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit ten home runs in a season for the first time when he homered on September 10 in an 11‚Äì5 win over Pittsburgh. Renter√≠a finished the season with a .275 batting average. He led the Cardinals with 154 games, 585 at-bats, 161 hits, 36 doubles, and 37 stolen bases (which was also the seventh most in the National League). 2000 In 2000, Renter√≠a had a .273 average by the All‚ÄìStar break, and he was selected to the All‚ÄìStar Game to replace teammate Mark McGwire, who was injured. He homered in three straight games from April 9‚Äì11, and he set a new career high on the eleventh with four RBI in a 10‚Äì6 victory over the Houston Astros. On April 16, he reached base five times in a 14‚Äì13 loss to Colorado. On August 29, he hit his sixteenth home run of the year in a 3‚Äì1 loss to the Marlins. The home run broke Solly Hemus's record for most home runs by a Cardinals' shortstop. On September 4, his three-run triple gave the Cardinals a 4‚Äì2 win over the Expos. He finished the season with a .278 batting average and 156 hits in 150 games. He led the Cardinals with 21 stolen bases, and his 76 RBI were the second most by a Cardinals' shortstop (in 1921 Doc Lavan had 82). His 76 RBI were also second only to Jim Edmonds's 108 that season, and he led the team with 32 doubles. He also won the National League's Silver Slugger Award for a shortstop. The Cardinals made the playoffs and swept the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, but they were defeated in five games by the New York Mets in the NLCS. 2001 On April 4, 2001, Renter√≠a went three-for-five and hit a 432-foot home run off Denny Neagle in a 13‚Äì9 loss to Colorado at Coors Field. On April 18, he walked and scored the winning run on a wild pitch by Randy Johnson in a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had a pinch hit single on May 10 against Pittsburgh that provided the winning run in an 11‚Äì5 victory. His RBI single off John Rocker of Cleveland on July 8 gave the Cardinals a 4‚Äì3 victory. However, his batting average was only .226 by July 26. Renter√≠a batted .299 in his last fifty‚Äìeight games, though, to raise his batting average to .260 by the end of the season. During those games, Renter√≠a had a ten-game hitting streak from August 8 to 17. Renter√≠a finished the season with seventeen stolen bases, which led the Cardinals. In Game 3 of the 2001 NLDS, Renter√≠a hit his first playoff home run, off Brian Anderson of Arizona, in a 5‚Äì3 loss. However, the Diamondbacks defeated the Cardinals in five games on their way to winning the World Series. 2002 Renter√≠a enjoyed a better season in 2002. On April 10, he had three hits (including a game‚Äìtying single in the ninth inning) in a 6‚Äì5 win over Milwaukee. On May 6, he hit his first home run since August 20 of the previous year in a 6‚Äì5 loss to the Cubs.

Two nights after that, he hit two home runs in a 5‚Äì0 victory over the Marlins. On August 18, he hit his first career grand slam to lift the Cardinals to a 5‚Äì1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit another grand slam on September 4 and had a career‚Äìhigh five RBI in a 10‚Äì5 victory over Cincinnati. He finished the season with a .305 batting average and 166 hits, and he won his second Silver Slugger Award. He also won his first Gold Glove Award, and he became the first Cardinals' shortstop to win a Gold Glove Award since Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith won one in 1992. Renter√≠a only batted .194 in the playoffs, but the Cardinals made it all the way to the NLCS, where they were beaten by San Francisco in five games. 2003 On April 13, 2003, Renter√≠a hit two home runs and had five RBI in an 11‚Äì8 victory over Houston. He had four RBI on April 29, in a 13‚Äì3 victory over the New York Mets. He got five hits in a game for the first time on June 12, in an 8‚Äì7 victory over the Boston Red Sox. The next day, Roger Clemens of the New York Yankees struck out Renter√≠a for his four thousandth strikeout on the way to winning his three hundredth game as the Yankees beat the Cardinals 5‚Äì2. Renter√≠a was selected to the All‚ÄìStar Game after he had a .331 batting average by the break, and he became the first Cardinals' player since Delino DeShields in 1997 to have twenty stolen bases before the All‚ÄìStar break. On September 18, he had four hits and five RBI in a 13‚Äì0 win over Milwaukee. He won his second Player of the Week Award after he had twelve runs batted in from September 15 to 21. On September 27, the final game of the season, Renter√≠a became the first NL shortstop since Hubie Brooks in 1985 (and the first Cardinals' shortstop) to have one hundred RBI in a season when he had the game‚Äìwinning RBI in a 3‚Äì2 win over Arizona. He finished the year fourth in the NL in stolen bases (34) and batting average (a career-high .330), and he won a Silver Slugger Award after setting career highs in hits (194) and doubles (47, which set a Cardinal single-season record for doubles by a shortstop, besting Dick Groat's 43 in 1963). He also won a Gold Glove Award, and he became the first Cardinals' shortstop to win Silver Slugger Awards and Gold Glove Awards in back-to-back years. 2004 On April 10, 2004, Renter√≠a had four hits in a 10‚Äì2 victory over Arizona. On June 9, against Mark Prior, he hit his third career grand slam in a 12‚Äì4 victory over the Cubs. He had a ten-game hitting streak, his best of the year, from June 22 to July 3. During the streak, on June 26 against the Kansas City Royals, his RBI single in the tenth inning gave the Cardinals a 3‚Äì1 victory. Also, on July 2, he scored four runs in an 11‚Äì2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. He was one of three Cardinals selected to the All‚ÄìStar Game. He had four hits again on July 15 in a 7‚Äì2 win over Cincinnati. On August 8, he had five hits in a 6‚Äì2 win over the Mets. He had five RBI on August 22 in an 11‚Äì4 victory over Pittsburgh. Renter√≠a finished the year with a .287 batting average, and he had ten home runs, 72 RBI, and 84 runs. The Cardinals made the World Series that year, but they were swept by Boston. Renter√≠a was the final batter of a World Series for the second time in his career, when he grounded out against Keith Foulke to end Game 4 as the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. However, he was one of only three Cardinals position players to bat above .250 in the Series as he batted .333. Following the year, he became a free agent. =Boston Red Sox= On December 17, the Boston Red Sox signed Renter√≠a to a four-year, $40 million contract with an option for 2009 to replace free agent Orlando Cabrera at shortstop. On April 14, he hit his first home run with the Red Sox off Randy Johnson of the Yankees. His double in the eighth inning of that game was the game winner in an 8‚Äì5 victory for Boston. From May 26 to 29, he had four straight games with at least three hits, the longest streak since George Brett had six (the record) in 1976. During that stretch, on May 28, he went three for three with a grand slam and five RBI in a 17‚Äì1 victory over the Yankees. The next day, he had four hits, including a home run, in a 7‚Äì2 victory over New York. For his efforts that week, he won his third career Player of the Week Award. He set a new career high for hits in a month when he had forty hits in August, second in the major leagues. He had a game-winning single on September 24 off B. J. Ryan of the Baltimore Orioles in a 4‚Äì3 victory. The win moved the Red Sox into a tie with the Yankees for the AL East lead. He scored one hundred runs in a season for the first time when he scored both runs in a 7‚Äì2 loss to Toronto on September 28. He finished the year with a .276 batting average and 172 hits. He struggled defensively, though, as he led the major leagues with a career high 30 errors, and Red Sox fans soon began booing him after he only batted .228 in April. Renteria batted only .231 in the 2005 ALDS as the Red Sox would lose the division series to the Chicago White Sox in just 3 games. The Red Sox were also disappointed with his performance, and on December 8 he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for prospect Andy Marte. Renter√≠a with the Braves in June 2007. =Atlanta Braves= Renter√≠a started 2006 with a 23-game hitting streak (counting the final game of 2005, it was 24 games). The 23-game streak in 2006 was the second longest that year and the longest to open the season since Ron LeFlore started 1976 with a thirty-game streak. He missed nine games after straining his rib cage on April 15 against San Diego, but he was not placed on the disabled list. On May 8, he had four hits and hit two home runs for the first time since 2003 in a 13‚Äì12 win over the Cubs. On July 3, he hit his one hundredth career home run off Anthony Reyes in a 6‚Äì3 victory over St. Louis. He was selected to the 2006 All-Star Game after he batted .318 with nine home runs in the first half of the season. On August 17, he had his first hit in 24 at-bats in a 5‚Äì0 win over the Washington Nationals. He finished the year with a .293 batting average, fourteen home runs, and seventy RBI. His defense also flourished, as he only committed thirteen errors. On Opening Day (April 2) in 2007, Renter√≠a hit two home runs (including the game-winning one in the tenth) in a 5‚Äì3 victory over Philadelphia. He became the third Atlanta Brave to hit two home runs on Opening Day, joining Fred McGriff and Joe Torre. From April 20 to May 12, he had an eighteen-game hitting streak, which was the longest by a Brave in 2007. During the streak, he had four hits for the twentieth time in his career on April 27 in a 9‚Äì7 victory over Colorado. On May 15, he hit two home runs in a 6‚Äì2 win over the Nationals. He had four hits on May 30 in a 9‚Äì3 win over the Brewers. He had five hits for the first time since 2004 on June 16 in a 6‚Äì2 victory over the Indians. On August 3, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time since 1998 after he sprained his ankle the previous day. Renter√≠a returned on August 22, but he returned to the DL a day later when he reinjured his ankle after facing only one pitch. He was activated again on September 7, and he returned to the Braves' lineup the next day. He finished the year with a .332 batting average (tied for third in the NL and a new career high), twelve home runs, and 57 RBI. He was one of only four major league shortstops in 2007 to bat over .300 with over ten home runs and fifty RBI (the others were Derek Jeter, Hanley Ram√≠rez, and Miguel Tejada). However, because of the emergence of shortstop prospect Yunel Escobar, Renter√≠a was traded to the Detroit Tigers on October 29 for Jair Jurrjens and Gorkys Hern√°ndez. =Detroit Tigers= Renter√≠a batting for the Tigers on March 31, 2008. On April 16, 2008, Renter√≠a hit his fifth career grand slam and had five RBI in a 13‚Äì2 victory over the Indians. He had four hits on April 22 in a 10‚Äì2 win over the Rangers. He had four hits again and five RBI in a 12‚Äì8 victory over Seattle on May 20. He hit his sixth career grand slam on June 7 in an 8‚Äì4 victory over the Indians. On June 17, he had his two thousandth hit (off Jonathan S√°nchez) in a 5‚Äì1 victory over San Francisco. He finished the year with a .270 batting average, 136 hits, and ten home runs. After the season, the Tigers declined his option on October 30, and they chose not to offer arbitration on December 1, which made him a free agent. =San Francisco Giants= 2009 On December 4, 2008, Renter√≠a signed a two-year, 18.5 million dollar deal with the San Francisco Giants with an option for 2011. He had five RBIs and became the first player to hit a grand slam off Jake Peavy in an 8‚Äì3 victory over San Diego on April 21, 2009. On April 29, he had four hits in a 9‚Äì4 victory over the Dodgers. He tied an eventual 7‚Äì4 loss to the Mets on May 14 with a single in the eighth inning, but he strained a hamstring advancing to first base and had to leave the game with an injury. He missed six games with the injury before he returned to the lineup on May 22. From May 8 through June 6, despite batting only .250, he reached base safely in twenty straight games. He had a game-winning grand slam on August 30, which gave the Giants a 9‚Äì5 win over Colorado. He missed nineteen of the final twenty games of the season with biceps tendonitis and a sprained AC joint, and on September 26 he had surgery to remove bone spurs and chips from his right elbow. Dealing with injuries all year, Renter√≠a finished the season with a career-low .250 batting average and only 115 hits and 48 RBI. Renter√≠a playing for the Giants in June 2009 2010 On April 7, 2010, Renter√≠a had five hits (in five at-bats) in a 10‚Äì4 victory over Houston. He started the season well, as he was batting .320 through April 30. However, on April 30, he was forced to leave a game against Colorado after two innings with an injured groin. After missing four games, he returned to the lineup on May 6, but he left that game after two innings when he reinjured the groin. He was placed on the disabled list the next day. He was activated from the DL on May 22, but, after three games, he strained a hamstring on May 25 and was placed on the disabled list again the next day. He returned to the Giants on June 19. However, he returned to the disabled list on August 11 with a biceps injury received the previous night. He returned to the Giants on September 1, but Giants' manager Bruce Bochy announced that Juan Uribe, who had been playing well while substituting for Renter√≠a at short, would remain the starting shortstop, which made Renter√≠a a reserve player. He had four hits on September 16, in a 10‚Äì2 win over the Dodgers. On September 23, with the Giants trailing San Diego in the NL West, Renter√≠a delivered a speech during a team meeting in which he told his teammates it could be his last year, and he wanted the Giants to make the playoffs. The Giants managed to overtake San Diego, and they did make the playoffs. Renter√≠a finished the year with career- lows in games (72), hits (67), home runs (three, tied with his 1998 total), and RBI (22). During the season, he also began contemplating retirement. 2010 postseason In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Renter√≠a reclaimed a starting role when he started four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3‚Äì0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1‚Äì0 lead. He later added a two-run single in the eighth inning as the Giants won 9‚Äì0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3‚Äì1, Renter√≠a joked with teammate Andr√©s Torres that he was going to hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Renter√≠a hit a three-run home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series- winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Renter√≠a did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Renter√≠a declined. =Cincinnati Reds= Renter√≠a on July 28, 2011 2011 On January 7, 2011, Renter√≠a signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds worth $2.1 million plus another $900,000 in performance bonuses. He began the season as a utility player, since Paul Janish began the year at shortstop. Through 2011, he led all active major league shortstops in career errors, with 272. In 2012, he received interest and offers from multiple teams, including the Milwaukee Brewers, but teams were told that he \\"intends to remain retired.\\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120520&content;_id=31804636&notebook;_id=31804758&vkey;=notebook_mil&c;_id=mil =Retirement= On March 22, 2013, Renter√≠a formally retired from Major League Baseball. =Career Statistics= In 2,152 games over 16 seasons, Renter√≠a posted a .286 batting average (2,327-for-8,142) with 1,200 runs, 436 doubles, 29 triples, 140 home runs, 923 RBI, 294 stolen bases, 718 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .398 slugging percentage.

He is general director and artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre, chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic and artistic director of the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg. Early life Gergiev, born in Moscow, is the son of Tamara Timofeevna (Tatarkanovna) Lagkueva and Abisal Zaurbekovich Gergiev. He and his siblings were raised in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia in the Caucasus. He had his first piano lessons in secondary school before going on to study at the Leningrad Conservatory from 1972 to 1977. His principal conducting teacher was Ilya Musin (–ò–ª—å—è –ú—É—Å–∏–Ω), one of the greatest conductor- makers in Russian musical history. His sister, Larissa, is a pianist and director of the Mariinsky's singers' academy. Career In 1978, Gergiev became assistant conductor at the Kirov Opera, now the Mariinsky Opera, under Yuri Temirkanov, where he made his debut conducting Sergei Prokofiev's War and Peace. He was chief conductor of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra from 1981 until 1985 ‚Äì the year he made his debut in the United Kingdom, along with pianist Evgeny Kissin and violinists Maxim Vengerov and Vadim Repin at the Lichfield Festival. Gergiev in Brussels in 2007 In 1991, for the first time, Gergiev conducted a western European opera company with the Bavarian State Opera in a performance of Modest Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov in Munich. In the same year, he made his American d√©but, performing War and Peace with the San Francisco Opera. Since then, he has conducted both operatic and orchestral repertoire across the world. He also participates in numerous music festivals, including the White Nights in St. Petersburg. He became chief conductor and artistic director of the Mariinsky in 1988, and overall director of the company, appointed by the Russian government, in 1996. In addition to his artistic work with the Mariinsky, Gergiev has worked in fundraising for such projects as the recently built 1100-seat Mariinsky Hall, and intends to renovate the Mariinsky Theatre completely by 2010. From 1995 to 2008, Gergiev was principal conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1997, he became principal guest conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. His contract there ran until the 2007‚Äì2008 season, and his premieres included a new version of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, revised and reorchestrated by Igor Buketoff in a manner faithful to Mussorgsky's intentions (unlike the Rimsky-Korsakov revision mostly used for many years until the 1960s or 1970s). In 2002, he was featured in one scene in the film Russian Ark, directed by Alexander Sokurov and filmed at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2003, he initiated and conducted at the Mariinsky Theatre the first complete cycle of Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung to be staged in Russia for over 90 years. The production's design and concept reflects many aspects of Ossetian culture. Gergiev conducted this production in Cardiff in 2006 at the Wales Millennium Centre, in Costa Mesa, California in October 2006 in the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and in July 2007 in Lincoln Center, New York City to great acclaim and completely sold-out houses. In 1988, Gergiev guest-conducted the London Symphony Orchestra for the first time. In his next appearance with the LSO in 2004, he conducted the seven symphonies of Sergei Prokofiev. This engagement led to his appointment in 2005 as the Orchestra's fifteenth principal conductor, succeeding Sir Colin Davis effective 1 January 2007. Gergiev's initial contract with the LSO was for 3 years. His first official concert as principal conductor of the LSO was on 23 January 2007; this was originally scheduled for 13 January, but was postponed due to Gergiev's illness. In June 2011, Gergiev joined the International Tchaikovsky Competition and introduced reforms to the organisation, which included replacing academic judges with notable performers and introduced an openness to the process, arranging for all performances to be streamed live and free on the internet and for the judges to speak their minds in public as and whenever they wished. Since 2015, Gergiev is chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic. On 5 May 2016, Gergiev competed at the Roman Theatre of Palmyra at a concert event called Praying for Palmyra ‚Äì Music revives ancient ruins. It was devoted to the victims who died while liberating Palmyra from ISIS and should emphasize the state of the ancient city.Praying for Palmyra: Russian maestro leads orchestra in ruins of ancient city, rt.com; accessed 14 October 2017. Social and political involvement Valery Gergiev's requiem concert in Tskhinvali, 21 August 2008 In April 2007, Gergiev was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the 10-year classical music outreach manifesto, \\"Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st century\\", to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. After the 2004 Beslan school massacre, Gergiev appealed on television for calm and against revenge. He conducted concerts to commemorate the victims of the massacre. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, Gergiev, who is of partial Ossetian heritage himself, accused the Georgian government of massacring ethnic Ossetians, triggering the conflict with Russia. He came to Tskhinvali and conducted a concert near the ruined building of the South Ossetian Parliament as tribute to the victims of the war.The Times, LSO conductor Valery Gergiev leads defiant South Ossetia concert, 22 August 2008. Gergiev has been, according to Alex Ross in The New Yorker, \\"a prominent supporter of the current Russian regime\\". In 2012, in a television ad for Putin's third Presidential campaign, he said, \\"One needs to be able to hold oneself presidentially, so that people reckon with the country. I don't know if it's fear? Respect? Reckoning.\\"Alex Ross, \\"Imperious: The problem with Valery Gergiev\\", The New Yorker, 4 November 2013. In December 2012, Gergiev sided with the Putin administration against the members of Russian band Pussy Riot and suggested that their motivation was commercial. He told the British newspaper The Independent, \\"I don't think this is anything to do with artistic freedom....Why go to the Cathedral of Christ to make a political statement? Why with screaming and dancing? You don't need to go to a place that is considered sacred by many people ... I am told by too many people that those girls are potentially a very good business proposition. Suppose that someone created all this in order to produce another touring group earning millions and millions? Anna Netrebko (acclaimed Russian soprano) didn't need to do something like this.\\"Adam Sherwin, \\"London Symphony Orchestra director takes sides with Putin against Pussy Riot\\", The Independent, 12 December 2012. In The New Yorker, Alex Ross decried Gergiev's allegation by noting, \\"One member [of Pussy Riot] has been on a hunger strike in a prison camp.\\" In New York City in 2013, the LGBT activist group Queer Nation interrupted performances by orchestras conducted by Gergiev at the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall. The activists cited Gergiev's support for Vladimir Putin, whose government had recently enacted a law that bans the distribution of \\"propaganda of non- traditional sexual relations\\" to minors, as the reason for their actions. In London, the veteran activist, Peter Tatchell, led anti-Gergiev demonstrations. In a public statement Gergiev replied, \\"It is wrong to suggest that I have ever supported anti-gay legislation and in all my work I have upheld equal rights for all people. I am an artist and have for over three decades worked with tens of thousands of people and many of them are indeed my friends.\\" This did not satisfy all of his critics; the novelist Philip Hensher tweeted: \\"Gergiev summarised: 'Some of my best friends are gay. I don't support institutional homophobia. I leave that up to my friend Putin. Writing in The Guardian, Mark Brown wrote, \\"Gergiev's case was not helped by comments he made to the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant on 10 September [2013]: 'In Russia we do everything we can to protect children from paedophiles. This law is not about homosexuality, it targets paedophilia. But I have too busy a schedule to explore this matter in detail. On 26 December 2013, the city of Munich made public a letter from Gergiev assuring them that he fully supports the city's anti-discrimination law and adding, \\"In my entire professional career as an artist, I have always and everywhere adhered to these principles and will do so in the future...All other allegations hurt me very much.\\" Melissa Eddy, \\"Gergiev, With Eye on Munich Job, Responds to Antigay Accusations\\", New York Times, 27 December 2013. In March 2014, he joined a host of other Russian arts and cultural figures in signing an open letter of support for Russia's position regarding Ukraine and the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The letter was posted on the website of Russia's culture ministry on 12 March 2014. In the letter signatories stated that they \\"firmly declare our support for the position of the president of the Russian Federation\\" in the region. However, in September 2015, as he became chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, Gergiev said that he did not really sign the letter to Putin, but only had a phone conversation about it with Vladimir Medinsky. The New York Times reported that Russian artists may have been pushed by the Russian government to endorse the annexation of Crimea. The article specifically mentioned Gergiev, who faced protests in New York City while performing. After Ukrainian public outcry, the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture blacklisted Gergiev from performing in Ukraine. Personal life In 1999, Gergiev married the musician Natalya Dzebisova, more than a quarter century his junior, and a fellow Ossetian. They have three children together, two boys and a girl. From time to time, Gergiev has been reported to be a friend of Putin; they have been said to be godfathers to each other's children, but in a letter to The Daily Telegraph Gergiev rejected this notion. From a past relationship with the language teacher Lena Ostovich, he has another daughter, Natasha. Recordings Gergiev has focused on recording Russian composers' works, both operatic and symphonic, including Mikhail Glinka, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Alexander Borodin, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, Hector Berlioz and Rodion Shchedrin. Most of his recordings, on the Philips label, are with the Kirov Orchestra, but he has also recorded with the Vienna Philharmonic. A recent undertaking, the complete Prokofiev symphonies and the cycle Berlioz, are with the London Symphony Orchestra. Gergiev has recorded the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler with the London Symphony Orchestra; all were recorded live in concert, issued on the London Symphony Orchestra Live label and made available on digital media. In 2009, Gergiev and the Mariinsky launched a Mariinsky Live record label (being distributed by London Symphony Orchestra Live), with the first two recordings featuring music by Dmitri Shostakovich. Gergiev's recording of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet with London Symphony Orchestra on LSO live in 2010 was voted the winner of the Orchestral category and the Disc of the Year for the 2011 BBC Music Magazine Awards. =Discography= Ballets { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size: smaller;

It was the 12th mission to and 10th successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz T-2 crew were the second to visit the long- duration Soyuz 35 resident crew. Soyuz T-2 carried Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov into space. A mission lasting under four days, its primary purpose was to perform a crewed test of the new Soyuz-T spacecraft. Crew =Backup crew= Mission highlights When the visiting Soyuz 36 Intercosmos crew departed Salyut 6 on 3 June 1980 and the remaining resident crew almost immediately redocked the Soyuz craft left behind, observers speculated the secretive Soviets were possibly planning a second Intercosmos mission. The failure of Soyuz 33 the year before had forced the Soviets to juggle their launch schedule. A launch indeed was soon in the offing, but not the predicted mission. Soyuz T-2 was launched 5 June with Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov on what turned out to be the first crewed mission of the new Soyuz T variant. The craft had new engine systems and could launch three cosmonauts. Additionally, the Soyuz was equipped with a new Argon computer which controlled docking and reentry procedures. As the craft approached Salyut 6, solar cells, re-introduced to the Soyuz, were tested. The approach was completed automatically, while the final 180 metres were achieved manually on 6 June. The Argon docking computer had failed, leaving the craft perpendicular to the station. The computer failure was later explained as being caused by the crew and controllers failing to have practiced the particular approach the computer chose. The crew had therefore chose to dock manually to be safe; the computer would have successfully docked if allowed to, said the Soviets. However, failures during the automatic approach was a recurring problem in future Soyuz T missions. During their short stay, Malyshev and Aksyonov seemed to have carried out a minimum of experiments, including participating in some medical tests and using the Salyut's MKF-6M camera. They undocked in the craft they arrived on only two days after first greeting the resident crew. As they left, the Salyut turned around and the Soyuz T-2 crew photographed and visually inspected the space station. The Soyuz then departed and landed about three hours later.

In most areas of the world outside of Brazil, a rod√≠zio restaurant refers to a Brazilian style steakhouse restaurant. Customers pay a fixed price (pre√ßo fixo), and waiters bring samples of food to each customer several times throughout the meal, until the customers signal that they have had enough. In churrascarias or the traditional Brazilian-style steakhouse restaurants, servers come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of quality cuts of meat, most commonly local cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and sometimes atypical or exotic meats. The exact origin of the rod√≠zio style of service is unknown, but the traditional story is that this serving style was created when a waiter delivered a meat skewer to the wrong table by mistake but let the guest take a small piece of the meat anyway. Rod√≠zio became increasingly popular in Brazil in the mid-20th century and spread around the world as experienced servers moved to open their own restaurants. In Brazil, the rod√≠zio style is sometimes also found in Italian or more recently Japanese restaurants.. Italian restaurants serving pizza are especially common. Most rod√≠zio courses are served right off the cooking spit and are sliced or plated right at the table. Sometimes, they are accompanied with fried potatoes, fried bananas, collard greens, black beans, and rice (self-served buffet style). In many restaurants, the diner is provided with a colored card. Green, on one side, indicates to servers to bring more meat. Red, on the other side, indicates that the diners have enough meat for the moment. Fare The following foods are often seen at a churrascaria served rod√≠zio style: * Filet mignon chunks wrapped in bacon * Turkey chunks wrapped in bacon (these two are usually two-bite sized) * Sirloin steak (cut semicircular and served in slices) * Roast beef (served like sirloin steak) * Rump cover (called picanha in Portuguese) * Beef short ribs * Lamb * Pork ribs * Chouri√ßo or some other spicy Iberian pork sausage * Chicken hearts * Grilled dark-meat chicken * Grilled pineapple or banana (meant as a palate cleanser between courses) See also * Brazilian cuisine * Culinary art References Category:Restaurants by type Category:Brazilian cuisine ","title":"Rod√≠zio"},{"id":"849639","text":"William Darby was an Anglican Archdeacon in Ireland in the late 18th century.

The PC Weenies was created and launched on the web in October 1998 by Krishna M. Sadasivam, a former electrical engineer. The series has enjoyed success in web and print media. Most notably, The PC Weenies was the first webcomic to appear regularly on CNET. The PC Weenies currently appear in print within Tau Beta Pi's The BENT publication. The comic has also appeared within print in EE Times, the largest electronic engineering publication in the world. The PC Weenies webcomic also appears regularly on BBspot. Synopsis The PC Weenies follows the life of the Weiner family, a household of technology geeks. The main character is the 40-year old Bob Weiner who loses his job in the tech industry and searches for a new one, all the while dealing with his family and the rapidly advancing computer industry. Development In 1998, Sadasivam first considered the idea of creating a webcomic about a family of computer geeks while taking a shower; less than a week later, he uploaded the first page of The PC Weenies. Sadasivam initially worked with a multi-panel layout for his webcomic, but switched over to single-panel cartoons after a few weeks and stuck with this format for eight years. According to Sadasivam, creating The PC Weenies involves doing research, as he reads technology news websites and blogs in order to comment on the latest developments. Sadasivam released a print collection of his webcomic under the title PC Weenies: Rebootus Maximus in 2009. Sadasivam announced the end of The PC Weenies in May 2011. Among the reasons for the webcomic's conclusion, Sadasivam cited that he desired to focus on illustration, that his audience had been plateauing, and that he had to deal with several large emergency bills at the time. On his website, he wrote that \\"the time I spend on making the comic could be better spent on other income-generating areas, and right now I have to do what‚Äôs best for my family.\\" The webcomic has since resumed.

Cohen (born 1952) is a Christian psychotherapist and author associated with the ex-gay movement. He is a co-founder of Positive Approaches to Healthy Sexuality (PATH). In 2002, Cohen was expelled from the American Counselling Association for multiple violations. Cohen entered into an arranged marriage in 1980 and claims to have been \\"exclusively heterosexual\\" since 1987, after affairs with men even as he publicly portrayed himself as a \\"former homosexual\\". He is author of Alfie's Home, a children's book which depicts childhood sexual abuse as the \\"cause\\" of a boy's same-sex attractions, a fringe theory which has not been supported by recent scientific research which shows that gay men are more likely to be targeted in childhood for their gender nonconformity. Medical institutions warn that conversion therapy is ineffective and may be harmful, and that there is no evidence that sexual orientation can be changed by therapeutical treatments.: \\"As noted previously, early research indicates that aversive techniques have been found to have very limited benefits as well as potentially harmful effects.\\" The available penile plethysmograph studies which measured mens self-reports of sexual orientation change against their actual genital response to imagery has found all were still attracted to men and not women. In a 2000 position statement, the American Psychological Association (APA) opposed all clinical attempts to change an individual‚Äôs sexual orientation, and stated that ‚Äú‚Ä¶there are no scientifically rigorous outcome studies to determine either the actual efficacy or harm of \\"reparative\\" treatments.‚Äù Biography Cohen was born into a Jewish family in Philadelphia. While attending Boston University, he became an evangelical Christian, and later joined the Unification Church. In 1980, Cohen married Jae Sook, a South Korean woman, and in 1995, Cohen and his family left the Unification Church. During adolescence, Cohen reportedly spent \\"years in intensive psychiatric treatment unsuccessfully trying to become straight\\". thumb Cohen identified as gay during his undergraduate years at Boston University. He sought counseling for his unwanted same-sex attractions. He says he has been heterosexual since 1987, to which he credits resolution of underlying issues. He then became involved in the ex-gay movement. Cohen received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Boston University and a Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology from Antioch University. Cohen has authored several self-published books, his most recent, Healing Humanity: Time, Touch and Talk was published in 2019. Career = International Healing Foundation / Positive Approaches to Healthy Sexuality = Cohen founded the International Healing Foundation (IHF) in 1990, a nonprofit organization, to counsel those who experience unwanted same-sex attraction (SSA) through Sexual Orientation Therapy. IHF was dissolved in 2015. In 2003, Cohen co-founded Positive Approaches to Healthy Sexuality (PATH), which promotes \\"the individual's right of self-determination, and equality, tolerance and diversity for all views of sexuality and gender identity.\\" Cohen has said, \\"If someone wants to live a gay life, that needs to be respected. If someone wants to resolve unwanted same-sex attraction, that too needs to be respected. Let us practice true tolerance, real diversity, and equality for all.\\" While he was a psychotherapist in Washington State, Cohen was a registered counselor. During his therapeutic practice in Maryland, there was no licensure requirement for counselors until the time he was transitioning to full time teaching. Over the past twelve years, Cohen has trained over 6,000 psychologists, psychotherapists, physicians, and ministry leaders throughout the USA, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. =Expulsion from the ACA= In 2002, Cohen was expelled from the American Counseling Association (ACA)., American Counseling Association.

Founded in 1927, it was owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers. It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by three brewing companies, Molson, Labatt and Sleeman, which are owned by multi-national corporations. It is also partially owned (under 0.02%) by 30 Ontario-based brewers.http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us \\"The Beer Store\\" Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices,\\"Master Framework Agreement\\" Ontario Ministry of Finance subject to LCBO price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.Flanagan, Greg (February 10, 2014) [www.thebeerstore.ca/.../default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf \\"TBS Alcohol Deregulation\\"], retrieved May 02, 2017 Under Ontario's Liquor Control Act, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities. The act and the company's articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell \\"hard liquor\\" (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries). Amendments made to the Liquor Control Act have since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at select supermarkets in Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of \\"beer commons.\\"Flanagan, Greg. (2014) Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario. A 2013 Angus Reid survey commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Stores Association found that only 13% of Ontario residents were aware that \\"The Beer Store monopoly is not a government-owned enterprise.\\" The Beer Store operates approximately 450 outlets in Ontario and made a gross profit of about $396-million in 2016.https://spiritandoak.com/2019/05/03/a-deeper-dive-the-beer-store/, A DEEPER DIVE: THE BEER STOREhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/the- beer-store-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontarios-lucrative- monopoly/article23248112/, The Beer Store: Everything you need to know about Ontario's lucrative monopoly In early June 2019, the provincial government passed legislation to terminate its 10-year contract with the company, six years prior to expiry; continued negotiations with TBS were underway prior to actual enactment of the legislation. This step was a prelude to making beer widely available in variety stores in Ontario. Company A Beer Store shop. The Beer Store in Richmond Hill The Beer Store follows an open ownership model whereby any qualifying brewer is allowed the opportunity to become a Beer Store shareholder, but three multi-national own the vast majority of shares: Molson-Coors, Labatt (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) and Sleeman (owned by Japan's Sapporo). Some smaller brewers also own shares, making the company a consortium of 30 Ontario based brewers. In order to qualify, the brewer must operate at least one facility in Ontario, conduct the full brewing process and sell beer through the corporation. Valid Ontario and Canadian manufacturing licenses are required and the brewer must not produce beer in any other jurisdiction, or else meet minimum annual capacity and production goals.Master Framework Agreement (September 22, 2015) The Beer Store is governed by the Liquor Control Act (LCA) and is therefore regulated by the LCBO.Liquor Control Act, RSO 1990, c.L.18 As of December 2016, the company operates over 450 retail stores which sell beer to the general public. This makes The Beer Store (TBS) the largest distributor of domestic beer in Ontario, selling to over 20,723 licensed customers. Although many imported beers are available at the Beer Store, the LCBO serves as the primary importer. Once imported, the product is then sold to the Beer Store for further distribution. As the primary retailer of Ontario, The Beer Store sells more than 720 brands of beer and over 1,000 home consumer beer selling units from 180 different brewers around the world.The Beer Store (August 16, 2017) Larger Beer Store outlets typically stock around 600 beer selling units with the smallest Beer Stores stocking around 200 units. TBS has a policy of accepting any brewer in the world to sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO. Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in. Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies.Shareholders Agreement: Brewers Retail Inc. (January 1st, 2016) Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectoliters a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectoliters of beer produced that year. Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectoliters a year are now provided with 2 free guaranteed product listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores. Currently, workers are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 12R24 union. History The company began in 1927, with the end of prohibition in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be unsuccessful, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other Canadian provinces), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail/The Beer Store. The Beer Store today A truck for The Beer Store =Operating Model & Pricing Market= The Beer Store claims that it operates on a self-sustaining basis as an efficient distributor and retailer of Beer in the Province of Ontario.TBS Financial Statements Operations take place on a fee for service basis, requiring brewers to pay a fee to sell their products through the Beer Store. The Beer Store publishes an annual rate sheet outlining their necessary financial requirements and consistency with annual budget and business plans. The open nature of the Beer Store combined with pricing freedom for individual brewers is claimed to have created a highly competitive beer pricing market. The Beer Store processes hundreds of price changes every month and the average retail selling price in the system has only increased 2.8% from 2003 to 2014 while the general rate of Ontario inflation over the same period was approximately 20%. Ontario's uniform pricing regulation precludes price competition between beer retailers such as the LCBO and the Beer Store. Price competition between individual brewers and brands within the Beer Store system is claimed to be significant, but there is little real competition as there is little variance in price both over time and between brands of similar quality. The system does benefit remote areas in that lower-priced products are not restricted to larger outlets in urban centers, but are available at all Beer Store locations throughout the province. Hence rural consumers benefit as much (or as little) as urban consumers. =Estimated profits= The Beer Store states it operates as a not-for-profit entity. While this may be true, critics have argued that the TBS system is structured to support relatively high prices and profits of the breweries and the detriment of consumers. A series of studies, authored or co-authored by professor Anindya Sen of the University of Waterloo, estimated that the near-monopoly the Beer Store has in Ontario allows its owners to capture between $450 to $630 million in ‚Äúadditional profits‚Äù each year.Sen, Anindya \\"An Economic Analysis of Increasing Competition in Retail Liquor Sales in Ontario: Part I of a Two-Part Study for the Ontario Convenience Store Association\\", June 2013Sen, Anindya \\"An Empirical Analysis of Beer Price Differentials Between Ontario and Quebec: Part II of a Two-Part Study Conducted for the Ontario Convenience Store Association\\", August 2013Sen, Anindya and Masson, Paul R., \\"Uncorking a Strange Brew: The Need for More Competition in Ontario's Alcoholic Beverage Retail System\\", C.D. Howe Institute Commentary No 414, August 2014 The first of the Sen studies was commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Store Association and surveyed six 24-pack domestic brands from IGA and Metro Quebec flyers compared to the same brands at The Beer Store in Ontario over a 22-week period in 2013. Sen corrected tax analysis associated with the original study and added three import brands from a Costco in Quebec in subsequent analysis. Correcting for tax differentials between the two provinces, positive price differences of $1.3 - $3.3 were found to exist between their average price of 24-bottle packs of brands including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Coors Light, Budweiser and Bud Light. Using Molson Canadian as an example, the adjusted 24 pack price from Quebec IGA and Metro flyers was found to be $26.81 versus $28.12 for Ontario TBS locations.[16]Earnscliffe Strategy Group \\"Comparing Beer Prices Between Ontario and Quebec: Comments on the Ontario Convenience Store Association Study\\", November 2013 In response to Sen's analysis, The Beer Store commissioned a survey of Quebec ‚Äì Ontario beer pricing by Debra Aron, an economist with Navigant Economics, which reviewed average TBS home consumer beer prices for all of 2013 in comparison to all beer sales at Quebec seven largest grocery chains, utilizing Neilsen data, for the same period. Aron's study concluded that the average TBS beer prices, excluding all taxes, were 18% less than those at Quebec grocery stores in 2013 or on a per case basis approximately $4.40 less per case of 24 cans.Aron, Debra J., \\"The Price of Beer in Ontario and Quebec\\", May, 2014, Navigant Economics Reports from 2015 indicated that 80% of beer sales in Ontario were made at the 450 outlets of The Beer Store. An estimate published in 2017, provided this summary as to profitability. \\"Add the cost savings together with the extra market share and you get $396-million. That is how valuable The Beer Store is to its owners.\\" =Green policies= Since 1927, the Beer Store has refunded deposits on all empty beer containers purchased in Ontario. In February 2007 the Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP) was launched by the Government of Ontario. The ODRP's goal is to ensure that 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled. All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario's waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher- end recycling supporting Ontario's green economy and generating environmental benefits. ‚ÄúThis success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,‚Äù said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement. As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality glass cullet for Ontario glass manufacturing ‚Äì previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source glass cullet from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013-2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads.http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energyresources/ calculator.html#results Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil). Between 2013-2014, the Beer Store achieved a system-wide recovery and re-use rate of 99 per cent for the industry standard bottles, which are reused 12 to 15 times. The Beer Store has received praise from local and national organizations including the Conservation Council of Ontario, Environmental Defence Canada, The Recycling Council of Ontario, and Toronto Environmental Alliance. TBS‚Äô recycling efforts translate into cost savings for municipal governments as municipalities need not spend tax revenue on recycling packaging that TBS sells. In 2008, TBS estimated that its return program has saved taxpayers $38 million in avoided waste management and recycling program costs per year. In 2012, the TBS estimated that savings had increased to $40 million with 94% of beer containers and 81% of LCBO containers recycled. The Beer Store also is actively engaged in reducing its carbon footprint by finding innovative ways to reduce its energy consumption, a key input for any retail organization, especially one with a need to constantly refrigerate its product. A notable initiative is the use outside air to cool beer when outside temperatures provide for such a tactic. Pierre Sadik, Senior Policy Adviser at the David Suzuki Foundation has stated, \\"Ontarians should be proud of The Beer Store's environmental achievements. It's time businesses across the province follow The Beer Store's lead and turn their talk about waste diversion into real action.\\" =Corporate responsibility= TBS maintains a strict policy of ‚ÄúID 30‚Äù and the right to refuse any customer who appears intoxicated or who is underage. Furthermore, TBS empowers its retail management to actively monitor and track every employee's refusal rate to ensure proper conformance to company policy. In 2017, TBS employee challenge and refusal rates are the following: RETAIL BEER CHALLENGES AND REFUSALS CY17  Jan, 2017 ‚Äì Dec, 2017 # Minors Challenged/asked to produce I.D:3,388,975 # Minors Refused service: 31,983 # Intoxicants Challenged/suspected for being impaired (alcohol/drugs): 13,583 # Intoxicants Refused service for impairment: 10,390 . The Beer Store works closely with Police agencies across Ontario to report suspected impaired driving. Also Retail employees will work with the customer in finding other means of transportation(cab/transit/call a friend) home if suspected they are impaired and refused service, they go the extra step to make sure the customer will arrive alive and not just let them find a way home. =Returns for Leukemia= Since 2006 The Beer Store, UFCW Local 12R24 (the union representing its employees), and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada have partnered together to help raise awareness and funds for blood cancer research through the collection of empty bottles. The bottle drive is formally called \\"Returns for Leukemia\\" but many refer to it as the \\"Leukemia Bottle Drive\\". It is held on the last Saturday of May and is also the world's largest bottle drive. Over the last 13 years, through donations of cash and empties, the event has raised over $15 million for the cause. Proposed cancellation of contract The Ontario government's plan to cancel the contract with The Beer Store as the sole seller of beer in packages exceeding six units, began with legislation tabled in late May 2019. (The ten year \\"Master Framework Agreement\\" was signed in 2015 by the government in power at the time.)https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/ontario-to-end-beer-store-deal- would-pave-the-way-for-beer-in-corner-stores, Ontario moves to end Beer Store contract, paving the way for beer in corner stores The plan has led to some concern, with certain industry sources suggesting that the company will be entitled to significant damages, up to one billion dollars according to some estimates; if so, that would be costly for the taxpayer.https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/05/27/province-tables-legislation- to-cancel-beer-store-contract/, Province tables legislation to cancel Beer Store contracthttps://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/province-wants-to-cancel- beer-store-contract-1.4440333, Province wants to cancel Beer Store contract The government believes that the cancellation is important but has not addressed the concerns raised by the industry. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told the news media that the current monopoly on beer sales in bulk \\"is a bad deal for consumers and businesses and is deeply unfair to the people of Ontario\\". TBS president Ted Moroz issued this statement: \\"The government cannot extinguish our right to damages as outlined in the Master Framework Agreement. It is critical to understand that The Beer Store has, in good faith, based on a legally-negotiated 10-year operating agreement with the Province of Ontario, invested more than $100 million to modernize its stores and to continue to upgrade the consumer experience. [We] will fight this legislation vigorously through the courts...\\".https://globalnews.ca/news/5321606/ford-government-beer-store- contract/, Ford government to terminate contract with The Beer Store; pave way for corner store sales John Nock of the United Food and Commercial Workers union made this statement, \\"We will fight this government and this premier to keep our jobs and to save the taxpayers the billions Ford is willing to pay to put beer in corner stores\\". Ontario Chamber of Commerce President Rocco Rossi wrote to Fedeli stating that the plan to cancel the contract with TBS was a \\"short-sighted approach\\" that could lead to other corporations refusing to contract with the Province. Fedeli dismissed suggestions that the government might be required to pay up to $1 billion as a result of cancelling the contract at this time. The previous government had approved the sale of beer in six packs or less in a limited number of supermarkets in 2018 but the plan to cancel the contract with TBS would provide greater \\"choice and convenience\\" according to Fedeli.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-beer-store- convenience-corner-doug-ford-government-1.5155552, What's at stake in the Ford government's battle with The Beer Store The government passed legislation to cancel the contract in early June but did not immediately proclaim it into law, because negotiations were continuing with TBS about the cancellation process. TBS Board chair Charlie Angelakos believed that negotiations could lead to a \\"mutually acceptable\\" method of increasing the availability of beer in retail locations and could prevent a \\"protracted legal battle and the significant damages to which the government would be exposed\\".https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/06/06/legislation-beer-store- contract-cancellation/, Province passes legislation to rip up Beer Store deal, announces more LCBO stores Criticism =Brewer neutrality= The Beer Store employees are not allowed to recommend one brand over another. Staff can tell customers about the products but cannot encourage customers to choose a specific brand. This policy is known as brewer neutrality. The Beer Store is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries listing fees, for each beer carried in stock, that many critics perceive as substantial. Listing fees have been criticized as restricting competition in the huge Ontario beer market, especially from smaller brewers who often cannot afford the fees, especially for multiple brands. Some Canadian provinces have since allowed privately owned stores to compete for sales of beer and wine while retaining tighter controls over the sale of spirits, while Alberta has privatized all retail liquor stores. In Ontario no changes have been made, and The Beer Store continues to sell over 80% of the beer sold in the province, and is the only entity legally allowed to sell 12-packs, 24-packs, and other large cases. The Beer Store has only limited competition for retail sales of 6-packs and singles with the government-owned LCBO, select supermarkets, and individual brewer retailers, located on-site at most Ontario breweries. Furthermore, the competition is only with respect to location, as prices between supermarkets, LCBO and TBS are kept uniform. Many critics say this constitutes a foreign- owned monopoly. With regards to distribution, TBS operates its own fleet and provides service to over 16,000 licensed establishments in Ontario. TBS also delivers beer to Beer Stores on behalf of brewers who may choose to avoid the high cost of self-distributing. Critics have stated that TBS does not provide any credit terms for licensed clients, forcing them to pay cash on delivery, causing friction between TBS and the hospitality industry. However, TBS does provide credit terms and flexible payment options for customers. Customers may receive up to seven days of credit terms. =Consumer prices= Critics say TBS constitutes a foreign-owned monopoly over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer more in the long run in terms of convenience and price. Critics also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the price of beer will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled ‚ÄúAlcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario‚Äù by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta's deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol price rises have since tripled Ontario's (28.2% vs 9.2%).Flanagan, Greg. (2014) \\"Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario.\\" By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost of beer between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model. =Political controversy= The Beer Store has been subject to criticism following the Molson-Coors merger, whose 49% stake in TBS was the last 100% Canadian-owned share of the venture under the pre-merger Molson Breweries. In 2005, Ontario's alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. A report called the Beverage Alcohol System Review was released on March 24, 2005 by the Ontario Government. However, the report's findings dealt centrally with the LCBO and the economic and social impact of its privatization. An online petition was started by a private citizen, Derek Forward, to ask the provincial government to end the monopoly enjoyed by the Beer Store. The petition has received coverage in the Toronto Star, and has generated enough support to allow it to be formally presented to the provincial legislature in the fall of 2008 for consideration (petition No. P‚Äì146: \\"Practice and arrangement of retailing beer\\"). However, on December 9, 2008, the Ontario government dismissed the petition citing the effectiveness of the TBS system. At the start of the 2007 provincial election campaign, The Brick Brewing Company of Waterloo made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company's statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests. Additionally, Brick claimed that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force what is now Ontario's largest independent brewer to stop offering beer in \\"stubbies\\" by withholding supplies of industry standard \\"long-necked\\" bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry-standard bottle and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed. Brick has since stopped selling beer in \\"stubbies\\" because the cost was too high. A July 2008 Toronto Star article attributed an industry analyst as estimating the three foreign entities that owned TBS earned $1 billion in profit per year in Canada. Ontario Craft Brewers is the main lobby group for Ontario's smaller brewers, and has been increasingly critical of BRI/TBS. The 29 OCB members currently employ several thousand Ontarians. OCB wants to either acquire shares in TBS or be permitted to set up their own competing chain. Premier McGuinty responded by saying that his government would not consider any application to form a competing chain, and that his government would not consider compelling TBS shareholders to sell any shares, although some Liberal and Conservative backbenchers have said they would expect BRI to at least negotiate in good faith with craft brewers who made a serious offer. BRI responded by saying that it was not considering and would not consider selling shares at any price, and that they do more than enough to accommodate non-shareholding brewers already. Canada's National Brewers (the lobby group that represents the BRI shareholders) further said that in the event OCB did get to set up a competing chain, they would refuse to stock their products there. In February 2012, the website Canadian Beer News reported that The Beer Store has made thousands of dollars worth of political donations to the British Columbia Liberal Party and British Columbia New Democratic Party. The report noted that it was odd for an Ontario-based company to be making such large donations to political parties in another province, and suggested that the co-owning breweries were funneling this money through The Beer Store in an attempt to put pressure on the BC government to give their brands favourable placements in BC Liquor stores. In 2015, it signed a contract \\"Master Framework Agreement\\" with the Government of Ontario which required the company to \\"improve the customer experience\\" in its retail outlets. The contract expires in 2025, limits the number of retail outlets permitted to sell beer, and specifies the company will receive a monetary award for breach of contract even if the breach results from a change in government legislation. =Non-competitive business practices= On December 9, 2014, Toronto Star investigative journalist Martin Regg Cohn exposed an agreement between The Beer Store and the LCBO to limit competition, by ensuring that the LCBO would not offer beer products in 12 or 24-pack cases, it would not sell major brands to restaurants or bars, and would inform the Beer Store of any store it was planning to open in a new community. The document, dated, June 1, 2000, and provided to him by a whistleblower, was signed by then head of the LCBO Andy Brandt and head of BRI Daver Perkins, of which a copy was sent to Ministry of Consumer & Commercial Relations Deputy Minister Sandra Lang. In a 2014 report to the government on maximizing assets, former TD Bank CEO Ed Clark stated that the LCBO (and the Government of Ontario) forgoes $515 million of revenue by not allowing sales of larger format beer packages and forgoes $500 million of revenue by not selling major brands to restaurants. Andy Brandt, former highly successful head of the LCBO, was very critical of the agreement, and says it was forced upon him by the then Mike Harris Progressive Conservative government. When Regg Cohn questioned the Beer Store representatives about the agreement, suggesting it is collusion, the reply from the BRI lawyer Michael A. Eizenga of Bennett Jones LLP stated the \\"use of the term 'collusion' which has significant legal meaning,\\" and \\"This is an inaccurate and inappropriate characterization, to which my client objects.\\" Liberal Finance Minister Charles Sousa, in response to these revelations, says he has \\"got the investigation underway\\" and that \\"I'm trying to ensure that what you‚Äôre suggesting doesn‚Äôt happen any further ... You're right, there's a monopoly, a duopoly, oligopoly ‚Äî call it what you will.\\" On December 10, 2014, Restaurants Canada filed an official complaint with the Competition Bureau. \\"'We did not know the depth of the complicity,' it said, pointing to 'new and disturbing information' in the Star that detailed price gouging of restaurants and bars forced to buy from The Beer Store ... A Competition Bureau spokesperson said it is 'reviewing it to determine whether the conduct in question could raise concerns under the criminal or civil provisions in the Competition Act.'\\" On April 15, 2015, Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne announced the Master Framework Agreement‚Äîa 10-year agreement with The Beer Store allowing changes to provincial liquor laws that would, among other changes, allow up to 450 supermarkets in \\"urban population centres\\" (roughly equating the number of Beer Store locations) to be authorized to sell beer subject to conditions, require The Beer Store to improve the placement and marketing of Ontario craft brews, and allow LCBO locations to trial carrying 12-packs. Wynne stated that The Beer Store had become a \\"de-facto monopoly controlled by a small number of companies\\". The new regulations took effect on December 15, 2015 with 58 designated supermarkets, and additional locations to be added in the future; all products must be below 7.1% alcohol by volume, and at least 20% of a store's stock must be Ontario craft brews. Loblaw Companies elected to go beyond the minimum quota and committed to stock 50% Ontario craft brews at its participating stores, in an effort to provide a wider array of options. Current premier Doug Ford is a supporter of private liquor sales. On May 27, 2019, Minister of Finance Vic Fedeli tabled legislation proposing the unwinding of the Master Framework Agreement. Fedeli described the MFA as a \\"sweetheart deal by the previous government\\" for \\"three global giants\\" who were \\"more interested in protecting profits than providing convenience or choice for average people.\\" As map publisher In the 1980s, Brewers Retail published a directory of its retail locations in a booklet with a small map to each location. It had a picture of an animal, (a penguin, for example) on the covers. The booklet when closed was approximately . The 1972 version issued by Brewers Retail had cartography by Rand McNally. In popular culture In the film Strange Brew the McKenzie Brothers visit a Brewers Retail store demanding a refund after they attempt to return a bottle of beer that contained a mouse (the mouse was however placed in the bottle by the brothers). Due to the nature of the scene, Brewers Retail refused to allow the use of one of their actual stores for the filming, and also refused to allow the use of the name \\"Brewers Retail\\". In response, the filmmakers built their own replica store, and called it \\"The Beer Store\\". Coincidentally, several years later, Brewers Retail changed the name of its stores to \\"The Beer Store\\", and they continue to operate under this name. The Beer Store was also showcased in episodes of Late Night with Conan O'Brien during O'Brien's week-long tenure in Toronto during the week of February 10, 2004. Related companies Brewers' Distributor Ltd. (BDL) operates in Western Canada and is owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev and Molson- Coors (Sleeman has its own distribution operation in the West). Unlike BRI, BDL only warehouses and distributes beer and is not in the retail business.

Common scenarios include releasing a genie from a lamp, catching and agreeing to release a mermaid or magical fish; or crossing paths with the devil. The first two wishes go as expected, with the third wish being misinterpreted, or granted in an unexpected fashion that doesn't reflect the intent of the wish.See Isaac Asimov, Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor: A Lifetime Collection of Favorite Jokes (1991), p. 255. Alternatively, the wishes are split between three people, with the last person's wish inadvertently or intentionally thwarting or undoing the wishes of the other characters. An example of the three wishes joke runs as follows: :Three men are stranded on a desert island, when a bottle washes up on the shore. When they uncork the bottle, a genie appears and offers three wishes. The first wishes to be taken to Paris. The genie snaps his fingers, and the man suddenly finds himself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower. The second man wishes that he were in Hollywood, and with a snap of the genie's fingers, he finds himself on a Tinseltown movie set. The third man, now alone on the island, looks around and says, \\"I wish my friends were back.\\"  Variations  One variation on the theme has the protagonist turning the tables on the genie, who for some contrived reason has placed a condition on the wishes that would result in an opponent of the protagonist also benefiting from the wishes. An example of this joke was used in The Simpsons episode, \\"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife\\". There, a character tells Marge Simpson a joke in which a genie promises to grant a man whatever he wishes, with the caveat that the man's wife's lover gets double whatever the man gets. After first wishing for a house and a car, the man wishes to be beaten \\"half to death\\" ‚Äî which Marge doesn't understand. A very early version of the joke is found in an 1875 book of Scottish anecdotes. There, a Scottish highlander is asked what his three wishes would be. He first wishes for a lake full of whisky. His second wish is for a similar quantity of good food. When asked for his third wish, after a moment of indecision, he asks for a second lake full of whisky.A. Hislop, ed., The book of Scottish anecdote (1874), p. 96. Yet another variation is the one where the first wishes go wrong and through the last one, the protagonist(s) end up exactly the way they were from the beginning. An example of this is the following, taken from Charles Perrault's story The Ridiculous Wishes: :A poor starving peasant couple are granted three wishes and the woman, just taking the first thing that comes to her mind, wishes for one sausage, which she receives immediately. Her husband, pointing out that she could have wished for immense wealth or food to last them a lifetime, becomes angry with her for making such a stupid wish and, not thinking, wishes the sausage were stuck on her nose. Sure enough, the sausage is stuck in the middle of her face, and then they have to use the third wish to make it go away, upon which it disappears completely. In fiction The format is not always used for humor. In \\"The Monkey's Paw\\", a horror short story by author W. W. Jacobs, the paw of a dead monkey is a talisman that grants its possessor three wishes, but the wishes come with an enormous price. In the story, the recipient of the monkey's paw wishes for ¬£200, only to learn that his son has been killed in a terrible work accident, for which the employer makes a goodwill payment of ¬£200. Later, the mother asks that the dead son be wished back to life. Upon hearing strange sounds and a knock at the door, the father realizes that the thing outside would be a horribly mutilated body, and wishes it away.

Life and career Maxwell was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Clarence Maxwell and his wife, Emma Ash. Maxwell attended Granite High School. During World War II, Maxwell served as an infantryman in the United States Army (77th Division), where he saw action in the Battle of Okinawa. After the war, Maxwell served for two years as an LDS Church missionary in Canada. While pursuing an undergraduate education at the University of Utah before leaving on his mission, Maxwell met Colleen Hinckley (1928‚Äì2016). After Maxwell returned from his mission, he resumed courting Colleen, and they were married in the Salt Lake Temple on November 22, 1950. They became the parents of four children and had twenty-four grandchildren. Maxwell earned bachelors and masters degrees in political science from the University of Utah. From 1952 to 1956, he worked in Washington DC, first for the US government and then as an assistant to Senator Wallace F. Bennett. Maxwell was a professor of political science at the University of Utah. He also held many administrative roles at the university. He first joined the university staff as assistant director of public relations in 1956. In 1958, he became Assistant to the President. In 1961, he was secretary to the Board of Trustees, followed by dean of students in 1962, and later vice president for planning and public affairs. In 1967, he became Executive Vice-President of the University of Utah. LDS Church service From 1959 to 1962, Maxwell served as bishop of Salt Lake City's University Sixth Ward. He was a member of the General Board of the YMMIA and a member of the Adult Correlation Committee for the next five years. In 1967, Maxwell was called to be one of the first 69 regional representatives, when that position was created.Hugh B. Brown, Conference Report, October 1967. From 1970 to 1974, he served as the tenth Commissioner of Church Education overseeing the Church Educational System. Under his direction, the system received its current name. Maxwell began serving as an LDS general authority in 1974, when he was called as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1976, Maxwell became one of the seven presidents of the seventy, when the calling of Assistant to the Twelve was eliminated. Maxwell was ordained an apostle by N. Eldon Tanner on July 23, 1981, after Gordon B. Hinckley became a counselor in the First Presidency. He was sustained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 3, 1981. As with all general authorities, among his many assignments was to preside over the organization of new stakes of the church. One of the more notable was the Aba Nigeria Stake in 1988, with David W. Eka called as president. This was the first stake in the church staffed entirely by people of African descent. Maxwell wrote approximately 30 books concerning religion and authored numerous articles on politics and government for local, professional and national publications. He was well known for his extensive vocabulary and elegant style of speaking and writing. His highly alliterative talks have always presented a great challenge to translators. During one LDS general conference, the translators had categorized each of the talks to be given into five levels of difficulty. All of the talks were assigned to levels one to four, except Maxwell's. His talk was alone at level five. Commenting on his speaking and writing styles at Maxwell's funeral, church president Gordon B. Hinckley said, Maxwell received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Utah; an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Westminster College, Salt Lake City; an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, Utah; an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Utah State University, Logan, Utah; an Honorary Degree from Ricks College, Rexburg, Idaho; and an Honorary Degree from Salt Lake Community College. The University of Utah established the Neal A. Maxwell Presidential Endowed Chair in Political Theory, Public Policy and Public Service in the fall of 1998. Maxwell's business career included serving as a director of several business firms, including Questar Corporation, Questar Pipeline, and Deseret News Publishing Company. He also was active in public service, including service as chairman of the Utah Constitutional Revision Commission. Maxwell received the Liberty Bell award from the Utah State Bar in 1967 for public service. In 1973, the Institute of Government Service at BYU named him Public Administrator of the Year. Death Maxwell died in Salt Lake City, from leukemia. He was originally diagnosed with leukemia in 1996, eight years before his death. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. According to Hinckley, Maxwell \\"accomplished more in these last eight years than most men do in a lifetime.\\" Maxwell was survived by his wife, Colleen, four children, 24 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. With the death ten days later of fellow apostle David B. Haight, the vacancies created in the Quorum of the Twelve were filled by Dieter F. Uchtdorf and David A. Bednar. The BYU Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts was renamed the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship after Maxwell's death.

S√£o Paulo: Summus, 2008, , page 51 the so-called Proconsult scheme, Maia was to be elected to the national Chamber of Deputies in 1986, and saw re-election in 1990. Meanwhile, having achieved personal political prominence in the late 1980s, Maia broke with Brizola and the PDT, affiliating with the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) in 1991, being elected mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro for the first time in 1992, defeating the Workers' Party candidate, Afro-Brazilian Benedita da Silva in a run-off election, in a campaign that was regarded by some as being driven by racist ideology.During his 1992 campaign, Maia declared Rio to have an \\"image\\" (i.e., a brand) that could not risk being associated to a black woman openly avowing sympathies with the destitute - cf. Michael Mitchell, \\"Racial Consciousness, Afro-Brazilian Electoral Strategies, and Regime Change in Brazil\\", IN Georgia Anne Persons, ed. Race and ethnicity in comparative perspective. The National Political Science Review, Volume 7, 199, , pages 75/76In early 1993, already as mayor, Maia would complain to the Brazil's Foreign Ministry about issuing tourist - as well as political asylum - visas to people from Angola without requiring them to undergo testing for AIDS, as \\"this sudden arrival of thousands of foreigners\\" posed \\" a serious epidemiological risk\\". Cf. James Brooke \\"Haven in Rio Quite Hostile For Angolans\\", The New York Times, July 11, 1993, available at Maia subsequently left the PMDB and joined the Liberal Front Party (PFL). Mayoral career Maia began his first term as mayor in the wake of an episode that mirrored the strained relationship between the social classes in Rio de Janeiro, the so- called arrast√£o (looting-rampage, or \\"dragnet\\") on October the 18th, which saw rival groups of youths from different shanty towns (galeras) and associated with various funk bands (funkeiros) sorting out their differences and going on a looting-spree at Ipanema beach.George Y√∫dice, The expediency of culture: uses of culture in the global era.

Sharpe, 1997, , pages 176/178 Maia ran as a law and order candidate, and after his inauguration tried a \\"no-nonsense\\" attitude, focused on new directions on public administration and urban intervention.

Bogot√°: Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 2005, , page 2,023 Favela-Bairro, however, as much as it was presented as a plan for drastic improvement of actual living conditions, was seen as having failed in one of its chief concerns, that of blurring the boundaries between the \\"formal\\" city and the shantytown: in the words of scholar Janice Perlman, \\"there's still no doubt about where the asfalto ends and the morro begins\\".Perlman, Favela: Four Decades of Living on the Edge in Rio De Janeiro. Oxford University Press, 2010, , page 281 At the same time, by stating that favela residents could have access to proper urbanism if they behaved in an \\"orderly\\" fashion, Favela-Bairro perpetuated the stigma long associated to shantytown dwellers.Nezar AlSayyad, ed., Consuming tradition, manufacturing heritage, 286 Finally, Favela-Bairro was also seem as very limited in scope, as it concerned itself with only 27% of all Rio shanty-towns.Rose Compans, Empreendedorismo urbano: entre o discurso e a pr√°tica.

This method is generally used for cooking large joints of meat or entire animals, such as pigs or turkeys. The rotation cooks the meat evenly in its own juices and allows easy access for continuous basting. History Spitted fowl are rotated by a hand crank and basted with a long-handled spoon in this illustration from the Romance of Alexander, Bruges, 1338-44 (Bodleian Library) In medieval cuisine and early modern kitchens, the spit was the preferred way of cooking meat in a large household. A servant, preferably a boy, sat near the spit turning the metal rod slowly and cooking the food; he was known as the \\"spit boy\\" or \\"spit jack\\". Mechanical turnspits (\\"roasting jacks\\") were later invented, first powered by dogs on treadmills, and then by steam power and mechanical clockwork mechanisms. The spit could also be powered by a turbine mounted in the chimney with a worm transmission for torque and speed conversion. Spits are now usually driven by electric motors. Rotisserie can also refer to a mechanical device used for rotisserie cooking, or to a restaurant specializing in spit-roasted meat. The word comes from French where it first appeared in Paris shops around 1450. Additionally, in restaurants employing the Escoffierian brigade de cuisine, the rotisseur is the chef responsible for all spit-roasted, oven roasted, grilled and in some cases fried foods. Horizontal rotisserie This style mounts the spit horizontally. They are often used to cook whole chickens or roasts of various meats including beef and pork. The design may include a single spit mounted over an open broiler or grill, a single spit mounted within an otherwise-conventional oven, or many spits mounted within a large industrial oven. The latter are commonly used to mass-produce roasted meats for sale to consumers. In this style of rotisserie, balance is important. If the object to be cooked is far out of balance, it will impose a heavy load on the drive mechanism or cause the mechanism to fail to turn. Loose chicken legs or wings can also cause the mechanism to jam. For these two reasons, some skewering skill is required. High-end consumer ovens commonly come with a rotisserie (or allow the installation of a rotisserie as an option). In these cases, the motor drive mechanism is usually concealed within the oven. The rotisserie is used by removing the normal cooking racks; a special carrier may be needed to provide one or both bearing points for the spit. The speed of rotation can vary, depending on the type of food being cooked and proximity to the heat source. Large animals, such as whole pigs, are often cooked at speeds ranging from 3 rpm to 1 rpm. Ron Popeil, inventor of the Ronco \\"Showtime\\" rotisserie oven, claims that 6 rpm is an ideal speed for cooking a variety of food. Generally speaking, when a whole animal is being spit roasted, it is best rotated faster in the early part of the roasting, to help interior temperature rise without burning the exterior. Once the exterior has started to crust, then the rate of rotation is adjusted down so as to minimize dripping. This allows juices and drippings to stay on, thus maximizing flavor. The latter is particularly important if using a horizontal spit and coals or an open fire, in which case the drippings cannot be salvaged for basting. For a horizontal spit, it is also preferable to keep the roast further away from the heat source in the beginning, which minimizes infrared heating while preserving air convection heating. Later on, the roast is brought closer, thus combining intense convection and radiation heating. Supermarkets commonly mass-produce rotisserie chickens using a horizontal rotisserie that has metal bars to hold the chicken in place through the weakest part of the breast (also which hardly affects the meat itself from the impaling, but still holds the chicken firmly in place) and the densest part of the chicken (located just below the drumstick of the chicken). Vertical rotisserie A vertical rotisserie cooking D√∂ner kebab Another style of rotisserie is the vertical rotisserie in which the heat is applied directly from the side or, less commonly, convected up from below. In this style of rotisserie, balance of the load is less important than with a horizontal rotisserie; this feature is useful, as the meat is typically shaved off a bit at a time. Some dishes that are commonly cooked on a vertical rotisserie include: * D√∂ner kebab from Turkey * Gyro, from Greece * Shawarma, from the Middle East and the Arab World * Taco al pastor, from Mexico See also * Asado * Barbecue * Lechon * Lechon manok * List of spit-roasted foods * Pig roast * Satay * Skewer References  External links * The spit turner, Historic Royal Palaces movie * How to Make a Spit Roast: The Complete Guide (Updated) * 101 Things to do with Rotisserie Chicken - Madge Baird * The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook: 300 Mouthwatering Recipes for Making the ... - Diane Phillips * Rotisserie Chickens to the Rescue!: How to Use the Already- Roasted Chickens ... - Carla Fitzgerald Williams * Category:Barbecue Category:Cooking appliances Category:Cooking techniques Category:Spit-cooked foods Category:Culinary terminology ","title":"Rotisserie"},{"id":"849676","text":"Orlando Ram√≠rez Leal (born December 18, 1951 in Cartagena, Colombia), also known as El √ëato (Snub Nose), is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and right-handed batter who played for the California Angels between 1974 and 1979.

Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is high, excluding its pedestal. The arms stretch wide. The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.  History  A view of the Corcovado before the construction, 19th century Aerial view of the statue. Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid 1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed. The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (\\"Monument Week\\") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as 'Godlessness' in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the \\"Statue of the Christ\\" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen. Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work. In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden.https://www.realtid.se/skanska-vi-ar-oskyldiga-till- underverkethttp://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/kultur/article1570427/Oppna- Kristusarmar-som-har-haft-skiftande-betydelse.html The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on-site. In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint‚ÄîOur Lady of the Apparition, under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there. Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again, on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand. In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act \\"a crime against the nation\\". The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.Infosur hoy: Christ the Redeemer to get new outfit In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo's usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the statue while in an Inter Milan strip. The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church. Restoration A panoramic view of the statue at the top of Corcovado Mountain with Sugarloaf Mountain (centre) and Guanabara Bay in the background. Christ the Redeemer at night as seen from Tijuca Forest Corcovado Rack Railway In 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo, oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro entered an agreement to conduct restoration work. More work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010 focused on the statue itself. The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.Christ the Redeemer se la come, YouTube video, accessed January 20, 2011. The restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue. During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Film history Consisting of interviews with Welsh directors, actors and public figures about the significance that film (particularly amateur film) has played in their lives, it achieved a limited UK cinema release in 2001. The film was also shown at a handful of festivals and special screenings around the world, including two at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in London. An intriguing gem, it is still occasionally to be seen at cinemas and film societies in the UK. The film was directed by Jack Jewers, produced by Jack Jewers, Leo Brend and the (then) head of the archive, Iola Baines. It features interviews with William Lloyd-George, (grandson of David Lloyd George); the actors Rhys Ifans, Donna Edwards and Sue Rodderick; the directors Marc Evans and Karl Francis; and the author Kevin Brownlow. Jewers described the commissioning of the film as follows: Jewers recorded that he was struck by \\"the sheer power and historical value\\" of the Welsh Film Archive, and \\"astonished to discover\\" 8mm film of Hitler meeting David Lloyd George.

Its total area, including the gardens, is the largest palatial estate in the country. The palace has four wings: the northern wing, the Alter Hauptbau, is the oldest and was used as a ducal residence; the east and west wings were used for court purposes and housing guests and courtiers; the southern wing, the Neuer Hauptbau, was built to house more court functions and was later used as a residence. Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, appointed Philipp Joseph Jenisch to direct the work and construction began in 1704. In 1707, Jenisch was replaced with Johann Friedrich Nette, who completed the majority of the palace and surrounding gardens. Nette died in 1714, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni finished much of the palace facades. In the final year of construction, Eberhard Louis died and the Neue Hauptbau's interiors were left incomplete. Charles Eugene's court architect, Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re, completed and refurbished parts of the New Hauptbau in the Rococo style, especially the palace theatre. Charles Eugene abandoned the palace for Stuttgart in 1775. Duke Frederick II, later King Frederick I, began using Ludwigsburg as his summer residence in the last years of Charles Eugene's reign. Frederick and his wife Charlotte, Princess Royal, resided at Ludwigsburg and employed Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret to renovate the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret converted much of Ludwigsburg's interiors over the reign of Frederick and later life of Charlotte. As a result of each architect's work, Ludwigsburg is a combination of Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, and Empire style architecture. The constitutions of the Kingdom and Free People's State of W√ºrttemberg were ratified at Ludwigsburg Palace, in 1819 and 1919 respectively. It was the residence for four of W√ºrttemberg's monarchs and some other members of the House of W√ºrttemberg and their families. The palace was opened to the public in 1918 and survived World War II intact. It underwent periods of restoration in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1990s and again for the palace's 300th anniversary in 2004. The palace had more than 350,000 visitors in 2017 and has hosted the Ludwigsburg Festival every year since 1947. Surrounding the palace are the Blooming Baroque (Bl√ºhendes Barock) gardens, arranged in 1954 as they might have appeared in 1800. Nearby is Schloss Favorite, a hunting lodge built in 1717 by Frisoni. Within the palace are two museums operated by the Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg dedicated to fashion and porcelain respectively.  History  Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, known in German as Eberhard Ludwig, as he appeared in 1720 \\"Ludwigsburg,\\" meaning \\"Louis's castle,\\" was named after its builder, Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, in 1705. It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. W√ºrttemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Allied victory at the Battle of Blenheim that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of W√ºrttemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored. Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705‚Äì06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, Eberhard Louis decided to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located from Stuttgart, Eberhard Louis could set up a court with his mistress, Wilhelmine von Gr√§venitz, and demonstrate his absolutist status as a monarch. Eberhard Louis lost faith in Jenisch's ability and in 1707 replaced him with Johann Friedrich Nette, an engineer. By 1709, it had become apparent that the massive undertaking of the palace's construction eventually necessitated the building of a town, also known as Ludwigsburg. That cost of construction provoked financial consequences, opposition at court, and criticism from the populace. A major retrenchment of court functions took place in 1709 that shrank the orchestra to eight members. That same year, after a fatal workplace accident at the palace, a pastor in nearby said of the palace at his pulpit, \\"May God spare our land the chastising that the Ludwigsburg brood of sinners conjure.\\" = Construction = Courtyard, looking north at the corps de logis of the Alter Hauptbau. Nette began and finished most of the structures depicted. Nette was now charged with building a complete Baroque palace from Jenisch's central corps de logis, to which an east wing and a west wing were to be added, aligned at 11¬∞. Nette based his plans on those of Jenisch, enabling him to complete his design for a three-wing palace in the same year as his appointment. The galleries of the Alter Hauptbau were completed in 1707, then the corps de logis the next year. The Ordensbau and Riesenbau were constructed from 1709 to 1713, and their interiors were completed in 1714. Nette began the interior of the Alter Hauptbau, which he would never finish. Construction of the building's pavilions dragged on into 1722. Nette made two trips to Prague and his native Brandenburg to expand his pool of talent. He hired , Tomasso Soldati, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni in 1708, Andreas Quitainner in 1709, and then Luca Antonio Colomba, Riccardo Retti and Diego Francesco Carlone. Nette fled to Paris from an accusation of embezzlement from Jenisch's allies but was ordered back to Ludwigsburg by Eberhard Louis. On his return trip, he died suddenly of a stroke on 9 December 1714 in Nancy at the age of 41. At the time of his death, most of the northern section of the modern palace and its northern garden was complete. Eberhard Louis stunted an attempt by Jenisch to reprise his previous role as director, replacing Nette in 1715 with Frisoni. Frisoni, although having no formal training in architecture, enjoyed the support of the court chamberlain and impressed the duke with his stucco work in the Alter Hauptbau. Frisoni resumed construction with the palace's churches, beginning the Schlosskapelle in 1716 and the Ordenskapelle in 1720, then finished the Kavalierbauten (Cavaliers' Buildings) in 1722. Frisoni also added the mansard roof to the top of the Alter Hauptbau, as its flat roof was prone to water damage. This had become a common issue with Nette's work because of the pressure the duke placed on him to finish the palace as soon as possible. Frisoni's work thus far led him to believe that he did not have a large enough talent pool to satisfy the duke's desires for the palace and town, so Frisoni brought in Giacomo Antonio Corbellini and Paolo Retti, his brother and son-in-law respectively, who were followed by Diego Carlone in 1718. In 1721, the duke began to run out of room in the Alter Hauptbau for the functions of his court and Frisoni began planning to enlarge it. The duke dismissed the idea in 1724 and ordered Frisoni to construct the Neuer Hauptbau. Frisoni designed a four-story structure, double the height of the existing palace, but plans changed several times after construction began in 1725 atop the first terrace of the south garden. Frisoni settled on a three- story building that still afforded Eberhard Louis six rooms for his suite to the three in the Alter Hauptbau. To connect the Neuer Hauptbau to the existing palace, Frisoni built the Bildergalerie and Festinbau on the west side, and the Ahnengalerie and Schlosstheater (Palace theater) on the east. The Bildergalerie and Ahnengalerie were decorated from 1731 to 1733. With the exception of the interiors of the Neuer Hauptbau and Schlosstheater, all work was finished in 1733, but Eberhard Louis died that same year. Only a few rooms in the west end of the Neuer Hauptbau had been completed when he died. Construction of the Neuer Hauptbau and its connecting galleries cost 465,000 guilders and was managed by Paolo Retti, who at times had more than 650 stone masons, cutters, and basic laborers working on the facades between 1726 and 1728. Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace cost the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg 3,000,000 florins. = Residence = Casanova was a guest at Charles Eugene's court. During his stay, he praised the performances of the duke's orchestra. Eberhard Louis left no heirs and was succeeded by Charles Alexander. Charles Alexander ended funding for the palace, dismissed its staff, and moved the capital back to Stuttgart in 1733 to modernize W√ºrttemberg's army and fortifications. As central figures in the construction of what was now decried as the \\"sin palace\\", Frisoni and Paolo Retti were arrested in 1733 on fraudulent charges of embezzlement. The two men were acquitted in 1735 after they paid a hefty fine to the ducal treasury, despite attempted intervention by the Margrave of Ansbach to free them earlier. Frisoni died in Ludwigsburg on 29 November 1735. Charles Alexander himself died suddenly two years later on 12 March 1737 as he prepared to leave Ludwigsburg Palace to inspect the duchy's fortresses. After his death, the nine-year-old Charles Eugene became Duke, beginning a regency that lasted until 1744. Charles Eugene began the construction of a new palace in Stuttgart in 1746 but unofficially used Ludwigsburg as his residence until 1775. The function of certain rooms at Ludwigsburg changed frequently; converted the Ordenskapelle to a Lutheran church from 1746 to 1748 for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie. Beginning in 1757 and lasting into the next year, the suites of the beletage were extensively modified by Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re. La Gu√™pi√®re completed the Schlosstheater in 1758‚Äì59, adding a stage, machinery, and the auditorium. A wooden opera house, adorned with mirrors, was constructed in 1764‚Äì65, located east of the Alter Hauptbau. Although Charles Eugene officially declared Ludwigsburg Palace his residence in 1764, he made no further modifications after 1770. The palace that had hosted a court that Giacomo Casanova called \\"the most magnificent in Europe\\" began a steady decline. Charles Eugene died without a legitimate heir in 1793 and was succeeded by his brother, Frederick II Eugene, who was succeeded by his son Frederick II in 1797. Ludwigsburg Palace had already been Frederick II's summer residence since 1795, and he continued to use it as such with Duchess Charlotte after marrying her on 18 May 1797. The main palace from Schloss Favorite Napoleon's armies occupied W√ºrttemberg from 1800‚Äì01, forcing the duke and duchess to flee to Vienna. The royals returned when Frederick II agreed in 1803 to pledge allegiance to Napoleon and part with W√ºrttemberg's territory on the Left Bank, an area of . In exchange, according to the Treaty of Lun√©ville, Frederick II was named an Elector-prince and given of Right Bank territory. Frederick II, now Elector Frederick I, tasked his court architect Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret with renovating the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret started in the Ahengalerie and the Ordensbau, working there from 1803 to 1806. For two days in October 1805, Napoleon visited Ludwigsburg to coerce Frederick I into joining the Confederation of the Rhine and thus becoming his ally, compensating W√ºrttemberg with neighboring territories in the Holy Roman Empire and Frederick I with the title of King. Frederick I again tasked Thouret with a remodeling, from 1808 to 1811, of the Ordenskapelle and the king's apartment. The final modernizations ordered by the king took place from 1812 to 1816 in the Schlosstheater and Marble Hall. During this time, the ceiling frescoes of the Guard Room and the main staircases of the Neuer Hauptbau were repainted. By the time Frederick I died in 1816, the majority of the palace had been converted to reflect the latest style. Following her husband's death, Charlotte continued to reside at Ludwigsburg, receiving visitors such as her siblings. She tasked Thouret with the renovation of her own apartment, which was carried out between 1816 and 1824. The dowager queen died at the palace on 5 October 1828 following a bout of apoplexy. Charlotte was the last ruler of W√ºrttemberg to reside at Ludwigsburg, as Frederick's son and successor, Wilhelm I, and future kings did not show any interest in the palace. Members of the House of W√ºrttemberg continued to reside at the palace into the early 20th century, while the W√ºrttembergs moved to Bebenhausen Abbey after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. = Later history = In 1817, ownership of Ludwigsburg Palace passed from the House of W√ºrttemberg to the government of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, which established offices there the next year. King Wilhelm I chose the Order Hall, the throne room of his father, for the ratification of the kingdom's constitution in 1819. The palace's first restoration took place at the Alter Hauptbau in 1865. Borkum Island massacre trial questions a witness, in the foreground next to an American soldier who is acting as interpreter. On 9 November 1918, the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg was dissolved with the abdication of King Wilhelm II. Ludwigsburg Palace was opened to the public that same year and a new constitution was ratified for the Free People's State of W√ºrttemberg on 12 January 1919. At this time, two apartments at Ludwigsburg Palace were still occupied by members of the House of W√ºrttemberg, Duke Ulrich and Princess Olga. The new state ordered them vacated until 1 April for the ratification. Ulrich moved out of Ludwigsburg in January, but Olga rented a new suite in the Neuer Hauptbau in February. She continued to reside at Ludwigsburg in her apartment with her family until her death in 1932. The Schlosstheater hosted the W√ºrttemberg State Theatre for a production of Handel's Rodelinda in 1923, the first musical performance at the palace since 1853. In the early 1930s, began hosting the Ludwigsburger Schlo√ükonzerte (Ludwigsburg Palace Concerts), which comprised six to ten concerts annually from 1933 to 1939. The palace survived World War II unscathed, though its furnishings were removed in 1944‚Äì45 and held at the monasteries at Alpirsbach and Lorch. It was chosen as the site of the Borkum Island war crimes trial in 1946. The concerts resumed in 1947 with 34 performances, a record that would not be broken until 1979. In 1952, the concerts were packed into a single week as the Ludwigsburger Schlo√ütage (\\"Palace Days\\"). They gained national significance when President Theodor Heuss attended a production of Mozart's Titus two years later. The concerts were named Ludwigsburger Schlo√üfestspiele in 1966, and were internationally known as the Ludwigsburg Festival. In 1980, the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg made the festival an official state event. On 9 September 1962, Charles de Gaulle delivered his \\"speech to the German youth\\" in the courtyard of Ludwigsburg Palace to 20,000 people. Revolverheld performing in the courtyard in August 2016 Restorations were undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s and again in the 1990s, in time for the palace's tricentenary in 2004. The anniversary was commemorated by the state government with three new museums. On 19 October 2011, Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann hosted a reception for the U.S. Army's 21st Theater Sustainment Command at the palace, which was attended by John D. Gardner, former deputy commander of EUCOM, and , commander of all German troops in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Ludwigsburg appeared again on Federal postage stamps in the Burgen und Schl√∂sser series. The 50th anniversary of Charles de Gaulle's speech at Ludwigsburg was celebrated on 22 September 2012 and included appearances by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Minister- President Kretschmann, and French President Fran√ßois Hollande. Merkel and Hollande both spoke at the event, the former directly referencing de Gaulle's speech in French. A painting of Frederick the Great on display was found to be a rare original by Antoine Pesne in November 2017. Michael H√∂rrmann ‚Äì the director of the ‚Äì valued the portrait at a minimum of ‚Ç¨1 million. Baden- W√ºrttemberg's Minister of Finance, Edith Sitzmann visited Ludwigsburg to see the painting and attend a press conference, where she spoke about the cultural importance of Ludwigsburg Palace. In 2017, 350,642 people visited Ludwigsburg Palace. By March 2020, Staatliche Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Baden-W√ºrttemberg plans to have spent ‚Ç¨4 million to furnish the Neuer Hauptbau as it would have been during the reign of King Frederick I. To this end, about 500 paintings, 400 pieces of furniture, and 500 lamps, clocks, and sculptures ‚Äì will be sourced, sorted, and restored.  Architecture  Plan of Ludwigsburg Palace as completed, in German Ludwigsburg Palace's Baroque architecture was built under Eberhard Louis from 1704 to 1733 and is characterized by a great deal of Austrian and Czech Baroque influence. This is most evident in the two churches, which resemble the of Kuks and the of Steyr. The palace's two Baroque architects, Johann Friedrich Nette and Donato Frisoni, were educated and worked in Bohemia and hired staff experienced in the Bohemian style. Frisoni even knew or was related to some of the artisans who worked at the Steyr church. French influence is also present, for example in the mirror halls in both the corps de logis and the palace's many mansard roofs. The combination of work by Germans (Philipp Jenisch and Nette) and Italians (Frisoni, Diego and Carlo Carlone, , Scotti and Luca Antonio Colomba) produced a strong resemblance to late 17th century works in Prague and Vienna. Charles Eugene brought the Rococo style to Ludwigsburg in 1747 and his court architect, Philippe de La Gu√™pi√®re, worked in that style until 1775. Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, working with Antonio Isopi, renovated much of Ludwigsburg Palace for Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde from 1797 to 1824. Thouret's work was heavily influenced by the French Imperial and Renaissance styles, the work of Charles Percier and Pierre Fran√ßois L√©onard Fontaine, and Egyptian motifs that became popular in Europe with Napoleon's three-year Egyptian campaign. Isopi would simplify Thouret's plans, which were then carried out by the Biedermeier woodworker Johannes Klinckerfu√ü and court painter Jean Pernaux. As a result, the palace's Neoclassical architecture does not reflect a single style or correspond to any one designer. = North wing (Alter Hauptbau) = The north wing, referred to as the Alter Hauptbau (Old Main building), is the oldest portion of the palace. It was originally built to house the apartments of Eberhard Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. Its facade was built from 1705 to 1708 and its interiors were mostly completed by 1715, although work inside its pavilions lasted into 1722. In 1809, and from 1826 to 1828, the rooms facing the courtyard in the beletage (main floor) were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but their Baroque frescoes were revealed in 1865. The corps de logis opens with a wide vestibule, decorated by Frisoni in 1712, that terminates in an unadorned staircase. At the top of the stairs is a guard room and the four suites on the beletage. These follow the French Baroque model of a living room, audience chamber, and bedroom. Eberhard Louis's apartment features a hall of mirrors decorated with stucco by Frisoni and a hidden staircase, since removed, into the room of his mistress Wilhelmine von Gr√§venitz. The third floor, finished in 1708, houses two galleries. The first takes up most of the south wall and served as a portrait gallery and ahnentafel (table of ancestors), with stucco portraits of Eberhard Louis and his ancestors created by Frisoni and Soldati in 1713. The ceiling fresco were lost in the 1808 renovation that divided into smaller rooms. The gallery was restored between 2000 and 2004. Above the third floor is a mansard roof that now houses Zwiefalten Abbey's original clockwork, taken by King Frederick I in 1809. The two pavilions to the west and east of the corps de logis are connected to it by arcaded galleries, completed in 1713 and 1715 respectively, that close off the northern edge of the cour d'honneur. The western gallery celebrates peace with stucco statuary, medallions, and reliefs of the Judgement of Paris, Aeneas fleeing Troy, Hercules and Omphale, and Apollo and Daphne. Its terminus, the Jagdpavillon (Hunting pavilion), contains the Marmorsaletta (Little marble hall) decorated with scagliola by Riccardo Retti and frescoes by Luca Antonio Colomba. Adjoined to the hall are three cabinet rooms, the first and third of which are decorated with Turkish and Chinese imagery respectively. The eastern gallery celebrates war with stucco trophy captives and weapons, reliefs of Eberhard Louis's monogram, and depictions of the cardinal virtues and the classical elements. Spanning the entire gallery is Colomba's ceiling fresco of the Gigantomachy, the war between the Olympian gods and the giants. At the end of the gallery is the Spielpavillon, completed in 1716, whose center is a rounded, cruciform hall with four corner rooms that contain imitation Delftware images of Jacques Callot's Grotesque Dwarves. The dome fresco by Colomba and depicts the four seasons and their corresponding zodiac signs. = East wing = The Riesenbau's namesake giants in its vestibule The first structure of the eastern wing is the Riesenbau (Giants' building), built by Johann Friedrich Nette in 1712‚Äì13. The vestibule, decorated by Andreas Quittainer and Colomba, prominently features two sphinxes and four giants as the atlases under the staircase to the beletage. Originally, these stairs led up to a room for the Hunting Order, which was segregated into residences from 1720 to 1723. Ahead of the giants is a statue of Minerva, and the frescoes on the ceiling above the staircase show Justitia and Fortitudo, the four seasons, and the four classical elements. In 1810, the rooms on the beletage were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but they were restored to the Baroque style and opened as a museum in the 1950s. The apartments of Frederick Louis and Charles Alexander were decorated by Frisoni and Colomba, but Charles Alexander's apartment also features a landscape painting by Adolf Friedrich Harper. Directly south of the Riesenbau is the √ñstlicher Kavalierbau (East Cavaliers' Building), built from 1715 to 1719 for housing courtiers. It contains four apartments on both floors, decorated with stucco ornament by Riccardo Retti and an original fresco on the ceiling of the beletage by Leopoldo Retti. The southwestern apartment on the second floor contains a museum dedicated to the Schlosstheater (Palace theater), attached by a gallery to the √ñstlicher Kavalierbau and the Schlosskapelle. Europe's oldest theater was constructed by Frisoni from 1729 to 1733 but was first furnished in 1758‚Äì59 by La Gu√™pi√®re, who added the stage, auditorium, and machinery. Thouret remodeled the Schlosstheater in Neoclassical in 1811‚Äì12. Casanova is known to have visited the Schlosstheater, making notes on the performances held there. Ahnengalerie, tracing the lineage of the House of W√ºrttemberg The Schlosskapelle (Palace chapel) was built from 1716 to 1724. The chapel is made up of a rotunda with three semi-domes and a private box for the duke and his family, accessed from the second floor. The box was painted around 1731 with the story of David and given its red velvet wallpaper and a ceiling fresco by Livio Retti. The chapel was painted by Frisoni, Colomba, and Carlo Carlone, who were restricted by Protestant doctrine to illustrations of biblical topics, such as the Apostles and scenes from the Old Testament. A crypt under the chapel is the burial site of all rulers of W√ºrttemberg from Duke Eberhard Louis to King Frederick I. The Schlosskapelle did not receive any major remodeling in the 19th century. The southernmost part of the east wing is the Ahnengalerie, built in 1729 and long. The original ceiling frescoes by Carlo Carlone, which illustrate the story of Achilles, were moved to the Bildergalerie after their completion in 1732. Instead, Carlone painted an homage to Eberhard Louis from 1731 to 1733, glorifying his reign with depictions of Alexander the Great, Apelles, Venus, Mars, Apollo, Phobos, and the Muses, among others. Frederick I had Thouret remodel the Ahnengalerie in 1805‚Äì06, retaining Carlone's frescoes and adding stucco to the two antechambers. The portraits in the Ahnengalerie trace the lineage of the rulers of W√ºrttemberg from Eberhard I the Bearded, the first Duke of W√ºrttemberg, to Wilhelm II, the last King of W√ºrttemberg. = West wing = King Frederick I's throne in the Ordenskapelle The first building of the west wing is the Ordensbau (Order building, in reference to the ducal Order of the Golden Eagle), containing three apartments on the ground floor and the banquet hall. The vestibule features a ceiling fresco of Pheme with a genius. Pictures of Hercules adorn its walls and continue into the stairwell. The antechamber of the Order Hall is decorated with stucco reliefs of cherubs, masks, birds, and weapons by Tomasso Soldati and Frisoni. The Order Hall's stucco was also by Soldati and Frisoni, but the ceiling fresco is a later repainting by Scotti and Baroffio in 1731, as the original by Colomba was damaged by water and removed. King Frederick I had the Hall renovated into a throne room in 1805‚Äì06 and moved the ceremonies of the Order to the Ordenskapelle. Thouret designed the king's throne and baldachin, opposite 's 1808 portrait of the king. It was in the Order Hall that the constitutions of the Kingdom and the Free People's State of W√ºrttemberg were ratified in 1819 and 1919, respectively. Immediately southwest of the Ordensbau is the oval Ordenskapelle (Order chapel), built from 1715 to 1723. The Ordenskapelle was remodeled from 1746 to 1748 by on behalf of Duke Charles Eugene for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka. Leger removed the floor between the chapel and a second- floor Order hall and reused existing pilasters for new Rococo decor by Pietro Brilli. Retti painted scenes from the life of Jesus on the ceiling. On the second floor is the duchess's box, decorated in 1747‚Äì48 with stucco and frescoes of the birth of Christ and allegories of faith, hope, and love. In 1798, Frederick I moved the Ordenskapelle's church functions to the Schlosskapelle. Nine years later, he designated it for use by the Order of the Golden Eagle and tasked Thouret with remodeling it in the Empire style. Thouret walled up the first-floor windows in 1807‚Äì08 for additional seating room and for the king's canopied throne under its star-studded semidome. The Westlicher Kavalierbau (West Cavaliers' building) is attached to the Ordenskapelle, identical in layout and design to its eastern counterpart. It was built in 1719‚Äì20, and retains some original stucco and ceiling frescoes by Riccardo and Retti. The Festinbau, attached to the Westlicher Kavalierbau, was originally designed as a kitchen built from 1729 to 1733, and used from 1770 to 1775 as a theater. Since 2004, the Westlicher Kavalierbau and Festinbau have housed a fashion museum. The actual kitchen, the K√ºchenbau, was built separate from the palace to its west, to keep odors and possible fires at bay. Inside are seven hearths, a bakery, a butcher's shop, several pantries, and the quarters for the servant staff in the attic and on the first floor. The Bildergalerie (Picture gallery), the southernmost part of the west wing, was built by Frisoni in 1731‚Äì32. The only remaining Baroque decor is Scotti's ceiling fresco depicting the life of Achilles, which first adorned the ceiling of the Ahnengalerie. Thouret renovated the Bildergalerie in Tuscan Neoclassicism from 1803 to 1805, adding a fireplace by Isopi and a statue of Apollo opposite it. The frescoes in the Bildergalerie's antechambers were painted in 1730 by either Scotti or Carlo Carlone. = South wing (Neuer Hauptbau) = The south wing, the Neuer Hauptbau (New Main building), was designed and constructed by Frisoni on the order of Duke Eberhard Louis, who found that the Alter Hauptbau was too small to serve the needs of his court. Frisoni planned for a four-story building in 1725 but wound up building three stories. Eberhard Louis died before he could move into the Neuer Hauptbau, leaving its interiors unfinished until Duke Charles Eugene finished them in 1747, but abandoned the palace in 1775. The next royals to reside there were W√ºrttemberg's first King and Queen, Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde, who extensively remodeled parts of the palace in the Neoclassical style from 1802 to 1824. The building was used in 1944‚Äì45 to store furnishings recovered from the recently destroyed New Palace in Stuttgart. Statuary and ceiling of the Queen's Staircase The Neuer Hauptbau opens with an oval vestibule decorated by Carlo Carlone. It houses a statue of Duke Eberhard Louis, surrounded by terms supporting the ceiling. In the niches behind the columns are statues of Apollo, a woman and a sphinx, and two maenads with a satyr. A vaulted passageway decorated with two figures of Hercules leads into a salon, featuring a ceiling fresco by Diego Carlone and statues of Roman deities in niches. The King's and Queen's Staircases bookend the vestibule and lead up to the Neuer Hauptbau's beletage. The King's Staircase has statuary themed after unhappy romances, and the cavettos above are adorned with stucco depictions of the seasons personified and medals bearing Eberhard Louis's initials. The Queen's Staircase is a mirror of the King's, but the statuary depicts virtues and the ribbonwork above displays Apollo, Artemis, and the four classical elements. Two galleries lead from the stairs to a guardroom decorated by Diego Carlone in 1730 with stucco weapon trophies and fresco. Thouret covered over Carlone's work with Neoclassical ornamentation in 1815. The guardroom leads into the Marble Hall (Marmorsaal), the palatial dining hall once used to receive Francis II of Austria and Alexander I of Russia. Thouret began work here in 1813‚Äì14 by installing a new, curved ceiling and finished two years later with the Marble Hall's scagliola walls. Pilasters and windows form the lower wall, decorated with stucco garlands and candelabras by Antonio Isopi. Reproductions of the Medusa Rondanini, Hermes Ludovisi, and the Medici Vase are present around the doors. Above the hall is a walkway in the attica, divided by pillars clad with caryatids holding plates and pitchers designed by Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. The ceiling fresco, by Pernaux, is of a partly cloudy blue sky that contains an eagle and four smaller birds that each hoist a chandelier. The roof above the Marble Hall, though curved, has no visible supports. This was achieved by cantilevering its weight upon the entablatures at the top of the walls of the Marble Hall. Queen Charlotte's bed To the east of the Marble Hall is Queen Charlotte's apartment, originally the suites intended to house Prince Frederick Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. When Charlotte joined Frederick I in residence at Ludwigsburg in 1798, the separating walls were removed to form one suite. Thouret only made small changes to the queen's suite from 1802 to 1806, principally adding damask to the primary antechamber and to the assembly and audience rooms. Extensive renovations, lasting from 1816 to 1824, came after the queen fully established herself at Ludwigsburg. Charlotte's audience chamber contains her throne, red silk walls, and paintings of Cybele, Minerva, and personified virtues by over the doors and in the lunettes of the mirrors. The adjacent bedroom was remodeled in 1824 with marbled green pilasters and an alcove containing red silk from 1760. The study is unusual for a Neoclassical interior because of its large mirrors. Finally, there is the summer study and the queen's library, remodeled in 1818 with blue damask and Rococo overdoors that carry over into the library to the west. The entire apartment is furnished in the Biedermeier style by Johannes Klinckerfu√ü, whose work Charlotte herself covered with embroidery. King Frederick's bedroom The king's apartment, to the west of Charlotte's, was to house Duke Eberhard Louis and Wilhelmine von Gr√§venitz, and later Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach. Charles Eugene became the first to reside here in 1744 with his wife. When Frederick I took up residence, he had Thouret remodel his 12-room suite from 1802 to 1811. The suite opens with the antechamber, containing decorations dated to 1785, likely taken from Hohenheim Palace, and an original ceiling fresco by Carlo Carlone of Bacchus and Venus. Adjacent to it is the audience chamber, decorated with Baroque red damask and Neoclassical borders. The room contains Frederick's throne and furniture by Isopi, embellished with griffins in relief. Past the conference room and its Rococo overdoors by Heideloff are the king's bedchambers. The Baroque wooden wall paneling and overdoors survived the room's 1811 remodeling. The walls and furnishings of the king's office are Neoclassical, decorated with the heads of Greek gods and cornucopias, but the ceiling fresco is a Guibal original from 1779 of Chronos and Clio. Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and tasked La Gu√™pi√®re with the apartment's decoration. Two years later, La Gu√™pi√®re completed the entire suite except for the bedchamber, as the Duke occupied his wife's former suite in 1760 for his actual residence. The rest of the suite was used for social functions until it was emptied of furnishings in the next decade. A staircase and antechamber lead to the entrance of today's apartment, a gallery decorated by Ludovico Bossi. The initial rooms are the first and second antechambers, clad in green damask with portraits by Antoine Pesne and paneling by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by Matth√§us G√ºnther, boiserie flooring, and furniture by Jacques- Philippe Carel and Jean-Baptiste H√©douin that Charles Eugene acquired around 1750. The Assembly Room, restored in 2003, prominently features overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of musical instruments above the windows. Charles Eugene's third-floor residence begins with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which feeds into a cabinet room and then finally the bedchamber, completed in 1770. Bossi created the ceiling's stucco in 1759‚Äì60, but the room and its two closets took another decade to complete. Additional rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the rulers of W√ºrttemberg and these have been occupied by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.  Grounds and gardens  A colored engraving depicting the Alter Hauptbau and the Emichsburg, dated to 1810 The gardens were to be centered in the north with an Italian terraced garden and were largely completed when Eberhard Louis turned his attention to the south garden. There he laid out a large symmetrical French garden. Charles Eugene filled in the terraces in 1749 to replace them with a large broderie. He then reorganized and expanded the south garden over the next decade. Frederick I again reorganized the south garden in 1797 in a Neoclassical style and Mediterranean theme. He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden's center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with hillocks in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi. Frederick also expanded the garden east to form an English landscape garden (Lower east) and demolished Charles Eugene's opera house to form a medieval-themed landscape garden (Upper east). Two additional gardens, for Frederick and Charlotte, were laid out adjacent to their palace suites. Also in the fantasy garden is the Emichsburg, a folly built from 1798 to 1802 and named after the fabled ancestor of the House of W√ºrttemberg, a knight of the House of Hohenstaufen. William I abandoned Ludwigsburg for Rosenstein Palace in Stuttgart and opened the south garden to the public in 1828. The canal was filled in and an orchard planted on the southern lawns, later used to grow potatoes. The Blooming Baroque gardens around Ludwigsburg Palace In 1947, , Director of the State Parks and Gardens Authority, was charged with maintaining the gardens. After visiting the 1951 Bundesgartenschau in Hanover, he decided to restore the gardens. Sch√∂chle convinced Baden-W√ºrttemberg's Minister of Finance to help fund the venture in 1952 on the condition that the town of Ludwigsburg also assisted. Ludwigsburg's mayor, , and the town council agreed to this stipulation. Frank approved the start of work on 23 March 1953, but it lasted late into the year. The restoration of the garden required the moving of of earth by bulldozers supplied and operated by American soldiers and the planting of tens of thousands of trees and hedges, 22,000 roses, and 400,000 other flowers. The Blooming Baroque (Bl√ºhendes Barock) gardens were opened on 23 April 1954 as a special horticultural show and attracted more than 500,000 visitors by the end of May, among them President Theodor Heuss. When the show closed in the fall of 1954, it had recouped all but 150,000 Deutsche Marks of the investment in the restoration of the gardens and became a permanent landmark. The opening of the Fairy-Tale Garden and its recreations of fairy-tales in 1959 was also an immediate success and increased revenue by 50% for that year. The Blooming Baroque gardens, covering an area of , attract 520,000 to 550,000 visitors annually. = Schloss Favorite = Schloss Favorite in the winter By 1710 Eberhard Louis had decided to use Ludwigsburg as his main residence, but he still desired a hunting retreat. Inspired by a garden palace he had seen in Vienna, he tasked Frisoni with the design of a new Rococo palace on a hill to the north of Ludwigsburg. Frisoni largely completed Favorite within that year but was unable to complete his extensive plans for its grounds. Only the roads to the main palace and to Monrepos Palace were laid out. In 1800, the interior was remodeled by Thouret for Frederick I. Only one room, in the western half of the building, retains its original baroque appearance. When Frederick was appointed an elector in 1803 and then a king in 1806, he chose both times to celebrate the occasion at Schloss Favorite. Favorite fell into disrepair in the 20th century but was extensively restored from 1972 to 1982. = Museums = On the first and third floors of the Alter Hauptbau is the Baroque Gallery (Barockgalerie), a subsidiary museum of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart opened in 2004. It displays 120 paintings, some of which are originals from a purchase Duke Charles Alexander made in 1736 of about 400 paintings from . Examples of German and Italian Baroque paintings on display include Martin van Meytens's portrait of Charles Alexander, works by Johann Heinrich Sch√∂nfeld, Carl Borrom√§us Andreas Ruthart, Johann Heiss, and Katharina Treu, as well as works that formerly were in the collection of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Ludwigsburg porcelain on display in the Ceramics Museum The Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg maintains two subsidiary museums at Ludwigsburg Palace, the Ceramics Museum and Fashion Museum (Keramikmuseum and Modemuseum, respectively), both opened in 2004. The first of these takes up all of the third floor of the Neuer Hauptbau except the apartment of Duke Charles Eugene, a space of containing more than 4,500 exhibits of porcelain, ceramics, faience and pottery, and of their history, making it one of the largest collections of ceramics in Europe. It includes 2,000 pieces of original Ludwigsburg porcelain and 800 pieces of maiolica, purchased by Charles Eugene from dealers in Augsburg and Nuremberg. It also includes porcelain from the manufactories at Meissen, Berlin, S√®vres, and Vienna, and 20th century Art Nouveau pieces purchased from six countries since 1950. The Fashion Museum, housed in the Festinbau and West Kavalierbau, displays about 700 pieces of clothing and accessories from the 1750s to the 1960s, including works by Charles Frederick Worth, Paul Poiret, Christian Dior, and Issey Miyake. On the ground floor of the Neuer Hauptbau is a lapidarium, housing original Baroque statuary by Andreas Quittainer, Johann Wilhelm Beyer and Pierre Fran√ßois Lejeune. Charles Eugene's apartment houses the Princess Olga Cabinet Exhibition, exploring the lives of Princess Olga and her family at Ludwigsburg from 1901 to 1932. Kinderreich (Children's Kingdom) is an interactive museum that educates children four years and older about life at the court of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. In the Palace Theatre, about 140 original set pieces and props from the 18th and 19th centuries are preserved that were discovered during restoration of the theatre, such as oil lamps used for stage lighting. These items were extensively restored to their original condition from 1987 to 1995, and since 1995 one of the original stage pieces, a winter background, has been used for the Junge B√ºhne (Young stage).

It is a prominent feature in the cuisine of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. The related term churrascaria (or churrasqueria) is mostly understood to be a steakhouse. A churrascaria is a restaurant serving grilled meat, many offering as much as one can eat: the waiters move around the restaurant with the skewers, slicing meat onto the customer's plate. This serving style is called espeto corrido or rod√≠zio, and is quite popular in Brazil, specially in southern states like Rio Grande do Sul, Paran√°, Santa Catarina and S√£o Paulo. In Latin America Brazilian churrasco In Brazil, churrasco is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine and Uruguayan asado) which originated in southern Brazil. The discovery of the churrasco is attributed to the indigenous community who inhabited the coast of South, Central and North America. They would roast the meat outdoors on a stone fire with the help of a grill made of green wood. However, it was in the region known as the great pampa in South America that the churrasco found its ideal setting. It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built \\"churrasqueira\\", a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. Portable \\"churrasqueiras\\" are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian \\"churrasqueiras\\" do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the State of Rio Grande do Sul). Churrasco sandwich from Chile In Nicaragua, the first immigrant group to introduce the term for this cut of beef to the United States restaurant scene in Miami, Florida as early as the 1950s, it refers to a thin steak prepared grilled and served with a traditional chimichurri sauce- macerated parsley, garlic, peppers, and olive oil sauce. In Argentina and Uruguay a churrasco refers to any boneless cut of beef that is sliced slightly thin as a steak and grilled over hot coals or on a very hot skillet. Gauchos would have grilled churrasco as part of their asado, now the national dish of both countries, served with salad and fried or mashed potatoes, and sometimes a fried egg. In Puerto Rico it always refers to skirt steak, cooked on a barbecue grill. The chimichurri sauce is optional, since the meat is very savory with just a slight hint of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking. It is also customary to replace chimichurri sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or Ajilim√≥jili sauce. In Ecuador churrasco is a staple food of the Coast Region, especially Guayaquil. The dish's main ingredient is the grilled steak that is seasoned with chimichurri, it is served with plantains, white rice, French fries, a fried egg, and slices of avocado. In Guatemala, churrasco is regarded as a typical dish, often eaten in familiar gatherings and festive occasions. It is usually served topped with chirmol, a red sauce containing chopped tomatoes and onions, and accompanied by corn, guacamole, grilled potatoes, stewed black beans, rice and tortillas. In Chile, churrasco refers to a thin cut of steak which varies depending on the desired quality of the sandwich. The slices are grilled and served in a -sometimes warmed- local bun (called \\"marraqueta\\", or \\"pan batido\\" in Valpara√≠so), usually accompanied with tomato, avocado and mayonnaise, in the case of a churrasco italiano. Another popular dish, churrasco a lo pobre (\\"poor man's churrasco\\"), consists of a churrasco served with French fries, fried egg, and caramelized onions. File:Churrasco00004.jpg File:Churrasco00001.jpg File:Churrasco00003.jpg File:Wagyu00001.jpg File:Primerib00001.jpg In other countries Brazilian Barbecue In Portugal, frango de churrasco with piri piri (a kind of salty roasted chicken cooked on the churrasqueira, spiced with hot red chili sauce, garlic and paprika) is very popular. Portuguese churrasco and chicken dishes are very popular in countries with Portuguese communities, such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Venezuela and South Africa. The term churrasco is used in former Portuguese colonies‚Äîa churrasco mo√ßambicano is a grilled meat dish from Mozambique, for instance. In Galicia, churrasco refers almost exclusively to grilled pork or beef spare ribs. Galicians who emigrated to America in the 20th century took with them the recipe for churrasco. Nowadays, many Galicians of all social classes prepare a churrascada. In the United States, churrasco-style restaurants have grown in popularity since the 1990's, fueled by the success of various chains, including Rodizio Grill,Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Ch√£o, Tucanos, as well as stand-alone Brazilian barbecue restaurants. In North America, CHURRASCO is a registered trademark for rotisserie/grills manufactured by Hickory Industries, Inc. of Ft. Lee, New Jersey.

Two of the Fletch books earned Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America: Fletch was named Best First Novel in 1975, and Confess, Fletch won for Best Paperback Original in 1977. This is the only time a novel and its sequel won back-to-back Edgars. Mcdonald would go on to write nine more Fletch novels, including the prequels Fletch Won and Fletch Too. The original book became a 1985 movie of the same name starring Chevy Chase. Early life Mcdonald was born in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. He was educated at Harvard, paying his own way by operating yachts. Career He worked as a teacher before becoming a journalist for the Boston Globe in the late 1960s. He finally left his newspaper position to become a novelist full-time with the publication of Fletch. =Fletch novels= In 1985, the first novel in the Fletch series was adapted into a movie with Chevy Chase playing the irreverent investigative reporter. Chase would reprise his role in the 1989 sequel Fletch Lives. Though Mcdonald had never really seen Chevy Chase perform in anything substantial, he readily agreed to the casting of the actor in the role, and had nothing but praise for his performance. In Confess, Fletch, Mcdonald also introduced his second signature protagonist, Inspector Francis Xavier Flynn, a brilliant but eccentric Boston Police homicide detective who served as a foil for Fletch. Flynn would go on to appear in four of his own spin-off novels. The Fletch series also spawned the Son of Fletch series, in which Mcdonald introduced the character of Jack Faoni, the illegitimate son of Irwin Maurice Fletcher. In addition, Mcdonald wrote two novels in the Skylar series and a number of non-series (and non-mystery) novels. Personal life In the mid-1980s, he moved to Pulaski, Tennessee. There, he bought an antebellum farm and became involved in local politics. He died at his home from prostate cancer in 2008.

It is mostly a hill of steep, grassy slopes, with a narrow summit ridge that runs east/west. There are crags on the northern side of this ridge, looking down into the corrie of Coire Choinnich. From the summit there are fine views of the Coulin and Torridon peaks to the north, whilst southward lies a large expanse of wilderness around Loch Monar. The hill is often climbed along with the neighbouring Sg√πrr a' Chaorachain, which lies to the east, as the pair are linked by a high bealach at the head of Coire Choinnich. The most normal route of ascent starts from the north, near Craig, a small village in Glen Carron. A good track leads up the side of the Allt a' Chonais burn, and once across the burn one possible route of ascent is the north ridge of Sg√πrr a' Chaorachain. From the summit of this peak one may continue west onto the summit of Sg√πrr Choinnich. From the east, a well defined ridge leads to the bealach of Bealach Bhearnais; here a stalkers track leads from the glen of Allt a' Chonais is met, thus a circular route is possible.

The production is based in the town of Jarnac in the Charente region of France.  History  = Foundation = Originally established in Paris, in the French suburb of Bercy in 1835, Emmanuel Courvoisier started a wine and spirit company with Louis Gallois, then the mayor of Bercy. Originally, Emmanuel and Louis would act as traders for the best cognacs of the region. Eventually the two decided that the only way they could guarantee the very finest cognac was relocate to the region and become producers themselves. The 200-year-old crafting process has not changed since Courvoisier's establishment in Bercy. =Napoleon= Napoleon Bonaparte visited Bercy in 1811 as documented in a historic painting by Etienne Bouhot and later was credited with saying he wanted his artillery companies to have a ration of cognac during the Napoleonic Wars. Legend has it that Napoleon I later took several barrels of cognac with him to St Helena, a treat much appreciated by the English officers on the ship, who named it \\"the Cognac of Napoleon\\". In 1869, Napoleon Bonaparte's heir Napoleon III personally requested Courvoisier and bestowed the honourable title of \\"Official Supplier to the Imperial Court\\" which is still displayed at the Courvoisier museum in Jarnac. =Move to Jarnac= In 1828, Felix Courvoisier and Jules Gallois, the sons of Emmanuel and Louis, wanted to improve the quality of cognac, moving the company to the heart of the Cognac region in the town of Jarnac. After Felix's passing in 1866, his nephews, the Curlier brothers, took over the management of the business. By 1909, the business was sold to the Simon family from England, but still maintained its production and headquarters in the Jarnac region. Located ten minutes from the town of Cognac, the main Courvoisier business operations still operate from the Ch√¢teau on the banks of the Charente river which was established in the 1870s. Courvoisier sources eaux-de-vie from the following crus to create its blends: Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Boderies and Fin Bois. The harvest season begins in October, followed up by distillation from November to March. Courvoisier cognac is aged in barrels handmade from 200-year-old oak sourced from the Tron√ßais forest in France. = Ch√¢teau Courvoisier = Courvoisier headquarters are still stationed in Jarnac, about ten minutes from the Cognac region. Courvoisier is run from the original Ch√¢teau Felix Courvoisier and Jules Gallois moved to in 1828. Today, the Courvoisier Ch√¢teau has a boutique and museum, offering private tastings and exclusive tours. The museum features several items linked to Napoleon I, including a lock of his hair, his hat and his coat. = Marketing = Continuing to honour the spirit of Napoleon, Courvoisier launched the Josephine bottle in 1951, named after Napoleon's first wife. The shape of the bottle, with a thin neck and wide base, has become synonymous with Courvoisier, and speculation still exists whether the shape is meant to mimic Josephine's love of corsets or an inverted replica of early brandy glasses. Courvoisier was the first cognac brand to appear on TV with an advertisement on UK television broadcast to nine million viewers. In 2009, Courvoisier was the first alcohol brand to release a 3D advertisement, titled \\"Cognac With Another Dimension\\", on TV and in cinemas, ahead of the viewing of the biggest- grossing film of all time, Avatar. A special iPod app was created to teach consumers how to use Courvoisier as an ingredient in cocktails as part of the \\"Mixability\\" promotion. With a focus on mixology, Courvoisier created \\"The Architectural Punchbowl\\" for an immersive brand experience with cocktails served from a structure filled with 4,000 litres of a punch containing Courvoisier. The event was a homage to Admiral Edward Russell, who in 1694 created a large punchbowl that had to be served by a boy rowing across it. Le Nez de Courvoisier, one of the first examples of sensory marketing, recognised the dominant aromas in each of the Courvoisier cognacs and used them to deliver food pairing initiatives in partnership with leading chefs and music. = Fashion = In 1988, famed Art Deco designer Ert√© was commissioned to create limited edition Courvoisier bottles containing Grande Champagne cognac dating back to the year of his birth, 1892. The seven unique designs represented various stages of the cognac distillation process interpreted by Ert√©'s unique designs. Courvoisier's next fashion partnership was in 2005 with English designer Vivienne Westwood. Sold exclusively at Harvey Nichols, The Courvoisier XO dressed by Vivienne Westwood only released 150 limited edition bottles. The oldest bottle of Courvoisier, with liquid dating back to 1789, was unveiled at Harrod's for the Alchimie L'Atelier event. Discovered in Dutch collector Bay van der Bunt's vault, the bottle was on sale for ‚Ç¨90,000.

The easternmost Polynesian culture, the descendants of the original people of Easter Island make up about 60% of the current Easter Island population and have a significant portion of their population residing in mainland Chile. They speak both the traditional Rapa Nui language and the primary language of Chile, Spanish. At the 2017 census there were 7,750 island inhabitants‚Äîalmost all living in the village of Hanga Roa on the sheltered west coast. As of 2011, Rapa Nui's main source of income derived from tourism, which focuses on the giant sculptures called moai. Rapa Nui activists have been fighting for their right of self-determination and possession of the island. Protests in 2010 and 2011 by the indigenous Rapa Nui on Easter Island, objecting to the creation of a marine park and reserve, have led to clashes with Chilean police. History =Pre-European contact (300‚Äì1722 CE)= Rapa Nui are believed to have settled Easter Island between 300 and 1200 CE. Previously, the date of arrival was estimated to be around 700‚Äì800 CE, but more-recent evidence from radiocarbon dating supports an arrival date as late as 1200 CE. The Rapa Nui People have been found to be of Polynesian origin through genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA of pre-historic skeletons. Genetic analysis performed by Erik Thorsby and other geneticists in 2007 revealed genetic markers of European and Amerindian origin that suggest that the Rapa Nui had European and Amerindian contributions to their DNA during or before the early 1800s. =Early European contact (1722‚Äì1870 CE)= Jacob Roggeveen was the first European to record contact with the Rapa Nui. Roggeveen allegedly set sail either in search of Juan Fernandez Islands or David's Island but instead arrived at Easter Island on April 5, 1722 (Easter Sunday). He remained on the island for about a week. Felipe Gonz√°lez de Ahedo visited the Rapa Nui in 1770 and claimed the island for Spain on a document which the islanders wrote on in rongorongo, the now undecipherable Rapa Nui script. James Cook and Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse, visited the island for a few days in 1774 and 1786, respectively. Group of Rapa Nui people at Hanga Roa, c. 1914 1915 Mana Expedition (23 July 1915). Culture = Language = The Rapa Nui currently speak Spanish and the traditional Rapa Nui language. The Rapa Nui language, also known as Pascuan, is classified as an Eastern Polynesian language and is currently written in Latin script. Rapa Nui is a minority language, as most Rapa Nui people speak Spanish as their first language. Spanish is the most widely spoken language on Easter Island and the primary language of education and administration. It is believed that Rapa Nui is currently undergoing a shift toward more Spanish sentence structure. Rongorongo, a system of glyphs discovered in the 1800s, is believed to represent an older version of the Rapa Nui language. However, the decipherment of rongorongo is an ongoing process and it is not yet clear whether Rongorongo is a form of writing or some other form of cultural expression. = Mythology = The main stories of Rapa Nui mythology are that of Hotu Matu'a, believed to be the first settler of Easter Island, and the Tangata manu. The Tangata manu is the mythology of the Birdman religion and cult which had creator god Makemake and competition with eggs to choose the birdman who would remain sacred for five months. More recent Rapa Nui mythology includes the story of the epic battle between the Hanau Epe and the Hanau Momoko. The trans-Neptunian dwarf planet Makemake is named after this creator deity. =Moai= The best-known aspect of the Rapa Nui culture is the moai, the 887 human figures carved from rock between 1250 and 1500 CE and transported throughout Easter Island. The moai were believed to be the living faces of ancestors and had all been toppled by 1868. The moai rest on large stone platforms called ahu, the most famous of which are Ahu Tongariki, the largest ahu, and Ahu Vinapu. Some moai have hats of red volcanic stone known as Pukao. Currently, the Rapa Nui and the Chilean government are focused on preserving and restoring the statues, including denoting an area that includes many of the statues, Rapa Nui National Park, as a World Heritage site. =Art= The Rapa Nui have historically made feather headdresses, bark cloth, wood carvings, and stone carvings. Adzes, blunt round stones, were used to complete stone images and wood carvings. A distinguishing characteristic of Rapa Nui statues is the use of shell or coral inlaid with obsidian to represent eyes. =Music= Rapa Nui traditional music consists of choral singing and chanting accompanied by instruments including conch shell trumpets, percussive dancers, accordions, and kauaha, a percussion instrument created from the jaw bone of a horse. Modern Rapanui music has had Latin American influences creating new genres such as the Rapa Nui style of tango. Matato'a, one of the most famous musical groups on the island, promotes traditional styles of dance and music. = Tattoos = Like in other Polynesian islands, tattoos and body paintings had a fundamentally spiritual connotation. In some cases the tattoos were considered a receptor for divine strength or mana. They were manifestations of the Rapa Nui culture. Priests, warriors and chiefs had more tattoos than the rest of the population, as a symbol of their hierarchy. Both men and women were tattooed to represent their social class. Tattoos, as well as other forms of art in Rapa Nui, blends anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. Nowadays, young people are bringing back Rapa Nui tattoos as an important part of their culture and local artists base their creations on traditional motifs. The tattooing process was performed with bone needles and combs called Uhi made out of bird or fish bones. The ink was made out of natural products, primarily from the burning of Ti leaves (Cordyline terminalis) and sugar cane. Interaction with the environment A common hypothesis is held that the apparent decline of Rapa Nui culture and society before European discovery in 1722 was caused by the over-exploitation of the island‚Äôs environment, most notably through deforestation of almost all the island‚Äôs trees. The most prominent proponent of this explanation is Jared Diamond who proposes a scenario for the \\"ecocide\\" on Easter Island in his 2005 book Collapse. This idea that Rapa Nui society collapsed came out of the imbalance between general resources present on the island, mainly population, timber and food sources, and the energy- and resource-intensive feat of transporting and raising the moai. Food resources may have been scarcer than in other areas of Polynesia because of factors like the cooler climate, lack of rainfall in comparison to other islands in the area, high winds and a lack of biodiversity, leading to common Polynesian crops not faring as well as they would in other areas of the Pacific. A source of good timber is also currently noticeably absent from the Island, the tallest, extant plant life averaging around 7 feet. Although Easter Island currently has only 48 different kinds of plants as evidenced by botanical surveys of the island, it once possessed many more, shown through pollen analysis conducted on sediment layers from swamps or ponds. From these samples, 22 no longer present on the island were shown to have existed at some time there. These plants included a giant palm, the Rapa Nui Palm, that showed signs of being the largest palm species in the world, eclipsing the size of the Chilean Wine Palm if it were not extinct. There are also signs of Easter Island's once possessing a far more diverse collection of fauna. The skeletal remains of 25 different species of nesting bird have been located on the island, but have since been reduced to 16. This trend of extinction and extirpation is a common occurrence when humans populate a new area, because of tendencies to overhunt and overexploit resources. Deforestation would have caused a decrease in crop yields due to soil erosion, loss of wood as a resource to construct fishing boats, among other things, and would have necessitated a halt to the construction of the moai erected around the island. Diamond hypothesizes that resource scarcity may have led to brutal civil war, creating a drop in population. He further hypothesizes that there were about 7,000 individuals pre-war, a number which fell to the 2,000 whom missionaries met when they showed up in the 19th century and conducted the first census of the island. Others attribute this decline to overpopulation or the introduction of Europeans to the island and the diseases that commonly came with them like smallpox. =Agriculture= Agriculture on Easter Island shows signs of intensification before European arrival, necessary because of its climate which had an excess of wind and a low amount of rainfall for the area. Archaeological finds show a multitude of composting pits and irrigation systems. Large boulders were also stacked to serve as barriers against the wind. In the fields, a system of agriculture called lithic mulch was employed. In this method, farmers would lay rocks out in patterns in their fields, forcing the plants to grow in certain areas. This method is known to increase soil moisture while decreasing soil erosion from wind, effectively combating the climate conditions. Crops grown on Easter Island included sweet potatoes, yams, taro, bananas and sugarcane. Chickens were the sole domestic animal, though the \\"chicken coops\\" carved of stone which still dot the fields of the island were most likely tombs from which the chickens obtained calcium and phosphorus in the form of bone meal.

Definition Let G be a Lie group and be a principal G-bundle on a smooth manifold M. Suppose there is a connection on P; this yields a natural direct sum decomposition T_u P = H_u \\\\oplus V_u of each tangent space into the horizontal and vertical subspaces. Let h: T_u P \\\\to H_u be the projection to the horizontal subspace. If œï is a k-form on P with values in a vector space V, then its exterior covariant derivative Dœï is a form defined by :D\\\\phi(v_0, v_1,\\\\dots, v_k)= d \\\\phi(h v_0 ,h v_1,\\\\dots, h v_k) where vi are tangent vectors to P at u. Suppose that is a representation of G on a vector space V. If œï is equivariant in the sense that :R_g^* \\\\phi = \\\\rho(g)^{-1}\\\\phi where R_g(u) = ug, then Dœï is a tensorial -form on P of the type œÅ: it is equivariant and horizontal (a form œà is horizontal if .) By abuse of notation, the differential of œÅ at the identity element may again be denoted by œÅ: :\\\\rho: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V). Let \\\\omega be the connection one- form and \\\\rho(\\\\omega) the representation of the connection in \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V). That is, \\\\rho(\\\\omega) is a \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V)-valued form, vanishing on the horizontal subspace. If œï is a tensorial k-form of type œÅ, then :D \\\\phi = d \\\\phi + \\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi,If , then, writing X^{\\\\\\\\#} for the fundamental vector field (i.e., vertical vector field) generated by X in \\\\mathfrak{g} on P, we have: :d \\\\phi(X^{\\\\\\\\#}_u) = \\\\left . {d \\\\over dt}\\\\right\\\\vert_0 \\\\phi(u \\\\operatorname{exp}(tX)) = -\\\\rho(X)\\\\phi(u) = -\\\\rho(\\\\omega(X^{\\\\\\\\#}_u))\\\\phi(u), since . On the other hand, . If X is a horizontal tangent vector, then D \\\\phi(X) = d\\\\phi(X) and \\\\omega(X) = 0. For the general case, let Xi's be tangent vectors to P at some point such that some of Xi's are horizontal and the rest vertical. If Xi is vertical, we think of it as a Lie algebra element and then identify it with the fundamental vector field generated by it. If Xi is horizontal, we replace it with the horizontal lift of the vector field extending the pushforward œÄXi. This way, we have extended Xi's to vector fields. Note the extension is such that we have: [Xi, Xj] = 0 if Xi is horizontal and Xj is vertical. Finally, by the invariant formula for exterior derivative, we have: :D \\\\phi(X_0, \\\\dots, X_k) - d \\\\phi(X_0, \\\\dots, X_k) = {1 \\\\over k+1} \\\\sum_0^k (-1)^i \\\\rho(\\\\omega(X_i)) \\\\phi(X_0, \\\\dots, \\\\widehat{X_i}, \\\\dots, X_k), which is (\\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi)(X_0, \\\\cdots, X_k). where, following the notation in , we wrote :(\\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi)(v_1, \\\\dots, v_{k+1}) = {1 \\\\over (1+k)!} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma} \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\sigma)\\\\rho(\\\\omega(v_{\\\\sigma(1)})) \\\\phi(v_{\\\\sigma(2)}, \\\\dots, v_{\\\\sigma(k+1)}). Unlike the usual exterior derivative, which squares to 0, the exterior covariant derivative does not. In general, one has, for a tensorial zero-form œï, :D^2\\\\phi=F \\\\cdot \\\\phi.Proof: Since œÅ acts on the constant part of œâ, it commutes with d and thus :d(\\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi) = d(\\\\rho(\\\\omega)) \\\\cdot \\\\phi - \\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot d\\\\phi = \\\\rho(d \\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi - \\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot d\\\\phi. Then, according to the example at , :D^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho(d \\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi + \\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot (\\\\rho(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi) = \\\\rho(d \\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi + {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\rho([\\\\omega \\\\wedge \\\\omega]) \\\\cdot \\\\phi, which is \\\\rho(\\\\Omega) \\\\cdot \\\\phi by E. Cartan's structure equation. where is the representation in \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) of the curvature two-form Œ©. The form F is sometimes referred to as the field strength tensor, in analogy to the role it plays in electromagnetism. Note that D2 vanishes for a flat connection (i.e. when ). If , then one can write :\\\\rho(\\\\Omega) = F = \\\\sum {F^i}_j {e^j}_i where {e^i}_j is the matrix with 1 at the -th entry and zero on the other entries. The matrix {F^i}_j whose entries are 2-forms on P is called the curvature matrix.  Exterior covariant derivative for vector bundles  When is a representation, one can form the associated bundle . Then the exterior covariant derivative D given by a connection on P induces an exterior covariant derivative (sometimes called the exterior connection) on the associated bundle, this time using the nabla symbol: : abla: \\\\Gamma(M, E) \\\\to \\\\Gamma(M, T^*M \\\\otimes E) Here, Œì denotes the space of local sections of the vector bundle. The extension is made through the correspondence between E-valued forms and tensorial forms of type œÅ (see tensorial forms on principal bundles.) Requiring ‚àá to satisfy Leibniz's rule, ‚àá also acts on any E-valued form; thus, it is given on decomposable elements of the space \\\\Omega^k(M;E) = \\\\Gamma(\\\\Lambda^k(T^*M) \\\\otimes E) of E-valued k-forms by : abla(\\\\omega \\\\otimes s) = (d \\\\omega) \\\\otimes s + (-1)^k \\\\omega \\\\wedge abla s \\\\in \\\\Omega^{k+1}(M;E). For a section s of E, we also set : abla_X s = i_X abla s where i_X is the contraction by X. Conversely, given a vector bundle E, one can take its frame bundle, which is a principal bundle, and so obtain an exterior covariant differentiation on E (depending on a connection). Identifying tensorial forms and E-valued forms, one may show that :-2F(X, Y) s = \\\\left([ abla_X, abla_Y] - abla_{[X, Y]}\\\\right) s which can be easily recognized as the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor on Riemannian manifolds.  Example  * Bianchi's second identity, which says that the exterior covariant derivative of Œ© is zero (that is, ) can be stated as: d\\\\Omega + \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\Omega = d\\\\Omega + [\\\\omega \\\\wedge \\\\Omega] = 0.

It was a theological treatise, and as such was published in Latin as well as German, the language in which the treatises were written.  Context  The book was circulating in print not quite a week when the papal bull against Luther arrived in Wittenberg in October 1520.The bull and the book were being prepared simultaneously. Luther accuses the Roman church and the papacy of keeping the church in captivity, equating Rome with the biblical Babylon that exiled the Israelites from their homeland, holding them captive in Babylon. According to Luther, the pope was holding the church in captivity through the use of the sacramental system and Rome's theology. In 1521 Martin Luther was requested to either confess or recant his books, including his treatise The Babylonian Captivity of the Church. The book was a critique of the medieval Roman church's system of sacraments. The treatise is a summary of Luther's thinking on the sacraments and it is still the confessional Lutheran relationship to the number of sacraments. Content In this work Luther examines the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church in the light of his interpretation of the Bible. With regard to the Eucharist, he advocates restoring the cup to the laity, dismisses the Catholic doctrine of Transubstantiation but affirms the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, and rejects the teaching that the Mass is a sacrifice offered to God. With regard to baptism, he writes that it brings justification only if conjoined with saving faith in the recipient; however, it remains the foundation of salvation even for those who might later fallSchaff-Herzog, \\"Luther, Martin,\\" 71. and be reclaimed. As for penance, its essence consists in the words of promise (absolution) received by faith. Only these three can be regarded as sacraments because of their divine institution and the divine promises of salvation connected with them; but strictly speaking, only Baptism and the Eucharist are sacraments, since only they have \\"divinely instituted visible sign[s]\\": water in Baptism and bread and wine in the Eucharist.Schaff-Herzog, \\"Luther, Martin,\\" 71. Luther claimed that Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, and Extreme Unction are not sacraments. The titular \\"captivity\\" is firstly the withholding the cup in the Lord's Supper from the laity, the second the doctrine of transubstantiation, and the third, the Roman Catholic Church's teaching that the Mass was a sacrifice and a good work.Spitz, 338. The work is angry in tone, attacking the papacy. Although Luther had made a link tentatively in the address To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, this was the first time he forthrightly accused the pope of being the Antichrist. It certainly heralded a radicalisation of Luther's views -- only a year before he had defended the validity of the sacraments, yet was now attacking them fiercely. Although published in Latin, a translation of this work was quickly published in German by Luther‚Äôs opponent, the Strasbourg Franciscan Thomas Murner. He hoped that by making people aware of the radical nature of Luther‚Äôs beliefs, they would realise their foolishness in supporting him. In fact, the opposite proved true, and Murner‚Äôs translation helped to spread Luther‚Äôs views across Germany. The virulence of Luther's language however, was off-putting to some. After the publication of this work, with its harsh condemnation of the papacy, the renowned humanist Erasmus, who had previously been cautiously supportive of Luther's activities, became convinced that he should not support Luther's calls for reform.

The blocks of 52nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Seventh Avenue became renowned for the abundance of jazz clubs and lively street life. The street was convenient to musicians playing on Broadway and the 'legitimate' nightclubs and was also the site of a CBS studio. Musicians who played for others in the early evening played for themselves on 52nd Street. In its heyday from 1930 through the early 1950s, 52nd Street clubs hosted such jazz legends as Miles Davis, Harry Gibson, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Nat Jaffe, Marian McPartland, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Louis Prima, Art Tatum, Fats Waller, Trummy Young, and many more. Although musicians from all schools performed there, after Minton's Playhouse in uptown Harlem, 52nd Street was the second most important place for the dissemination of bebop;.Miles Davis (1989) Autobiography In fact, a tune called \\"52nd Street Theme\\" by Thelonious Monk became a bebop anthem and jazz standard.

By the late 1940s the jazz scene began moving elsewhere around the city and urban renewal began to take hold of the street. By the 1960s, most of the legendary clubs were razed or fell into disrepair. The last jazz club there closed in 1968, though one remains as a restaurant. Today, the street is full of banks, shops, and department stores and shows little trace of its jazz history.

It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models. The model was developed by Ford W. Harris in 1913, but R. H. Wilson, a consultant who applied it extensively, and K. Andler are given credit for their in-depth analysis. Overview EOQ applies only when demand for a product is constant over the year and each new order is delivered in full when inventory reaches zero. There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered; an order is assumed to contain only 1 unit. There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as holding cost, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item. We want to determine the optimal number of units to order so that we minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery and storage of the product. The required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year, the purchase cost for each item, the fixed cost to place the order for a single item and the storage cost for each item per year. Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost, though this number can be determined from the other parameters. =Variables= *T = total annual inventory cost *P = purchase unit price, unit production cost *Q = order quantity. *Q^* = optimal order quantity. *D = annual demand quantity. *K = fixed cost per order, setup cost (not per unit, typically cost of ordering and shipping and handling. This is not the cost of goods) *h = annual holding cost per unit, also known as carrying cost or storage cost (capital cost, warehouse space, refrigeration, insurance, etc. usually not related to the unit production cost) =The total cost function and derivation of EOQ formula= The single-item EOQ formula finds the minimum point of the following cost function: Total Cost = purchase cost or production cost + ordering cost + holding cost Where: * Purchase cost: This is the variable cost of goods: purchase unit price √ó annual demand quantity. This is P √ó D * Ordering cost: This is the cost of placing orders: each order has a fixed cost K, and we need to order D/Q times per year. This is K √ó D/Q * Holding cost: the average quantity in stock (between fully replenished and empty) is Q/2, so this cost is h √ó Q/2 T = PD + K {\\\\frac{D}{Q}} + h {\\\\frac{Q}{2}}. To determine the minimum point of the total cost curve, calculate the derivative of the total cost with respect to Q (assume all other variables are constant) and set it equal to 0: {0} = -{\\\\frac{DK}{Q^2}}+{\\\\frac{h}{2}} Solving for Q gives Q* (the optimal order quantity): Q^{*2}={\\\\frac{2DK}{h}} Therefore: cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} Q* is independent of P; it is a function of only K, D, h. The optimal value Q* may also be found by recognising that T = {\\\\frac{DK}{Q}} + {\\\\frac{hQ}{2}} + PD ={\\\\frac{h}{2Q}}(Q - \\\\sqrt{2DK/h})^2 + \\\\sqrt{2hDK} +PD, where the non-negative quadratic term disappears for Q = \\\\sqrt{2DK/h}, which provides the cost minimum T_{min} = \\\\sqrt{2hDK} + PD. = Example = *annual requirement quantity (D) = 10000 units *Cost per order (K) = 40 *Cost per unit (P)= 50 *Yearly carrying cost per unit (h) = 5 Economic order quantity = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2D*K}{h}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2*10000*40}{5}} = 400 units Number of orders per year (based on EOQ) = {\\\\frac{10000}{400}} = 25 Total cost = P*D + K (D/EOQ) + h (EOQ/2) Total cost = 50*10000 + 40*(10000/400) + 5*(400/2) = 502000 If we check the total cost for any order quantity other than 400(=EOQ), we will see that the cost is higher. For instance, supposing 500 units per order, then Total cost = 50*10000 + 40*(10000/500) + 5*(500/2) = 502050 Similarly, if we choose 300 for the order quantity then Total cost = 50*10000 + 40*(10000/300) + 5*(300/2) = 502083.33 This illustrates that the economic order quantity is always in the best interests of the firm. Extensions of the EOQ model =Quantity discounts= An important extension to the EOQ model is to accommodate quantity discounts. There are two main types of quantity discounts: (1) all-units and (2) incremental.Zipkin, Paul H, Foundations of Inventory Management, McGraw Hill 2000 Here is a numerical example: * Incremental unit discount: Units 1‚Äì100 cost $30 each; Units 101‚Äì199 cost $28 each; Units 200 and up cost $26 each. So when 150 units are ordered, the total cost is $30*100 + $28*50. * All units discount: an order of 1‚Äì1000 units costs $50 each; an order of 1001‚Äì5000 units costs $45 each; an order of more than 5000 units costs $40 each. So when 1500 units are ordered, the total cost is $45*1500. In order to find the optimal order quantity under different quantity discount schemes, one should use algorithms; these algorithms are developed under the assumption that the EOQ policy is still optimal with quantity discounts. Perera et al. (2017) establish this optimality and fully characterize the (s,S) optimality within the EOQ setting under general cost structures. =Design of optimal quantity discount schedules= In presence of a strategic customer, who responds optimally to discount schedule, the design of optimal quantity discount scheme by the supplier is complex and has to be done carefully. This is particularly so when the demand at the customer is itself uncertain. An interesting effect called the \\"reverse bullwhip\\" takes place where an increase in consumer demand uncertainty actually reduces order quantity uncertainty at the supplier. =Backordering costs and multiple items= Several extensions can be made to the EOQ model, including backordering costs and multiple items. Additionally, the economic order interval can be determined from the EOQ and the economic production quantity model (which determines the optimal production quantity) can be determined in a similar fashion. A version of the model, the Baumol-Tobin model, has also been used to determine the money demand function, where a person's holdings of money balances can be seen in a way parallel to a firm's holdings of inventory. Malakooti (2013) has introduced the multi-criteria EOQ models where the criteria could be minimizing the total cost, Order quantity (inventory), and Shortages. A version taking the time-value of money into account was developed by Trippi and Lewin. = Imperfect quality = Another important extension of EOQ model is to consider items with imperfect quality. Salameh and Jaber (2000) are the first to study the imperfect items in an EOQ model very thoroughly. They consider an inventory problem in which the demand is deterministic and there is a fraction of imperfect items in the lot and are screened by the buyer and sold by them at the end of the circle at discount price.  For improving fuel economy of internal combustion engines In 2016, an interesting similarity between EOQ of Melon picking and fuel injection in Gasoline Direction Injection has been proposed.

It was the first Soyuz spacecraft to carry three cosmonauts following the fatal Soyuz 11 disaster in 1971. The mission was both an early flight of the new Soyuz-T variant craft, as well as one of the later flights to the Salyut 6 station, which had successfully received several crews and visiting craft in recent years. Unlike previous habitations of the station, the crew of Soyuz T-3 did not receive any visitors, and thus did not exchange Soyuz craft with other crews for a return journey, a common practice. Crew =Backup crew= Mission summary Although the main objective of the crew's mission was to refurbish Salyut 6, part of their mission also involved testing their spacecraft. During their brief stay on Salyut 6, the crew performed experiments using the Splav and Kristall units, and studied biological material which had been carried abroad their Soyuz using the Svetoblok and Oazis units. Much of their time, however, was devoted to station maintenance. On 2 December they began conducting the Mikroklimat experiment to assess the station's living conditions, and began work on the thermal control system. They installed a new hydraulic unit with four pumps. On 4 December, they replaced electronics in the station's telemetry system. 5 December saw them repairing electrical system faults. Other repairs included replacement of a program and timing device in the onboard control system and replacement of a power supply unit for the compressor in the refueling system. The Salyut 6 Principal Expedition 4 crew in TsUP provided the crew with advice as they made their repairs. On 8 December, Progress 11 carried out an orbital correction for the complex. Upon leaving the station the craft's orbital module was left attached to Salyut 6 for a few hours, while its descent and service modules completed procedures for re-entry. This procedure was also used during the undocking of Soyuz T-4.Portree, Mir Hardware Heritage, p. 89. Soyuz T-3 returned to Earth on 11 December 1980, landing west of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakh SSR.

Despite this, the docking occurred successfully on 13 March 1981. The Progress 12 spacecraft was already docked to the station by the time the crew arrived, and they spent several days unloading the Progress before its undocking on 19 March. This freed the remaining docking port for the arrival of the Soyuz 39/EP-9 crew on 22 March. In mid-May, Kovalyonok and Savinykh replaced the spacecraft's probe with a Salyut drogue. This may have been an experiment to see if a Soyuz-T docked to a space station could act as a rescue vehicle in the event that an approaching Soyuz-T equipped with a probe experienced docking difficulties and could not return to Earth. The EO-6 crew undocked from Salyut 6 on 26 May, leaving behind the Soyuz's orbital module. Soyuz T-4 landed over three hours later, touching down east of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakh SSR.

In general, the higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond price is to the change in interest rates. Bond convexity is one of the most basic and widely used forms of convexity in finance. Convexity was based on the work of Hon-Fei Lai and popularized by Stanley Diller.Diller, Stanley (1991), Parametric Analysis of Fixed Income Securities, in Dattatreya, Ravi (ed.) Fixed Income Analytics: State-of-the-Art Debt Analysis and Valuation Modeling, Probus Publishing  Calculation of convexity  Duration is a linear measure or 1st derivative of how the price of a bond changes in response to interest rate changes. As interest rates change, the price is not likely to change linearly, but instead it would change over some curved function of interest rates. The more curved the price function of the bond is, the more inaccurate duration is as a measure of the interest rate sensitivity. Convexity is a measure of the curvature or 2nd derivative of how the price of a bond varies with interest rate, i.e. how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Specifically, one assumes that the interest rate is constant across the life of the bond and that changes in interest rates occur evenly. Using these assumptions, duration can be formulated as the first derivative of the price function of the bond with respect to the interest rate in question. Then the convexity would be the second derivative of the price function with respect to the interest rate. In actual markets, the assumption of constant interest rates and even changes is not correct, and more complex models are needed to actually price bonds. However, these simplifying assumptions allow one to quickly and easily calculate factors which describe the sensitivity of the bond prices to interest rate changes. Convexity does not assume the relationship between Bond value and interest rates to be linear. For large fluctuations in interest rates, it is a better measure than duration.Rojas Arz√∫, J., Roca, F., Risk Management and Derivatives Explained, First Edition, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, 2018, p. 44  Why bond convexities may differ  The price sensitivity to parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates is highest with a zero-coupon bond and lowest with an amortizing bond (where the payments are front-loaded). Although the amortizing bond and the zero-coupon bond have different sensitivities at the same maturity, if their final maturities differ so that they have identical bond durations then they will have identical sensitivities. That is, their prices will be affected equally by small, first-order, (and parallel) yield curve shifts. They will, however, start to change by different amounts with each further incremental parallel rate shift due to their differing payment dates and amounts. For two bonds with the same par value, coupon, and maturity, convexity may differ depending on what point on the price yield curve they are located. Suppose both of them have at present the same price yield (p-y) combination; also you have to take into consideration the profile, rating, etc. of the issuers: let us suppose they are issued by different entities. Though both bonds have the same p-y combination, bond A may be located on a more elastic segment of the p-y curve compared to bond B. This means if yield increases further, the price of bond A may fall drastically while the price of bond B won‚Äôt change; i.e. bond B holders are expecting a price rise any moment and are therefore reluctant to sell it off, while bond A holders are expecting further price-fall and are ready to dispose of it. This means bond B has a better rating than bond A. So the higher the rating or credibility of the issuer, the lower the convexity and the lower the gain from risk-return game or strategies. Less convexity means less price-volatility or risk; less risk means less return. Mathematical definition If the flat floating interest rate is r and the bond price is B, then the convexity C is defined as :C = \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\frac{d^2\\\\left(B(r)\\\\right)}{dr^2}. Another way of expressing C is in terms of the modified duration D: : \\\\frac{d}{dr} B (r) = -DB. Therefore, :CB = \\\\frac{d(-DB)}{dr} = (-D)(-DB) + \\\\left(-\\\\frac{dD}{dr}\\\\right)(B), leaving :C = D^2 - \\\\frac{dD}{dr}. Where D is a Modified Duration =How bond duration changes with a changing interest rate= Return to the standard definition of modified duration: : D = \\\\frac {1}{1+r}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\frac {P(i)t(i)}{B} where P(i) is the present value of coupon i, and t(i) is the future payment date. As the interest rate increases, the present value of longer-dated payments declines in relation to earlier coupons (by the discount factor between the early and late payments). However, bond price also declines when interest rate increases, but changes in the present value of sum of each coupons times timing (the numerator in the summation) are larger than changes in the bond price (the denominator in the summation). Therefore, increases in r must decrease the duration (or, in the case of zero-coupon bonds, leave the unmodified duration constant). Note that the modified duration D differs from the regular duration by the factor one over 1+r (shown above), which also decreases as r is increased. :\\\\frac{dD}{dr} \\\\leq 0. Given the relation between convexity and duration above, conventional bond convexities must always be positive. The positivity of convexity can also be proven analytically for basic interest rate securities. For example, under the assumption of a flat yield curve one can write the value of a coupon-bearing bond as \\\\scriptstyle B (r)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i e^{-r t_i} , where ci stands for the coupon paid at time ti. Then it is easy to see that :\\\\frac{d^2B}{dr^2} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i e^{-r t_i} t_i^2 \\\\geq 0. Note that this conversely implies the negativity of the derivative of duration by differentiating \\\\scriptstyle dB / dr\\\\ =\\\\ - D B . Application of convexity #Convexity is a risk management figure, used similarly to the way 'gamma' is used in derivatives risks management; it is a number used to manage the market risk a bond portfolio is exposed to. If the combined convexity and duration of a trading book is high, so is the risk. However, if the combined convexity and duration are low, the book is hedged, and little money will be lost even if fairly substantial interest movements occur. (Parallel in the yield curve.) #The second-order approximation of bond price movements due to rate changes uses the convexity: :: \\\\Delta B = B\\\\left[\\\\frac{C}{2}(\\\\Delta r)^2 - D\\\\Delta r\\\\right]. Effective convexity :See also: Bond duration #Embedded options and effective duration. For a bond with an embedded option, a yield to maturity based calculation of convexity (and of duration) does not consider how changes in the yield curve will alter the cash flows due to option exercise. To address this, an \\"effective\\" convexity must be calculated numerically. Effective convexity is a discrete approximation of the second derivative of the bond's value as a function of the interest rate: : \\\\text{Effective convexity} = \\\\frac {V_{-\\\\Delta y} -2V +V_{+\\\\Delta y}}{(V_0)\\\\Delta y^2} where V is the bond value as calculated using an option pricing model, Œî y is the amount that yield changes, and V_{-\\\\Delta y}\\\\text{ and } V_{+\\\\Delta y} are the values that the bond will take if the yield falls by y or rises by y, respectively (a parallel shift). These values are typically found using a tree-based model, built for the entire yield curve, and therefore capturing exercise behavior at each point in the option's life as a function of both time and interest rates; see Lattice model (finance) #Interest rate derivatives.

He won a World Series championship in 2004 with the Boston Red Sox. He has played for the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants. Cabrera is the younger brother of former major leaguer Jolbert Cabrera. Cabrera won the Gold Glove Award in 2001 and in 2007. He announced his retirement before the 2012 season. Baseball career =Montreal Expos (1997‚Äì2004)= On July 18, 1999, Cabrera popped up to end David Cone's perfect game. In 2002, he led all major league ballplayers in errors, totaling 29. In 2003, he finished second among the league shortstops in batting average (.297), slugging percentage (.415), runs batted in (80), and stolen base percentage (24-to-26). In addition, he was one of four Montreal Expos players to have played all 162 games in a season, and the first to do it twice. Also, his 17 home runs that season were the most ever by a shortstop in Expos history. Since the Expos traded Cabrera to the Red Sox in 2004, he appeared in six of the seven MLB postseasons, and at least once with every team he spent the end of the season with (2004 with Boston, 2005 and 2007 with Los Angeles, 2008 with Chicago, 2009 with Minnesota, and 2010 with Cincinnati). =Boston Red Sox (2004)= Cabrera was traded by Montreal to the Boston Red Sox in the summer of 2004, on the last day of the July trading deadline. Cabrera batted .294 with six home runs and 31 RBIs in 58 games with the Red Sox. He also brought stability to the shortstop position. The trade, which also netted first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Twins, shored up Boston's infield defense and energized the team, which went 42‚Äì19 after the deal to win the American League's wild card (56‚Äì45 before the trade). \\"He is a game-changer in the field for me\\", Curt Schilling said. He hit a home run on his first at-bat with the Red Sox on August 1, becoming the eighth Boston player to accomplish the feat. In Game 2 of the 2004 ALDS, he hit a bases-clearing double, as the Red Sox went on to sweep the 3 game series from the Los Angeles Angels. Boston went on to win its first World Series title since 1918 with a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2005‚Äì07)= Following his 2004 World Series victory with the Red Sox, Cabrera signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Angels. He replaced David Eckstein at shortstop. In 2007, Cabrera led qualified AL shortstops with a .983 fielding percentage and a league-low 11 errors, earning him the American League Gold Glove for shortstop, the first by an Angel shortstop since Jim Fregosi in 1967. Also, he stole 20 bases for the third straight year and the fifth time overall. Cabrera had a 63-game on-base streak in early-through-mid-2006, which was the sixth-longest streak of all time. Ted Williams holds the Major League record with 84 straight games reaching base. Cabrera also had a straight steal of home plate on July 2, 2006, the first such time it had been accomplished by an Angels player since 1997. Cabrera scored without a throw. Cabrera with the Chicago White Sox in 2008. =Chicago White Sox (2008)= On November 19, 2007, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with cash considerations for Jon Garland. Cabrera's one season with White Sox was marred with controversy: arguing with manager Ozzie Guill√©n, leaving the clubhouse early to avoid the media, calling the press box to have errors overturned, questioning his team's attitude, and kicking dirt at Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Grant Balfour during an at-bat in Game 1 of the AL Divisional Series.Middle relief big key in Rays' success =Oakland Athletics (2009)= On March 6, 2009, Cabrera signed a one-year deal and played middle infield with the Oakland Athletics. =Minnesota Twins (2009)= On July 31, 2009, Cabrera was traded to the Minnesota Twins with cash considerations for SS Tyler Ladendorf. In 2009, Cabrera led all major league players in errors, with 25. He had a solid offensive year, finishing the season batting .284, with 186 hits (4th among all shortstops), and 77 RBIs (1st among AL shortstops and 4th out of all shortstops). His seventh-inning, two-run home run in the American League Central Division's tiebreaker game on October 6, 2009, kept the Twins in the game, which they later won, 6‚Äì5, in the 12th inning, to advance to post-season play. Cabrera with the Cincinnati Reds in 2010. =Cincinnati Reds (2010)= On February 1, 2010, Cabrera signed a 1-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds. Cabrera spent the season as the Reds shortstop and posted a .263 average with four home runs, 42 RBIs, and a .303 on-base percentage. Cabrera played in only 123 games due to a strained oblique muscle that kept him on the DL from August 3 to September 3. The injury continued to bother him in September and into the playoffs, culminating with Dusty Baker giving him the start in game three of the NLDS despite Cabrera mentioning pain. In the first inning Cabrera made a high throw to first that allowed a run to score. While on the disabled list, Cabrera spent one game in full batboy uniform, bringing balls to the umpire and collecting bats. The Reds declined the option for 2011 on his contract with a $1 million buyout. Reds GM Walt Jocketty expressed that he wanted to bring back Cabrera at a price lower than the $4 million option. =Cleveland Indians (2011)= On February 10, 2011, Cabrera signed a one-year contract for $1 million with the Cleveland Indians. With Asdr√∫bal Cabrera in place at shortstop, Cabrera switched to playing second base. On June 12, 2011, Cabrera got his 2,000th hit in Yankee Stadium off of pitcher Freddy Garc√≠a. On July 21, Jason Kipnis was called up to share duties with Cabrera, who had hit .172 in the month of July and .244/.275/.323 for the season. =San Francisco Giants (2011)= On July 30, 2011, Cabrera was traded to the San Francisco Giants for minor league outfielder Thomas Neal. He was originally given the number 6, but opted to wear number 43, out of respect for J. T. Snow. =Retirement= On January 18, 2012, Cabrera announced his retirement on a radio show in his native home country of Colombia.http://22gigantes.com/2012/01/orlando-cabrera-retires-from- baseball.html In November of the same year, his brother Jolbert said Orlando could have come out of retirement and played for the Colombia national baseball team if they had advanced to the final round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Personal life Cabrera became a naturalized U.S. citizen on May 19, 2011, in South Carolina. Cabrera, a Colombian national, had faced extra scrutiny when traveling through customs due to Colombia's reputation for drug trafficking. , he lives in Windham, New Hampshire.

Slow match, also called match cord, is the slow-burning cord or twine fuse used by early gunpowder musketeers, artillerymen, and soldiers to ignite matchlock muskets, cannons, shells, and petards. Slow matches were most suitable for use around black-powder weapons because a slow match could be roughly handled without going out, and only presented a small glowing tip instead of a large flame that risked igniting nearby gunpowder. Slow match of various types was one of the first kinds of artillery fuse. Slow matches were also used in the drilling and blasting of rock to ignite charges of gunpowder.  Design and use  The slow match attached to the lock of the matchlock gun was usually a length of hemp or flax cord that had been chemically treated to make it burn slowly and consistently for an extended period. In Japan, however, match cord was made from braiding together strands of bark from the Japanese cypress. The rate of burning was approximately 1 ft (305mm) per hour. The British Army estimated that a single soldier on guard duty, for one year, could use an entire mile worth of match cord. In practical use on a matchlock, both ends of the match cord were often ignited, as the flash of gunpowder in the flash pan could often extinguish one end of the match cord, and the remaining end could then be used to reignite the firing end of the cord upon reloading the matchlock musket. To prevent dragging the match cord on the wet ground, a linstock was often carried and used, it being a forked wooden support inserted into the ground and used for holding the end of the match cord farthest removed from the matchlock. Many formulas for match cord exist, providing varying burn rates. The predominant chemical used was potassium nitrate, although sodium nitrate, and lead(II) acetate also appear to have been used. Potassium nitrate, however, had an advantage over sodium nitrate, through being less likely to absorb atmospheric moisture. Match cord was often used from the 15th century until about 1630, when the flintlock started its rise to prominence. (The arrival of the snaplock after 1540 had only limited impact on match cord use, snaplocks generally being considered a peasant's weapon.) Match cord remained in use with limited numbers of matchlocks in Europe until approximately 1730, and in Japan until the early 1900s. Even once it became obsolete for small arms use, some artillery users (notably the Royal Navy) continued to deploy it as a backup until the end of the flintlock era. Historic England published a well illustrated account of the investigation of conservation work on a slow match pouch found in the intertidal zone at Medmerry, West Sussex, now in the collection of the National Museum of the Royal Navy. Artillery demonstrator with burning slow match  Modern use and replacements  Modern-day slow match (used with replica matchlock firearms) is sometimes made of cotton cord, instead of hemp, due to legalities associated with growing hemp plants. For faster burning and modern-day applications such as for igniting fireworks, either tubed black match (sometimes termed quick match) or punk are generally used instead of slow match.

The original name of the organization was the National Association of Lubricating Grease Manufacturers, Inc. The name was changed in 1937 as the industry recognized the need for a joint development and standards association and membership grew. The NLGI is a not-for-profit corporation whose membership includes grease manufacturers and sales organizations, associated equipment manufacturers, industry suppliers, service organizations, research and educational groups. Membership is open to corporations and individuals. According to information posted by the NLGI in 2004, the institute has member organizations in 26 countries, while subscriptions to its journal, the NLGI Spokesman, represent 50 countries.  Standards  In cooperation with ASTM International and SAE International, the NLGI has developed the categorisation of lubricating greases specified in standard ‚Äústandard classification and specification for automotive service greases‚Äù, reproduced in standard ‚Äúautomotive lubricating greases‚Äù. The NLGI retains jurisdiction over the designation and definition of the categories, which it publishes in its ‚Äúchassis and wheel bearing service classification system‚Äù.

Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler, the spacecraft was launched on March 7, 2009, into an Earth- trailing heliocentric orbit. The principal investigator was William J. Borucki. After nine years of operation, the telescope's reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018. Designed to survey a portion of Earth's region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zones and estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets, Kepler's sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. These data are transmitted to Earth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star. Only planets whose orbits are seen edge-on from Earth can be detected. During its over nine and a half years of service, Kepler observed 530,506 stars and detected 2,662 planets. History The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system. The Ames Research Center is responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was 3.5 years, but greater-than- expected noise in the data, from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016,\\"NASA Extends Planet- Hunting Kepler Mission Through 2016\\". Space.com. April 4, 2012. Retrieved May 2, 2012. but on July 14, 2012, one of the spacecraft's four reaction wheels used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if all other reaction wheels remained reliable. Then, on May 11, 2013, a second reaction wheel failed, disabling the collection of science dataNASA ‚Äì Kepler Mission Manager Update (May 21, 2013) and threatening the continuation of the mission. On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting. NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans \\"potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters\\". On November 18, 2013, the K2 \\"Second Light\\" proposal was reported. This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detect habitable planets around smaller, dimmer red dwarfs. On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension. By January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations had found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems, along with a further 3,199 unconfirmed planet candidates. Four planets have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission. In November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion rocky Earth-size exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun- like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way. It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be away, according to the scientists. On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars: three of the four, Kepler-438b, Kepler-442b and Kepler-452b, are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth, Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth. On May 10, 2016, NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanets found by Kepler, the single largest finding of planets to date. Kepler data has also helped scientists observe and understand supernovae; measurements were collected every half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events. On October 30, 2018, after the spacecraft ran out of fuel, NASA announced that the telescope would be retired. The telescope was shut down the same day, bringing an end to its nine-year service. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime. A newer NASA mission, TESS, launched in 2018, is continuing the search for exoplanets. Spacecraft design left Interactive 3D model of Kepler The telescope has a mass of and contains a Schmidt camera with a front corrector plate (lens) feeding a primary mirror‚Äîat the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit, though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg2 (about 12-degree diameter) field of view (FOV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg2 is of science quality, with less than 11% vignetting. The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry, rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a m(V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (see mission status). =Camera= Kepler's image sensor array. The array is curved to account for Petzval field curvature. The focal plane of the spacecraft's camera is made out of forty-two CCDs at 2200√ó1024 pixels each, possessing a total resolution of 94.6 megapixels, which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space. The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator. The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets. Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission, the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid- state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars, p-mode stars, smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images. =Primary mirror= Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the Kepler telescope and other notable optical telescopes. The Kepler primary mirror is in diameter. Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass, the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size. In order to produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Using ion assisted evaporation, Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption. =Photometric performance= In terms of photometric performance, Kepler worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted. Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80 ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7 œÉ event, instead of the intended 4 œÉ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets. On April 4, 2012, the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016, but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (see Spacecraft history below). =Orbit and orientation= Kepler's search volume, in the context of the Milky Way The motion of Kepler relative to Earth, slowly drifting away from Earth in a similar orbit, looking like a spiral over time Kepler orbits the Sun, which avoids Earth occultations, stray light, and gravitational perturbations and torques inherent in an Earth orbit. NASA has characterized Kepler's orbit as \\"Earth-trailing\\". With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles per annum). , the distance to Kepler from Earth was about . This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years. Until 2013 the photometer pointed to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco, which is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits. This is also the direction of the Solar System's motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the galactic center as the Solar System, and also close to the galactic plane. This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the Rare Earth hypothesis. Orientation is 3-axis stabilised by sensing rotations using fine-guidance sensors located on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, e.g. as used on Hubble).Kepler press kit and using reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters to control the orientation. =Operations= Kepler's orbit. The telescope's solar array was adjusted at solstices and equinoxes. Kepler was operated out of Boulder, Colorado, by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) under contract to Ball Aerospace & Technologies. The spacecraft's solar array was rotated to face the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes, so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space. Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace control the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the University of Colorado. LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission's initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation. In 2012, NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year. Communications NASA contacted the spacecraft using the X band communication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the Ka band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550 kB/s. The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to Earth.Kepler press kit The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth. Data management Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated FITS-format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the Kepler Science Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC: #Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC #Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star #Performs transit searches for detection of planets (threshold-crossing events, or TCEs) #Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project's scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST). Reaction wheel failures On July 14, 2012, one of the four reaction wheels used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed. While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field. After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending Kepler's primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable, and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's remaining capabilities. This effort ultimately led to the \\"K2\\" follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic. =Operational timeline= Kepler's launch on March 7, 2009 Interior illustration of Kepler A 2004 illustration of Kepler In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA. It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems. At this time, the high-gain antenna was changed from a gimbal-led design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009, at 03:49:57 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55 UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7, 2009, and the first light images were taken on the next day. On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return. On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree. On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars. On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had entered safe mode on June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by a processor reset. The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day. On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides power to the RAD750 processor. On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of Kepler's 42 CCDs. , the module was described as \\"failed\\", but the coverage still exceeded the science goals. Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data about once per month‚Äîan example of such a downlink was on November 22‚Äì23, 2010. Field of view Diagram of Kepler's investigated area with celestial coordinates The photometer's field of view in the constellations Cygnus, Lyra and Draco Kepler has a fixed field of view (FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates and where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the top left corner. The mission website has a calculatormission website calculator that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the Kepler Follow-up Program, or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations. Kepler's field of view covers 115 square degrees, around 0.25 percent of the sky, or \\"about two scoops of the Big Dipper\\". Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like telescopes to cover the whole sky. The Kepler field contains portions of the constellations Cygnus, Lyra, and Draco. The nearest star system in Kepler's field of view is the trinary star system Gliese 1245, 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ¬± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths. Objectives and methods The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals: * To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone (often called \\"Goldilocks planets\\") of a wide variety of spectral types of stars. * To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets. * To estimate how many planets there are in multiple- star systems. * To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets. * To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques. * Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems. Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other projects were giant planets, mostly the size of Jupiter and bigger. Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth's mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, the transit method, involves observing repeated transit of planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star's apparent magnitude, on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet's orbital period, from which estimates of its orbital semi-major axis (using Kepler's laws) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated. The probability of a random planetary orbit being along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit. For an Earth-size planet at 1 AU transiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210. For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%; If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes‚Äîan assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation. For instance, if a Kepler-like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 7% chance that it would also see Venus transiting. Kepler's 115 deg2 field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the Hubble Space Telescope, which has a field of view of only 10 sq. arc-minutes. Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler's field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the main sequence. Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400‚Äì865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations. All the selected stars are observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars. Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer. Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying variable stars of various types and performing asteroseismology, particularly on stars showing solar-like oscillations. Planet finding process =Finding planet candidates= Artist's impression of Kepler Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries. Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list. Not all the planet candidates go through this process. Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation. =Confirming planet candidates= Kepler mission ‚Äì new exoplanet candidates ‚Äì as of June 19, 2017. Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests. Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with more- advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal. Another method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object. Through other detection methods There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, called doppler spectroscopy, requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed through transit timing variation by looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way.The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) Planet-finding Technique Begins to Flower Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets. In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars' orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system. In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations‚Äîlike the Moon, they go through phases from full to new and back again. Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small‚Äîthe photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar- type star‚ÄîJupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet's orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles. Kepler's photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star's brightness changes caused by doppler beaming or a star's shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable. However, there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetary-mass companions such as TrES-2b. Through validation If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method was Kepler-22b which was also observed with a Spitzer space telescope in addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities. Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes. In 2014, a new confirmation method called \\"validation by multiplicity\\" was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system. Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries. Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time. A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from Kepler data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway. PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler-420b. Mission results open star cluster NGC 6791. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. Detail of Kepler image of the investigated area. The location of TrES-2b within this image is shown. Celestial north is towards the lower left corner. The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. , Kepler has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,512 confirmed exoplanets. =2009= NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6, 2009. At this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b, and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets. Because Kepler's detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves (variable stars) are not useful in this search. From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars. These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars. The first new planet candidate observed by Kelper was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star. However, it was confirmed ten years later and is now designated Kepler-1658b. The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars. Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found, two low-mass white dwarfs that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects, and Kepler-16b, a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star. =2010= On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates. Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates. NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the Kepler team to perform follow-up observations. The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011. (See the Kepler results for 2011 below.) The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size tail of the size distribution. This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets would be relatively infrequent. Page 18 in particular states that models that required a near collision of stars imply about 1% will have planets. Based on extrapolations from the Kepler data, an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic. Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding that Kepler had actually found these planets. This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center, for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010 states, \\"Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like planets.\\" In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars: KOI 74 and KOI 81. These objects are probably low-mass white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass transfer in their systems. =2011= A size comparison of the exoplanets Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f with Venus and Earth On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16, 2009. They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow assume the candidates are really planets, though the official papers called them only candidates. Independent analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets and not false positives). 68 planets were approximately Earth-size, 288 super-Earth-size, 662 Neptune- size, 165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones. That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the \\"habitable zone\\", including five less than twice the size of Earth. There were previously only two planets thought to be in the \\"habitable zone\\", so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of \\"Goldilocks planets\\" (planets of the right temperature to support liquid water). All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like stars will take several additional years to accumulate the three transits required for detection). Of all the new planet candidates, 68 are 125% of Earth's size or smaller, or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets. \\"Earth-size\\" and \\"super-Earth-size\\" is defined as \\"less than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)\\" [(or, Rp ‚â§ 2.0 Re) ‚Äì Table 5]. Six such planet candidates [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) ‚Äì Table 6] are in the \\"habitable zone.\\" A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported. The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet systems. By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20. Based on Kepler's findings, astronomer Seth Shostak estimated in 2011 that \\"within a thousand light-years of Earth\\", there are \\"at least 30,000\\" habitable planets. Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated that there are \\"at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way\\", of which \\"at least 500 million\\" are in the habitable zone. In March 2011, astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that about \\"1.4 to 2.7 percent\\" of all Sun-like stars are expected to have Earth-size planets \\"within the habitable zones of their stars\\". This means there are \\"two billion\\" of these \\"Earth analogs\\" in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers also noted that there are \\"50 billion other galaxies\\", potentially yielding more than one sextillion \\"Earth analog\\" planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way. =2012= In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported that each star in the Milky Way may host \\"on average...at least 1.6 planets\\", suggesting that over 160 billion star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way. Kepler also recorded distant stellar super-flares, some of which are 10,000 times more powerful than the 1859 Carrington event. The superflares may be triggered by close-orbiting Jupiter-sized planets. The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) technique, which was used to discover Kepler-9d, gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries.The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) Planet-finding Technique Begins to Flower. NASA.gov. A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a system had been discovered.Planet Hunters Find Circumbinary Planet in 4-Star System ‚Äì 10.16.2012. , there were a total of 2,321 candidates. Of these, 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune- size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that 5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and that 17% of all stars have multiple planets. =2013= A chart showing Kepler discoveries, in context of all discovered exoplanets (through 2013), with some transit probabilities indicated for example scenarios. According to a study by Caltech astronomers published in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100‚Äì400 billion exoplanets. The study, based on planets orbiting the star Kepler-32, suggests that planetary systems may be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7, 2013.NASA's Kepler Mission Discovers 461 New Planet Candidates The longer Kepler watches, the more planets with long periods it can detect. A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, was Kepler-69c (formerly, KOI-172.02), an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable zone and possibly habitable. In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI-256 star system. In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-size exoplanets‚ÄîKepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Kepler-69c‚Äîin the habitable zones of their respective host stars, Kepler-62 and Kepler-69. The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment. A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable. On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously failed, and the telescope required three wheels (out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to function properly. Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured. Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was a backlog of data still to be looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years, despite the setback. Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem, an additional sixty- three candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations.NASA ‚Äì Kepler Mission Manager Update: Preparing for Recovery In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference was held. The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013, preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone. =2014= Histogram of exoplanet discoveries. The yellow shaded bar shows newly announced planets including those verified by the multiplicity technique (February 26, 2014). On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems. Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone. This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014. On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called \\"verification by multiplicity\\" which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water. In March, a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1‚Äì50 days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter. On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler-186f, the first nearly Earth-sized planet located in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red dwarf. In May 2014, K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail. K2 observations began in June 2014. In July 2014, the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries. Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0 in preparation to the main K2 mission. On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that the K2 mission had completed campaign 1, the first official set of science observations, and that campaign 2 was underway. Kepler observed KSN 2011b, a Type Ia supernova, in the process of exploding: before, during and after. Campaign 3 lasted from November 14, 2014 to February 6, 2015 and included \\"16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets\\". =2015= * In January 2015, the number of confirmed Kepler planets exceeded 1000. At least two (Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b) of the discovered planets announced that month were likely rocky and in the habitable zone. Also in January 2015, NASA reported that five confirmed sub-earth-sized rocky exoplanets, all smaller than the planet Venus, were found orbiting the 11.2 billion year old star Kepler-444, making this star system, at 80% of the age of the universe, the oldest yet discovered. * In April 2015, campaign 4 was reported to last between February 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015, and to include observations of nearly 16,000 target stars and two notable open star clusters, Pleiades and Hyades. * In May 2015, Kepler observed a newly discovered supernova, KSN 2011b (Type 1a), before, during and after explosion. Details of the pre-nova moments may help scientists better understand dark energy. * On July 24, 2015, NASA announced the discovery of Kepler-452b, a confirmed exoplanet that is near- Earth in size and found orbiting the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. The seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog was released, containing 4,696 candidates, and increase of 521 candidates since the previous catalog release in January 2015. * On September 14, 2015, astronomers reported unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852, an F-type main-sequence star in the constellation Cygnus, as detected by Kepler, while searching for exoplanets. Various hypotheses have been presented, including comets, asteroids, and an alien civilization. =2016= By May 10, 2016, the Kepler mission had verified 1,284 new planets. Based on their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone: *Kepler-560b *Kepler-705b *Kepler-1229b *Kepler-1410b *Kepler-1455b *Kepler-1544b *Kepler-1593b *Kepler-1606b *Kepler-1638b Mission status Kepler was launched in 2009. It was very successful at finding exoplanets, but failures in two of four reaction wheels crippled its extended mission in 2013. Without three functioning wheels, the telescope could not be pointed accurately. On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended. =Extension= Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original Kepler search space. In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals. On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler's primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel. =Reaction wheel issues= In July 2012, one of Kepler's four reaction wheels (wheel 2) failed. On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting. Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy. On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels. A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation. Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful. On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a \\"rest\\" state to conserve fuel. Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests. Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth. On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed. An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters. Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler's limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost. Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing. Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler's field of view, they will drift. However, proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view. Previously collected data continues to be analyzed. = Second Light (K2)= In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 \\"Second Light\\" was presented for consideration. K2 would involve using Kepler's remaining capability, photometric precision of about 300 parts per million, compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect data for the study of \\"supernova explosions, star formation and Solar-System bodies such as asteroids and comets, ... \\" and for finding and studying more exoplanets. In this proposed mission plan, Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. Celestial objects, including exoplanets, stars and others, detected by the K2 mission would be associated with the EPIC acronym, standing for Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog. In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission. From March to May 2014, data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run. On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission. Kepler's photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. In February 2014, photometric precision for the K2 mission using two-wheel, fine-point precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration. The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data. On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail. K2 proposal explained (December 11, 2013). Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo-Virgo region of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the \\"head\\" area of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters, Messier 4 and Messier 80, and part of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association, which is only about 11 million years old and distant with probably over 1,000 members. On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, a super-Earth named HIP 116454 b. Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the full K2 mission. Radial velocity follow-up observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected. During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded them priority access to NASA's Deep Space Network. By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it was placed into point-rest state, a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn. At that time, the cause of the emergency was unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler's reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to support K2 Campaign 9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations. Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22. The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks. In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion of on-board fuel in 2018. In August 2018, NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode, applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance, and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign, finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted. Data releases The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations. However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection. On this schedule, the data from the quarter ending June 2010 was scheduled to be released in June 2013. This resulted in considerable criticism, leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection. The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012. =Follow-ups by others= Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates (Kepler Objects of Interest, or KOIs) to the public. Using this information, a team of astronomers collected radial velocity data using the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-428b in 2010, later named Kepler-40b. In 2011, the same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later named Kepler-39b. =Citizen scientist participation= Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used for the Planet Hunters project, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer algorithms might miss. By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team. The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets. In January 2012, the BBC program Stargazing Live aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers‚Äîone in Peterborough, England‚Äîto discover a new Neptune-sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B. One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012. One such exoplanet, PH1b (or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet, PH2b (Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013. In April 2017, ABC Stargazing Live, a variation of BBC Stargazing Live, launched the Zooniverse project \\"Exoplanet Explorers\\". While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later named K2-138, with a Sun-like star and four super-Earths in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates. The citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published. Confirmed exoplanets Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones (Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f, Kepler-296e, Kepler-296f, Kepler-438b, Kepler-440b, Kepler-442b). Exoplanets discovered using Kepler data, but confirmed by outside researchers, include KOI-423b, KOI-428b, KOI-196b, KOI-135b, KOI-204b, Kepler-45 (formerly KOI-254b), KOI-730, and Kepler-42 (formerly KOI-961). The \\"KOI\\" acronym indicates that the star is a Kepler Object of Interest. Kepler Input Catalog The Kepler Input Catalog is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission. The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft. Solar System observations Kepler has been assigned an observatory code in order to report its astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center. In 2013 the alternative NEOKepler mission was proposed, a search for near-Earth objects, in particular potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth's orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission. Kepler's first discovery in the Solar System, however, was , a 200-kilometer cold classical Kuiper belt object located beyond the orbit of Neptune. Retirement Artwork commissioned by NASA to commemorate the retirement of Kepler in October‚ÄìNovember 2018. On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope, having run out of fuel, and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2,600 exoplanets, has been officially retired, and will maintain its current, safe orbit, away from Earth.

McClory was best known for producing the James Bond film Thunderball and for his legal battles with the character's creator, Ian Fleming (later United Artists, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Eon Productions). Early years McClory was born in D√∫n Laoghaire, County Dublin, in 1924, to noted actor Thomas John O'Donovan McClory (stage name Desmond O'Donovan) and Winifrede (n√©e Doran), a writer, teacher and actress. He suffered from dyslexia. McClory's ancestry goes back to the famous Bronte family. Elinor McClory was the mother of Patrick Prunty who changed his name to Bronte when he emigrated from Ireland to England in 1802. Patrick was the father of Emily, Anne, Charlotte, and Branwell Bront√´. McClory's parents, Thomas John O'Donovan McClory (stage name Desmond O'Donovan) and Winifred (n√©e Doran) were actors and theatre producers in Ireland. Second World War As a teenaged radio officer in the British Merchant Navy, McClory endured attacks by German U-boats on two different occasions. The first attack occurred on 20 September 1942 was while he was serving aboard The Mathilda. A U-Boat surfaced and attacked the ship with heavy machine gun fire. The crew of the ship fired back and the U-Boat retreated. The second attack occurred on 21 February 1943 when McClory was serving on the Norwegian tanker Stigstad, which was attacked by torpedo from multiple U-boats. The ship sank and McClory and the other survivors made it to a life raft. They survived in terrible conditions for two weeks and traveled more than 600 miles before being rescued off the coast of Ireland. Two seaman died on the raft and a third died soon after they were rescued. McClory suffered severe frostbite and lost the ability to speak for more than a year after the incident. When he recovered his voice he was left with a pronounced stammer. He served out the rest of the war in the British Navy. 1950s McClory started a career at Shepperton Studios in Middlesex as a film boom operator and location manager, where he worked on The Cockleshell Heroes for Warwick Films. He was an assistant to John Huston on films including The African Queen (1951) and Moulin Rouge (1952). He was an assistant director on Huston's version of Moby-Dick (1956), and associate producer and second-unit director on Mike Todd's Around the World in 80 Days (also 1956). McClory was romantically involved with Elizabeth Taylor. Although he and Taylor reportedly had plans to marry, she eventually left him for her future husband Mike Todd. Todd and McClory fell out over Taylor, yet they managed to complete the final cut of the film side by side. The trio would eventually reconcile, and they remained friends until Todd's untimely death in 1958.A Valuable Property: The Life Story Of Michael Todd by Michael Todd Jr and Susan McCarthy Todd.C. David Heymann. Liz: An Intimate Biography of Elizabeth Taylor In 1957, McClory led an expedition of 25 men in an attempt to drive around the world. He filmed a documentary of the adventure, One Road, as well as a series of ads for his sponsor Ford Motor Company. The team completed the journey in 104 days. He later wrote, produced and directed the 1957 film The Boy and the Bridge, with financial assistance from heiress Josephine Hartford Bryce (sister of Huntington Hartford) and her husband Ivor Bryce, a friend of Ian Fleming.Callan, Michael Feeney Sean Connery Random House, 31 Oct 2012 1960s Bryce was a close friend of Ian Fleming. In 1958 Fleming approached McClory to produce the first Bond film. McClory rejected all of Fleming's books but felt that the character James Bond could be adapted for the screen. McClory, Bryce, Fleming and Jack Whittingham developed the new James Bond character through a number of treatments and screenplays. McClory, Fleming and Bryce settled on the screenplay Longitude 78 West (later renamed Thunderball) and went into pre-production. Fleming had assigned his interest in the film to McClory and Bryce's company Xanadu and would make no more money from the project. He conspired with Bryce to force McClory out of the film, denying that McClory had any legal interest in the screenplays and treatments that had been written during their collaboration. Later and without permission, Fleming novelised the draft screenplay Thunderball, his ninth novel, in 1961, which initially did not credit McClory or Whittingham. The two sued, and the case opened to the High Court in London on 20 November 1963. After nine days, the case was settled. Fleming paid McClory damages of ¬£35,000 and his court costs of ¬£52,000, and future versions of the novel were credited as \\"based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming\\" ‚Äì in that order. Fleming and Bryce conveyed to McClory any rights they held in the screenplays and treatments that McClory, Whittingham and Fleming had written during their collaboration. Fleming conveyed to McClory the worldwide film rights in the novel Thunderball. Harry Saltzman's and Albert R. Broccoli's production company Eon Productions later made a deal with McClory for Thunderball to be made into a film in 1965, with McClory producing. Under the deal, Eon licensed McClory's rights for a period of ten years and in return they assigned to McClory any rights they had in the scripts and treatments. McClory made an uncredited cameo in the film. In 1968 McClory announced plans to make a film about Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, to star Richard Harris. The film was to have been shot at Ardmore Studios in 1969 but was never made. 1970s‚Äì1980s In 1975, McClory and Richard Harris took out a full page ad in the Nassau Tribune \\"demanding an end to internment without trial\\" in Northern Ireland. Conservative opposition leader Edward Heath who was visiting Nassau at the time called a press conference and advised \\"Harris and McClory to 'ask their friends to stop murdering people.'\\" In 1976, McClory announced he was to produce an original James Bond film to be titled either Warhead, Warhead 8, or James Bond of the Secret Service, but the project was severely hampered as a result of legal action brought by the Fleming Trustees and United Artists. McClory won the case. The Trustees and United Artists appealed to the Supreme Court of Judictature The Senior Courts of England and Wales but again they lost to McClory. Lord Justices Waller, Fox and May affirmed McClory's right to make James Bond films and enjoined the Plaintiffs from taking similar legal action against McClory in the future. McClory went on to licence his rights to Jack Schwartzman. The resulting film titled Never Say Never Again starred Sean Connery as Agent 007 in a highly publicized return to the role after a 12-year absence. In 1989, McClory attempted to recycle the Warhead script again, retitling the project Atomic Warfare. He approached Pierce Brosnan who had missed out on the role of James Bond to Timothy Dalton due to his contract with NBC's Remington Steele. 1990s‚Äì2000s McClory subsequently continued to try to make other adaptations of Thunderball, including Warhead 2000 A.D. which was to be made by Sony. MGM/UA took legal action against Sony and McClory in the United States to prevent the film going into production. MGM/UA abandoned the claim after settling with Sony. His rights were untouched. In 2004 Sony acquired 20% of MGM; however, the production and final say over everything involving the film version of James Bond is controlled by Eon Productions, Albert R. Broccoli's production company and its parent company Danjaq, LLC. Prior to Sony's settlement with MGM in 1999, they filed a lawsuit against MGM claiming McClory was the co-author of the cinematic 007 and was owed fees from Danjaq and MGM for all past films. This lawsuit was thrown out in 2000 on the ground that McClory had waited too long to bring his claims. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed this decision in 2001. 2010s On 15 November 2013 MGM and Danjaq, LLC announced they had acquired all rights and interests of McClory's estate. MGM, Danjaq and the McClory estate issued a statement saying that they had brought to an \\"amicable conclusion the legal and business disputes that have arisen periodically for over 50 years.\\" Personal life McClory was married twice. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. His first wife was Frederica Ann Sigrist, daughter of Fred Sigrist. He later married Elizabeth O'Brien, daughter of the racehorse trainer Vincent O'Brien. They lived at Baltyboys House in Blessington, County Wicklow. Death He died on 20 November 2006, aged 82, at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, County Dublin, from a cerebral hemorrhage, four days after the British release of Casino Royale.

It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards the front of the engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the camshaft timing being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the camshaft timing depending on factors such as engine load and RPM. For twin cam or DOHC engines, VCT was used on either the intake or exhaust camshaft. (Engines that have VCT on both camshafts are now designated as Ti-VCT.‚Üì) The use of variable camshaft timing on the exhaust camshaft is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the exhaust camshaft do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the exhaust cam timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize the opening of the intake valves to match the engine conditions. VCT is used in Ford's Triton 5.4L 3-valve V8 engine, the Australian Barra 182 and 240 Inline-6s, and Ford's 4.6L 3-valve V8 engine used in the 2006-2010 Ford Explorer and 2005-2010 Ford Mustang GT. The 2.0L Zetec Inline-4 used in the 1998-2003 Ford Escort ZX2, Ford Contour, and 99-02 Mercury Cougar used VCT on the exhaust camshaft. The 2002-2004 SVT Focus (ST170 in Europe) also featured VCT, but on the intake camshaft of its modified version of the 2.0L Zetec engine. In addition, the 1.7L Zetec-S engine found in the European Ford Puma was equipped with variable camshaft timing. The 6.2L V8 introduced in the 2010 SVT Raptor also uses VCT. That motor has a single cam per bank, so it is dual-equal variable cam timing. Ti-VCT Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) is the name given by Ford to engines with the ability to advance or retard the timing of both the intake and exhaust camshafts independently, unlike the original versions of VCT, which only operated on a single camshaft. This allows for improved power and torque, particularly at lower engine RPM, as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. Some Ford Ti-VCT engines use BorgWarner's Cam Torque Actuation (CTA) which utilizes the \\"existing torsional energy in the valve train to rotate the camshaft\\" instead of traditional oil pressure driven cam phasing. Many new Ford engines feature Ti-VCT, including ones used in the 2011-2015 Mustang, 2011 Edge and Edge Sport, 2011 Lincoln MKX, 2011 Fiesta, 2011 Explorer, 2011-2016 F-150, and 2012 Focus. Engines Using CTA System: 5.0 Coyote Engines without CTA: 3.7 Cyclone Joseph Haefner pioneered the breakthrough cam phasing valve production in 2002/2003. He standardized the supply chain quality and production systems, refined manufacturing, and resolved all manufacturing process issues to achieve zero parts per million defects with 6 months of production startup. The first application of cam phasing was for Volvo, owned by Ford at that time.

Life Rallying to Philip van Artevelde in the Ghent Revolt of 1379 against Louis II, Count of Flanders, Ackerman was placed in command of the Reisers, a mobile force of 3,000 men responsible for securing the city's supply-lines with Li√®ge, Brussels and Leuven.J.J. De Smet, \\"Ackerman (Fran√ßois)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 1 (Brussels, 1866), 14‚Äì18. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Beverhoutsveld (3 May 1382), which led to the taking of Bruges and put almost all of Flanders under the control of Ghent. With the king of France lending support to the count of Flanders, Ackerman undertook an embassy to England to seek the intervention of King Richard II.Alberdingk Thijm, \\"Ackerman, Franz\\", Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. 1 (1875), pp. 33‚Äì34. During his absence, the rebels suffered a serious defeat in the Battle of Roosebeke (27 November 1382), where Van Artevelde himself was slain. The count regained control of all of Flanders except the city of Ghent, where Ackerman became the rebel leader. The English launched Despenser's Crusade in 1383, intervening in Flanders under the pretext of enforcing obedience to Pope Urban VI. Ackerman took Aardenburg from a French garrison, sacking the town and carrying the plunder to Ghent, and made an unsuccessful attempt on Bruges. Together with his English allies he was victorious at the Battle of Dunkirk (25 May 1383). He then took Oudenaarde by stratagem. When the count died in 1384, he was succeeded by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who had married the count's daughter, Margaret III, Countess of Flanders. Duke Philip continued the war. Ackerman took the town of Damme in a surprise attack, but was soon besieged within it by the army of Charles VI of France. The expected help from the English not arriving, his force broke out and returned to Ghent. On 18 December 1385, the war ended with the Peace of Tournai between Ghent and Philip the Bold. Ackerman was a prominent member of the Ghent delegation who agreed the terms, but afterwards declined to serve the duke either at court or in the field. On 22 July 1387, while on his way to Saint Peter's Abbey, Ghent, Ackerman was murdered by a son of the Lord of Herzele who blamed him for his father's death.

Salyut 7 was similar to the Salyut 6 (1977‚Äì1982) space station it superseded, but featured a number of improvements. The Soyuz T-5 spacecraft docked with Salyut 7 in orbit, and it was visited by the 2nd and 3rd expeditions to the space station. One advantage the new Salyut 7 station had over Salyut 6, was continuously available hot water. The Elbrus crew ejected a 28-kg amateur radio satellite from a Salyut 7 trash airlock on May 17, 1982. The Soviets called this the first launch of a communications satellite from a crewed space vehicle. They did this ahead of the launch of two large geostationary satellites from the U.S. Space Shuttle (STS-5, November 11‚Äì16, 1982). On May 25, the Elbrus crew reoriented Salyut 7 so the aft end of the Progress pointed toward Earth. This placed the station in gravity-gradient stabilization. Lebedev remarked in his diary that the attitude control jets were ‚Äúvery noisy,‚Äù and that they sounded like ‚Äúhitting a barrel with a sledgehammer.‚Äù Of Salyut 7 during the unpacking of Progress 13, Lebedev said, ‚ÄúIt looks like we‚Äôre getting ready to move or have just moved to a new apartment.‚Äù The following day the Elbrus crew closed the hatch from the work compartment into the intermediate compartment so the TsUP could pump fuel from Progress 13 to Salyut 7. The crew monitored the operation but played little active role in it. May 29 was spent organizing the supplies delivered. At the same time, according to Lebedev, ‚Äúwe filled the resupply ship with what we don‚Äôt need and tied them down with ropes. When I enter the resupply ship, it jingles with a metallic sound, so when we separate it will sound like a brass band.‚Äù Progress 13 pumped 300 liters of water aboard on May 31.

During the Cretaceous period, about 145 to 66 million years ago, most of what are now the central plains and the Southeastern United States were covered by shallow seas. Tiny marine plankton grew in those seas, and their carbonate skeletons accumulated into massive chalk formations. That chalk eventually became a fertile soil, highly suitable for growing crops. The Black Belt arc was the shoreline of one of those seas, where large amounts of chalk had collected in the shallow waters.  History  Before the 19th century, this region was a mosaic of prairies and oak- hickory forest. In the 1820s and 1830s, the region was identified as prime land for upland cotton plantations. Short-staple cotton did well here, and its profitable processing was made possible by invention of the cotton gin. It grew better in the upland regions than did the long-staple cotton of the Low Country. =Social-Economic region= After 1865, the phrase was sometimes used to describe a geopolitical region, much as the terms snow belt, rust belt, sun belt and bible belt are used today. Booker T. Washington wrote in his 1901 autobiography > I have often been asked to define the term \\"Black Belt.\\" So far as I can > learn, the term was first used to designate a part of the country which was > distinguished by the colour of the soil. The part of the country possessing > this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the > South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were > taken there in the largest numbers. Later, and especially since the war, the > term seems to be used wholly in a political sense‚Äîthat is, to designate the > counties where the black people outnumber the white. Since the 1920s the term Black Belt fell out of favor as a term outside of the specialized field of physical geology, but various authors have written about the fact that the Black Belt geographical formation contained a large number of slaves before the American Civil War, many of whom worked the cotton plantations.Arthur Raper, \\"The Black Belt\\", Southern Spaces, 2004 Some publications still use the phrase to refer to the geopolitical region.

Previously, he played in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians (1998‚Äì2002), Los Angeles Dodgers (2002‚Äì2003), Seattle Mariners (2004), and Cincinnati Reds (2008). Cabrera hits and throws right-handed. He is the older brother of former shortstop Orlando Cabrera. The two played together during the 1997 season while members of the Ottawa Lynx, the Montreal Expos Triple-A affiliate. Cabrera made his major league debut with the Indians on April 12, 1998, in the only game he played that season. 2001 was Cabrera's best statistical season in Cleveland, as he slashed a line of .261/3/38 with ten stolen bases for the division winning Indians. He was traded on July 22, 2002 to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitcher Lance Caraccioli. He remained there until an early season trade in 2004 sent him to Seattle. He was released in 2005. During the 2007 offseason, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals that included an invitation to spring training. After spending most of the year with their Triple-A affiliate, the Memphis Redbirds, Cabrera was released and signed a minor league contract with Colorado Rockies. On January 5, 2008, Cabrera signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds and was called up to the majors on June 10. On September 7, 2008, Cabrera hit a walk-off single against the Cubs to win the game 4‚Äì3. On January 12, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. On January 15, 2010, it was reported that Cabrera had signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets with an invitation to spring training. In an eight-year career, Cabrera had a batting average of .257 with 18 home runs and 157 RBI in 609 games. Cabrera currently resides in Cleveland, Ohio with his three daughters: Alexandra, Ashlyn, and Ashanty. He is a part-owner of the Dave's Cosmic Subs franchise in Chagrin Falls, OH.

It is a type of nonvolatile random access memory based on the position of carbon nanotubes deposited on a chip-like substrate. In theory, the small size of the nanotubes allows for very high density memories. Nantero also refers to it as NRAM. Technology The first generation Nantero NRAM technology was based on a three-terminal semiconductor device where a third terminal is used to switch the memory cell between memory states. The second generation NRAM technology is based on a two-terminal memory cell. The two-terminal cell has advantages such as a smaller cell size, better scalability to sub-20 nm nodes (see semiconductor device fabrication), and the ability to passivate the memory cell during fabrication. In a non-woven fabric matrix of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), crossed nanotubes can either be touching or slightly separated depending on their position. When touching, the carbon nanotubes are held together by Van der Waals forces. Each NRAM \\"cell\\" consists of an interlinked network of CNTs located between two electrodes as illustrated in Figure 1. The CNT fabric is located between two metal electrodes, which is defined and etched by photolithography, and forms the NRAM cell. Carbon nanotube fabric The NRAM acts as a resistive non-volatile random access memory (RAM) and can be placed in two or more resistive modes depending on the resistive state of the CNT fabric. When the CNTs are not in contact the resistance state of the fabric is high and represents an \\"off\\" or \\"0\\" state. When the CNTs are brought into contact, the resistance state of the fabric is low and represents an \\"on\\" or \\"1\\" state. NRAM acts as a memory because the two resistive states are very stable. In the 0 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are not in contact and remain in a separated state due to the stiffness of the CNTs resulting in a high resistance or low current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes. In the 1 state, the CNTs (or a portion of them) are in contact and remain contacted due to Van der Waals forces between the CNTs, resulting in a low resistance or high current measurement state between the top and bottom electrodes. Note that other sources of resistance such as contact resistance between electrode and CNT can be significant and also need to be considered. To switch the NRAM between states, a small voltage greater than the read voltage is applied between top and bottom electrodes. If the NRAM is in the 0 state, the voltage applied will cause an electrostatic attraction between the CNTs close to each other causing a SET operation. After the applied voltage is removed, the CNTs remain in a 1 or low resistance state due to physical adhesion (Van der Waals force) with an activation energy (Ea) of approximately 5eV. If the NRAM cell is in the 1 state, applying a voltage greater than the read voltage will generate CNT phonon excitations with sufficient energy to separate the CNT junctions. This is the phonon driven RESET operation. The CNTs remain in the OFF or high resistance state due to the high mechanical stiffness (Young's Modulus 1 TPa) with an activation energy (Ea) much greater than 5 eV. Figure 2 illustrates both states of an individual pair of CNTs involved in the switch operation. Due to the high activation energy (> 5eV) required for switching between states, the NRAM switch resists outside interference like radiation and operating temperature that can erase or flip conventional memories like DRAM. Figure 2: Carbon nanotube contact points NRAMs are fabricated by depositing a uniform layer of CNTs onto a prefabricated array of drivers such as transistors as shown in Figure 1. The bottom electrode of the NRAM cell is in contact with the underlying via (electronics) connecting the cell to the driver. The bottom electrode may be fabricated as part of the underlying via or it may be fabricated simultaneously with the NRAM cell, when the cell is photolithographically defined and etched. Before the cell is photolithographically defined and etched, the top electrode is deposited as a metal film onto the CNT layer so that the top metal electrode is patterned and etched during the definition of the NRAM cell. Following the dielectric passivation and fill of the array, the top metal electrode is exposed by etching back the overlying dielectric using a smoothing process such as chemical-mechanical planarization. With the top electrode exposed, the next level of metal wiring interconnect is fabricated to complete the NRAM array. Figure 3 illustrates one circuit method to select a single cell for writing and reading. Using a cross-grid interconnect arrangement, the NRAM and driver, (the cell), forms a memory array similar to other memory arrays. A single cell can be selected by applying the proper voltages to the word line (WL), bit line (BL), and select lines (SL) without disturbing the other cells in the array. Figure 3: CNT switch Characteristics NRAM has a density, at least in theory, similar to that of DRAM. DRAM includes capacitors, which are essentially two small metal plates with a thin insulator between them. NRAM has terminals and electrodes roughly the same size as the plates in a DRAM, the nanotubes between them being so much smaller they add nothing to the overall size. However it seems there is a minimum size at which a DRAM can be built, below which there is simply not enough charge being stored on the plates. NRAM appears to be limited only by lithography. This means that NRAM may be able to become much denser than DRAM, perhaps also less expensive. Unlike DRAM, NRAM does not require power to \\"refresh\\" it, and will retain its memory even after power is removed. Thus the power needed to write and retain the memory state of the device is much lower than DRAM, which has to build up charge on the cell plates. This means that NRAM might compete with DRAM in terms of cost, but also require less power, and as a result also be much faster because write performance is largely determined by the total charge needed. NRAM can theoretically reach performance similar to SRAM, which is faster than DRAM but much less dense, and thus much more expensive. Comparison with other non-volatile memory Compared with other non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) technologies, NRAM has several advantages. In flash memory, the common form of NVRAM, each cell resembles a MOSFET transistor with a control gate (CG) modulated by a floating gate (FG) interposed between the CG and the FG. The FG is surrounded by an insulating dielectric, typically an oxide. Since the FG is electrically isolated by the surrounding dielectric, any electrons placed on the FG will be trapped on the FG which screens the CG from the channel of the transistor and modifies the threshold voltage (VT) of the transistor. By writing and controlling the amount of charge placed on the FG, the FG controls the conduction state of the MOSFET flash device depending on the VT of the cell selected. The current flowing through the MOSFET channel is sensed to determine the state of the cell forming a binary code where a 1 state (current flow) when an appropriate CG voltage is applied and a 0 state (no current flow) when the CG voltage is applied. After being written to, the insulator traps electrons on the FG, locking it into the 0 state. However, in order to change that bit, the insulator has to be \\"overcharged\\" to erase any charge already stored in it. This requires higher voltage, about 10 volts, much more than a battery can provide. Flash systems include a \\"charge pump\\" that slowly builds up power and releases it at higher voltage. This process is not only slow, but degrades the insulators. For this reason flash has a limited number of writes before the device will no longer operate effectively. NRAM reads and writes are both \\"low energy\\" in comparison to flash (or DRAM for that matter due to \\"refresh\\"), meaning NRAM could have longer battery life. It may also be much faster to write than either, meaning it may be used to replace both. Modern phones include flash memory for storing phone numbers, DRAM for higher performance working memory because flash is too slow, and some SRAM for even higher performance. Some NRAM could be placed on the CPU to act as the CPU cache, and more in other chips replacing both the DRAM and flash. NRAM is one of a variety of new memory systems, many of which claim to be \\"universal\\" in the same fashion as NRAM ‚Äì replacing everything from flash to DRAM to SRAM. An alternative memory ready for use is ferroelectric RAM (FRAM or FeRAM). FeRAM adds a small amount of a ferro-electric material to a DRAM cell. The state of the field in the material encodes the bit in a non-destructive format. FeRAM has advantages of NRAM, although the smallest possible cell size is much larger than for NRAM. FeRAM is used in applications where the limited number of writes of flash is an issue. FeRAM read operations are destructive, requiring a restoring write operation afterwards. Other more speculative memory systems include magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) and phase- change memory (PRAM). MRAM is based on a grid of magnetic tunnel junctions. MRAM's reads the memory using the tunnel magnetoresistance effect, allowing it to read the memory both non-destructively and with very little power. Early MRAM used field induced writing,https://www.everspin.com/file/214/download reached a limit in terms of size, which kept it much larger than flash devices. However, new MRAM techniques might overcome the size limitation to make MRAM competitive even with flash memory. The techniques are Thermal Assisted Switching (TAS),The Emergence of Practical MRAM developed by Crocus Technology, and Spin-transfer torque on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and other companies were working in 2009. PRAM is based on a technology similar to that in a writable CD or DVD, using a phase-change material that changes its magnetic or electrical properties instead of its optical ones. The PRAM material itself is scalable but requires a larger current source. History Nantero was founded in 2001, and headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. Due to the massive investment in flash semiconductor fabrication plants, no alternative memory has replaced flash in the marketplace, despite predictions as early as 2003 of the impending speed and density of NRAM. In 2005, NRAM was promoted as universal memory, and Nantero predicted it would be in production by the end of 2006. In August 2008, Lockheed Martin acquired an exclusive license for government applications of Nantero's intellectual property. By early 2009, Nantero had 30 US patents and 47 employees, but was still in the engineering phase. In May 2009, a radiation-resistant version of NRAM was tested on the STS-125 mission of the US . The company was quiet until another round of funding and collaboration with the Belgian research center imec was announced in November 2012. Nantero raised a total of over $42 million through the November 2012 series D round. Investors included Charles River Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Globespan Capital Partners, Stata Venture Partners and Harris & Harris Group. In May 2013, Nantero completed series D with an investment by Schlumberger. EE Times listed Nantero as one of \\"10 top startups to watch in 2013\\". 31 Aug 2016. Two Fujitsu semiconductor businesses are licensing Nantero NRAM technology with joint Nantero-Fujitsu development to produce chips in 2018. They will have several thousand times faster rewrites and many thousands of times more rewrite cycles than embedded flash memory.

History The London Musicians' Collective originally put together a four-week programme of radio art as part of 1998's Meltdown festival at the South Bank Centre, curated by John Peel. The station operated from the Royal Festival Hall on a month-long Restricted Service Licence on 107.3 FM. Phil England, an organiser of the original broadcast, described the origins of the station in a text written to accompany the printed programme. The aim, he wrote, was \\"to raise the specter of radio art in a country where the notion has no common currency\\". After a four-year hiatus, the station returned on 1 May 2002 as part of the Ofcom Access Radio Pilot Scheme from studios on Denmark Street in the Soho area of London's West End. Resonance was awarded a five-year Community Radio licence in December 2005, enabling the station to broadcast 24/7. Ofcom extended the station's FM broadcasting licence in July 2010. Resonance FM resumed scheduled broadcasting in September 2007 after a short hiatus whilst moving into a new studio building on Borough High Street, Southwark; a short walk from the area where they launched in 1998. In 2011, Resonance presented a six-week exhibit at the Raven Row Gallery Exhibit in East London. The exhibition theme was the relation of sound to art, and included work from Max Eastley and Takehisa Kosugi.

Crew member Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman in space in almost twenty years, since Valentina Tereshkova who flew in 1963 on Vostok 6. Savitskaya was given the orbital module of Soyuz T-7 for privacy. The Soyuz T-7 crew delivered experiments and mail from home to the Elbrus crew. On August 21 the five cosmonauts traded seat liners between the Soyuz Ts. The Dnieper undocked in Soyuz T-5, leaving the newer Soyuz T-7 spacecraft for the long-duration crew.

The crew which launched on Soyuz T-7 remained aboard the station for eight days, as a short-term \\"visiting crew\\", accompanying the station's long-term resident crew. The crew exchanged Soyuz vehicles with the resident crew, returning home in the older Soyuz T-5, leaving the fresher Soyuz T-7 available to the resident crew as a return vehicle.

The episode was written by executive producers Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, and directed by Martin Wood. The episode was the strongest episode of the whole series on Nielsen household ratings. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide. \\"Rising\\" is about the establishment of the Atlantis expedition, it follows Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) and Colonel Marshall Sumner (Robert Patrick) and their mission to the Pegasus Galaxy in part one. The second part is about the awakening of the Wraith and freeing prisoners of war from them. The pilot has various guest stars from Stargate SG-1 as for example Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Siler (Dan Shea) among others.  Plot  = Part 1 = The technologically advanced Ancient race from Stargate SG-1 series voyaged to the Pegasus Galaxy from Earth via a colossal starship to spread new life. The city of Atlantis served as a maneuvering station as well as a base of operations. Their mission was unsuccessful and they met a terrible new enemy called the Wraith, the Ancients lost the war with the Wraith and after a long siege Atlantis was submerged under the ocean. Discovering evidence of the Ancients journey to another galaxy, a large team of scientists and military personnel, led by diplomat Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) examine residual technology in an Antarctic outpost with hopes to travel to Atlantis, thereby discovering any knowledge left behind and unraveling the mystery of the abrupt disappearance of its citizens. With the assistance of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) they are able to travel to Atlantis through the Stargate. Using an Ancient power resource known as the Zero Point Module (ZPM) to supply the energy essential for the unusually extended wormhole, an assembly of volunteer representatives from many different countries joins the Atlantis expedition under the command of Colonel Marshall Sumner (Robert Patrick) of the United States Marine Corps. Shortly after crossing, Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) determines that because of the immediate depletion of power due to their arrival, the shield protecting the city from the ocean water, will imminently collapse. Without enough energy to return to Earth, a squadron including Colonel Sumner, Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), and Lieutenant Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) travels to a random planet for help. The local villagers, led by Teyla Emmagan (Rachel Luttrell), are permitted to breed for generations before being systematically harvested by the Wraith. They assist the strangers, but as Colonel Sumner arranges an exploration of a vacant Ancient settlement, three Wraith starships travel through the Athosian Stargate to begin herding the planet‚Äôs human inhabitants. = Part 2 = The Wraith starships head toward the village and start attacking. The military personnel start attacking the starships, but are eventually outmaneuvered by the Wraith. Back in Atlantis the shield is getting weaker and the remaining personnel there receive immediate orders to evacuate. Before they are able to press the gate address John Sheppard and the Athosian villagers come through the Stargate. When the shield fails, rather than taking on water, the city rises to the ocean surface. The captured military personnel and Athosian villagers wake up in a Wraith cell, three Wraith start taking out prisoners from the cell, one at the time. After tracking where the Wraith hideout is, Rodney McKay reveals to Sheppard that they can use one of the Ancient spaceships, dubbed \\"Puddle Jumper\\" by Sheppard, to get there. In the meantime, Carson Beckett shows Elizabeth Weir what he found out about the Wraith DNA. Weir authorizes the rescue mission led by Sheppard, and he assembles a team together with Aiden Ford, to go through the Stargate. After leaving the Spacegate (a Stargate placed in Space, or in Orbit around a planet) on the other side, they eventually find the location of the Wraith base on the planet below. Meanwhile, Marshall Sumner is confronted by a Wraith woman (The Keeper). She tells him about their race and then uses her telepathic abilities to find out about Earth which she hopes to use as a new feeding ground for the Wraith. In the meantime Sheppard and Ford infiltrate the Wraith base and trying to locate the survivors from the Wraith attack. They split up, and Sheppard finds Sumner and the Keeper. The Keeper begins to feed on Sumner, and Sheppard shoots him, after witnessing his suffering. After Ford locates and saves the others survivors, he saves Sheppard from being fed upon by the Keeper. Sheppard kills her, but she tells him with her dying breath, that he has awoken them all. Sheppard and Ford witness the Wraith awakening from their hibernation pods, and decide to leave. The remaining soldiers, protecting the Jumper outside the base are attacked by Wraith Darts. The team is able to escape the planet with the Jumper, but is held up by Wraith Darts blockading the Spacegate. Sheppard eventually manages to maneuver the Jumper to the gate. Back in Atlantis Sheppard, Ford and Weir talk about the situation with the Wraith and Sheppard apologizes because he hasn't made them many friends. However, Weir then shows him the Athosians, and Teyla Emmagan agrees with her, since they will help them find more friends. While the expedition celebrates their arrival in Atlantis, Weir asks Sheppard which members he wants in his team, since they have to go out there to fight the Wraith.  Production  Cooper, writer and executive producer for the show with Wright The pilot episode, \\"Rising (Parts 1 and 2)\\" was written by Robert C. Cooper and Brad Wright, and directed by Martin Wood. The Pemberton Glacier in British Columbia doubles for Antarctica during the opening flying sequence. The Antarctic scenes in the start of the episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The budget for the two-part episode was estimated around $5 million US dollars. Rodney McKay was actually supposed to be African-Canadian under the name Dr. Benjamin Ingram, this didn't stop David Hewlett auditioning. The producers eventually came to a solution where Ingram would be replaced by McKay from the former Stargate SG-1 series. The character Teyla Emmagan was originally named \\"Mikala\\" in the early drafts of the Stargate Atlantis script. At the end of February, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) announced the inclusion of Robert Patrick's character Marshall Sumner. The official announcement said that he would only be featured in part one, but was later extended to both parts one and two. In January 2004 the Stargate producers announced including Jack O'Neill (portrayed by Richard Dean Anderson) and Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) in the two-hour premiere pilot episode to make it easier for fans to relate to. Stargate Atlantis was supposed to be set on present day Earth, after Stargate SG-1 was canceled. This cancelation of SG-1 didn't happen and Stargate Atlantis was released while Stargate SG-1 was still airing, so the story arc was set in a new galaxy under the name, Pegasus. The story was set in another galaxy so the two running series would not collide with each other and to stop plot interferences.  Reception  Director Martin Wood at Comic Con 2007 \\"Rising\\" is Stargate Atlantis strongest episode of the series, with a 3.2 on the Nielsen ratings. The episode was the most watched episode ever broadcast by Sci Fi Channel gathering over 4 million viewers in the United States according to Variety in 2004, but was beaten by Warehouse 13 in 2009. In the United Kingdom, it was viewed by 1.28 million people, placing it first in the most viewed shows in Sky One for the week. The two-part pilot episode was released on DVD after its initial broadcast on TV. The pilot episode was awarded a Gemini Award in the category Best Visual Effects. The episode was also nominated for an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\", a Leo Award for \\"Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series\\", and a Visual Effects Society Award for \\"Outstanding Visual Effects in a Broadcast Series\\".

Variants are used for either desserts or dinners. When used as a dessert, it is commonly combined with a sweetener such as sugar. Such desserts are found on many continents, especially Asia where rice is a staple. Some variants are thickened only with the rice starch; others include eggs, making them a kind of custard.Persian Saffron Rice Pudding Rice pudding around the world Arroz con leche (rice with milk) is the Spanish and Hispanic American type of rice pudding. Leftover rice is often used, especially in restaurants. Rice puddings are found in nearly every area of the world. Recipes can greatly vary even within a single country. The dessert can be boiled or baked. Different types of pudding vary depending on preparation methods and the selected ingredients. The following ingredients are usually found in rice puddings: * rice; white rice (usually short-grain, but can also be long-grain, broken rice, basmati, or jasmine rice), brown rice, or black rice * milk (whole milk, coconut milk, cream or evaporated) * spices (cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, or others) * flavorings and toppings (vanilla, orange, lemon, rose water; pistachio, almond, cashew, raisin, walnut, or others) * sweetener (sugar, brown sugar, honey, sweetened condensed milk, dates, fruit or syrups) * eggs (sometimes) The following is a list of various rice puddings grouped by place of origin. =Middle East, North Africa, West Asia= Turkish fƒ±rƒ±n s√ºtla√ß, baked Levantine Riz bi haleeb * Moghli (Lebanese) with anise, caraway, and cinnamon * Muhalibiyya (Arabic) with milk, rice flour, sugar, and rosewater * Fƒ±rƒ±n s√ºtla√ß (Turkish) baked, with milk, eggs, and cinnamon * S√ºtla√ß (Turkish), served as cold; often browned in a salamander broiler and garnished with cinnamon.

The earliest rice pudding recipes were called whitepot and date from the Tudor period; one of the earliest recipes was written down by Gervase Markham in 1615. Rice pudding is traditionally made with pudding rice, milk, cream and sugar and is sometimes flavoured with vanilla, nutmeg, jam and/or cinnamon. It can be made in two ways: in a saucepan or by baking in the oven. In a saucepan, it is made by gently simmering the milk and rice until tender, and then the sugar is carefully mixed in. Finally, the cream is mixed in, and it can either be left to cool and be served at room temperature, or it can be heated and served hot. It should have a very creamy consistency. Oven baked When made in the oven, the pudding rice is placed into a baking dish, and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in. The dish is then placed in the oven and baked at a low temperature for a few hours, until the rice is tender and the pudding has a creamy consistency. While cooking, the pudding may develop a thick crust, which adds an interesting texture to the pudding. It is traditional to sprinkle the top with finely grated nutmeg before baking. Using evaporated milk (9% milk fat), instead of whole milk, enriches the result and intensifies the caramelised flavour. An alternative recipe frequently used in the north of England uses butter instead of cream, adds a small pinch of salt, and requires the pudding mixture to stand for an hour or so prior to being cooked. Such puddings tend to set firmly when cooled, enabling slices to be cut and eaten like cake. If eaten hot, the pudding is traditionally served with cream poured on top in wealthy households, and with full fat milk where cream was not available. A spoonful of sweet jam or conserve is also a very popular topping for the pudding. Clotted Cream is oftern used in the Westcountry. A specific type of rice is available and widely used for rice pudding called \\"pudding rice\\". Similar to Arborio rice, its grain is round and short, and when cooked produces a creamier consistency than savoury rice. However, other short grained rice can be used as a substitute. Ready-made, pre-cooked rice pudding sold in tin cans or pots is very widely available in most supermarkets and shops. Because it is canned, it has a very long shelf life. A popular brand is Ambrosia. . Some brands are made with skimmed (fat free) milk.

It is made as a warm dish from rice cooked in milk. When served, it is commonly sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and a small knob of butter, and served with milk or fruit juice. In Iceland, it is sometimes served with cold sl√°tur, a type of liver sausage. In different languages it is called risengr√∏d (Danish), risengrynsgr√∏t (Norwegian), risgrynsgr√∂t (Swedish), riisipuuro (Finnish), grj√≥nagrautur, hr√≠sgrautur or hr√≠sgrj√≥nagrautur (Icelandic), and r√≠sgreytur (Faroese). The rice porridge dinner is used as a basis for rice cream dessert. There are many different variants of this dessert but the basis is the same: cold rice porridge (the dinner variant) is mixed with whipped cream and sweetened. In Sweden, it is sometimes mixed with oranges and is then called apelsinris. Risalamande (Danish, after French riz √† l'amande, rice with almonds) is cold risengr√∏d with whipped cream, vanilla, and chopped almond, often served with hot or chilled cherry (or strawberry) sauce. In Norway, the dessert is called riskrem and sometimes served with red sauce (usually made from strawberries or raspberries). Rice cream dessert is called ris √† la Malta in Sweden, while what is referred to as risgrynspudding is made with eggs instead of cream. In Scandinavia, rice pudding has long been a part of Christmas tradition, in some countries referred to as julegr√∂t/julegr√∏t/julegr√∏d/joulupuuro (Yule porridge) or tomtegr√∂t/nissegr√∏d. The latter name is due to the old tradition of sharing the meal with the guardian of the homestead, called tomte or nisse (see also bl√≥t). In Finland it is common to eat the Christmas rice porridge with a kissel or compote made of dried prunes. A particular Christmas tradition that is often associated with eating rice pudding or porridge is hiding a whole almond in the porridge. In Sweden and Finland, popular belief has it that the one who eats the almond will be in luck the following year. In Norway, Denmark, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, the one who finds it will get the almond present as a prize. In Denmark and the Faroe Islands, the almond tradition is usually done with risalamande served as dessert at Julefrokost (Christmas lunch) or on Christmas Eve. In Norway, it is commonly served as lunch or early dinner on Christmas Eve or the day before, lillejulaften (\\"Little Eve\\"). In Sweden and Finland, it is more commonly done with a rice porridge dinner, sometimes a few days before Christmas Eve. =Canada and the United States= In Canada and the United States, most recipes come from European immigrants. In the latter half of the 20th century, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin American recipes have also become more common. In New England, a popular pudding is made with long grain rice, milk, sugar, or in Vermont, maple syrup. This may be combined with nutmeg, cinnamon, and/or raisins. The pudding is usually partially cooked on top of the stove in a double boiler, and then \\"finished\\" in an oven. =Latin America and the Caribbean= Argentine arroz con leche * Arroz con dulce (Puerto Rican) Puerto Rican rice pudding is made with pearl rice. The rice is first rinsed until the water is clear and most of the starch has been removed, then it is left over night in water (this process makes it easier to cook and gives the rice better texture). Coconut milk, cream of coconut, evaporated milk, star anise, cloves, ginger, raisins (soaked in rum), vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg and the option of lemon peel is simmered until the coconut milk is infused with all spices. The rice is then drained and placed in a hot pot that has been coated in butter. The infused coconut milk is then poured on the rice and cooked until rice is tender and sticky. Coconut milk and cream can be replaced with more milk and cream cheese; pistachios can be substituted for raisins. Puerto Rican rice pudding is also popular in Colombia and Venezuela. * Arroz con leche (Dominican Republic) made with milk, cinnamon, raisins, sugar, and lemon zest. * Arroz con leche made to Spanish recipes; popular flavourings include anise seed, star anise, and raisins (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica). cinnamon, or cajeta or dulce de leche (Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela, Cuba, Panama) or dulce de leche with cinnamon (Argentina) * Arroz con leche (Mexican) with milk, cinnamon, sugar, egg yolk, vanilla, orange peel, raisins (soaked in sherry, rum or tequila); chocolate, butter, nutmeg, or lime zest may also be added. * Arroz en leche (Guatemala) with milk, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla; raisins may also be added. * Rice pudding (Jamaican) with milk, egg yolk, allspice, sugar, raisins (soaked in rum), vanilla, butter, sometimes crushed meringue, toasted coconut flakes, cornstarch, and crushed pineapple can be added. * Arroz con leche (Colombian) with milk, cream, sugar, coffee, raisins (soaked in rum or red wine), butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves * Arroz con leche (Peruvian) with milk, sugar, orange peel, raisins, cloves, sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, and vanilla and sometimes shredded coconut and (more rarely) brazil nuts can be added. It is commonly consumed with mazamorra morada (purple corn pudding). When served with it is known as \\"clasico\\". * Morocho (Ecuador) * Sweet rice (Trinidadian and Guyanese) with coconut milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, vanilla, and angostura bitter * Arroz-doce or Arroz de leite (Brazilian) with milk, coconut milk (sometimes), sugar, condensed milk and cinnamon. * Arroz con leche (Venezuela) with milk, coconut, sugar, condensed milk and cinnamon. * Du riz au lait (Haiti) made with milk, condensed milk, cinnamon, vanilla, sugar, and raisins. In popular culture Buddhist Sutras state that Gautama Buddha's final meal before his enlightenment was a large bowl of rice pudding, prepared for him by a girl named Sujata. Rice pudding is mentioned frequently in literature of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, typically in the context of a cheap, plain, familiar food, often served to children or invalids, and often rendered boring by too-frequent inclusion in menus. In Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Kenelm Chillingly, a would-be host reassures a prospective guest: \\"Don't fear that you shall have only mutton-chops and a rice-pudding\\". In Henry James' A Passionate Pilgrim, the narrator laments: \\"having dreamed of lamb and spinach and a salade de saison, I sat down in penitence to a mutton-chop and a rice pudding\\". Charles Dickens relates an incident of shabby treatment in A Schoolboy's Story: \\"it was imposing on Old Cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole Vacation, but that was just like the system. When they didn't give him boiled mutton, they gave him rice pudding, pretending it was a treat. And saved the butcher.\\" In Ethel Turner's Seven Little Australians, the children express dissatisfaction with their food. \\"My father and Esther ... are having roast fowl, three vegetables, and four kinds of pudding\\", Pip says angrily. \\"It isn't fair!\\" His sister notes that \\"we had dinner at one o'clock\\". \\"Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!\\" her brother replies, witheringly. In Jane Austen's Emma, reference to the combination of mutton and rice pudding is once again made - \\"his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for\\". Rice Pudding is the title and subject of a poem by A. A. Milne, in which the narrator professes puzzlement as to what is the matter with Mary Jane, who is \\"crying with all her might and main/And she won't eat her dinner‚Äîrice pudding again‚Äî/What is the matter with Mary Jane?\\" T.S. Eliot, in the poem \\"Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town\\", writes: \\"If he looks full of gloom/Then he's lunched at The Tomb/On cabbage, rice pudding, and mutton.\\" Rice pudding is mentioned with much more affection in an incident related by Walt Whitman in Specimen Days. Whitman visited an invalid soldier who \\"was very sick, with no appetite ... he confess'd that he had a hankering for a good home-made rice pudding‚Äîthought he could relish it better than anything ... I soon procured B. his rice pudding. A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish, made the pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days.\\" In the play Arcadia by Tom Stoppard, Thomasina Coverly uses the example of stirring jam into rice pudding as an illustration of chaos. She wonders why it is not possible to separate the jam from the pudding by stirring backwards. Her tutor Septimus Hodge asserts that it is because our universe is deterministic, according to the theories of Isaac Newton. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams the supercomputer Deep Thought derives the existence of rice pudding from first principles. This is to counterpoint between the complexity of Deep Thought and its task of exploring the eternal verities, with simplicity of the pudding.

Every normal mammalian eye has a scotoma in its field of vision, usually termed its blind spot. This is a location with no photoreceptor cells, where the retinal ganglion cell axons that compose the optic nerve exit the retina. This location is called the optic disc. There is no direct conscious awareness of visual scotomas. They are simply regions of reduced information within the visual field. Rather than recognizing an incomplete image, patients with scotomas report that things \\"disappear\\" on them. The presence of the blind spot scotoma can be demonstrated subjectively by covering one eye, carefully holding fixation with the open eye, and placing an object (such as one's thumb) in the lateral and horizontal visual field, about 15 degrees from fixation (see the blind spot article). The size of the monocular scotoma is 5√ó7 degrees of visual angle. A scotoma can be a symptom of damage to any part of the visual system, such as retinal damage from exposure to high-powered lasers, macular degeneration and brain damage. The term scotoma is also used metaphorically in several fields. The common theme of all the figurative senses is of a gap not in visual function but in the mind's perception, cognition, or world view. The term is from Greek œÉŒ∫œåœÑŒøœÇ/sk√≥tos, darkness. Signs and symptoms Symptom-producing, or pathological, scotomata may be due to a wide range of disease processes, affecting any part of the visual system, including the retina (in particular its most sensitive portion, the macula), the optic nerve and even the visual cortex.\\"Bilateral effects of unilateral visual cortex lesions in human\\", Matthew Rizzo and Donald A. Robin, Brain (1996), 119, pages 951-96. A pathological scotoma may involve any part of the visual field and may be of any shape or size. A scotoma may include and enlarge the normal blind spot. Even a small scotoma that happens to affect central or macular vision will produce a severe visual disability, whereas a large scotoma in the more peripheral part of a visual field may go unnoticed by the bearer because of the normal reduced optical resolution in the peripheral visual field. Causes Common causes of scotomata include demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis (retrobulbar neuritis), damage to nerve fiber layer in the retina (seen as cotton wool spots\\"The role of axoplasmic transport in the pathogenesis of retinal cotton-wool spots\\", D. McLeod, J. Marshall, E. M. Kohner, and A. C. Bird, Br J Ophthalmol (1977), 61(3), pages 177‚Äì191.) due to hypertension, toxic substances such as methyl alcohol, ethambutol and quinine, nutritional deficiencies, vascular blockages either in the retina or in the optic nerve, stroke or other brain injury, and macular degeneration, often associated with aging. Scintillating scotoma is a common visual aura in migraine.\\"Possible Roles of Vertebrate Neuroglia in Potassium Dynamics, Spreading depression, and migraine\\", Gardner-Medwin, J. Exp. Biol. (1981), 95, pages 111-127 (Figure 4). Less common, but important because they are sometimes reversible or curable by surgery, are scotomata due to tumors such as those arising from the pituitary gland, which may compress the optic nerve or interfere with its blood supply. Rarely, scotomata are bilateral. One important variety of bilateral scotoma may occur when a pituitary tumour begins to compress the optic chiasm (as distinct from a single optic nerve) and produces a bitemporal paracentral scotoma, and later, when the tumor enlarges, the scotomas extend out to the periphery to cause the characteristic bitemporal hemianopsia. This type of visual-field defect tends to be obvious to the person experiencing it but often evades early objective diagnosis, as it is more difficult to detect by cursory clinical examination than the classical or textbook bitemporal peripheral hemianopia and may even elude sophisticated electronic modes of visual-field assessment. In a pregnant woman, scotomata can present as a symptom of severe preeclampsia, a form of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Similarly, scotomata may develop as a result of the increased intracranial pressure that occurs in malignant hypertension. The scotoma is also caused by the aminoglycoside antibiotics mainly by Streptomycin. Terminology Beyond its literal sense concerning the visual system, the term scotoma is also used metaphorically in several fields, including neurology, neuropsychology, psychology, philosophy, and politics. The common theme of all the figurative senses is of a gap not in visual function but in the mind's perception, cognition, or world view. Their concrete connection to the literal sense, however, is by the connection between the nervous system and the mind, via the chain of links from sensory input, to nerve conduction, to the brain, to perception (the processing and interpreting of that input) via the brain-mind correlation, to psychological function. Thus there is not only (or not necessarily) a visual inability to see an aspect of reality but also (or instead) a mental inability to conceive even the possibility of seeing that aspect, due to a cognitive schema that lacks any provision for it. At the most concrete level, there is neuropsychological scotoma. One example is the hemispatial neglect that is sometimes experienced by people who have had strokes. Another type is the phenomenon of reverse or negative phantom limb, in which nerve injuries to the limbs, such as trauma in which a limb's nerves are severed but the limb is spared from amputation, can affect the mind's body schema in such a way that an existing limb seems to its owner like it should not exist, and its presence thus seems uncanny. Neurologist Oliver Sacks, who experienced a reverse phantom leg that later resolved, considered it a form of spatial neglect in the body schema analogous to hemispatial neglect in that the mind could not conceive of the leg as self because it could not conceive that there was any space for the leg to exist in. Sacks and others agreed that the leg thus seemed like someone else's leg, including sometimes a cadaverous one, which was part of the reason for the dysphoria but not the sole explanation. Even for people who intellectually understood that the leg or hand was supposed to be theirs simply could not believe it emotionally and could not completely reconcile reality with schema, prompting great unease. Given how hard this is to comprehend for a person who has not experienced it, people recently experiencing it for the first time consider it both uncanny and ineffable (as Sacks self-reported and found in others). Sacks also explored the regular type of phantom limb (a positive phantom), which does not produce a neuropsychological scotoma but shares with reverse phantoms the trait that the body schema resists revision despite a person's perfect intellectual awareness and acceptance of the current physical reality (that is, that the amputated limb is gone or that the spared limb is still present). This suggests that aspects of schema in the mind (body schema, world schema) have neurologic bases that cannot be revised by mere intellectual understanding‚Äîat least not quickly. Sacks does explore the topic of how people adapt to phantoms over the years and how positive phantom limbs often gradually foreshorten and sometimes disappear; but some remain for the rest of life. At a higher level of abstraction are what have been called ', in which a person's self-perception of his or her own personality is judged by others to have a gap in perceptive ability. Thus, in psychology, scotoma can refer to a person's inability to perceive personality traits in themselves that are obvious to others. And at the highest abstraction level are what have been called intellectual scotomas, in which a person cannot perceive distortions in their world view that are obvious to others. Thus, in philosophy or politics, a person's thoughts or beliefs might be shaped by an inability to appreciate aspects of social interaction or institutional structure.

Shortly into the mission, the spacecraft failed to dock with the space station due to an incident involving an antenna being torn off the craft by the protective launch shroud. After a fuel-consuming attempt made in darkness for an optical rendezvous with Salyut 7 resulted in an abort in order to avoid collision, it was decided to de-orbit T-8 two days into the mission in order to ensure that the spacecraft had a sufficient amount of propellant for the de-orbit maneuver. After de-orbiting, landing of the craft occurred normally. Crew =Backup crew= Mission parameters *Mass: 6850 kg *Perigee: 200 km *Apogee: 230 km *Inclination: 51.6¬∞ *Period: 88.6 minutes Mission highlights Failed to dock with Salyut 7 due to problems with automated docking system. First failure to dock at a space station since Soyuz 33 in 1979. Once in orbit the Soyuz rendezvous radar antenna boom failed to deploy properly. Several attitude control maneuvers at high rates were made but failed to swing the boom out. (The postflight inquiry later discovered that the antenna had been torn off when the Soyuz payload shroud separated.) The crew believed the boom remained attached to the spacecraft's orbital module, and that it had not locked into place. Accordingly, they shook the spacecraft using its attitude thrusters in an effort to rock it forward so it could lock. With FCC permission, the crew attempted a rendezvous using only an optical sight and ground radar inputs for guidance. During the final approach, which was made in darkness, Titov believed that the closing speed was too great. He therefore attempted a braking maneuver, but felt that the two spacecraft were still closing too fast. He aborted the rendezvous to avoid a crash, and no further attempts were made. The abortive docking attempts consumed much propellant.

Each club is composed of a shaft with a grip and a club head. Woods are mainly used for long-distance fairway or tee shots; irons, the most versatile class, are used for a variety of shots; hybrids that combine design elements of woods and irons are becoming increasingly popular; putters are used mainly on the green to roll the ball into the hole. A standard set consists of 14 golf clubs, and while there are traditional combinations sold at retail as matched sets, players are free to use any combination of 14 or fewer legal clubs. An important variation in different clubs is loft, or the angle between the club's face and the vertical plane. It is loft that is the primary determinant of the ascending trajectory of the golf ball, with the tangential angle of the club head's swing arc at impact being a secondary and relatively minor consideration (though these small changes in swing angle can nevertheless have a significant influence on launch angle when using low-lofted clubs). The impact of the club compresses the ball, while grooves on the club face give the ball backspin. Together, the compression and backspin create lift. The majority of woods and irons are labeled with a number; higher numbers indicate shorter shafts and higher lofts, which give the ball a higher and shorter trajectory. Materials The shafts of the woods were made of different types of wood before being replaced by hickory in the middle of the 19th century. The varieties of woods included ash, purpleheart, orangewood, and blue-mahoo. Despite the strength of hickory, the long-nose club of the mid nineteenth century was still prone to breaking at the top of the back swing. The club heads were often made from woods including apple, pear, dogwood, and beech in the early times until persimmon became the main material. Golf clubs have been improved and the shafts are now made of steel, titanium, other types of metals or carbon fiber. The shaft is a tapered steel tube or a series of stepped steel tubes in telescopic fashion. This has improved the accuracy of golfers. The grips of the clubs are made from leather or rubber.  Club types = Wood = A couple of golf woods Woods are long-distance clubs, meant to drive the ball a great distance down the fairway towards the hole. They generally have a large head and a long shaft for maximum club speed. Historically woods were made from persimmon wood although some manufacturers‚Äînotably Ping‚Äîdeveloped laminated woods. In 1979, TaylorMade Golf introduced the first wood made of steel. Even more recently manufacturers have started using materials such as carbon fiber, titanium, or scandium. Even though most ‚Äòwoods‚Äô are made from different metals, they are still called ‚Äòwoods‚Äô to denote the general shape and their intended use on the golf course. Most woods made today have a graphite shaft and a mostly-hollow titanium, composite, or steel head, of relatively light weight allowing faster club-head speeds. Woods are the longest clubs and the most powerful of all the golf clubs. There are typically three to four woods in a set which are used from the tee box and, if on a long hole, possibly for the second or even third shot. The biggest wood, known as the driver or one wood, is often made of hollowed out titanium with feather-light shafts. The length of the woods has been increasing in recent decades, and a typical driver with a graphite shaft is now long. The woods may also have very large heads, up to in volume (the maximum allowed by the USGA in sanctioned events; drivers with even larger club-head volumes are available for long-drive competitions and informal games). The shafts range from senior to extra-stiff depending upon each player‚Äôs preference. = Iron = A few golf irons Irons are clubs with a solid, all-metal head featuring a flat angled face, and a shorter shaft and more upright lie angle than a wood, for ease of access. Irons are designed for a variety of shots from all over the course, from the tee box on short or dog-legged holes, to the fairway or rough on approach to the green, to tricky situations like punching through or lobbing over trees, getting out of hazards, or hitting from tight lies requiring a compact swing. Most of the irons have a number from 1 to 9 (the numbers in most common use are from 3 to 9), corresponding to their relative loft angle within a matched set. Irons are typically grouped according to their intended distance (which also roughly corresponds to their shaft length and thus their difficulty to hit the ball); in the numbered irons, there are long irons (2‚Äì4), medium irons (5‚Äì7), and short irons (8‚Äì9), with progressively higher loft angles, shorter shafts, and heavier club heads. As with woods, ‚Äôirons‚Äô get their name because they were originally made from forged iron. Modern irons are investment-cast out of steel alloys, which allows for better-engineered ‚Äòcavity-back‚Äô designs that have lower centers of mass and higher moments of inertia, making the club easier to hit and giving better distance than older forged ‚Äômuscle-back‚Äô designs. Forged irons with less perimeter weighting are still seen, especially in sets targeting low- handicap and scratch golfers, because this less forgiving design allows a skilled golfer to intentionally hit a curved shot (a ‚Äôfade‚Äô or ‚Äôdraw‚Äô), to follow the contour of the fairway or ‚Äôbend‚Äô a shot around an obstacle.  Wedge  A few golf wedges Wedges are a subclass of irons with greater loft than the numbered irons (generally starting at 47¬∞‚Äì48¬∞ of loft, above the 9-irons of 44¬∞‚Äì45¬∞), and other features such as high-mass club heads and wide soles that allow for easier use in tricky lies. Wedges are used for a variety of short-distance, high-altitude, high-accuracy ‚Äôutility‚Äô shots, such as hitting the ball onto the green (\\"approach\\" shots), placing the ball accurately on the fairway for a better shot at the green (\\"lay-up\\" shots), or hitting the ball out of hazards or rough onto the green (chipping). There are five types of wedges, with lofts ranging from 45¬∞ to 64¬∞: pitching wedge (PW, 48‚Äì50¬∞), gap wedge (GW, also \\"approach\\", \\"attack\\", \\"utility\\", or \\"dual\\" wedge, typically 52‚Äì54¬∞), sand wedge (SW, 55‚Äì56¬∞), lob wedge (LW, 58¬∞‚Äì60¬∞), and ultra lob wedge (sometimes called the \\"flop wedge\\" or FW, 64¬∞‚Äì68¬∞). = Hybrid = A golf hybrid Hybrids are a cross between a wood and an iron, giving these clubs the wood's long distance and higher launch, with the iron's familiar swing. The club head of a hybrid has a wood-inspired, slightly convex face, and is typically hollow like modern metal woods to allow for high impulse on impact and faster swing speeds. The head is usually smaller than true woods, however, not extending as far back from the face, and the lie and shaft length are similar to an iron giving similar swing mechanics. These clubs generally replace low-numbered irons in a standard set (between 2 and 5, most commonly 3‚Äì4), which are typically the hardest clubs in a player's bag to hit well. By doing so they also generally make higher-lofted woods redundant as well. However, some manufacturers produce \\"iron replacement\\" sets that use hybrid designs to replace an entire set of traditional irons, from 3 to pitching wedge. Sets designed for less muscular players commonly feature a combination of high-lofted woods (up to 7-wood) and hybrids to replace the 5, 6 and 7-irons, allowing these players to achieve greater carry distances with slower swings. = Putter = A golf putter Putters are a special class of clubs with a loft not exceeding ten degrees, designed primarily to roll the ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5¬∞ from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross- sections, bent shafts or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim. Chipper Present in some golfers' bags is the chipper, a club designed to feel like a putter but with a more lofted face, used with a putting motion to lift the ball out of the higher grass of the rough and fringe and drop it on the green, where it will then roll like a putt. This club replaces the use of a high-lofted iron to make the same shot, and allows the player to make the shot from a stance and with a motion nearly identical to a putt, which is more difficult with a lofted iron due to a difference in lie angle. Most chippers have a loft greater than 10 degrees, which is the maximum loft permitted by the Rules of Golf for a club to be classed as a putter, so these clubs are actually classed as irons. To be legal for sanctioned play, a chipper cannot have any feature that is defined in the rules as allowable only on putters, e.g. two striking faces or a flat-topped \\"putter grip.\\" This disqualifies many chipper designs, but there are some USGA-conforming chippers, and non-conforming designs can still be used for informal play.  Construction  = Shaft = Loft and lie of a golf club. The shaft is a tapered tube made of metal (usually steel) or carbon fiber composite (referred to as graphite). The shaft is roughly in diameter near the grip and from in length. Shafts weigh from , depending on the material and length. Shafts are quantified in a number of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load. A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, which requires more power to flex and \\"whip\\" through the ball properly (which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance), while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings, but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square at impact, resulting in lower accuracy. Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L/W (Lady/Women's), A/I (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower swing speed (), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above . Some companies also offer a \\"stiff-regular\\" or \\"firm\\" flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a Regular shaft (), allowing golfers and club makers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player. At impact, the club head can twist as a result of torque applied to the shaft, reducing accuracy as the face of the club is not square to the player's stance. The ability of a shaft to twist along its length due to this torque is fundamentally a function of the flex of the shaft itself; a stiffer shaft will also torque less. To counter torque in more flexible shafts, club makers design the shafts with varying degrees of torque through their length, particularly along the thinnest part of the shaft where it joins with the club head. This results in a point at which the shaft is most flexible, called the \\"kick point\\"; above that point the increasing diameter of the shaft makes it more rigid, while below that point the shaft is reinforced internally to reduce torquing of the club head. Shafts have typically been classified as having a low, medium or high kick; a low kick means the shaft will store energy closer to the club head, which means the club head can twist more but also allows for higher club head speeds. A high kick shaft will store energy closer to the grip; such a shaft will feel firmer when swinging it and will give better control over direction, but the same strength swing will flex the shaft less, which will reduce club-head speed. Widely overlooked as a part of the club, the shaft is considered by many to be the engine of the modern club head. Shafts range in price from a mere US$4 to over US$1200. Current graphite shafts weigh considerably less than their steel counterparts (sometimes weighing less than for a driver shaft), allowing for lighter clubs that can be swung at greater speed. Beginning in the late 1990s, custom shafts have been integrated into the club-making process. These shafts will, within a given flex rating, address specific criteria, such as to launch the ball higher or lower or to adjust for the timing of a player's swing to load and unload the shaft at the correct moments of the swing for maximum power. Whereas in the past each club could come with only one shaft, today's club heads can be fitted with dozens of different shafts, each with slight variation in behavior, creating the potential for a much better fit for the average golfer. = Grip = The grip of the club is attached to the opposite end of the shaft from the club head, and is the part of the club the player holds on to while swinging. Originally, the grip was composed of one or more leather strips wrapped around the shaft. The leather outer wrap on a grip is still seen on some clubs, most commonly putters, but most modern grips are a one-piece \\"sleeve\\" made of rubber, synthetic or composite material that is slid over the shaft and secured with an adhesive. These sleeve grips allow club makers and golfers to customize the grip's diameter, consistency (softness/firmness) and texturing pattern to best fit the player. Clubs with an outer \\"wrap\\" of leather or leather-like synthetic still typically have a \\"sleeve\\" form underneath to add diameter to the grip and give it its basic profile. Grip rules According to the rules of golf, all club grips must have the same cross-section shape along their entire length (the diameter can vary), and with the exception of the putter, must have a circular cross-section. The putter may have any cross section that is symmetrical along the length of the grip through at least one plane; \\"shield\\" profiles with a flat top and curved underside are common. Grips may taper from thick to thin along their length (and virtually all do), but they are not allowed to have any waisting (a thinner section of the grip surrounded by thicker sections above and below it) or bulges (thicker sections of the grip surrounded by thinner sections). Minor variations in surface texture (such as the natural variation of a \\"wrap\\"-style grip) are not counted unless significant. Re-gripping Advances in materials have resulted in more durable, longer-lasting soft grips, but nevertheless grips do eventually dry out, harden, or are otherwise damaged and must be replaced. Replacement grips sold as do-it-yourself kits are generally inexpensive and of high quality, although custom grips that are larger, softer, or textured differently from the everyday \\"wrap\\"-style grip are generally bought and installed by a clubsmith. Re-gripping used to require toxic, flammable solvents to soften and activate the adhesive, and a vise to hold the club steady while the grip was forced on. The newest replacement kits, however, use double-sided tape with a water-activated adhesive that is slippery when first activated, allowing easier installation. Once the adhesive cures, it creates a very strong bond between grip and shaft and the grip is usually impossible to remove without cutting it off. = Hosel = The hosel is the portion of the club head to which the shaft attaches. Though largely ignored by players, hosel design is integral to the balance, feel and power of a club. Modern hosels are designed to place as little mass as possible over the top of the striking face of the club, which lowers the center of gravity of the club for better distance. = Club head = Each head has one face which contacts the ball during the stroke. Putters may have two striking faces, as long as they are identical and symmetrical. Some chippers (a club similar in appearance to a double-sided putter but having a loft of 35‚Äì45 degrees) have two faces, but are not legal. Page 135 of the 2009 USGA rules of golf states:USGA rules of golf, p. 135. > The club head must have only one striking face, except that a putter may > have two such faces if their characteristics are the same, and they are > opposite each other. Page 127 of the USGA rules of golf states:USGA rules of golf, p. 127. > A putter is a club with a loft not exceeding ten degrees designed primarily > for use on the putting green. Therefore, any double sided club with a loft greater than 10 degrees is not legal. = Ferrule = The trim ring, usually black (It may have additional trim colors), that is found directly on top of the hosel on many woods and irons. The ferrule is mostly decorative, creating a continuous line between the shaft and the wider hosel, but in some cases it can form part of the securing mechanism between hosel and shaft. Ferrules of differing weights can fine-tune the center of mass of the overall club head, but for these minute adjustments, screw-in weighted inserts at specific points on the club head are usually used instead.  Club sets  The rules of golf limit each player to a maximum of 14 clubs in their bag. Strict rules prohibit sharing of clubs between players that each have their own set (if two players share clubs, they may not have more than 14 clubs combined), and while occasional lending of a club to a player is generally overlooked, habitual borrowing of other players' clubs or the sharing of a single bag of clubs slows play considerably when both players need the same club. The most common set of men's clubs is: * A driver, usually numbered a 1-wood regardless of actual loft, which varies from 8¬∞ up to 13¬∞ * A fairway wood, typically numbered a 3-wood and lofted about 15¬∞ (though 2- and 4-woods are sometimes seen) * A matched set of 7 numbered irons from 3 through 9, plus a pitching wedge or \\"10-iron\\" * A sand wedge * A putter The above set is only 12 clubs; these (or equivalent hybrid substitutes) are found in virtually every golf bag. To this, players typically add two of the following: * Another fairway wood, often a 5-wood lofted around 18¬∞, to allow other options besides long irons in the 180‚Äì250 yard range, * A hybrid, typically lofted for similar distance as a 3- or 4-iron and usually replacing instead of supplementing those clubs in the bag, and/or * An additional wedge, usually either: ** A gap wedge lofted near 52¬∞ to fit between the modern pitching and sand wedges in loft, or ** A lob wedge, typically lofted around 60¬∞, used for tight approach shots from the rough or sand. * A chipper. Women's club sets are similar in overall makeup, but typically have higher lofts and shorter, more flexible shafts in retail sets to accommodate the average female player's height and swing speed. Variations on this basic set abound; several club options usually exist for almost any shot depending on the player's skill level and playing style, and the only club universally considered to be indispensable is the putter. Some consider the modern deep-faced driver to be equally irreplaceable; this is cause for some debate, as professional players including Tiger Woods have played and won tournaments without using a driver, instead using a 3-wood for tee shots and making up the difference on the approach using a lower-lofted iron. The most common omissions are the \\"long irons\\", numbered from 2 to 5, which are notoriously difficult to hit well. The player can supplement the gaps in distance with either higher-numbered woods such as the 5 and even the 7-wood, or may replace the long irons with equivalently-numbered hybrid clubs. If hybrids are used, higher-lofted woods are often omitted as redundant, but ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature both hybrids and high-lofted woods, omitting the long irons entirely in favor of the lofted woods, and replacing the mid-irons (5‚Äì7) with hybrids. The combination allows for higher launch angles on the long-distance clubs, which gives better distance with slower swing speeds. Where a club is omitted and not replaced with a club of similar function, players may add additional clubs of a different function such as additional wedges. While 14 clubs is a maximum, it is not a minimum; players are free to use any lesser number of clubs they prefer, so substitutions for the common omissions above are not always made; a player may simply choose to play without a 5-wood or 2‚Äì4 irons, instead using a 4-wood and moving directly to their 5-iron as desired distance decreases (a 4-wood in a skilled golfer's hands averages 200 yards; a 5-iron in the same player's hands would be about 160, which is a large gap but not unplayable). Other clubs may be omitted as well. On courses where bags must be carried by the player, the player may take only the odd-numbered irons; without the 4, 6 or 8 irons (the 3 is sometimes removed instead of the 4) the bag's weight is considerably reduced. Carrying only a driver, 3-wood, 4-hybrid, 5-7-9 irons, pitching and sand wedges, and a putter reduces the number of clubs in the bag to 9; this is a common load-out for a \\"Sunday bag\\" taken to the driving range or to an informal game. A skilled player can usually overcome the lesser selection of club lofts by reducing their swing speed on a lower-loft iron and/or placing the ball further forward in their stance to get the same carry distance and/or launch angle as the next higher loft number. Another increasingly common informal format is a deliberately low upper limit such as four clubs, or three clubs plus putter, with a typical load being a wood or hybrid, middle iron, wedge and putter, although often with significant variation between players with regards to which specific clubs are favored in each role.  Regulations  The ruling authorities of golf, The R&A; (an offshoot of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews) and the United States Golf Association (USGA), reserve the right to define what shapes and physical characteristics of clubs are permissible in tournament play. The current rules for club design, including the results of various rulings on clubs introduced for play, are defined in Appendix II of the Rules of Golf. The overarching principle of club design used by both authorities is defined in Appendix II-1a, which states: \\"The club must not be substantially different from the traditional and customary form and make. The club must be composed of a shaft and a head and it may also have material added to the shaft to enable the player to obtain a firm hold (see 3 below). All parts of the club must be fixed so that the club is one unit, and it must have no external attachments.\\" In addition, Appendix II-4a states, regarding club heads, that \\"the club head must be generally plain in shape. All parts must be rigid, structural in nature and functional. The club head or its parts must not be designed to resemble any other object. It is not practicable to define 'plain in shape' precisely and comprehensively.\\" These two rules are used as the basis for most of the more specific rules of Appendix II, including that no club may have a concave face (1931) and various rules defining what is \\"traditional\\" about the shapes of specific clubs, while allowing for the progression of technology. The \\"traditional and customary\\" rule was originally used to ban the introduction of steel club shafts (patented in 1910), as that material was not traditional for shafts; that specific ban was rescinded in 1924 by the USGA (the R&A; would continue to ban steel shafts until 1929),USGA History - 1911-1930 and steel would become universal until the development of graphite shafts whose introduction was less controversial. The \\"plain in shape\\" rule was more recently bent to allow for non-traditional driver club head shapes, such as squares, as a compromise to club-makers after imposing and enforcing a 460cc volume limit on these same club heads. Many recently developed woods have a marked \\"trampoline effect\\" (a large deformation of the face upon impact followed by a quick restoration to original dimensions, acting like a slingshot), resulting in very high ball speeds and great lengths of tee shots. As of 1 January 2008, the USGA and R&A; have settled on a regulation that limits the acceptable \\"trampoline effect\\" to a coefficient of restitution (COR)‚Äîa measurement of the efficiency of the transfer of energy from the club head to the ball‚Äîof .830. Other large scale USGA rulings involve a 1990 lawsuit, and subsequent settlement, against Karsten Manufacturing, makers of the PING brand, for their use of square, or U-grooves in their immensely popular Ping Eye2 irons. The USGA argued that players who used the Eye2 had an unfair advantage in imparting spin on the ball, which helps to stop the ball on the putting greens. The USGA utilized John L. Saksun, founder of Canadian golf company Accuform Golf, as a consultant to set up methods of measuring the unique grooves and determining PING's compliance with the rulings. Saksun, by proposing a cost-effective solution to help PING change the design of subsequent Eye2s, saved PING hundreds of millions. PING subsequently withdrew their US$100 million lawsuit against the USGA. Ping‚Äôs older clubs were \\"grandfathered in\\" and allowed to remain in play as part of the settlement. However, the USGA has begun phasing in a ban on square grooves in golf. Manufacturers were required to discontinue noncompliant clubs by January 1, 2011. According to the USGA, as January 1, 2010, professional golfers on one of the top tours, or those attempting to qualify for one of the three Open Championships (since then four) will need to use new conforming wedges (those without square grooves). Moreover, those who plan to qualify for any other USGA championship (Amateur championships‚Äîunder 18, Amateur, over 25, and over 50 in both sexes, and four-ball, along with international team championships), will need new conforming wedges by 2014. In addition, this regulation includes IGF and USGA-sanctioned regional amateur events as well, as a \\"condition of competition\\". Wedges that conform to the new standard are often marketed as \\"CC\\" or \\"Condition of Competition\\" wedges; this moniker is likely to fall into disuse as players upgrade clubs and the use of non-conforming irons diminishes.

It was originally a breakfast dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but is now eaten all over Switzerland and around the world. The French name r√∂stis bernois makes direct reference to the origins of the dish. Many Swiss people consider r√∂sti to be a national dish. Rather than considering it a complete breakfast, lunch or dinner, it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes such as Spinat und Spiegelei (spinach and fried eggs, sunny side up), cervelas or Fleischk√§se. It is commonly available in Swiss restaurants as a replacement for the standard side dish of a given meal. Preparation R√∂sti dishes are made with coarsely grated potato, either parboiled or raw. Depending on the frying technique, oil, butter, cheese, or another fat may be added (and usually salt and pepper). It is also common to fry the grated potato without additional fats. The grated potatoes are shaped into rounds or patties, usually measuring between 3‚Äì12 cm (1 to 5 inches) in diameter and 1‚Äì2 cm (0.5 inch) thick. R√∂sti are most often pan-fried and shaped in the frying pan during cooking, but they can also be baked in the oven. Although basic r√∂sti consists of nothing but potato, a number of additional ingredients are sometimes added, such as bacon, onion, cheese, apple or fresh herbs. This is usually considered to be a regional touch. Cultural impact In Swiss popular cultural ethos, r√∂sti are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. R√∂sti dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin culture.

Early years  He began drawing cartoons on washroom walls as a kid. After being expelled from his first (and last) art class at the age of 15, he moved with his parents to England, then to Canada. While there, he worked at various jobs, from loading grain ships in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to surveying on the West Coast. Illustrating his mother Joan Raeside's children's books got him his start in the art business. Raeside began drawing editorial cartoons for the Victoria Times Colonist in Victoria, BC in 1979. He occupied the editorial cartoonist position until 2015, when he was let go by the newspaper. During that time, Raeside's editorial cartoons were reprinted in hundreds of publications worldwide.  Career  Raeside founded and operated an animation company in 1988 to animate editorial cartoons for CBC Television. Over the next four years, he created, directed and produced dozens of animated shows for Turner Broadcasting and Children's Television Workshop, adapting two Jim Henson Muppet characters for animation. Raeside adapted the book The Way Things Work as an animated series being broadcast on BBC. Raeside left animation production in 1992 but has since written dozens of scripts for animation, series that includes Atomic Betty, The Amazing Adrenalinis and Pirate Express. In 1990 he created The Other Coast comic strip which features two dogs and looks at life from a dog's perspective. The Other Coast appears in hundreds of publications, worldwide. Raeside is the author of sixteen books, including There Goes the Neighbourhood, an irreverent history of Canada; The Demented Decade; and 5 Twisted Years. Raeside also wrote and illustrated the popular Dennis the Dragon series of children's books. In 2009 he published Return to Antarctica, an account of his grandfather Sir Charles (Silas) Wrights' experience on Captain Robert Scott's 1910 British Antarctic Expedition to be first to reach the South Pole, which resulted in the death of Scott and four companions. Raeside researched the book by travelling to Cape Evans, in the Ross Sea, following in his grandfather's footsteps. Raeside is also related to two other members of the Scott Expedition: Sir Raymond Priestley and Griffith Taylor. Beside the book Return to Antarctica, Raeside produced a 1-hour documentary of the same name. In 2012 No Sailing Waits and Other Ferry Tales, a collection of A collection of BC ferry-related editorial cartoons was published by Harbour Publishing, followed by a collection of dog-related strips from The Other Coast strip called Tails don't Lie - a Decade of Dog Cartoons (70 in Dog Years) also published by Harbour publishing in 2013, remaining on the bestseller list for over 6 months. Raeside wrote and illustrated The Rainbow Bridge - A Visit to Pet Paradise (Harbour 2012) as a way to comfort those who have lost a pet.

Its mission was heavily impacted by the Soyuz T-8 docking failure and the Soyuz T-10a Soyuz booster failures which bracketed it. Almost immediately after docking at Salyut 7's aft port, the crew entered Kosmos 1443 and commenced transferring the 3.5 tons of cargo lining its walls to Salyut 7. Window impact: on 27 July 1983, a small object struck a Salyut 7 viewport. It blasted out a 4-mm crater, but did not penetrate the outer of the window's two panes. The Soviets believed it was a member of the Delta Aquariid meteor shower, though it may have been a small piece of orbital debris. The crew loaded Cosmos 1443's VA capsule with 350 kg of experiment results and hardware no longer in use. It could have held 500 kg, had they had that much to put in. Cosmos 1443 then undocked, in spite of Western predictions that the FGB component would remain attached to Salyut 7 as a space station module. The VA capsule soft-landed on 23 August 1983, and the FGB component continued in orbit until it was deorbited over the Pacific Ocean on 19 September 1983. The crew also filmed scenes for the movie Return from Orbit.Vozvrashchenie s orbity (1984) - Trivia - IMDb  See also  * List of human spaceflights to Salyut space stations * List of Salyut expeditions References Category:Crewed Soyuz missions Category:1983 in spaceflight Category:1983 in the Soviet Union Category:Spacecraft launched in 1983 ","title":"Soyuz T-9"},{"id":"849922","text":"The 1840 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom' titled ' was the first fully written constitution for the Hawaiian Kingdom. The need for a constitution was originally intended as a manner of laws set forth to control the Native Hawaiian population with a Western style and legal framework, giving less severe punishments, such as being exiled, than was the traditional custom until the 1840s. Christianity had failed to change many behaviors of the Hawaiian population, even with the support of the families. Adultery and many other sexual relations became forbidden. Hawaiians were arrested and sentenced to severe punishments that were not well organised. The exiled had little food and could easily swim away from the islands and the prison at Honolulu Fort. The issue became worse as fewer pardons from the were available, and the overall sentencing then became much more severe for the native population. Overview The constitution was enacted on October 8, 1840, by King Kamehameha III and KekƒÅuluohi as Kuhina Nui, an office similar to Prime Minister or co-regent. The constitution, compared to its predecessor, was extremely detailed. The June 7, 1839, document, sometimes called a constitution but more similar to a declaration of rights, stated simply that the government was based on Christian values and equality for all. Incorporating the 1839 document, the 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai‚Äôi was a turning point in Hawai‚Äôi government. This constitution organized the power of government and its functions by defining the House of Representatives as the legislative body, giving their people the power to vote, proclaiming the House of Kamehameha, establishing of the office of Kuhina Nui, creating of the office of royal governors of the various islands and recognizing Christianity as an authority. Amendments It could be changed by section 13, which gave the House of Nobles and the House of Representative the ability to change the constitution. References *. *.

The seat was held by the Conservative Party, their first such victory since 1989. Background The vacancy was caused by the death of the Conservative MP Michael Shersby, who died unexpectedly on 8 May 1997, just seven days after his being returned to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election. Although that election saw the end of 18 years of Conservative rule as Labour won by a landslide, Shersby won a narrow victory over Labour Party candidate David Williams. The by-election was called for Thursday, 31 July 1997 and was the first by-election of the 1997-2001 parliament. Candidates David Williams, the Labour general election candidate was not placed on the by-election shortlist, which the BBC reported had \\"infuriated\\" some members. Activist Michael Shrimpton was also passed over, leading to his defection to the Conservatives. The Labour Party eventually chose Andy Slaughter, the Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, over the Barrister Willie Bach from Nottinghamshire. The Conservative Party selected John Randall, the Managing Director of the century-old Randall's Furniture Store in Uxbridge. Keith Kerr, a senior executive with British Airways, represented the Liberal Democrats. Eight other candidates also stood, including perennial candidates Screaming Lord Sutch and Ronnie Carroll. Campaign Labour's concentrated campaign included an unusual visit by Prime Minister Tony Blair. This was unusual in that a sitting Prime Minister does not normally campaign personally in by-elections for fear that a defeat may harm his own political standing. Conservative leader William Hague was the first leader of his party to campaign in a by-election for 20 years. The Conservative campaign was criticised by some members for keeping records of how much time would-be future parliamentary candidates had spent in the constituency. Results and aftermath In the end, the Conservative candidate was elected by a large majority, gaining over 50% of all votes cast, while the Labour and Liberal Democrat votes both fell. It was the first time the Conservatives held onto a seat at a by-election since the 1989 Richmond by- election (when the candidate was William Hague - who had become leader of the party shortly before the Uxbridge by-election). Randall represented the seat (and its successor, Uxbridge and South Ruislip) until standing down in 2015. Slaughter entered parliament eight years later, winning the seat of Ealing, Acton and Shepherds Bush in 2005. He has represented the Hammersmith constituency since 2010.

A direct sequel to Executive Orders (1996), President Jack Ryan deals with a war between Russia and China, referred respectively in the title as the Russian Bear and the Chinese Dragon. At over 1,028 pages, it is Clancy's longest novel. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. Plot summary In Moscow, SVR director Sergey Golovko survives an attack on his way to work, when a car identical to the armored white Mercedes that he was in was shot with an RPG-7, killing the occupants (one of them a former KGB agent turned pimp) inside. Investigation of the incident by Russian police and later intelligence officers points out to involvement from Chinese intelligence, and that Golovko was the real target. After the failed attempt on the SVR director's life, the Chinese later plot to assassinate the Russian president, but their agent, also a former KGB officer, was arrested by the FSB. Meanwhile, U.S. President Jack Ryan gives Taiwan diplomatic status, which is implied as retaliation to China for secretly assisting in previous plots by Japan (Debt of Honor) and Iran (Executive Orders) against the U.S. Months later, during trade negotiations between the U.S. and China in Beijing, a CNN crew witnesses the murders of the Papal Nuncio to the country and a Chinese Baptist minister, when the two attempt to stop Chinese authorities from performing a forced abortion on one of the latter's followers. Two days later, police officers brutally break up a prayer service led by the Baptist minister's widow in their home, who had been outraged that her husband's body was cremated and dumped into a river without her permission. International outrage over the incidents leads to a boycott on Chinese-made products. With its economy already struggling due to recent military expansions, the country hastens its planned invasion of Siberia to access newly discovered oil and gold fields. Ryan persuades NATO to admit Russia, and promises assistance against China to the Russian president. When the Chinese enter Siberia, the Russians repel their invasion force with help from the United States, causing heavy casualties on the Chinese side. The U.S. Navy attacks the Chinese mainland's coastal defenses and destroys much of the Chinese navy's aging fleet while it lies in port. F-117 Nighthawks destroy railroad bridges in Harbin and Bei'an with GBU-27 Paveway IIIs, seriously damaging Chinese lines of communication for their army in Russia. Ryan later decides to broadcast CNN's coverage of the war, plus direct feeds from U.S. reconnaissance drones, over a CIA website to counter the Chinese government's propaganda about the war's status and purpose. Beijing's increasingly desperate leaders decide to ready their ICBMs for a potential launch. A joint NATO-Russian special operations team led by Rainbow operative John Clark is dispatched to destroy them. The team destroys all but two of the Chinese missiles. Of the two that launch, one is shot down by an AH-64 Apache while the second heads toward Washington, D.C. Ryan's family is evacuated, but Ryan himself decides at the last minute to stay behind on board a docked naval ship, the USS Gettysburg, which is equipped with the experimental Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Ryan watches as the ship destroys the ICBM at the last possible moment. News footage of the ICBM's interception was later streamed through the CIA website. A thousand miles away in Beijing, a group of Chinese students, spurred on by what they have witnessed through the CIA website, march through Tiananmen Square and invade a Politburo meeting, setting the stage for an overthrow of the government. A reformist Politburo member, Fang Gan, takes over and arrests the rest of the Communist leadership, ordering an immediate withdrawal of Chinese forces from Siberia. Fang then holds an open discussion with student leaders that starts China's transition to democracy. The country then orders a unilateral ceasefire from the war with Russia.

While comparing it to Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace (1869), Entertainment Weekly praised the novel for its \\"excitingly cinematic climax\\", as well as for an abundance of African-American characters. Publishers Weekly noted \\"a handbook's worth of intoxicating, expertly researched, seemingly inside information\\". On the other hand, the book was criticized for its length, racist depiction of Chinese characters, and overreliance on right-wing politics. In a negative review, The Guardian bemoaned the length as \\"on full autopilot, and readers who haven't already quit from exhaustion might get the sneaking suspicion that the author too has long jumped ship\\", continuing: \\"Given [Clancy's] top-selling status, he has clearly progressed beyond any kind of editing.\\" References Category:2000 American novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Techno-thriller novels Category:Novels by Tom Clancy Category:Ryanverse Category:Novels set in Beijing Category:Novels set in China Category:Novels set in Russia Category:Novels set in Siberia Category:Novels set in Moscow Category:Novels set in the United States Category:Novels set in Washington, D.C.

However, it never finished its launch countdown; the launch vehicle was destroyed on the launch pad by fire on 26 September 1983. The launch escape system of the Soyuz spacecraft fired six seconds before the launch vehicle exploded, saving the crew. It is the first case in which a launch escape system has been fired with a crew on board.  Crew   Mission parameters  *Mass: 6850 kg *Perigee: N/A *Apogee: N/A *Inclination: N/A *Period: N/A  Mission highlights  The Soyuz spacecraft narrowly escapes disaster. The crew was sitting on the pad awaiting fueling of the Soyuz-U booster to complete prior to liftoff. Approximately 90 seconds before the intended launch, a bad valve caused nitrogen pressurization gas to enter the RP-1 turbopump of the Blok B strap-on. The pump began spinning up, but with no propellant in it, the speed of rotation quickly exceeded its design limits which caused it to rupture and allow RP-1 to leak out and start a fire which quickly engulfed the base of the launch vehicle. Titov and Strekalov could not see what was happening outside, but they felt unusual vibrations and realized that something was amiss. The launch control team activated the escape system but the control cables had already burned through, and the Soyuz crew could not activate or control the escape system themselves. The backup radio command to fire the LES required 2 independent operators to receive separate commands to do so and each act within 5 seconds, which took several seconds to occur. Then explosive bolts fired to separate the descent module from the service module and the upper launch payload shroud from the lower, the escape system motor fired, dragging the orbital module and descent module, encased within the upper shroud, free of the booster with an acceleration of 14 to 17g (137 to 167 m/s¬≤) for five seconds. According to Titov, \\"We could feel the booster swaying from side to side. Then there was a sudden vibration and a jerking sensation as the LES activated\\". Just after the escape tower pulled the descent module away, the booster exploded. Its remains burned on the pad for nearly 20 hours. Four grid fins on the outside of the shroud opened and the descent module separated from the orbital module at an altitude of 650 meters (2132 feet), dropping free of the shroud. The descent module discarded its heat shield, exposing the solid-fuel landing rockets, and deployed a fast-opening emergency parachute. Touchdown occurred about four kilometers (2.4 miles) from the launch pad. The two crew members were badly bruised after the high acceleration, but were otherwise in good health and did not require any medical attention. Upon being greeted by recovery crews, they immediately asked for cigarettes to steady their nerves. The cosmonauts were then given shots of vodka to help them relax. United States KH-11 reconnaissance satellites returned photos of the damaged Site 1 in several runs during late 1983 and early 1984. The descent module was refurbished and later used on Soyuz T-15. The failure's immediate result was the inability to replace the aging Soyuz T-9 return capsule attached to the Salyut 7 space station. This led to dire reports in the western media about the cosmonauts remaining aboard Salyut 7 (which had arrived several months before in the Soyuz T-9) being 'stranded' in space, with no ability to return. Official reports by the Soviet news agency TASS gave few details, merely saying that there had been a pad accident and the cosmonauts were rescued by the LES. It was not until several years later during glasnost that the full story of the accident was revealed to the outside world. Years later, in an interview with the United States History Channel regarding the flight, Titov claimed that the crew's first action after the escape rocket fired was to deactivate the spacecraft's cockpit voice recorder because, as he put it, \\"We were swearing\\".

Originally much longer than its present length, more than half of Highway 4 was transferred to the responsibility of local governments in 1998. In 2018, Highway 4 was re-signed and re-routed through London. In its present form, it travels between Highway 3 in Talbotville Royal, north-west of St. Thomas, and Highway 8 in Clinton. Highway 4 was first designated in 1920, when a route between Talbotville Royal and Elginfield was assumed by the Department of Highways. Over the next half century it was extended north and east to Highway 24 near Singhampton, and south to Port Stanley. Route description Lambeth from the Highway 402 interchange in London. Highway 4 starts at an intersection with Highway 3 in Talbotville Royal and continues north as a two-lane undivided highway. It then starts a short concurrency with Highway 401 at the community of Tempo. Before a 2017 re-route, the highway continued north from Tempo along Colonel Talbot Road. The concurrency ends at Wonderland Road, which the highway follows through London. At Sunningdale, the highway follows Sunningdale Road for a short distance before following Richmond Street. The road continues north, passing through Arva, Birr and large amounts of farmland before intersecting with the western terminus of Highway 7 at Elginfield. The highway then curves slightly west, passing through Lucan before continuing north. It then passes through the communities of Huron Park and Exeter. At Exeter, it crosses the former route of Highway 83. From there, it continues north, passing through the communities of Hensall, Ontario and Vanastra, Ontario before terminating at Highway 8 in the community of Clinton. History The Highway 4 / Talbot Street junction in St. Thomas. The King's Highway 4 was originally designated in 1920 when the provincial government assumed the road running from Talbotville Royal to Elginfield through London. In 1927, the highway was further extended with the assumption of the road from Elginfield to Clinton. In the 1930s, the highway was again extended as far north as the intersection of Highway 10 in Flesherton, and south to Edith Cavell Boulevard in Port Stanley. In the 1970s, Highway 4 reached its maximum length when it was extended from Flesherton to Singhampton. However, in 1998, the Mike Harris government, seeking to balance the provincial budget, off-loaded responsibility for the Clinton‚ÄìSinghampton and Talbotville-Port Stanley sections of Highway 4‚Äîalmost 65% of its total length‚Äîback onto municipal governments. In 2017, the City of London announced that Highway 4 through London would be re-signed and re-routed via Richmond Street, Sunningdale Road, and Wonderland Road, resulting in a short concurrency with Highway 401 between the Colonel Talbot Road and Wonderland Road interchanges.

In 1948, Ventura invited Distel to hear Dizzy Gillespie perform with his orchestra, along with Bruno Coquatrix, Paul Misraki, and Andr√© Hornez. Distel's efforts led to the orchestra's split into two rival bands: Guy Wormser's New Orleans band and the cool jazz and bebop aficionados led by Distel. After meeting Hubert Damisch, a saxophonist, Distel founded the band that would allow him to be with the leaders. With help from Jean Marie Ingrand (bass), Mimi Perrin (piano), and Jean-Louis Viale (drums), the band won the Coliseum's Night of Jazz Meilleur Petit Orchestre Moderne award, with Damisch and Distel winning prizes on the same night. Distel became a professional jazz guitarist. During his career he worked with Dizzy Gillespie and Tony Bennett. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in the late 1950s after establishing himself as a French crooner. He rose to fame in 1958 with the song \\"Brigitte\\", a homage to Brigitte Bardot, with a photo of the couple on the cover. In the 1960s, he composed \\"La Belle Vie\\", a tune that made its way across the Atlantic as \\"The Good Life\\" and performed by Tony Bennett. French lyrics were added in the 1970s and it became Distel's signature tune. During the 1960s, he had a variety show on French television. His only British hit single came in 1970 with a cover of \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\\", the Oscar-winning Burt Bacharach/Hal David song from the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Distel's version reached No. 10 in the UK. In the 1970s, he became popular outside France and hosted the Miss World contest in London in 1977. He appeared on TV variety shows in the UK throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Seaside Special and The Val Doonican Show. Maintaining his popularity in his homeland, however, Distel recorded French versions of English-language hits, such as \\"Vite, Ch√©rie, Vite\\" (\\"Beach Baby\\"), \\"Chanson Bleue\\" (\\"Song Sung Blue\\") and \\"Je T'Appelle Pour Dire Que Je T'Aime\\" (\\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\"). He also recorded in German, Spanish and Italian to satisfy his audiences in other parts of Europe. In August 1980, in honor of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Distel performed at Buckingham Palace to mark her 80th birthday. On 12 January 2004, Distel recorded an edition of Desert Island Discs for BBC Radio 4. Maurice Ravel and Frank Sinatra were among his eight song choices. The program was broadcast a month later on 15 February 2004, five months before his death. During his career, Distel worked with Kenny Clarke, Jimmy Gourley, Lionel Hampton, Slide Hampton, Bobby Jaspar, Barney Kessel, John Lewis, Pierre Michelot, Bernard Peiffer, Henri Renaud, Fats Sadi, Art Simmons, Martial Solal, Ren√© Urtreger, and Barney Wilen. Personal life Distel was involved with actress Brigitte Bardot in 1958, having invited her to his birthday party in St. Tropez. The relationship ended in 1959. He was romantically involved with singer Dionne Warwick. He married championship Olympic skier Francine Br√©aud in 1963. Distel publicly stated that he remained faithful to his wife. \\"Anything I want in a woman I can get at home.\\" In an interview a month after Distel's death, his widow Francine said she knew he had been unfaithful. \\"I knew it was going to happen and I knew it was going to pass.\\" Death Distel died at the age of 71 on 22 July 2004 in Rayol-Canadel, France. Two weeks before his death, he could be seen on TV in a charity broadcast of Qui veut gagner des millions ?

It is one of the world's largest chains of schools. The motto of Kendriya Vidyalayas is Tattva·πÅ p≈´·π£a·πáa apƒÅvrÃ•·πáu, ; in other words, \\"where the face of truth is covered by the golden lid, O Sun (God), please uncover so that truth and dharma are visible.\\" History The system came into being in 1963 under the name 'Central Schools'. Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. It is a non profit organisation. Its schools are all affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended but not restricted to all central government employees. A uniform curriculum is followed by the schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face education disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 50 years. Management The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, which literally translates to 'Central School Organisation', oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in New Delhi. The administration of this body is based on levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of Human Resource Development of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is Minister of State of MHRD. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS; there are additional commissioners to accompany the Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of a KVS region is Deputy Commissioner accompanied by an Assistant Commissioner. There are individual principals of every KV administrating the schools along with a Vice-Principal, Head Master/ Mistress. The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system. The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees. Schools Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Headquarters, Delhi , there were 1228 schools named Kendriya Vidyalayas. Kendriya Vidyalaya is one of the longest school chain in world with 1225 schools in India and three operated abroad. A total of students () and 45477 employees were on the rolls (). These were divided among 25 regions, each headed by a deputy commissioner. The three Kendriya Vidyalayas outside India is in Kathmandu, Moscow, and Tehran. They are intended for children of Indian embassy staff and other expatriate employees of the government of India. One school in Tsimalakha, Bhutan, was transferred to the Bhutanese government, thus ceasing to be a Kendriya Vidyalaya (then known as Indo-Bhutan Central School (IBCS)) in 1989, after one of the major Indo-Bhutan projects (the Chukhha Hydal power project) was near completion. Indian government employees were gradually transferred back to their own country. All the schools share a common syllabus and offer bilingual instruction, in English and Hindi. They are co-educational. Sanskrit is taught as a compulsory subject from classes VI to VIII and as an optional subject until class XII. Students in classes VI to VIII could study the German language until November 2014, when the scheme was discontinued. But was again re continued and is available in some schools until class 10. In Moscow, students are given an opportunity to choose French or Russian as their third or second language. Tuition fees are charged for Kendriya Vidyalaya students have to pay the school development fund (Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi), with the proceeds spent on the development of that particular school. Students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and children of KVS employees are exempt from tuition fees. Girls who are their parents' only child from class VI onward are exempt from tuition and school development fund. KVS is also having the MP Quota which involves some special provision under which admissions are given. Members of Lok Sabha & Rajya Sabha can recommends a few number of students for the admission. But these Special Provisions only works when KVS is located in the constituency of the MP. All members of parliament could recommend up to six students from their constituency for admission to a Kendriya Vidyalaya. From the academic session 2016-17, the quota has been increased to 10 students. The Quality Council of India (QCI) has accredited three of KV schools: KV RK Puram, KV IIT Powai and KV Bhinga.

It is endemic to southern Africa, and is found mainly in South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and in some parts of northern Namibia. It nests on cliffs and lays one egg per year. Since 2015, it has been classified as Endangered. Description At Giants Castle, KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, South Africa The illustration of Cape vulture skeleton (1904) This large vulture is of a creamy-buff colour, with contrasting dark flight- and tail-feathers. The adult is paler than the juvenile, and its underwing coverts can appear almost white at a distance. The head and neck are near-naked. The eyes are yellowish, and the bill is black. Juveniles and immatures are generally darker and more streaked, with brown to orange eyes and red neck. The average length of adult birds is about with a wingspan of and a body weight of . The two prominent bare skin patches at the base of the neck, also found in the white-backed vulture, are thought to be temperature sensors and used for detecting the presence of thermals. The species is among the largest raptors in Africa, next to the lappet-faced vulture. After the Himalayan griffon vulture and the cinereous vulture, the Cape vulture is the third largest Old World vulture. Habitat and distribution Egg The Cape vulture occurs in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Formerly, it could also be found in Namibia and Swaziland. Vagrants are occasionally recorded from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia. The species usually breeds and roosts on cliff faces in or near mountains, from where it can fly long distances in search of the large animal carcasses on which it specializes. Tracked specimens in Namibia were found to have home ranges in extent. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa, Cape Vultures were more likely to occupy cliff nest sites on ledges with a smaller depth and at a higher elevation, surrounded by conspecifics. Conservation and threats Cape vulture at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre (Breeding program in South Africa) The Cape vulture has been declining steadily since at least the 1980s, when it was first categorized as Threatened. Between 1992 and 2007 the species declined by 60-70% in South Africa alone. It was later upgraded to Vulnerable and, in 2015, to Endangered. As of 2013, estimates of total population size assume about 4,700 pairs or 9,400 mature individuals. The species is considered to be impacted by a large number of threats. A decrease in the amount of large carrion (particularly during nesting), poisoning (targeted or inadvertent), electrocution or collision with cables on electricity pylons (the most common cause of death in ringed birds), loss of foraging habitat, and unsustainable harvesting for traditional uses are thought to be the most important factors. A source of poisoning specific to many vultures, including the Cape vulture, is the drug Diclofenac and related compounds, which is used to treat arthritis in cattle, and which leads to kidney failure in vultures who consume carcasses of treated cattle. On the 20th of June 2019, the carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures, altogether 537 vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the carcasses of 3 elephants that were poisoned by poachers, possibly to avoid detection by the birds, which help rangers to track poaching activity by circling above where there are dead animals.

The institute has been widely criticized for false advertisements and fraudulent practices. After several controversies, the school's Honorary Dean Arindam Chaudhuri decided to shut down all campuses across India, except the one in Delhi. Founded in 1973, the institute used to offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in national economic planning and entrepreneurship, and international and fellowship programmes. Its executive education programmes include non-credit courses and visits to foreign business schools. IIPM is not accredited by UGC or All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and is not affiliated with the public Indian Institutes of Management. IIPM has been involved in controversies about its advertising. The University Grants Commission (UGC)a government organisation responsible for the standards of university education in Indiaand the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have repeatedly issued public notices stating that they do not recognise IIPM, and that they deem its technical programmes invalid. IIPM has responded by stating that it does not issue degrees and that it is not a university. In September 2014 Delhi High Court censured IIPM for misleading students and restrained it from using words like MBA, BBA, management course, and b-school to describe the programs it offers. In July 2015, IIPM announced that it will stop offering education programmes directly, and shut down all its campuses outside Delhi. It will operate only as a research and training institute in Delhi.  History  IIPM was founded in 1973 in New Delhi. According to the institute its first residential, full- time, post-graduate diploma programme began in 1974. IIPM had 18 branches across India; in New Delhi, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Noida, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Pune, Lucknow, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Jaipur, Dehradun, and Cochin.

Facilities and faculty IIPM Campus, New Delhi IIPM has a three- acre campus in New Delhi. The facilities at the branches vary but are usually less extensive. Arindam Chaudhuri is Honorary Dean of IIPM. The regular faculty of the institute comprises its own alumni and visiting professors. About 20% of the faculty have doctoral degrees. According to the Financial Times, IIPM has recruited many international professors to teach in India. The institute has built up its teaching faculty by recruiting its own alumni. Under the Global Outreach Programme, IIPM invites faculty members from business schools across the world to its campuses to teach its students. Academics =Offered programmes= IIPM is an academic partner of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, which issues degrees to IIPM students. According to the institute, it offers international programmes and programmes under its School of Business and Economy. These include undergraduate programs in planning and entrepreneurship lasting three years and postgraduate programs in the same subject lasting two years. A one-year postgraduate course is available for working executives with at least two years of past work experience. The institute also offers PhD and Fellowship programmes for postgraduates. The institute does not award BBA or MBA degrees; it awards certificates for its students who can then apply for degrees from allied institutions. Since 2010, IIPM students can get MBA and BBA degrees from Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, with which students of IIPM's Indian School of Business and Economics have a distance-learning degree arrangement. =Courses= Under its programmes in planning and entrepreneurship, the institute offers certificate courses aimed at making students eligible for degree courses. The IIPM course lasts 22 months and includes 1,944 hours of teaching. The postgraduate programme has 1,920 contact hours. The institute tries to give its students a \\"hands on\\" approach to learning, assigning them to work on consulting projects in major firms. In the first year, core subjects include marketing, accounting, finance, economics and organizational behaviour. In the second year, marketing and IT courses are compulsory and students choose a major in human resource or finance. The institute also offers courses that take unconventional approaches to business management. There is a focus on developing executive communication. All students of the institute attend a 21-day compulsory trip to Europe as part of its Global Opportunities and Threat Analysis (GOTA) programme. The programme arranges visits to multinational firms and political organisations. Since 2008, students have visited Africa and Australia under the GOTA programme. = Relationships with other educational institutions = In 2006, IIPM collaborated with Stanford University's Center for Professional Development to organise a strategy workshop in New Delhi. In 2008, professors from the National University of Singapore (NUS) conducted a seven-week course on investment banking at the institute for its top 100 students, leading to a joint certification in investment banking. In the same year, IIPM launched a global executive management programme with Chicago GSB and the Haas School of Business associated with it. , NUS was conducting workshops on business- related topics in Singapore for IIPM students. Between 2009 and 2012, Singapore's Nanyang Technological University sent students to the institute for a four-week course about Indian culture and economy.. , IIPM claimed that its global partners were: NYU Stern (for International Residency), Imperial College (participating B-school), Haas School of Business (Strategic Marketing Programme), McCombs School of Business (Affiliate B-school), Cornell University ILR School (Participating school for GOTA), National University of Singapore (Wealth management programme) and Nanyang Technological University. IIPM lists Judge School of Business (Cambridge University), Darden School of Business (University of Virginia) and SDA Bocconi School of Management as past partner institutions. The Mercator School of Management of Duisburg-Essen University has a formal partnership with IIPM for exchanging students and faculty, and jointly conducting research. Relationship with accreditation organisations The certifications offered directly by IIPM are not accredited by AICTEa regulating body for technical education in India whose accreditation is a voluntary process. According to IIPM, its courses do not come under the purview of AIU, AICTE, UGC and similar government-established regulatory bodies. =History= In 2005, the acting chairman of UGC, Prof V N Rajshekharan Pillai, said that IIPM's advertisements could be misleading. In June 2008, the Delhi High Court advised the UGC and IIPM to settle the matter amicably through an out-of-court settlement. According to the institute, it had not sought de jure recognition from any statutory body or accrediting authority. UGC and AICTE listed IIPM as a \\"fake university\\" and said it was not permitted to confer MBA and BBA degrees or authorised to operate as a university in India. IIPM filed a lawsuit in response. In June 2008, UGC and IIPM reached an agreement in the Delhi High Court. UGC agreed to remove IIPM's name from its list of fake universities and IIPM agreed to clarify that it offers only \\"certificate courses\\". The institute says it is an academically independent and autonomous body without affiliation to any university and its programs do not fall under the purview of AIU, AICTE, UGC, or similar government-established regulatory bodies. The Uttarakhand University Registrar in February 2010 said that IIPM was running MBA and BBA degree programs without UGC and AICTE affiliations and that IIPM's continuing operation would be detrimental to institutions that operate with affiliations. In July 2010, UGC issued a notice to IIPM after the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education questioned IIPM on the authenticity of its courses at its Hyderabad campus. UGC Chairman Ved Prakash said that IIPM was advertising its programs using the names of UGC, HRD Ministry and AICTE, and that \\"it is indulging in cheating.\\" IIPM Group President for Corporate Affairs Amit Saxena said the institute was not a university, was not empowered to award degrees on its own and was doing neither, and that IIPM was \\"on-site academic partner of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University which grants its degrees to IIPM students.\\" Saxena also said that IIPM had made representations to UGC and Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education to clarify its position and that the subject was sub judice at the Delhi High Court. The registrar of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University confirmed that IIPM was authorized to offer Manonmaniam Sundaranar University's MBA/BBA programs in all of IIPM's 18 branches. Students of IIPM's Indian School of Business and Economics (ISBE) were informed by Manonmaniam Sundaranar University that theirs is a distance- learning degree arrangement. Controversies IIPM has been involved in controversies related to its claims about infrastructure, job placements and affiliation with international institutes. Journalists and independent bloggers have investigated IIPM's claims in its newspaper advertising. IIPM denies these charges and has filed legal cases against some journalists. In February 2013, a district court in Gwalior passed an order asking India's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to block access to 78 URLs critical of IIPM, which led to online protests. The Hindus editor wrote that an IIPM advertisement which stated that The Hindu had called the institute \\"the B-School with a Human Face\\" was \\"illegal and unethical\\", and said that the quotation was the headline of a paid advertisement and The Hindu has not endorsed IIPM in any way. In December 2013, the Delhi High Court barred IIPM from publishing any TV, print or online advertisements without first obtaining the court's approval, given that past IIPM advertisements had potentially misled the public. =Conflicts with journalists= In 2005, Outlookwhose 2003 rankings IIPM had used in its advertisementsissued a statement withdrawing all rankings awarded to the institute, saying IIPM misguides students through unethical advertising practices and does not fully and truthfully disclose facts. According to Arindam Chaudhuri, this was done after he said that Outlook used the perception of qualitative rankings to influence b-school rankings. IIPM responded with legal action against Outlook. In June 2005, an Indian online magazine called Just Another Magazine (JAM) published an article accusing IIPM of misleading students and the public with its advertisements by using institutional rankings published in 2003 which were no longer valid. The article said that the IIPM is not accredited by UGC or AICTE. After a court ruling, the article was removed from the internet. JAM editor Rashmi Bansal later published similar content in her blog. In response, IIPM called JAMs statements an attempt to spread baseless rumours and filed a lawsuit against Bansal. In a court ruling on June 2010, Bansal was ordered to take down her blog article. Gaurav Sabnis, an IBM employee at that time, was forced to resign from his post after IIPM threatened to burn IBM laptops in front of IBM's Delhi office. Later, the magazine Careers 360published by Maheshwar Periinvestigated the case. IIPM again went to court against Peri and his publications Outlook and Careers 360 on defamation charges. In 2010, Uttarakhand High Court quashed the case. Another magazine, The Caravan, published an article critical of IIPM in 2011 and is facing a legal challenge. In 2016, IIPM withdrew all remaining cases against Mr.Peri. In 2009, Mahesh Sarma wrote in Careers 360 that for the class of 2008, three companies mentioned in IIPM advertisements as participants in campus placement said that although some freshers of the institute may have been working for them, the companies had never participated in the institute's campus recruitment process. Sarma profiled a sample of jobs that IIPM said its students obtained abroad in the Persian Gulf countries. As of June 2010, according to The Pioneer, Standard Chartered and Barclays were offering jobs to IIPM students. In 2009, according to Sarma's article, Judge Business School (University of Cambridge), Darden Graduate School of Business Administration (University of Virginia) and Haas School of Business hosted IIPM's non-credit Executive Education program participants and conducted sessions for them. Sarma wrote that McCombs School of Business was not aware of a relationship with IIPM, and that IIPM may have a relationship with another University of Texas-Austin college. Judge Business School told Sarma that they were delivering a \\"five- day non-degree executive education program\\" to IIPM students at the University of Cambridge, and that \\"there are no university qualifications awarded from Cambridge University or Judge Business School. The only certificate is a certificate of attendance which is what we provide to participants on all our programs.\\" Darden Business School told Sarma that \\"along with Cambridge (Judge) and UC Berkeley (Haas),\\" University of Virginia's Darden School of Business was providing a series of week-long Executive Education non-credit programs for IIPM. Darden also said it had no partnership agreement with IIPM. Haas Business School confirmed the existence of a contract with IIPM and said that IIPM \\"may represent itself as a business school participating with the Haas School of Business,\\" and that Haas faculty will teach courses in the IIPM program. Sarma also reported that the University of Buckingham had told him that although they were in talks with IIPM, there was no formal agreement yet and that until IIPM's programs are formally accredited by the QAA, IIPM does not have consent to mention the University of Buckingham in its advertisements. According to Sarma, after Careers360 published its article, IIPM removed the name of University of Buckingham from its advertisements. Sarma said NVAOthe accreditation organization for Netherlands and Flanderssaid that IMI \\"is not a recognized higher education institution in the Dutch or French speaking part of Belgium\\" and cannot award recognized degrees. According to Careers 360, the Uttarakhand government appointed the registrar of Uttarakhand Technical University to conduct an inquiry; the registrar recommended banning IIPM. =Wikipedia conflicts= The IIPM reportedly used paid editors to doctor its article and those of its critics on the English Wikipedia, a free content online encyclopedia, for promotional purposes. A Wikipedia user identified by the username was highly involved in such activity, monitoring the IIPM article to remove content that was critical of the institute. After gaining the trust of users, Wifione was also promoted to the position of administrator, and used this new influence to continue these activities. It was also found that Wifione had used at least 60 \\"sockpuppet\\" accounts on the website to influence discussions in favor of modifications to the page that reflected the opinion of the IIPM. The effects of these strategies were magnified by the introduction of the Wikipedia Zero program, which offers free access to Wikipedia content on mobile phones in developing countries‚Äîincluding India. This program thus allowed users to discover the institute's biased article. In February 2015, Wifione was banned from Wikipedia by its Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) for these actions. Litigation =2009= IIPM filed a criminal defamation charge against Careers 360. However, all proceedings in the criminal complaint filed by IIPM against Careers360 was quashed by the Uttarakhand High Court by its judgement dated 8 October 2010. The Court noted that \\"the sole purpose of the article was to caution gullible students. This court does not find anything defamatory in the article‚Äù, and that IIPM could show ‚Äúno proof of their claim that they grant degree from Buckingham University!\\" =2013= In December 2013, Livemint.com reported that public-interest litigation filed in 2010 by Mahesh Sarma, the editor of Careers 360, led to the Delhi High Court barring IIPM from publishing any TV, print or online advertisements without first obtaining the court's approval, given that past IIPM advertisements had potentially misled the public. According to Livemint.com, the interim court order was based on an affidavit by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which stated that IIPM advertisements had the potential to \\"mislead innocent students and public at large\\"; a UGC committee investigating the issue had found that the \\"practice of issuing such dubious advertisements by IIPM to attract students deceptively should be stopped forthwith\\". Portions of the UGC document were quoted in the interim court order. =2014= In September 2014, the Delhi High Court censured IIPM and its founder Arindam Chaudhuri for misleading students. A division bench restrained IIPM and its management with immediate effect from using the words ‚ÄúMBA, BBA, management course, management school, business school or b-school‚Äù in relation to the courses offered by it as well as in representations made to the public. The court noted that IIPM was promoting an impression that it had recognition from a foreign management institute, International Management Institute (IMI), Belgium. The court found that IMI had in fact been set up by Arindam Chaudhuri and his father Malay Chaudhuri, and was not even recognized by the laws of Belgium. The institute was also \\"directed to prominently display on the website of IIPM that they are not recognized by any statutory body/authority\\" and clarify the status of the foreign institutions from which students enrolling in IIPM would be getting a degree or certification =2016= In January 2016, IIPM withdrew all cases against Maheshwar Peri, chairman and chief executive of Careers360 when Maheshwar Peri sought to get all cases transferred to Supreme Court. In another setback to IIPM, University Grants Commission issued a notice on their website informing general public that IIPM is not a university and is not entitled to confer various educational degrees. = 2019 = In September 2019, Kolkata High Court was hearing of a petition of two students who claimed to have been impressed by the IIPM ads featuring actor Shahrukh Khan giving them an impression of IIPM as a trustworthy institution. Following this the court has asked the actor for an explanation on his relationship and business dealings with IIPM. In response the actor's lawyer denied claims in the petition and mentioned the actor had simply appeared in some ads for the institute. Meanwhile the High court also questioned state government on why should the case have a CBI probe. =Trade practices= In May 2007, The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC)an anti-monopoly watchdoginitiated a probe into IIPM's advertisements. They suspected that IIPM recovers the cost of GOTA tours and laptops, both advertised as free, from students later on. In October 2007, MRTPC announced that it would not be processing inquiries against business schools because of staff shortages. =Tax issues= In May 2007, S.S. Palanimanickam, Minister of State for Finance, answered a question in the Rajya Sabha raised by Dharam Pal Sabharwal, another Rajya Sabha member. Palanimanickam said, \\"IIPM has not paid income tax during the assessment years 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07, claiming exemption under section 10(23C) (vi) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.\\" The ministry also said that IIPM had paid no service tax in the preceding two years. Under a query raised through the Right to Information Act on the institute, the Central Board of Direct Taxes said that the ministry received a \\"tax evasion complaint in respect of wrong claims of exemption under Section 10(23C) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\\" Alt URL In April 2009, the Indian government stated that there were \\"no pending tax claims against IIPM\\" and the case had been closed after due enquiry.

G. Wodehouse, being a wealthy young member of the Drones Club, well-dressed, well-spoken, impeccably polite, and generally in some kind of romantic trouble. Stories Monty is featured in: * Heavy Weather (1933) ‚Äì a Blandings Castle novel * The Luck of the Bodkins (1935) * Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (1972) ‚Äì quoted as \\"Montrose\\" instead of \\"Montague\\" Monty is mentioned in: * Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939) ‚Äì Blandings * Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves (1963) ‚Äì Jeeves Life and character Monty Bodkin is the second richest member of the Drones Club (the richest being Oofy Prosser). He is tall, slender, and has butter-coloured hair. The son of a solicitor with a small country-town practice, Monty inherited his money from an aunt who married an American millionaire from Pittsburgh when she was in the chorus of a musical at the Adelphi Theatre. When we first meet Monty Bodkin at the start of Heavy Weather, he is employed by Lord Tilbury as assistant editor of Tiny Tots, one of the many imprints of the mighty Mammoth Publishing Company, his uncle Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe having prevailed upon Tilbury to give him the job at a public dinner. Monty does not work, however, because of any need for income; as he himself explains, there are \\"wheels within wheels\\". He is in love with Gertrude Butterwick but her father, named J. G. Butterwick in this novel (it'll evolve), feeling that his daughter should not marry some kind of a waster, requires Monty to hold down a job for a full year, and Gertrude, being an old- fashioned sort of girl of solid middle-class stock, refuses to elope with Monty. His time at Tiny Tots is brief, however, as he finds himself left in charge one day when the regular editor, the Reverend Aubrey Sellick, is away on vacation. His efforts at writing a piece for the \\"Uncle Woggly to His Chicks\\" column results in a swift and acrimonious parting between Bodkin and Tilbury's employ, and the hunt is on for new work. On the advice of his friend and fellow-Drone Hugo Carmody, he once again uses his uncle, this time to wangle the post of secretary to Lord Emsworth, recently vacated by Carmody. He spends a few happy days at Blandings, in company of his former fiancee Sue Brown, before events conspiring against him, particularly Lord Emsworth's suspicions of anyone connected to the Parsloe-Parsloe camp, lead to his expulsion from the post. He tries to get back in with Lord Tilbury by stealing Galahad Threepwood's reminiscences, but is scuppered by Percy Pilbeam; he later takes revenge on Pilbeam, but repents and ends up paying him handsomely for the chance to work for his Detective Agency, the Argus, for a year. In \\"The Plot That Thickened\\" Monty manages to hold down a job in the entertainment industry, only to be informed by J.G. Butterwick that it does not count. Surprising his fiancee's father, he immediately secures a job with his former employer in England, thanks to the efforts of his secretary. Over the course of the book, he falls in love with said secretary, and marries her after Gertrude breaks the engagement to marry a police officer. Adaptations Royce Mills portrayed Monty Bodkin in the 1988 radio dramatisation of Heavy Weather, part of the Blandings radio series. In the 1995 TV adaptation of Heavy Weather made by the BBC and partners, also broadcast in the United States by PBS, and titled Heavy Weather, Monty Bodkin was played by Samuel West.

The ins and outs of reason maintenance, in: Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 1, IJCAI‚Äô83. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, pp. 349‚Äì351.Doyle, J.: Truth maintenance systems for problem solving. Tech. Rep. AI-TR-419, Dep. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of MIT (1978) is a knowledge representation approach to efficient handling of inferred information that is explicitly stored. Reason maintenance distinguishes between base facts, which can be defeated, and derived facts. As such it differs from belief revision which, in its basic form, assumes that all facts are equally important. Reason maintenance was originally developed as a technique for implementing problem solvers. It encompasses a variety of techniques that share a common architecture:McAllester, D.A.: Truth maintenance. AAAI90 (1990) two components‚Äîa reasoner and a reason maintenance system‚Äîcommunicate with each other via an interface. The reasoner uses the reason maintenance system to record its inferences and justifications of (\\"reasons\\" for) the inferences. The reasoner also informs the reason maintenance system which are the currently valid base facts (assumptions). The reason maintenance system uses the information to compute the truth value of the stored derived facts and to restore consistency if an inconsistency is derived. A truth maintenance system, or TMS, is a knowledge representation method for representing both beliefs and their dependencies and an algorithm called the \\"truth maintenance algorithm\\" that manipulates and maintains the dependencies. The name truth maintenance is due to the ability of these systems to restore consistency. A truth maintenance system maintains consistency between old believed knowledge and current believed knowledge in the knowledge base (KB) through revision. If the current believed statements contradict the knowledge in the KB, then the KB is updated with the new knowledge. It may happen that the same data will again be believed, and the previous knowledge will be required in the KB. If the previous data are not present, but may be required for new inference. But if the previous knowledge was in the KB, then no retracing of the same knowledge is needed. The use of TMS avoids such retracing; it keeps track of the contradictory data with the help of a dependency record. This record reflects the retractions and additions which makes the inference engine (IE) aware of its current belief set. Each statement having at least one valid justification is made a part of the current belief set. When a contradiction is found, the statement(s) responsible for the contradiction are identified and the records are appropriately updated. This process is called dependency- directed backtracking. The TMS algorithm maintains the records in the form of a dependency network. Each node in the network is an entry in the KB (a premise, antecedent, or inference rule etc.) Each arc of the network represent the inference steps through which the node was derived. A premise is a fundamental belief which is assumed to be true. They do not need justifications. The set of premises are the basis from which justifications for all other nodes will be derived. There are two types of justification for a node. They are: # Support list [SL] # Conditional proof (CP) Many kinds of truth maintenance systems exist. Two major types are single-context and multi- context truth maintenance. In single context systems, consistency is maintained among all facts in memory (KB) and relates to the notion of consistency found in classical logic. Multi-context systems support paraconsistency by allowing consistency to be relevant to a subset of facts in memory, a context, according to the history of logical inference. This is achieved by tagging each fact or deduction with its logical history. Multi- agent truth maintenance systems perform truth maintenance across multiple memories, often located on different machines. de Kleer's assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS, 1986) was utilized in systems based upon KEE on the Lisp Machine. The first multi-agent TMS was created by Mason and Johnson. It was a multi-context system. Bridgeland and Huhns created the first single-context multi-agent system.

The name \\"Soyuz T-12\\" is also the name of the spacecraft used to launch and land the mission's three-person crew. The mission occurred in July 1984, during the long-duration expedition Salyut 7 EO-3. During the mission, crew member Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to ever perform a spacewalk, and the potential Buran Space shuttle pilot, Igor Volk, was given spaceflight experience. Unlike many Soyuz visiting missions, the Soyuz lifeboats were not swapped, and the crew returned to Earth in the same spacecraft in which they launched. Background Igor Volk was a test pilot, and was planned to be the commander of the first Buran spaceflight. The rule introduced following the Soyuz 25 failure, insisted that all Soviet spaceflight must have at least one crew member who has been to space before. As a result, it was decided that Volk should have spaceflight experience, and he was originally scheduled to visit Salyut 7 in 1983. But following the failure of Soyuz T-8 to dock to Salyut 7, in April 1983, the Soyuz launch schedule was disrupted, and Volk's original crew members, Kizim and Solovyov, were rescheduled elsewhere. They later became long-duration crew members of Salyut 7 EO-3, and Volk was scheduled fly in the passenger seat of a visiting mission Soyuz T-12 to the EO-3 crew, but the other members of the T-12 mission were not yet decided upon. In November 1983, NASA announced that during STS-41-G, Kathryn D. Sullivan would become the first woman to perform a spacewalk. The NPO Energia chief decided that the Soviets would get there first, and assembled the Soyuz T-12 crew within a month of NASA's announcement, which included Volk as previously planned. The back-up crew lists became available to Western space analysts in 1988, and they noted that the back-up crew contained a woman, but did not contain another LII test pilot. Judging from this, it appeared that, as reasons to have the Soyuz T-12 mission, achieving the first female spacewalk was more important than gaining experience for a potential Buran crew member. At the time of the mission the Buran program was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine Spaceflight, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.

Volk was a glimpse of things which might have been: he was a Buran programme program pilot being flown in space to prove he would be able to pilot Buran back to Earth after an extended stay in space. The crew of Soyuz T-12 (callsign Pamir), the second Visiting Expedition to visit the Mayaks, included veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Buran shuttle program cosmonaut Igor Volk, and Svetlana Savitskaya. On July 25 Dzhanibekov and Savitskaya performed a 3 hr, 30 min EVA (Savitskaya became the first woman ever to perform EVA), during which they tested the URI multipurpose tool. They cut, welded, soldered, and coated metal samples. During the Pamirs‚Äô stay, the six cosmonauts aboard Salyut 7 also conducted Rezonans tests and collected station air samples.

It is particularly notable for being the first book to illustrate insects, plants etc. as seen through microscopes. Published in January 1665, the first major publication of the Royal Society, it became the first scientific best-seller, inspiring a wide public interest in the new science of microscopy. It is also notable for coining the biological term cell.

Known for its spectacular copperplate engravings of the miniature world, particularly its fold-out plates of insects, the text itself reinforces the tremendous power of the new microscope. The plates of insects fold out to be larger than the large folio itself, the engraving of the louse in particular folding out to four times the size of the book. Although the book is best known for demonstrating the power of the microscope, Micrographia also describes distant planetary bodies, the wave theory of light, the organic origin of fossils, and other philosophical and scientific interests of its author. Hooke also selected several objects of human origin; among these objects were the jagged edge of a honed razor and the point of a needle, seeming blunt under the microscope. His goal may well have been as a way to contrast the flawed products of mankind with the perfection of nature (and hence, in the spirit of the times, of biblical creation).

Several changes were controversial, and not all proposed changes were implemented. Each had to be approved by the central government in New Delhi. The renaming of states and territories in India has also taken place, but until the 2010s with actual substantial name changes in both local language and in English such as the old British state name of Travancore-Cochin to Kerala (1956). The most notable exceptions are Indian English spelling-changes of Orissa to Odisha (March 2011)India and the World Bank: The Politics of Aid and Influence - Page 126 Jason A. Kirk - 2011 \\"Orissa (Note: This state was officially renamed Odisha in March 2011)\\" and the Union Territory of Pondicherry (which includes the City of Pondicherry) to Puducherry. Causes for renaming =Need for standardisation of spelling= India has various local languages. Even (Romanised) English spellings in long and wide use often vary depending upon which government department or agency uses them. To the point, a few examples are Quilandy vs. Koyilandy, Canannore vs. Kannur, and Rangiya vs. Rangia. Different departments of the government may have used official spellings in use at the time, while locations associated with Indian railways mostly maintained British-era spellings. The confusion inherent in such variations has often resulted in serious consequences like people having two \\"different\\" addresses (theoretically designating the same place) in their official records leading to legal disputes, or one house having residents of different house addresses due to differing place names. Many people argue that such confusion can lead to indeterminate and/or unintended consequences. =Renaming in local languages= In the post-colonial era, several Indian states' names were changed. Some of these changes coincided with the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, a major reform of the boundaries of India's states and territories that organised them along linguistic lines. At this time, for example, Travancore- Cochin was renamed Kerala. Later state name changes include the reorganisation of Madhya Bharat into Madhya Pradesh in 1959;The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics, 1925 to the 1990s. - Page 134 Christophe Jaffrelot 1999 - \\"The new state included Madhya Bharat, the Bhopal region, the former Vindhya Pradesh, Mahakoshal and Chhattisgarh (the last two regions forming the Hindi- speaking parts in the former Madhya Pradesh; see map, pp. xxii-xxiii).\\" and the renamings of the Madras State to Tamil Nadu in 1969, of the Mysore State to Karnataka in 1973, and of Uttaranchal to Uttarakhand in 2007. Name changes have varied with respect to the levels of language at which they have been applied, and also accepted. Some of these local name changes were changes made in all languages: the immediate local name, and also all India's other languages. An example of this is the renaming of predominantly Hindi-speaking Uttaranchal () to a new local Hindi name ( Uttarakhand). Other changes were only changes in some of the indigenous languages. For example, the renaming of the Madras Presidency to Madras State in 1947 and then Tamil Nadu in 1969 required non-Tamil speakers to change from an approximation of the British name ( Madras Presidency, then Madras State ) to a native Tamil name ( Tamil Nadu, \\"Tamil country\\"). In general, changes to the local names of cities in the indigenous languages are less common. However, a change in English may sometimes also be a reflection of changes in other Indian languages other than the specific local one. For example, the change of Madras ( Madras) to Chennai ( Chennai) was reflected in many of India's languages, and incidentally in English, while the Tamil endonym had always been Chennai and remained unaffected by the change. Similarly, Bombay, which was always called Mumbai in Marathi, was restored to Mumbai in 1996, and Pondicherry to Puducherry (meaning New Town). =Renaming in English= Change in official English spelling The renaming of cities is often specifically from English to Indian English in connection with that dialect's internal reforms. In other words, the city itself is not actually renamed in the local language, and the local name (or endonym) in the indigenous languages of India does not change, but the official spelling in Indian English is amended. An example is the change from English \\"Calcutta\\" to English \\"Kolkata\\" ‚Äì the local Bengali name ( K√¥lkata) did not change. Such changes in English spelling may be in order to better reflect a more accurate phonetic transliteration of the local name, or may be for other reasons. In the early years after Indian independence, many name changes were effected in northern India for English spellings of Hindi place names that had simply been romanised inconsistently by the British administration ‚Äì such as the British spelling \\"Jubbulpore,\\" renamed \\"Jabalpur\\" () among the first changes in 1947.

In several instances, the name change represents a struggle between a cosmopolitan elite and a local, regional-language populace over defining the city in ways that go far beyond a simple change of name.\\" Since independence, such changes have typically been enacted officially by legislation at local or national Indian government level, and may or may not then be adopted by the Indian media, particularly the influential Indian press. In the case of smaller towns and districts which were less notable outside and inside India, and where a well known English name (or exonym) could not be said to exist, older spellings used under British India may not have had any specific legislation other than changes in practice on the romanisation of indigenous Indian language names. Realignment of the official Indian English name to an alternative local name Aside from changes to the official English spellings of local names there have also been renaming proposals to realign the official name, hence the English name with an alternative local name.

He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate. Pal was one of the main architects of the Swadeshi movement along with Sri Aurobindo. He stood against the partition of Bengal by the colonial British government. Early life and background Bipin Chandra Pal was born in the village of Poil, Habiganj, Sylhet District, Bengal Presidency of British India, in a Hindu Bengali Kayastha family. His Sylheti father was Ramchandra Pal, a Persian scholar, and small landowner. He studied and taught at the Church Mission Society College (now the St. Paul's Cathedral Mission College), an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. His son was Niranjan Pal, one of the founders of Bombay Talkies. His son-in-law was the ICS officer, S. K. Dey, who later became a union minister. His another son-in-law was freedom fighter Ullaskar Dutta who married Lila Dutta his childhood love interest after many circumstances at their last age. As revolutionary as he was in politics, Pal was the same in his private life as well. After his first wife died, he married a widow and joined the Brahmo Samaj. Work Pal featured on a 1958 Indian stamp. Pal is known as the Father of Revolutionary Thoughts in India and was one of the freedom fighters of India. Pal became a major leader of the Indian National Congress. At the Madras session of Indian National Congress held in 1887, Bipin Chandra Pal made a strong plea for repeal of the Arms Act which was discriminatory in nature. Along with Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak he belonged to the Lal, Bal, Pal trio that was associated with revolutionary activity. Sri Aurobindo Ghosh and Pal were recognised as the chief exponents of a new national movement revolving around the ideals of Purna Swaraj, Swadeshi, boycott and national education. His programme consisted of Swadeshi, boycott and national education. He preached and encouraged the use of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to eradicate poverty and unemployment. He wanted to remove social evils from the form and arouse the feelings of nationalism through national criticism. He had no faith in mild protests in the form of non-cooperation with the British colonialists. On that one issue, the assertive nationalist leader had nothing common with Mahatma Gandhi. During the last six years of his life, he parted company with the Congress and led a secluded life. Sri Aurobindo referred to him as one of mightiest prophets of nationalism. Bipin Chandra Pal made his efforts to remove social and economic ills. He opposed caste system and advocated widow remarriage. He advocated 48 hours of work week and demanded for the hike in wages of workers. He expressed his disdain for Gandhi's ways, which he criticised for being rooted in ‚Äúmagic‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlogic‚Äù. As a journalist, Pal worked for Bengal Public Opinion, The Tribune and New India, where he propagated his brand of nationalism. He wrote several articles warning India of the changes happening in China and other geopolitical situations. In one of his writings, describing where the future danger for India will come from, Pal wrote under the title \\"Our Real Danger\\".

He became known as the Grand Dauphin after the birth of his own son, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Petit Dauphin. As he died before his father, he never became king. His grandson became Louis XV of France. Biography Louis was born on 1 November 1661 at the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, the eldest son of Louis XIV of France and Maria Theresa of Austria (who were double first-cousins to each other). As a Fils de France (\\"Son of France\\") he was entitled to the style of Royal Highness. He was baptised on 24 March 1662 at the chapel of the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en- Laye and given his father's name of Louis. At the ceremony, the Cardinal de Vend√¥me and the Princess of Conti acted as proxies for the godparents, Pope Clement IX and Queen Henrietta Maria of England. The latter was Louis's great- aunt. It was for this occasion that Jean-Baptiste Lully composed the motet Plaude Laetare Gallia. He was initially under the care of royal governesses, among them being Julie d'Angennes and Louise de Prie de La Mothe-Houdancourt. When Louis reached the age of seven, he was removed from the care of women and placed in the society of men. He received Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier, as his governor and was tutored by Jacques B√©nigne Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, the great French preacher and orator, without positive result: It was said that when Louis was an adult, he could pass a whole day simply tapping his cane against his foot in an armchair. Nonetheless, his generosity, affability, and liberality gave him great popularity in Paris and with the French people in general. Louis was one of six legitimate children of his parents. The others all died in early childhood; the second longest-lived, Marie Th√©r√®se of France, died at the age of five when Louis was 11. Louis XIV, too, had a low opinion of his son: : indolent, fatuous, and dull, only the saving grace of his bourgeois morals kept him from outraging the pious people about him. Like his father he enjoyed the hunt, but that was about the only way in which this disappointing son resembled his father. John B. Wolf, Louis XIV (1968) p 606 Alive especially to political considerations, the King considered various European royal daughters as possible wives for his heir, such as Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Louis' own cousin Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, daughter of Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, and Princess Henrietta of England. According to various reports, Marie Louise and Louis were in love, having grown up with each other. However, Louis XIV decided to use Marie Louise to forge a link with Spain and forced her to marry the invalid Charles II of Spain, the Dauphin's own half-uncle. Louis was engaged to his second cousin, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, when he was seven. She was a year older than Louis and, upon arriving at the French court, was described as being very unattractive. Nonetheless, she was a very cultured princess, and made initially a good impression upon her arrival as she was able to speak French fluently. They were married by proxy in Munich on 28 January 1680; the couple met for the first time on 7 March 1680 in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne. Political and military role Although he was permitted at first to attend and later to participate in the Conseil d'en haut, Louis did not play an important part in French politics. Nonetheless, as the heir to the throne, he was constantly surrounded by cabals battling for future prominence. Apart from the minor political role he played during his father's reign, Louis engaged in more leisurely pursuits and was esteemed for his magnificent collection of art at Versailles and Meudon. Louis XIV purchased Meudon for him from the widow of Louvois. The Dauphin employed Jules Hardouin Mansart and the office of the B√¢timents du Roi, but most particularly his long-term \\"house designer\\" Jean B√©rain, head of the Menus Plaisirs, to provide new decors. He lived quietly at Meudon for the remainder of his life surrounded by his two half-sisters Marie Anne de Bourbon and the Princess of Cond√©, both of whom he loved dearly. These three made up the main part of the Cabal de Meudon which opposed the Dauphin's son Louis and his Savoyard wife, the Duchess of Burgundy. During the War of the Grand Alliance, he was sent in 1688 to the Rhineland front. Before leaving the court, Louis was thus instructed by his father: > In sending you to command my army, I am giving you an opportunity to make > known your merit; go and show it to all Europe, so that when I come to die > it will not be noticed that the King is dead. There Louis succeeded, under the tutelage of Marshal de Duras and Vauban, in taking one of the bridgeheads across the Rhine, Philippsburg, which was surrounded by marshes. Louis' courage was shown when he visited the soldiers in the inundated trenches under heavy fire to observe the progress of the siege.Dunlop, Ian, Louis XIV, Pimlico London, 2001, p.309 Montausier, his former governor, wrote to him thus: > I shall not compliment you on the taking of Philippsburg; you had a good > army, bombs, cannons and Vauban. I shall not compliment you because you are > brave. That virtue is hereditary. But I rejoice with you that you have been > liberal, generous, humane, and have recognised the services of those who did > well.Dunlop, 309. The Grand DauphinLouis' capture of Philippsburg prevented the large gathering Imperial army from crossing the Rhine and invading Alsace. Louis's position in the Conseil d'en haut gave him an opportunity to have his voice heard in the years and crises leading up to the War of the Spanish Succession. From his mother, Louis had rights and claims to the Spanish throne. His uncle Charles II of Spain had produced no descendants and, as he lay dying, had no heir to whom he could pass the throne. The choice of a successor was essentially split between the French and Austrian claimants. In order to improve the chances of a Bourbon succession, Louis gave up his (and his eldest son's) rights in favour of his second son, Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), who, as second son, was not expected to succeed to the French throne, thus keeping France and Spain separate. Moreover, in the discussions in the Conseil d'en haut regarding the French response to Charles II's last will and testament, which did indeed leave all Spanish possessions to Anjou, Louis persuasively argued for acceptance. He opposed those who advocated a rejection of the will and the adherence to the Partition Treaty signed with William III of England, even though that Treaty had awarded Naples, Sicily and Tuscany to him. Louis died of smallpox on 11 April 1711, at the age of 49, predeceasing his father. Literary tribute *The Delphin Classics was a large edition of the Latin classics, edited in the 1670s for Louis (Delphin is the adjective derived from dauphin) Thirty-eight scholars contributed to the series, which was edited by Pierre Huet, with assistance from several co-editors including Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet and Anne Dacier. Marriages Louis married Duchess Maria Anna of Bavaria on 7 March 1680. She was known in France as Dauphine Marie Anne Victoire. Although the marriage was not a close one, the couple had three sons. The Dauphine died in 1690 and in 1695 Louis secretly married his lover Marie √âmilie de Joly de Choin. His new wife did not acquire the status of Dauphine of France, and the marriage remained without surviving issue. Pregnant at the time of her marriage, de Choin gave birth to a son, who was secretly sent to the countryside; the child died aged two, in 1697, without having been publicly named.Genealogy Database by Daniel de Rauglaudre =Issue= * Louis (16 August 1682 ‚Äì 18 February 1712), Duke of Burgundy and later Dauphin of France; married his double-second-cousin, Maria Adelaide of Savoy, elder daughter of the Duke of Savoy and was the father of the future Louis XV of France; * Philip (19 December 1683 ‚Äì 9 July 1746), Duke of Anjou and later King of Spain; married firstly his double-second-cousin, Maria Luisa of Savoy, younger daughter of the Duke of Savoy, and had issue; married secondly Elisabeth Farnese and had issue including the future Dauphine of France, Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain; * Charles (31 July 1686 ‚Äì 5 May 1714), Duke of Berry, of Alen√ßon and of Angoul√™me, Count of Ponthieu; married Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans and had issue but none survived over a year. Thus, through his two older sons Burgundy and Anjou, Louis ensured respectively the continuation of the senior Bourbon line on the throne of France and the establishment of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty. Besides his unnamed child with Mme de Choin, Louis had two illegitimate daughters with Fran√ßoise Pitel:Genealogy Database by Daniel de Rauglaudre *Anne Louise de Bourbon (1695 ‚Äì August 1716) ‚Äì wife of Anne Errard d'Avaugour; *Charlotte de Fleury (6 February 1697 ‚Äì 1750) ‚Äì wife of G√©rard Michel de La Jonch√®re. With another mistress, Marie Anne Caumont de La Force, he had one daughter: *Louise √âmilie de Vautedard (1694‚Äì1719) ‚Äì wife of Nicolas Mesnager. Legend has it that a prophecy told at his birth said that Louis would be \\"son of a king, father of a king, but never a king\\". This was thought to be fulfilled as he was the son of Louis XIV of France and father of Philip V of Spain, but did not himself become king. Ancestry Louis's paternal grandparents were Louis XIII of France and Anne of Austria; he was descended, on his mother's side, from Philip IV of Spain and √âlisabeth of France. Louis XIII and √âlisabeth de Bourbon were siblings (the children of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici), as were Anne of Austria and Philip IV, who were the children of Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. That means that he had only four great grandparents instead of the usual eight, and that his parents had the same coefficient of coancestry (1/8) as if they were half-siblings.

The Treaty of The Hague (1698), or First Partition Treaty, made Joseph Ferdinand heir to the Spanish throne but became redundant when he died of smallpox in February 1699. The Treaty of London replaced him with Archduke Charles, the younger son of Emperor Leopold I, but ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of war in 1701. Background Charles II, 1665-1700; last Habsburg King of Spain In 1665, Charles II became the last Habsburg King of Spain; he suffered from ill health most of his life and by 1698 it seemed likely he would die childless. Spain's financial and military power declined during the 17th century but it remained powerful and largely intact, with territories in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and large areas of the Americas. Since the closest heirs were from the ruling Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families, the succession was of great significance to the European balance of power and a matter of debate for many years. Cardinal Portocarrero, leader of the pro-Bourbon group at the Spanish court William III of England saw the Partition Treaties as a way of building on the relationship established at Ryswick with Louis XIV to create a lasting peace. Imposing a solution to such an important issue on Spain and Austria seemed unlikely even at the time, especially given the levels of mistrust between the signatories, which had been at war almost continuously since 1670. The English negotiated both treaties without notifying the Parliament or William's own ministers[NB}. That was still common practice in France but was no longer the case in England; Lord Somers, one of the Whig Junto, which managed the English government for William, was generally hostile to the provisions of the First Partition Treaty about which he learned only shortly before its signature. Few British or Dutch politicians trusted Louis, an impression strengthened when the Marquis d'Harcourt was sent as envoy to Madrid in November 1698 to build Spanish support for a French candidate. The Spanish were unwilling to allow their empire to be partitioned without consultation to suit the needs of foreign powers. On 14 November 1698, Charles published his will, making Joseph Ferdinand heir to an undivided Spanish Monarchy, thus ignoring the territorial adjustments specified in the First Partition Treaty. When the six-year-old died of smallpox in February 1699, another solution was required. Negotiations Queen Consort Maria-Anna, head of the 'Austrian' faction The Spanish were split into pro-Austrian and pro- French factions, the latter led by Fern√°ndez de Portocarrero, Cardinal and Archbishop of Toledo. For much of Charles' reign, the government was controlled by the 'Austrians', headed by his mother, Mariana of Austria, until her 1696 death and then his second wife, Maria Anna of Neuberg after her death in 1696. Under their influence, Spain joined the anti-French coalition during the Nine Years' War, which proved to be disastrous. By 1696, France held most of Catalonia, with Spain declaring bankruptcy in 1692. It had previously done so nine times between 1557 and 1666, including 1647, 1652, 1661 and 1666. However, Maria Anna retained power with the help of spurious rumours of her pregnancy. However, Charles was forced to banish some of her German entourage. For various reasons, the Austrians were unpopular with most of the Spanish nobility. Charles himself resented their arrogance and made it clear to Harcourt that he would not agree to partition the empire. Many genuinely believed that a French candidate was preferable; the wars of the last 50 years suggested France was a better ally than opponent, and its ability to impose a solution on Spain or to protect it was much greater than that of Austria. After the death of Joseph Ferdinand, the Marquess of Torcy, Louis' senior foreign policy advisor, quickly agreed the terms of a revised treaty, which William approved in June 1699. However, after Austria refused the territorial concessions, the Dutch also delayed their consent. It was not until 12 March 1700 that the treaty was finally signed in London, followed by in The Hague on 24th. Provisions de Torcy, architect of the Treaty and Louis' Foreign Minister The main change from the First Treaty was to replace Joseph Ferdinand with Archduke Charles heir to the Spanish throne, retaining Spain, its overseas Empire and the Spanish Netherlands. France received Naples, Sicily and the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa as well as the Duchy of Milan, which it would exchange for the Duchy of Lorraine. France would also transfer Naples and Sicily to Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy in exchange for the Counties of Nice and Savoy. While Leopold now accepted the principle of dividing the Spanish Empire, he objected to France being granted Spanish possessions in Italy, particularly Milan, which was considered essential to the security of Austria's southern borders. In addition, Lorraine was an imperial state occupied by France in 1670 and only returned in 1697, whose recently restored hereditary Duke of Lorraine was Leopold's nephew. Therefore, neither Leopold or Victor Amadeus had agreed the territorial exchanges required by the treaty, and Spain would not even accept the principle. Aftermath Somers for approving the treaties without informing Parliament established an important legal principle. When the Spanish learned of the terms of the treaty of London in mid-June, Charles amended his will in favour of Archduke Charles, again specifying an undivided monarchy. In September, he became ill once more, and by the 28th, he was no longer able to eat. His death seemed imminent, and on 2 October, Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his will in favour of Louis XIV's grandson, Philip of Anjou. Charles ordered all previous versions of his will destroyed, and when he finally died in November 1700, Philip was offered the throne. When Louis received the formal Spanish offer to Philip on 9 November, one option was to insist on the Treaty of London. That made Archduke Charles King of Spain, but if Leopold continued to refuse the territorial concessions, France could call on Britain and the Dutch Republic to enforce the treaty. However, Foreign Minister Torcy reported that Britain and the Dutch Republlic wanted peace and would not fight and that the anti-French mood of the Austrian court meant war either way. On 16 November 1700, Philip of Anjou was proclaimed King of Spain. The two Partition Treaties failed to prevent the outbreak of war in 1701 although that was arguably the result of miscalculations by Louis. Their weak point was enforcement. As William noted when asked to put pressure on Leopold, it made little sense 'to go to war at present for a treaty I have only made to prevent war'. However, they demonstrated that imposing solutions by secret negotiations between monarchs without consultation was out of date. The reaction in England when Parliament was informed of the Treaties in March 1700 was one of fury, partly because of the terms, which were seen as actively damaging to English commercial interests, but also their approval without Parliament's knowledge. The Tory majority attempted to impeach those responsible, including Somers. While unsuccessful, the process embittered relations between the two parties and had a profound impact on British politics over the next two decades.

Its name alludes to its judicial centre being the township of West Derby (the suffix -shire meaning the territory was appropriated to the prefixed settlement). It covered the southwest of Lancashire, containing the ancient ecclesiastical parishes of Walton, Sefton, Childwall, Huyton, Halsall, Altcar, North Meols, Ormskirk, Aughton, Warrington, Prescot, Wigan, Leigh, Liverpool, and Winwick. It corresponds roughly to areas of Merseyside north of the River Mersey and also covered parts of modern West Lancashire Borough, Wigan borough, Warrington Borough and Halton Borough. History =Domesday Book= When the Domesday Book was compiled, this hundred was composed of three separate hundreds of West Derby,Open Domesday Online: (West) Derby Hundred, accessed July 2018. WarringtonOpen Domesday Online: Warrington Hundred, accessed July 2018. and Newton-in-Makerfield. The hundreds possibly united in the reign of Henry I. The hundred is surrounded on the west by the Irish Sea and in the south west and south by the River Mersey and Glazebrook, to the east is Salford Hundred and to the north east the River Douglas and Leyland Hundred. Apart from the manor which contained West Derby Castle, said to have been built by Roger of Poitou, there were several other manors which were owned by the Lord of the manor for his own use. At the time of the Conquest these manors incorporated six berewicks encompassing the villages of Thingwall, Liverpool, Great Crosby, Aintree, Everton, Garston and Hale. =Expansion of the boundaries= By the end of the 12th century the three separate hundreds had united and West Derby Castle was an important administrative centre rivalling Lancaster in the north of the county. Its position was strengthened by its proximity to the Port of Liverpool, which was founded by King John, trade with Cheshire and the passage of ferries from Liverpool to Birkenhead. By 1327 West Derby Castle was reported to be in ruins. =Court and laws on the hundred= A Wapentake court was held every three weeks with the steward of the hundred officiating. There had been a courthouse in West Derby for over 1000 years since the time of the Vikings. The present courthouse situated in West Derby is from a building which was constructed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The court was used for the presentation of minor offences, or breaches of any laws within the hundred. The King, or lord of the manor had his own bailiff, who was the officer to the sheriff, who had the duty to ensure peace within the hundred and collect any taxes or levys from the people. From the reign of Stephen of England to that of Henry IV this office was a hereditary title held by members of the Walton family of Walton-on-the-Hill. By the fifteenth century the master of the forest was held by members of the Molyneux family, who also held the title of steward of the hundred. =Land changes hands= On 18 October 1229, Henry III granted all land from the Ribble to the Mersey, including West Derby, Liverpool, the village of Salford, and the wapentake of Leyland to Ranulf Earl of Chester and Lincoln. When he died in 1232 without any heir the land was inherited by William de Ferrers, through his wife Agnes, sister of the late earl. The land was then passed on to his son William, and then to his son Robert. In 1263, Robert held court against several people who had committed offences against the deer of his forest. In 1266 he rebelled against the rule of the King Henry III and was beaten at the Battle of Chesterfield, following this he was stripped of his title and land, which returned to the hands of the Crown, which was then given to Edmund, the King's second son, who was later created Earl of Lancaster. The title and land followed the line of descent of honour of Lancaster from Edmund until it was merged into the Crown in 1413, and is vested in the reigning monarch. =19th Century= In 1835 and 1895, Liverpool expanded to include West Derby. In 1889, all remaining administrative functions of historic counties were replaced by Administrative counties of England.

There are currently three classes of the Fleet Marine Force pin, being that of enlisted, officer, and chaplain. Enlisted The FMF pin worn embroidered on a navy corpsman's shirt in July 2002 A corpsman in 2012 wearing the FMFEWS on a MARPAT uniform. A corpsman in June 2012 wearing the FMFEWS on the NSU. The Fleet Marine Force Enlisted Warfare Specialist Device (FMFEWS) is a qualification insignia of the United States Navy earned by enlisted U.S. Navy sailors assigned to the Fleet Marine Force of the U.S. Marine Corps who have successfully completed the requirements of the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per OPNAV Instruction 1414.4B. This involves serving one year with a Marine Corps unit (two years for reserves), passing the Marine Physical Fitness Test (PFT), a written test, demonstrating skills used in service with the Marines such as weapon breakdown and familiarization, land navigation, combat communications and an oral examination by senior enlisted sailors who are FMF qualified. The Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist designation is most commonly awarded to the hospital corpsman (HM) and religious program specialist (RP) ratings, although it is also awarded to other sailors who support Marine Corps commands (e.g. Logistics Specialists assigned to medical logistics companies). It was created in 2000.https://www.2ndmaw.marines.mil/News/Article- View/Article/522624/fleet-marine-warfare-specialists-marine-corps-knowledge- for-a-combat-navy/ An enlisted U.S. Navy sailor who has qualified, may place the designator (FMF) after his or her rate and/or rate; for example, HM3 John Doe, USN, having qualified for his FMF pin, is identified as HM3 (FMF) John Doe, USN. As of 2004, all U.S. Navy corpsmen assigned to a Marine unit are required to earn the FMF badge within 18 months of their being assigned to said unit. =Enlisted requirements= When qualifying for the Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare specialist pin, a sailor (typically a hospital corpsman, logistics specialist, religious programs specialist, personnel specialist, along with some construction battalion \\"SeaBee\\" units [when directly assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps combatant command]) is required to have detailed knowledge on the following subjects: CORE *Safety Fundamentals (Operational Risk Management) *Marine Corps History, Rank Structure, and Courtesies (notable dates, personnel, battles, and Naval courtesies as they pertain to the USMC) *Marine Corps Mission and Organization *Administrative Fundamentals (Naval correspondence, courts martial, and service record information) *General Combat Leadership Fundamentals (Combat elements, POW rights and responsibilities, Military Code of Conduct) *First Aid and Field Sanitation Fundamentals (Triage, MEDEVAC & CASEVAC classifications, \\"Self\\" and \\"Buddy\\" aid skill sets for non-medical personnel) *Security Fundamentals (Security classifications, terrorism, lethal force, and guard skills training) *Field Communication Fundamentals (hands on detailed knowledge of the PRC-119 SINGARS radio, loading frequencies and communication of the 9-Line CASEVAC message) *Weapons Fundamentals (Detailed knowledge of small arms such as the M9, M16A4, M4, M1014, M67 grenade, M203, and M249SAW) and machine gun platforms (M240G, M2 .50 cal, Mk19) *Tactical Fundamental Procedures (platoon hand and arm signals, SALUTE and SMEAC reports, fighting positions, MOPP gear, formation movements in day/night conditions) *Marine Corps Operations Fundamentals (In- depth knowledge of all USMC aircraft, US Navy amphibious transports, hospital ships, as well as Urban warfare examples, and Military Operations Other Than War examples) *Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense Fundamentals (minefield signage and detailed signs, symptoms, & treatment of chemical agent exposures) *Drill and Ceremonies Fundamentals (breakdowns of formations, drill & cadence, color guards, and formal ceremonies) *Land Navigation Fundamentals (Map reading and compass handling)NAVEDTRA 43908-B Aug2010 Additionally a second section of the course is detailed toward the element of the United States Marine Corps with which the candidate is assigned. For example: a line corpsman with an infantry battalion will learn the Ground Combat Element (GCE). GCE *Infantry Fundamentals (Mission & structure of the Marine Division, Regiment, Battalion, Infantry & Weapons Companies, Platoon, Squad, and Fire teams) *Marine Artillery Regiment (Mission, structure, equipment of the Arty battalion; such as the m198 or m777 Howitzer) *Tank Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and equipment of the Tank Battalion; such as the M1A1, TOW Missile, M88A1E1 Hercules, and M60A1 Bridge Vehicle) *Assault Amphibious Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the AAB; such as the AAVP7A1, AAVC7A1 and AAVR7A1) *Combat Engineer Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, structure, mobility/counter mobility/survivability tasks of the CEB, Engineer Support Company, and Combat Engineer Company) *Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (Mission, structure, and vehicles of the LAV Battalion; such as the LAV-25, LAV-M, LAV-AT, LAV-C2, LAV-R, and LAV-L) *Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Fundamentals (Mission, tasks, and training of Force Recon and Division Recon) Furthermore, to finally qualify, a candidate is expected to perform a disassembly and reassembly of many of the taught weapon systems, operate a SINGARS radio, and plot various points on a map, perform various carries and life saving medical techniques, and in many cases perform (and pass) a Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test(PFT) and Combat Fitness Test (CFT) Although this is a qualification is for enlisted personnel serving in the United States Navy, it is unique in that only Commanding Generals or Commanding Officers of qualifying U.S. Marine Corps commands, Division, Group, or Wing; can approve awarding of the designation. As such, to some corpsmen it is the most coveted warfare insignia within the hospital corpsman community. The eagle, globe, and anchor (EGA) makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every Marine is a rifleman, just as every Sailor is a firefighter and damage controlman aboard ship and submarine. The surf and sand represent the \\"littoral zone,\\" the coastal regions where sailors have served alongside Marines as they earned their reputation and world's respect -- \\"the shores of Tripoli\\" and the \\"sands of Iwo Jima.\\" And has a scroll at the bottom stating \\"Fleet Marine Force\\" showing the exclusive community they belong to. Officer A highly polished gold and silver metal device depicting the eagle, globe and anchor atop two crossed rifles on a background of ocean swells breaking on a sandy beach and a scroll with the words \\"FLEET MARINE FORCE\\". The Fleet Marine Force Warfare Officer (FMFWO) Insignia is earned by Navy officers assigned to the Fleet Marine Force of the U.S. Marine Corps who have completed the requirements including serving for one year in a Marine Corps command, completing a written test, passing the Marine PFT, and an oral board conducted by FMF qualified officers. The FMF Qualified Officer Insignia is most commonly earned by staff officers in the medical fields, and chaplains, although it is also awarded to other officer communities, such as Civil Engineer Corps and naval gunfire officers. The FMFWO insignia is a gold, highly polished, metal device depicting the eagle, globe and anchor (EGA) atop two crossed rifles on a background of ocean swells breaking on a sandy beach atop a scroll with the words \\"Fleet Marine Force.\\" The EGA makes a clear statement that the wearer is a member of the Navy/Marine Corps team. The crossed rifles symbolize the rifleman ethic of the Marine Corps; every Marine is a rifleman, just as every Sailor is a firefighter and damagecontrolman aboard ship and submarine. The surf and sand represent the \\"littoral zone,\\" the coastal regions where Sailors have served alongside Marines as they earned their reputation and world's respect -- \\"the shores of Tripoli\\" and the \\"sands of Iwo Jima.\\" The eagle, continents, and rifles are highlighted with a highly polished silver finish. The qualification was created in July 2005; SECNAVINST 1412.10 outlines the requirements for qualification. Chaplain 250px Chaplains do not bear arms; therefore, they are designated as Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officers vice Fleet Marine Force Warfare Officers, and are waived from completing certain [weapons related] portions of the Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS). The Chaplain version of this badge does not include the crossed rifles and has a gold anodized finish. Navy Uniform Regulations, Chapter 5 Section 2 Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon 124px As a result of the Fleet Marine Force Qualified Officer and Enlisted Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist programs, the Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon was replaced effective October 1, 2006. Those individuals who previously qualified for the Navy Fleet Marine Force Ribbon will retain the FMF designator; however, they are not entitled to wear the EFMFWS insignia until completing another FMF assignment and meeting all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1414.4B.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure (postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)). It is taken by mouth once a day. Common side effects include headache, nausea, yellowish skin, abdominal pain, trouble sleeping, and fever. Severe side effects include rashes such as erythema multiforme and high blood sugar. Atazanavir appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease. Atazanavir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States it is not available as a generic medication. Medical uses Two Reyataz 200 mg capsules Atazanavir is used in the treatment of HIV. The efficacy of atazanavir has been assessed in a number of well-designed trials in ART-naive and ART-experienced adults. Atazanavir is distinguished from other protease inhibitors in that it has lesser effects on lipid profile and appears to be less likely to cause lipodystrophy. There may be some cross-resistant with other protease inhibitors. When boosted with ritonavir it is equivalent in potency to lopinavir for use in salvage therapy in people with a degree of drug resistance, although boosting with ritonavir reduces the metabolic advantages of atazanavir. = Pregnancy = No evidence of harm has been found among pregnant women taking atazanavir. It is one of the preferred HIV medications to use in pregnant women who have not taken an HIV medication before. It was not associated with any birth defects among over 2,500 live births observed. Atazanavir resulted in a better cholesterol profile and confirmed that it is a safe option during pregnancy. Contraindications Atazanavir is contraindicated in those with previous hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions). Additionally, atazanavir should not be given with alfuzosin, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone, pimozide, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, cisapride, St. John's wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, indinavir, or nevirapine.  Adverse effects  Common side effects include: nausea, jaundice, rash, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, insomnia, peripheral neurologic symptoms, dizziness, muscle pain, diarrhea, depression and fever. Bilirubin levels in the blood are normally asymptomatically raised with atazanavir, but can sometimes lead to jaundice.  Mechanism of action  Atazanavir binds to the active site HIV protease and prevents it from cleaving the pro-form of viral proteins into the working machinery of the virus. If the HIV protease enzyme does not work, the virus is not infectious, and no mature virions are made. The azapeptide drug was designed as an analog of the peptide chain substrate that HIV protease would cleave normally into active viral proteins. More specifically, atazanavir is a structural analog of the transition state during which the bond between a phenylalanine and proline is broken.Graziani, Amy L (June 17, 2014). \\"HIV protease inhibitors\\". UpToDate. Humans do not have any enzymes that break bonds between phenylalanine and proline, so this drug will not target human enzymes. Formulations Atazanavir is available as a 150 mg capsule, 200 mg capsule, 300 mg capsule, and 50 mg oral powder packet. The 300 mg capsule should reduce pill burden, as one 300 mg capsule may replace two 150 mg capsules.

Gas lighting is production of artificial light from combustion of a gaseous fuel, such as hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, propane, butane, acetylene, ethylene, coal gas (town gas) or natural gas. The light is produced either directly by the flame, generally by using special mixes of illuminating gas to increase brightness, or indirectly with other components such as the gas mantle or the limelight, with the gas primarily functioning as a fuel source. Before electricity became sufficiently widespread and economical to allow for general public use, gas was the most popular method of outdoor and indoor lighting in cities and suburbs. Early gas lights were ignited manually, but many later designs are self-igniting. Gas lighting now is generally used for camping, where the high energy density of a hydrocarbon fuel, combined with the modular nature of canisters (a strong metal container) allows bright and long lasting light to be produced cheaply and without complex equipment. In addition, some urban historical districts retain gas street lighting, and gas lighting is used indoors or outdoors to create or preserve a nostalgic effect. Background An overview of lighting technology, circa 1900 Early lighting fuels consisted of olive oil, beeswax, fish oil, whale oil, sesame oil, nut oil, and similar substances. These were the most commonly used fuels until the late 18th century. Chinese records dating back 1,700 years note the use of natural gas in the home for light and heat via bamboo pipes to the dwellings.P. James and N. Thorpe, Ancient inventions (Michael O Mara Books, 1995), pp. 427-428: citing Ch'ang Ch'√º (Â∏∏Áí©, a geographer), Records of the country south of Mount Kua (ËèØÈôΩÂúãÂøó). The ancient Chinese of the Spring and Autumn period made the first practical use of natural gas for lighting purposes around 500 B.C. where they used bamboo pipelines to transport and carry both brine and natural gas for many miles, such as the ones in Zigong salt mines. Public illumination preceded the discovery and adoption of gaslight by centuries. In 1417, Sir Henry Barton, Lord Mayor of London, ordained \\"lanterns with lights to be hung out on the winter evenings between Hallowtide and Candlemasse.\\" Paris was first lit by an order issued in 1524, and, in the beginning of the 16th century, the inhabitants were ordered to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets. In 1668, when some regulations were made for improving the streets of London, the residents were reminded to hang out their lanterns at the usual time, and, in 1690, an order was issued to hang out a light, or lamp, every night as soon as it was dark, from Michaelmas to Christmas. By an Act of the Common Council in 1716, all housekeepers, whose houses faced any street, lane, or passage, were required to hang out, every dark night, one or more lights, to burn from six to eleven o'clock, under the penalty of one shilling as a fine for failing to do so. In coal mining, accumulating and escaping gases were known originally for their adverse effects rather than their useful qualities. Coal miners described two types of gases, one called the choke damp and the other fire damp. In 1667, a paper detailing the effects of these gases was entitled, \\"A Description of a Well and Earth in Lancashire taking Fire, by a Candle approaching to it. Imparted by Thomas Shirley, Esq an eye-witness.\\" Stephen Hales was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal. His experiments with this object are related in the first volume of his Vegetable Statics, published in 1726. From the distillation of \\"one hundred and fifty-eight grains [10.2 g] of Newcastle coal, he states that he obtained one hundred and eighty cubic inches [2.9 L] of air, which weighed fifty-one grains [3.3 g], being nearly one third of the whole.\\" These results seemed to have passed without notice for several years. In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1733, some properties of coal-gas are detailed in a paper called, \\"An Account of the Damp Air in a Coal-pit of Sir James Lowther, sunk within Twenty Yards of the Sea.\\" This paper contained some striking facts relating to the flammability and other properties of coal-gas. The principal properties of coal-gas were demonstrated to different members of the Royal Society, and showed that after keeping the gas some time, it still retained its flammability. The scientists of the time still saw no useful purpose for it. John Clayton, in an extract from a letter in the Philosophical Transactions for 1735, calls gas the \\"spirit\\" of coal and discovered its flammability by an accident. This \\"spirit\\" happened to catch fire, by coming in contact with a candle as it escaped from a fracture in one of his distillatory vessels. By preserving the gas in bladders, he entertained his friends, by exhibiting its flammability. Early technology Passersby marvel at new gaslighting (London, 1809) Satirical cartoon showing dangers of early gaslighting (London, 1813) It took many years of development and testing before gas lighting for the stage was commercially available. Gas technology was then installed in just about every major theatre in the world. But gas lighting was short-lived because the electric light bulb soon followed. It took nearly 200 years for gas to become accessible for commercial use. A Flemish alchemist, Jan Baptista van Helmont, was the first person to formally recognize gas as a state of matter. He would go on to identify several types of gases, including carbon dioxide. Over one hundred years later in 1733, Sir James Lowther had some of his miners working on a water pit for his mine. While digging the pit they hit a pocket of gas. Lowther took a sample of the gas and took it home to do some experiments. He noted, \\"The said air being put into a bladder ‚Ä¶ and tied close, may be carried away, and kept some days, and being afterwards pressed gently through a small pipe into the flame of a candle, will take fire, and burn at the end of the pipe as long as the bladder is gently pressed to feed the flame, and when taken from the candle after it is so lighted, it will continue burning till there is no more air left in the bladder to supply the flame.\\"Penzel 28 Lowther had basically discovered the principle behind gas lighting. Later in the 18th century William Murdoch (sometimes spelled \\"Murdock\\") stated: \\"the gas obtained by distillation from coal, peat, wood and other inflammable substances burnt with great brilliancy upon being set fire to ‚Ä¶ by conducting it through tubes, it might be employed as an economical substitute for lamps and candles.\\"Penzel 29 Murdoch's first invention was a lantern with a gas- filled bladder attached to a jet. He would use this to walk home at night. After seeing how well this worked he decided to light his home with gas. In 1797, Murdoch installed gas lighting in his new home as well as the workshop in which he worked. ‚ÄúThis work was of a large scale, and he next experimented to find better ways of producing, purifying, and burning the gas.‚ÄùPenzel 30 The foundation had been laid for companies to start producing gas and other inventors to start playing with ways of using the new technology. Murdoch was the first to exploit the flammability of gas for the practical application of lighting. He worked for Matthew Boulton and James Watt at their Soho Foundry steam engine works in Birmingham, England. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company's steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal gas as the most effective. He first lit his own house in Redruth, Cornwall in 1792.Janet Thomson; The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story Of William Murdoch Inventor Of Gas Lighting; 2003; In 1798, he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting, the lights astonishing the local population. One of the employees at the Soho Foundry, Samuel Clegg, saw the potential of this new form of lighting. Clegg left his job to set up his own gas lighting business, the Gas Lighting and Coke Company. A \\"thermolampe\\" using gas distilled from wood was patented in 1799, whilst German inventor Friedrich Winzer (Frederick Albert Winsor) was the first person to patent coal-gas lighting in 1804. In 1801, Phillipe Lebon of Paris had also used gas lights to illuminate his house and gardens, and was considering how to light all of Paris. In 1820, Paris adopted gas street lighting. In 1804, Dr Henry delivered a course of lectures on chemistry, at Manchester, in which he showed the mode of producing gas from coal, and the facility and advantage of its use. Dr Henry analyzed the composition and investigated the properties of carburetted hydrogen gas (i.e. methane). His experiments were numerous and accurate and made upon a variety of substances; having obtained the gas from wood, peat, different kinds of coal, oil, wax, etc., he quantified the intensity of the light from each source. Josiah Pemberton, an inventor, had for some time been experimenting on the nature of gas. A resident of Birmingham, his attention may have been roused by the exhibition at Soho. About 1806, he exhibited gas lights in a variety of forms and with great brilliance at the front of his factory in Birmingham. In 1808 he constructed an apparatus, applicable for several uses, for Benjamin Cooke, a manufacturer of brass tubes, gilt toys, and other articles. In 1808, Murdoch presented to the Royal Society a paper entitled \\"Account of the Application of Gas from Coal to Economical Purposes\\" in which he described his successful application of coal-gas to light the extensive establishment of Messrs. Phillips and Lea. For this paper he was awarded Count Rumford's gold medal. Murdoch's statements threw great light on the comparative advantage of gas and candles, and contained much useful information on the expenses of production and management. Although the history is uncertain, David Melville has been credited with the first house and street lighting in the United States, in either 1805 or 1806 in Newport, Rhode Island. The first well-recorded public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in Pall Mall, London, on January 28, 1807, by Winsor. In 1812, Parliament granted a charter to the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company, and the first gas company in the world came into being. Less than two years later, on December 31, 1813, Westminster Bridge was lit by gas. As artificial lighting became more common, the desire grew for it to be readily available to the public: partly because towns became much safer places after gas lamps were installed in the streets, reducing crime rates. In 1809, accordingly, the first application was made to Parliament to incorporate a company in order to accelerate the process, but the bill failed to pass. In 1810, however, the application was renewed by the same parties, and though some opposition was encountered and considerable expense incurred, the bill passed, but not without great alterations; and the London and Westminster Chartered Gas-Light and Coke Company was established. By 1816, Samuel Clegg obtained the patent for his horizontal rotative retort, his apparatus for purifying coal-gas with cream of lime, and for his rotative gas meter and self-acting governor.

By this time, remaining gas lamps were rare curiosities. Among the economic impacts of gas lighting was much longer work hours in factories. This was particularly important in Great Britain during the winter months when nights are significantly longer. Factories could even work continuously over 24 hours, resulting in increased production. Following successful commercialization, gas lighting spread to other countries. In England, the first place outside London to have gas lighting was Preston, Lancashire, in 1816; this was due to the Preston Gaslight Company run by revolutionary Joseph Dunn, who found the most improved way of brighter gas lighting. The parish church there was the first religious building to be lit by gas lighting. In America, Seth Bemis lit his factory with gas illumination from 1812 to 1813. The use of gas lights in Rembrandt Peale's Museum in Baltimore in 1816 was a great success. Baltimore was the first American city with gas street lights; Peale's Gas Light Company of Baltimore on February 7, 1817 lit its first street lamp at Market and Lemon Streets (currently Baltimore and Holliday Streets). The first private residence in the US illuminated by gas has been variously identified as that of David Melville (c. 1806), as described above, or of William Henry, a coppersmith, at 200 Lombard Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1816. In 1817, at the three stations of the Chartered Gas Company in London, 25 chaldrons (24 m3) of coal were carbonized daily, producing 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m3) of gas. This supplied gas lamps equal to 75,000 Argand lamps each yielding the light of six candles. At the City Gas Works, in Dorset Street, Blackfriars, three chaldrons of coal were carbonized each day, providing the gas equivalent of 9,000 Argand lamps. So 28 chaldrons of coal were carbonized daily, and 84,000 lights supplied by those two companies only. At this period the principal difficulty in gas manufacture was purification. Mr. D. Wilson, of Dublin, patented a method for purifying coal-gas by means of the chemical action of ammoniacal gas. Another plan was devised by Reuben Phillips, of Exeter, who patented the purification of coal-gas by the use of dry lime. G. Holworthy, in 1818, patented a method of purifying it by passing the gas, in a highly condensed state, through iron retorts heated to a dark red. In 1820, Swedish inventor Johan Patrik Ljungstr√∂m had developed a gas lighting with copper apparatuses and chandeliers of ink, brass and crystal, reportedly one of the first such public installations of gas lightning in the region, enhanced as a triumphal arch for the city gate for a royal visit of Charles XIV John of Sweden in 1820.Protocol, √Öm√•ls R√•dhus, 10 February 1827, J. Jacobson By 1823, numerous towns and cities throughout Britain were lit by gas. Gas light cost up to 75% less than oil lamps or candles, which helped to accelerate its development and deployment. By 1859, gas lighting was to be found all over Britain and about a thousand gas works had sprung up to meet the demand for the new fuel. The brighter lighting which gas provided allowed people to read more easily and for longer. This helped to stimulate literacy and learning, speeding up the second Industrial Revolution. In 1824 the English Association for Gas Lighting on the Continent, a sizeable business producing gas for several cities in mainland, Europe, including Berlin, was established, with Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet as general manager. The 1839 invention, the Bude-Light, provided a brighter and more economical lamp. Oil-gas appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas. In 1815, John Taylor patented an apparatus for the decomposition of \\"oil\\" and other animal substances. Public attention was attracted to \\"oil-gas\\" by the display of the patent apparatus at Apothecary's Hall, by Taylor & Martineau. In 1891 the gas mantle was invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. This eliminated the need for special illuminating gas (a synthetic mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases produced by destructive distillation of bituminous coal or peat) to get bright shining flames. Acetylene was also used from about 1898 for gas lighting on a smaller scale. Illuminating gas was used for gas lighting, as it produces a much brighter light than natural gas or water gas. Illuminating gas was much less toxic than other forms of coal-gas, but less could be produced from a given quantity of coal. The experiments with distilling coal were described by John Clayton in 1684. George Dixon's pilot plant exploded in 1760, setting back the production of illuminating gas a few years. The first commercial application was in a Manchester cotton mill in 1806. In 1901, studies of the defoliant effect of leaking gas pipes led to the discovery that ethylene is a plant hormone. Throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th, the gas was manufactured by the gasification of coal. Later in the 19th century, natural gas began to replace coal-gas, first in the US, and then in other parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, coal-gas was used until the early 1970s. =Russia= The history of the Russian gas industry began with retired Lieutenant Pyotr Sobolevsky (1782‚Äì1841), who improved Philippe le Bon's design for a \\"thermolamp\\" and presented it to Emperor Alexander I in 1811; in January 1812, Sobolevsky was instructed to draw up a plan for gas street-lighting for St. Petersburg. The French invasion of Russia delayed implementation, but St. Petersburg's Governor General Mikhail Miloradovich, who had seen the gas lighting of Vienna, Paris and other European cities, initiated experimental work on gas lighting for the capital, using British apparatus for obtaining gas from pit coal, and by the autumn of 1819, Russia's first gas street light was lit on one of the streets on Aptekarsky Island. In February 1835, the Company for Gas Lighting St. Petersburg was founded; towards the end of that year, a factory for the production of lighting gas was constructed near the Obvodny Canal, using pit coal brought in by ship from Cardiff; and 204 gas lamps were ceremonially lit in St. Petersburg on September 27, 1839. Over the next 10 years, their numbers almost quadrupled, to reach 800. By the middle of the 19th century, the central streets and buildings of the capital were illuminated: the Palace Square, Bolshaya and Malaya Morskaya streets, Nevsky and Tsarskoselsky Avenues, Passage Arcade, Noblemen's Assembly, the Technical Institute and Peter and Paul Fortress.Alexander Yefimov and Lyudmila Volkova, \\"Pioneers of the Methane Age ,\\" Oil of Russia, No. 2, 2005.  Theatrical use  Diagram showing a typical limelight installation In the 19th century, gas stage lighting went from a crude experiment to the most popular way of lighting theatrical stages. In 1804, Frederick Albert Winsor first demonstrated the way to use gas to light the stage in London at the Lyceum Theatre. Although the demonstration and all the lead research were being done in London, \\"in 1816 at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia was the earliest gas lit theatre in world\\".Wilson,362 In 1817 the Lyceum, Drury Lane, and Covent Garden theatres were all lit by gas. Gas was brought into the building by \\"miles of rubber tubing from outlets in the floor called 'water joints'\\" which \\"carried the gas to border-lights and wing lights\\". But before it was distributed, the gas came through a central distribution point called a \\"gas table\\",Sellman 15 which varied the brightness by regulating the gas supply, and the gas table, which allowed control of separate parts of the stage. Thus it became the first stage 'switchboard'.Pilbrow 174 By the 1850s, gas lighting in theatres had spread practically all over the United States and Europe. Some of the largest installations of gas lighting were in large auditoriums, like the Theatre de Chatelet, built in 1862.Penzel 69 In 1875, the new Paris Opera was constructed. \\"Its lighting system contained more than twenty-eight miles [] of gas piping, and its gas table had no fewer than eighty-eight stopcocks, which controlled nine hundred and sixty gas jets.\\"Penzel 69 The theatre that used the most gas lighting was Astley's Equestrian Amphitheatre in London. According to the Illustrated London News, \\"Everywhere white and gold meets the eye, and about 200,000 gas jets add to the glittering effect of the auditorium ‚Ä¶ such a blaze of light and splendour has scarcely ever been witnessed, even in dreams.\\" Theatres switched to gas lighting because it was more economical than using candles and also required less labor to operate. With gas lighting, theatres would no longer need to have people tending to candles during a performance, or having to light each candle individually. \\"It was easier to light a row of gas jets than a greater quantity of candles high in the air.\\" Theatres also no longer needed to worry about wax dripping on the actors during a show. Gas lighting also had an effect on the actors. As the stage was brighter, they could now use less make- up and their motions did not have to be as exaggerated. Half-lit stages had become fully lit stages. Production companies were so impressed with the new technology that one said, \\"This light is perfect for the stage. One can obtain gradation of brightness that is really magical.\\" The best result was the improved respect from the audience. There was no more shouting or riots. The light pushed the actors more up stage behind the proscenium, helping the audience concentrate more on the action that was taking place on stage rather than what was going on in the house. Management had more authority on what went on during the show because they could see.Penzel 54 Gaslight was the leading cause of behavior change in theaters. They were no longer places for mingling and orange selling, but places of respected entertainment. =Types of lighting instruments= There were six types of burners, but four burners were really experimented with. * The first burner used was the single-jet burner, which produced a small flame. The tip of the burner was made out of lead, which absorbed heat, causing the flame to be smaller in size. It was discovered that the flame would burn brighter if the metal was mixed with other components, such as porcelain. * Flat burners were invented mainly to distribute gas and light evenly to the systems. * The fishtail burner was similar to the flat burner, but it produced a brighter flame and conducted less heat. * The last burner that was experimented with was the Welsbach burner. Around this time the Bunsen burner was in use along with some forms of electricity. The Welsbach was based on the idea of the Bunsen burner, still using gas. A cotton mesh with cerium and thorium was imbedded into the Welsbach. This source of light was named the gas mantle; it produced three times more light than the naked flame.Penzel 89 Several different instruments were used to light the stage in the 19th century fell; these included footlights, border lights, groundrows, lengths, bunch lights, conical reflector floods, and limelight spots. These mechanisms sat directly on the stage, blinding the eyes of the audience. *Footlights caused the actors' costumes to catch fire if they got too close. These lights also caused bothersome heat that affected both audience members and actors. Again, the actors had to adapt to these changes. They started fireproofing their costumes and placing wire mesh in front of the footlights. *Border lights, also known as striplights, were a row of lights that hung horizontally in the flies. Color was added later by dying cotton, wool, and silk cloth. *Lengths were constructed the same way as border lights, but mounted vertically in the rear where the wings were. *Bunch lights were a cluster of burners that sat on a vertical base that was fueled directly from the gas line. *The conical reflector can be related to the Fresnel lens used today. This adjustable box of light reflected a beam whose size could be altered by a barndoor. *Limelight spots are similar to today's current spotlighting system. This instrument was used in scene shops, as well as the stage.Penzel 95 Gas lighting did have some disadvantages. \\"Several hundred theatres are said to have burned down in America and Europe between 1800 and the introduction of electricity in the late 1800s. The increased heat was objectionable, and the border lights and wing lights had to be lighted by a long stick with a flaming wad of cotton at the end. For many years, an attendant or gas boy moved along the long row of jets, lighting them individually while gas was escaping from the whole row. Both actors and audiences complained of the escaping gas, and explosions sometimes resulted from its accumulation.\\" These problems with gas lighting led to the rapid adoption of electric lighting. By 1881, the Savoy Theatre in London was using incandescent lighting.Wilson 364 While electric lighting was introduced to theatre stages, the gas mantle was developed in 1885 for gas-lit theatres. \\"This was a beehive-shaped mesh of knitted thread impregnated with lime that, in miniature, converted the naked gas flame into in effect, a lime-light.\\"Baugh, 24 Electric lighting slowly took over in theatres. In the 20th century, it enabled better and safer theater productions, with no smell, relatively very little heat, and more freedom for designers.  Decline  This hospital lavatory could be lit by a dual gas and electric fixture (New Orleans, 1906) In the early 20th century, most cities in North America and Europe had gaslit streets, and most train station platforms had gas lights too. However, around 1880 gas lighting for streets and train stations began giving way to high voltage (3000‚Äì6000 volt) direct current and alternating current arc lighting systems. This time period also saw the development of the first electric power utility designed for indoor use. The new system by inventor Thomas Edison was designed to function similar to gas lighting. For reasons of safety and simplicity it used direct current (DC) at a relatively low 110 volts to light incandescent light bulbs. Voltage in wires steadily declines as distance increases, and at this low voltage power plants needed to be within about of the lamps. This voltage drop problem made DC distribution relatively expensive and gas lighting retained widespread usageA bit of Engineering History: The story of the fuel gas and electrical engineering company, by A. M. Gow, pp 181-183, The Electric Journal, Volume 14, Copyright 1917, The Westinghouse Club https://books.google.com/books?id=CjAyAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA181 with new buildings sometimes constructed with dual systems of gas piping and electrical wiring connected to each room, to diversify the power sources for lighting. The development of new alternating current power transmission systems in the 1880s and 90s by companies such as Ganz and AEG in Europe and Westinghouse Electric and Thomson-Houston in the US solved the voltage and distance problem by using high transmission line voltages, and transformers to drop the voltage for distribution for indoor lighting. Alternating current technology overcame many of the limitations of direct current, enabling the rapid growth of reliable, low-cost electrical power networks which finally spelled the end of widespread usage of gas lighting.  Modern outdoor usage  Modern gas street light in Berlin, Germany (2005) Gas train station lamp at Oakworth railway station in West Yorkshire, England Historic candelabrum in Prague from 1865, electrified in 1985, rebuilt back to gas light in 2012 In some cities, gas lighting is preserved or restored as a vintage nostalgic feature to support historic atmosphere of their historic centres. In the 20th century, most cities with gas streetlights replaced them with new electric streetlights. For example, Baltimore, the first US city to install gas streetlights, removed nearly all of them. A sole, token gas lamp is located at N. Holliday Street and E. Baltimore Street as a monument to the first gas lamp in America, erected at that location. However, gas lighting of streets has not disappeared completely from some cities, and the few municipalities that retained gas lighting now find that it provides a pleasing nostalgic effect. Gas lighting is also seeing a resurgence in the luxury home market for those in search of historical authenticity. The largest gas lighting network in the world is that of Berlin. With about 37,000 lamps (2014), it holds more than half of all working gas street lamps in the world, followed by D√ºsseldorf with 14,000 lamps (2020), of which at least 10,000 are to be retained https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/rheinland/duesseldorf-gaslaternen-bleiben- erhalten-100.html. In central London , gas lamps still light the Royal Parks, the exterior of Buckingham Palace and almost the entire Covent Garden area. Elsewhere in England, The Park Estate in Nottingham retains much of its original character, including the original gas lighting network, and Oakworth railway station on the preserved Keighley and Worth Valley Railway is one of the few train stations in the world that retains its original platform gas lights. In the United States, more than 2800 gas lights in Boston operate in the historic districts of Beacon Hill, Back Bay, Bay Village, Charlestown, and parts of other neighborhoods. In Cincinnati, Ohio, more than 1100 gas lights operate in areas that have been named historic districts. Gas lights also operate in parts of the famed French Quarter and outside historic homes throughout the city in New Orleans. South Orange, New Jersey, has adopted the gaslight as the symbol of the town, and uses them on nearly all streets. Several other towns in New Jersey also retain gas lighting: Glen Ridge, Palmyra, Riverton, and some parts of Orange, Cape May and Cherry Hill. The village of Riverside, Illinois, still uses its original gas street lights that are an original feature of the Frederick Law Olmsted planned community. Manhattan Beach, California, has a gas lamp section in which all the sidewalks are lit by public gas lamps. Disneyland has authentic 19th century gas lamps from Baltimore along the \\"Main Street, U.S.A.\\" section of the theme park. Prague had about 10,000 gas streetlamps in the 1940s. The last historic gas candelabras become electrified in 1985.Robert Oppelt: Pouliƒçn√≠ lampy sv√≠t√≠ u≈æ 160 let. MF Dnes, 15. September 2007 However, in 2002‚Äì2014, streetlamps along the Royal Route and some other streets in the centre were rebuilt to use gas (using replicas of the historic poles and lanterns), several historic candelabras (Hradƒçansk√© n√°mƒõst√≠, Loret√°nsk√° street, Dra≈æick√©ho n√°mƒõst√≠ etc.) were also converted back to gas lamps, and five new gas lamps were installed in the Michle Gasworks as a promotion.Tom√°≈° Belica: Rozhovor: Plynov√© lampy maj√≠ v Praze sv√© m√≠sto, ≈ô√≠k√° lamp√°≈ô, Metro.cz, 15 September 2014 In 2018, there were 417 points (about 650 lanterns) of street gas lighting in Prague.Pra≈æsk√© ve≈ôejn√© osvƒõtlen√≠ v letech 1918‚Äì2018 , prahasviti.cz, 26.

Besides producing a lot of heat, the combustion of methane tends to release significant amounts of carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas which is more readily absorbed by the blood than oxygen, and can be deadly. Historically, the use of lamps of all types was of shorter duration than we are accustomed to with electric lights, and in the far more draughty buildings, it was of less concern and danger. There are no suppliers of new mantle gas lamps set up for use with natural gas; however, some old homes still have fixtures installed, and some period restorations have salvaged fixtures installed, more for decoration than use. New fixtures are still made and available for propane (sometimes called \\"bottle(d) gas\\"), a product of oil refining, which under most circumstances burns more completely to carbon dioxide and water vapor. In some locations where public utility electricity or kerosene are not readily accessible or desirable, propane gas mantle lamps are still used, although the increased availability of alternative energy sources, such as solar panels and small scale wind generators, combined with increasing efficiency of lighting products, such as compact fluorescent lamps and LEDs are also in use. For occasional use in remote cabins and cottages, propane mantle lamps may still be more economical and less labor-intensive than an alternative energy system.  Other uses  Perforated tubes bent into the shape of letters were used to form gas lit advertising signs, prior to the introduction of neon lights, as early as 1857 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gas lighting is still in common use for camping lights. Small portable gas lamps, connected to a portable gas cylinder, are a common item on camping trips. Mantle lamps powered by vaporized petrol, such as the Coleman lantern, are also available.

Biography  Rivers hails from Gympie, Queensland, and attended medical school at University of New South Wales, where he was friends with students from Hong Kong who introduced him to Cantopop. After discontinuing his medical degree, he moved to Hong Kong. Two weeks after he landed, he ran into some band members of Alan Tam, whose driver he had been during a Sydney visit, and was invited to sing with him. As a debutant with a modicum of Cantonese, Rivers auditioned and was chosen for a Caucasian role at Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB). Rivers adopted the Chinese name Ho Kwok- wing, the surname meaning River and the given name being that of his idol Leslie Cheung. He went on to become TVB's staple stereotypical 'gweilo' (Caucasian) for two decades. In 2005, Rivers appeared on stage beside Teresa Teng in an opera production. In October 2007, Rivers was one of the four non- Chinese TV actors featured in an in-depth interview and feature story 'Hello Neighbour' in Muse, discussing his sense of cultural identity and how he saw his work. Rivers' stint with TVB ended in 2008. In a TV interview aired on 19 March 2007 on TVB, Rivers mentioned his reason for learning Cantonese was his association with Hong Kong Cantonese-speaking friends during his time at the University of New South Wales. It was this close friendship and the songs of Leslie Cheung that sparked his interest in learning the language. Rivers has quipped that he was \\"TVB's token Caucasian for 20 years straight\\", having played many different stereotyped roles in more than 200 dramas for TVB. He is also a frequent YouTube poster, having his own prolific number of video clips of himself and his many colleagues within the Hong Kong media industry. His performance of the song \\"Forever ATV\\", which made fun of the apparent government support for Asia Television (the doomed Hong Kong No. 2 broadcast television station that was then on the brink of collapse and finally to be stripped of its broadcasting licence and close its doors) was awarded \\"Hong Kong's most popular male singer 2015\\" at the satirical \\"TVMost 1st Guy Ten Big Ging Cook Gum Cook Awards Distribution\\" (TVMost's First Top Ten Wonderful Songs, Golden Songs Awards Ceremony) in January 2016. His rendition of his own Cantonese rap song È¶ôÊ∏ØÂú∞ (This Hong Kong) was welcomed as a defence of localism during difficult political times.

The Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain was a sister organisation in Great Britain. Origins The Home Rule League grew out of the Home Government Association, a pressure group formed in 1870 and led by Isaac Butt, a Dublin based barrister who had once been a leading Irish Tory before becoming a convert to Irish nationalism. On 18‚Äì21 November 1873, the loose association re-constituted itself as a full political party, the Home Rule League, and in the 1874 general election, many of whom were from an Irish aristocratic or gentry Church of Ireland background, some newly dedicated former Irish Liberal Party members, such as Sir John Gray MP, and other more radical members who gathered around Cavan MP Joseph Biggar and Meath MP Charles Stewart Parnell. This radical wing of the party launched parliamentary filibusters to obstruct the passage of Parliamentary business, to the embarrassment of Butt and frustration of successive British governments. Changes under Parnell On 28 August 1877 Parnell was elected leader of the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain in place of Butt. In January 1878, Butt retained control of the Home Rule League in Ireland, which had a more middle-class and less Fenian membership and structure. The division affected the disciple of the parliamentary party at Westminster. Following Butt's death in 1879, William Shaw served as chairman (leader) for one parliamentary session. In 1880, Parnell was elected chairman of the party, and in the 1880 general election, the party increased its number of seats. In 1882, as part of a wholesale move from being an informal alliance to a cohesive unified, political movement Parnell renamed it the Irish Parliamentary Party to pursue Irish Home Rule. The party under Parnell, himself a Protestant, became more radical, middle class, and Catholic. It largely, though not completely, squeezed out other political rivals, notably the Irish Liberal Party and the Irish Conservative Party.

After several highly publicized delays, Boo.com launched in the autumn of 1999 selling branded fashion apparel over the Internet. The company spent $135 million of venture capital in just 18 months, and it was placed into receivership on 18 May 2000 and liquidated. In June 2008, CNET hailed Boo.com as one of the greatest dot-com busts in history. Ernst Malmsten wrote about the experience in a book called Boo Hoo: A dot.com Story from Concept to Catastrophe, published in 2001.  Marketing plan  = Company vision = Boo.com was intended to become the largest online sports e-retailer in the world, planning to set up stores in both Europe and America simultaneously. = Brand name = The brand name was initially suggested as Bo.com, which was inspired by the actor Bo Derek. The final domain name, Boo.com, was bought for $2500 from a dealer as the domain Bo.com was already in use. = Strategy = The target customers of Boo.com were young, wealthy and fashionable people between 18 and 24 years old, who were expected to be attracted by sports and fashion brands offered by Boo.com. Boo.com created a virtual shopping assistant, Miss Boo, to assist customers with tips given at each step. Boo.com also developed technology that allowed online customers to put their chosen products onto 3D models and then inspect the result.  Headquarters and relaunch  The company had its headquarters along Carnaby Street in London in a building which it initially shared with the Erotic Review Magazine.Wray, Richard. \\"Boo.com spent fast and died young but its legacy shaped internet retailing.\\" The Guardian. 16 May 2005. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. The company initially had 40 employees.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Boo.com, Online Fashion Retailer, Goes Out of Business.\\" The New York Times. 19 May 2000. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. In October 1999, it had a total of eight offices and 400 employees in Amsterdam, Munich, New York City, Paris, and Stockholm. It relaunched in the autumn of 2000 with Kate Buggeln, an ex-Bloomingdale's salesperson and Internet consultant, appointed as president. She told Women's Wear Daily that they were working to \\"expand beyond the portal business model into Boo products and Boo licensing.\\"Seckler, Valerie, \\"Boo Names New Boss: Kate Buggelin,\\" WWD, Mon. 17 July 2000, p.14  Reasons for failure  = Timing = Although there were several months of delays prior to launch and problems with the user experience when boo.com first launched, these had been largely fixed by the time the company entered receivership. Sales had grown rapidly and were around $500,000 for the fortnight prior to the site being shut down. The fundamental problem was that the company was following an extremely aggressive growth plan, launching simultaneously in multiple European countries. This plan was founded on the assumption of the ready availability of venture capital money to see the company through the first few years of trading until sales caught up with operating expenses. Such capital ceased to be available for all practical purposes in the second quarter of 2000 following dramatic falls in the NASDAQ presaging the \\"dot crash\\" following the Dot-com bubble. Boo was one of numerous similar Dot-com company failures over the subsequent two years. One Boo.com manager acknowledges that the company's failure was that global marketing and advertising costs too much, and that managers and technology invest too little. It spent $135 million of its investment in 2 years. = Problems with the user experience = The Boo.com Homepage as it appeared in May 2000. The boo.com website was widely criticized as poorly designed for its target audience, going against many usability conventions. The site relied heavily on JavaScript and Flash technology to display pseudo-3D views of wares as well as Miss Boo, a sales-assistant-style avatar. The first publicly released version of the site included many large pages; the home page, for example, was several hundred kilobytes which meant that many users had to wait minutes for the site to load, as broadband technologies were not widely available at the time. The site's front page contained the warning, \\"this site is designed for 56K modems and above\\". The complicated design required the site to be displayed in a fixed-size window, which limited the space available to display product information to the customer. Navigation techniques changed as the customer moved around the site. The site's interface was complex and included a hierarchical system that required the user to answer four or five different questions before sometimes revealing that there were no products in stock in a particular sub-section. The same basic questions then had to be answered again until results were found. = Excessive expenditure on marketing = Within 18 months, $135 million was spent on marketing by Boo.com. Boo.com spent $25 million on advertising and public relations marketing before it had even opened to sell products. To attract consumers, the site developed a new Internet virtual technology with which consumers could drag their intended clothes onto a virtual 3D body model, and then view it from whatever angles and distance they wanted. The investment in this technology cost Boo.com over $6 million to develop and $0.5 million every month to maintain.  Burn rate  Boo.com spent ¬£125 million in just six months. Boo.com's sales did not match expectations, due partly to a higher-than-expected rate of product returns (a service that was offered for free, but charged for by their logistics supplier Deutsche Post). Poor management and a lack of communication between departments resulted in rapid growth in costs. The effectiveness of an expensive ad campaign was limited since the website was not ready in time, resulting in curious visitors being greeted with a holding page. Staff and contractors were recruited in large numbers, with a lack of direction and executive decision about how many people were required, resulting in high payroll costs.  Aftermath  The biggest loser among boo.com's investors was Omnia, a fund backed by members of Lebanon's wealthy Hariri family, which put nearly ¬£20 million into the company. Creditors, most of whom were advertising agencies, were owed around ¬£12 million. Over 400 staff and contractors were made redundant in London and around the world, and many had not been paid for several months. In a widely circulated article, former Interim CTO Tristan Louis broke down the problems that plagued the company, in one of the first post-mortems of a technology company posted online. Fashionmall.com, which had been operating since 1994, bought the remains of Boo.com, which included brand, web address and advertising materials but did not include any physical assets, software or distribution channels. The deal also included the Miss Boo character. Boo's main assets, its software and technology, were sold to Bright Station, a British company run by Internet entrepreneur Dan Wagner, for $250,000 and served as the basis for Venda Inc. Wagner credited the technology he acquired as key to the success of Venda (and its eventual acquisition by NetSuite for US$50M in 2014. Less than $2 million was earned by selling all Boo's remaining assets. Of the original global boo.com staff only one worked for both boo.com incarnations. Bill Burley of the original boo.com staff in New York City is a retail executive in buying and merchandise planning. Burley was hired by fashionmall as the Global Fashion Director of the new boo. He reported directly to Ms. Buggeln.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4470630/Boo-back-in-business-this- time-on-a-budget.html In 2005 CNET called Boo.com the sixth greatest dot-com flop.  Current state of the domain  In May 2007 Web Reservations International (WRI) turned boo.com into a travel site with reviews and listings. When the new site launched, it already had more than one million user reviews which had been collected from existing WRI travel sites. In October 2010, the new boo.com site announced that it was closing down with effect from 1 November 2010. boo.com redirects to hostelworld.com.

Extremely thin, \\"given to jerky movements and sudden contortions\\", she was nicknamed La M√©linite, after an explosive. Biography She was born Jeanne Louise Beaudon on 9June 1868 in Belleville, located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris (though her biographer, Jose Shercliff‚Äîwhose account of the dancer's life is highly romanticised‚Äîemployed the surname ‚ÄúRichepin‚Äù in her publication). Her mother L√©ontine Clarisse Beaudon was a prostitute who was known as \\"La Belle √âlise\\", and her father was an Italian aristocrat named Luigi de Font who separated from her mother when she was two years old. Avril was raised by her grandparents in the countryside until her mother took her back with the intent of turning her into a prostitute. Living in poverty and abused by her alcoholic mother, she ran away from home as a teenager, and was eventually admitted to the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in December 1882, with the movement disorder known as \\"St Vitus' Dance\\", with symptoms that included nervous tics, thrashing of limbs, and rhythmic swaying. Under the care of Dr.Jean-Martin Charcot, the expert on \\"female hysteria\\", she received various kinds of treatment, and claimed in her biography that, when she discovered dance at a social ball for employees and patients at the hospital celebrating Mardi Gras, she was cured, although a modern biography of her argues that this story is unlikely, as she was discharged in June 1884, months before any Mardi Gras celebration would take place. Regardless, she incorporated some of the mannerisms into her dance style, but it is unclear if she was actually afflicted by the condition or if it was simply a marketing strategy, as nervous conditions such as hysteria were associated with elegance by writers of the time (or both), She was certainly known for her unusual style, which was described as \\"an orchid in a frenzy\\". The Belgian author Frantz Jourdain described her as \\"this exquisite creature, nervous and neurotic, the captivating flower of artistic corruption and of sickly grace\\". Jane Avril, poster, 1893, by Toulouse-Lautrec On leaving the hospital, after a failed romance with a doctor, Avril pondered committing suicide, but was taken in by Parisian prostitutes. Working at whatever day jobs were available, including as a secretary to Ars√®ne Houssaye, as a rider or acrobat at the and as a cashier at the Exposition Universelle in 1889, at night she pursued a career in dancing by performing at local dance halls and caf√©s-concerts. In 1888 she met the writer Ren√© Boylesve (18671926) who became her lover. Using the stage name Jane Avril, suggested by an English lover, she built a reputation that eventually allowed her to make a living as a full-time dancer. During this time she became known by various nicknames: La M√©linite after an explosive, L'Etrange (\\"The Strange One\\"), and Jane la Folle (\\"Jane the Crazy\\"). Hired by the Moulin Rouge nightclub in 1889, within a few years she headlined at the Jardin de Paris, one of the major caf√©s-concerts on the Champs-√âlys√©es. To advertise the extravaganza, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec painted her portrait on a poster that elevated her stature in the entertainment world even further. The popularity of the can-can became such that Avril travelled with a dance troupe to perform in London in 1896. In 1895, Louise Weber, known by her stage name La Goulue (\\"The Glutton\\") and the most famous dancer in Paris, left the Moulin Rouge, and Avril was chosen to replace her. Graceful, soft-spoken, and melancholic, Avril gave a dance presentation that was the opposite of the very boisterous La Goulue. Nevertheless, the club's patrons adored her, and she became one of the most recognizable names of the Parisian nightlife. A younger dancer, May Milton, arrived in Paris in 1895 and she and Avril had a short but passionate affair. From another liaison, she bore a son, and beginning in 1901, appeared in theatre, taking roles in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt, as well as a stage adaptation of Claudine at School by Colette. In 1905, she retired from performing altogether and married the French artist, Maurice Biais (18721926) in 1911, who adopted her son. They moved to a home in Jouy-en-Josas at the outskirts of Paris. However, Biais suffered from lung disease and the couple separated in the 1920s, with Biais moving to the south of France, where he died. She was bankrupted by the Great Depression and died on in poverty and obscurity. She was interred in the Biais family plot in Paris' P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Zsa Zsa Gabor portrayed Avril in the original Moulin Rouge (1952); half a century later, the semi-fictionalized character was reinterpreted by Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! (2001). Avril is one of the characters in Per Olov Enquist's book The Book of Blanche and Marie, which portrays the lives of Marie \\"Blanche\\" Wittman and Marie Curie.

Winchester was initially declared to have been won by Mark Oaten (Liberal Democrat) with a majority of two votes at the general election on 1 May 1997, but following a legal challenge, a new election was allowed by the High Court. The by election, held on 20 November, was won by Oaten with a majority of 21,556. History At the general election on 1 May 1997, Mark Oaten was originally declared the winner, with a majority of two votes over Conservative Gerry Malone, after many recounts and haggling over spoilt ballots. Oaten was unseated on an electoral petition on 6 October 1997. The High Court held that 54 votes declared void for want of the official mark would have changed the result if counted. The court could not be sure they were not the product of a mistake, therefore deemed that the result was uncertain. They allowed the petition and declared the election void. The writ for the new election was moved on 28 October 1997. The by election on 20 November resulted in a clear win by Oaten ‚Äì his majority was 21,556 over second placed Gerry Malone, the former Conservative MP who had lost his seat in the general election. Campaigning had focused on Oaten's speaking record in the House of Commons after the general election, while the nature of the controversial 1 May election result was also an issue for some Liberal Democrat voters. The Independent wrote, \\"Although careful not to articulate it themselves, their unofficial campaign slogan is: 'When the umpire gives you out, you should walk'\\", alluding to the unseated Malone. The Labour Party obtained their worst ever results in a parliamentary election, in part because they hardly campaigned at all and instead focused their priorities on the by-election in Beckenham held on the same day. Screaming Lord Sutch, candidate in the by election Both the original and rerun election involved an incidence of a candidate using an attempted confusing description. Richard Huggett described himself in the general election as Liberal Democrat Top Choice For Parliament (leading to Oaten, the official Lib Dem candidate, to use the ballot paper description Liberal Democrat Leader Paddy Ashdown) and in the by election as Literal Democrat Mark Here to Win. The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 put an end to this practice. This was also the last election (by-or-general) in which Screaming Lord Sutch, founder of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, ran for a parliamentary seat. He committed suicide in June 1999. Results =General election result= At the general election (held five months before the by election), the top two candidates' votes were very close.

Music career  = Early years = Originally from the East Coast, Hurley and his family moved to San Pedro when he was six years old. Hurley was a surfer before devoting himself to music. A self-taught musician, Hurley created his own drumsticks out of Plexiglas and wood at the Boys Club in his youth. He got his first drumkit when he was nineteen after trading a motorcycle for it. Although he is known as a punk drummer, Hurley's musical influences are primarily Jazz based. Even though he went to the same high school as D. Boon and Mike Watt he did not meet them until around 1978. That same year, Hurley formed The Reactionaries with Boon, Watt, and Martin Tamburovich. Watt asked Hurley to join repeatedly but Hurley was reticent because they traveled in different circles and Watt was deemed \\"a geek\\". Eventually, Hurley threw caution to the wind and joined up with Watt. After The Reactionaries split, George joined a Hollywood new wave band called Hey Taxi!. In 1980, Hey Taxi! disbanded at the same time the Minutemen's then drummer Frank Tonche left the band. Hurley reunited with his two former Reactionaries bandmates in Minutemen. = Minutemen = The Minutemen played their first gig with Los Angeles band Black Flag and after their set were asked by Black Flag guitarist and SST Records founder Greg Ginn to record an album for his label. The Paranoid Time EP was followed by full length albums The Punch Line and What Makes a Man Start Fires? and two more EPs Joy and Bean-Spill before recording their magnum opus Double Nickels on the Dime, an album which appears on many professional lists of the all-time best rock albums, including Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Slant Magazine listed the album at on its list of \\"Best Albums of the 1980s\\". In 1985, D.

He also plays with his surviving Minutemen cohort Mike Watt on occasion, usually performing a set of Minutemen songs without a third person substituting for the late Minutemen leader D. Boon under the name George Hurley and Mike Watt. In addition, he occasionally performs with improvisational group Unknown Instructors with Watt and members of Saccharine Trust and Pere Ubu. Their first album, The Way Things Work, was released in late September 2005 by Smog Veil Records. In October 2005, they returned to the studio to record their second album, this time with Pere Ubu's David Thomas as an added participant. Hurley has formed a drum/bass duo with Constant Llama member Joe Dean called The Wrinkling Brothers. Personal life Hurley has been married since 1997 and has a son Garrett who was born in July 2002. = Hairstyle = Hurley is known for his distinctive hairstyle that he sported in his later Minutemen and Firehose days, a protruding clump of hair that he nicknamed \\"The Unit\\". Hurley explained in the 2005 Minutemen documentary We Jam Econo that since his limbs were all busy when he played drums, he grew \\"The Unit\\" so that his head movements were more noticeable on stage.

It is dependent on the type of thickener used and the cohesiveness of the oil and thickener of a grease.Totten, G.E., Handbook of Lubrication and Tribology Volume 1: Application and Maintenance, CRC Press, 2006, The dropping point indicates the upper temperature limit at which a grease retains its structure though is not necessarily the maximum temperature at which a grease can be used. Dropping point is used in combination with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications and for use in quality control.  ASTM test procedure  The dropping point test procedures are given in ASTM standards D-566ASTM D566 - 02 Standard Test Method for Dropping Point of Lubricating Grease, ASTM and D-2265.ASTM D2265 - 06 Standard Test Method for Dropping Point of Lubricating Grease Over Wide Temperature Range, ASTM The test apparatus consists of a grease cup with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the grease cup are coated with the grease to be tested. A thermometer is inserted into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another thermometer is inserted into the oil/block. To execute a test, the oil/block is heated, while being stirred, at a rate of to per minute until the temperature is approximately below the expected dropping point. The heat is reduced until the test tube temperature is at most less than the oil/block temperature. Once the temperature has stabilized the sample is inserted. The dropping point is the temperature recorded on the test tube thermometer, plus a correction factor for the oil/block temperature, when a drop of grease falls through the hole in the grease cup. If the drop trails a thread, the dropping temperature is the temperature at which the thread breaks. D-2265 explains that the dropping point is useful to assist in identifying the type of grease, and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for quality control. It adds that the results are not sufficient to assess service performance because dropping point is a static test.

The eighth expedition to the orbital station, the mission launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a Soyuz-U2 carrier rocket, at 06:39:52 UTC on 1985-06-06. It is of note because it marked the first time a spacecraft had docked with a 'dead' space station, and the first time such a station had been returned to operational status following repairs. Crew =Backup crew= Mission highlights Soyuz T-13 was the 8th expedition to Salyut 7. Vladimir Dzhanibekov, having previously flown to Salyut 7 on the Soyuz T-12 mission, returned on the next flight which was to become the first to dock manually with an inert space station, as the station had been crippled by a solar array problem. For this purpose modifications were made to the Soyuz spacecraft to include control levers for proximity operations. Viktor Savinykh's and Vladimir Dzhanibekov's mission was successful and they were able to salvage the Salyut 7 station. Savinykh remained aloft for 169 days, returning to Earth in Soyuz T-14; Dzhanibekov returned to Earth in Soyuz T-13 with Grechko after spending 110 days on Salyut 7. Before deorbiting, Soyuz T-13 spent about 30 hours conducting rendezvous and docking tests. =Salvaging Salyut 7= The effort to salvage Salyut 7 was, in the words of author David S. F. Portree, \\"one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history\\". As the crew approached the inert station, they saw that its solar arrays were pointing randomly as it rolled slowly about its long axis. They used a handheld laser rangefinder to judge their distance, and conducted a fly-around inspection to be certain the exterior was intact. Dzhanibekov noted that the thermal blankets on the transfer compartment had turned a dull gray from prolonged exposure to sunlight. Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7, matched the station's rotation and achieved soft dock with the station. Upon achieving hard dock‚Äîthe first time a Soyuz had docked with an inert space stationPortree, p. 99.‚Äîthe crew confirmed through the electrical connectors in the docking collars that the Salyut 7 electrical system was dead. They carefully sampled the air in the station before opening the hatch. The station air was very cold, but breathable. Frost covered the walls and apparatus. The cosmonauts wore winter garb, including fur-lined hats, as they entered the station. The first order of business was to restore electric power. Two of the eight batteries were destroyed, the rest fully discharged. Dzhanibekov determined that a sensor in the solar array pointing system had failed, preventing the batteries from recharging. A telemetry radio problem prevented the TsUP (mission control center) from detecting the problem. Salyut 7 had quickly run down its batteries, shutting down all its systems and accounting for the break in radio contact.Spacefacts, Soyuz T-13 page. The cosmonauts set about recharging the batteries and used Soyuz T-13 to turn the station in order to point its solar arrays to the sun. On June 10 they turned on the air heaters. The cosmonauts relied on the Soyuz T-13 air regeneration system until they could get the Salyut 7 system back in order. On June 13 the attitude control system was successfully reactivated. This was cause for jubilation, as it meant Kosmos 1669 (a Progress supply spacecraft) bearing replacement parts could dock with Salyut 7. The station's water tanks thawed by the end of June ‚Äì freezing had destroyed the water heater, so the cosmonauts used a powerful television light to heat fluids. Wall heaters were turned on only after all the frost had evaporated, in order to prevent water from entering equipment. Normal atmospheric humidity was achieved only at the end of July, nearly two months after docking.

It varies the timing of the valves by using hydraulic oil pressure to rotate the camshaft, known as \\"phasing\\", in order to provide optimal valve timing for engine load conditions. The system is closed loop using the camshaft sensors, crankshaft sensors, air flow meter, throttle position as well as oxygen sensors and/or Air-Fuel ratio sensors in order to calculate engine load. The ECU is programmed to operate control valves that adjust the delivery of the hydraulic pressure in order to move the camshaft into the position that will provide the engine with the best performance while meeting emissions standards. AVCS is used on the Version 7 and up EJ207 engines, the EJ204, , EJ254, EJ255 and EJ257, the second generation EZ30D (2005+ in the USA Market) found in the Legacy Outback, Legacy 2.0R and 3.0R and the B9 Tribeca. A Dual AVCS system phases both the intake and exhaust camshafts on the EZ36 found in the 2008+ Tribeca, 2009+ Outback 3.6R, 2009+ Legacy 3.6R, and on the 2008+ STi EJ257 (W25 heads). Dual AVCS is present on the new FA20 engines in the 2015+ WRX, Forester and BRZ and the FB20 engines in the 2012+ Impreza / Crosstrek, though they actuate with a different method than those of the older engines. Dual AVCS is also found on Japanese Spec engines, notably the late model EJ207s in the WRX STI. AVCS The implementation of AVCS is quite different from AVLS. The latter just changes which cam is operating one of the two valves. In AVCS, the engine computer (ECU) can command a solenoid which advances or retards the camshaft rotation by up to 35 degrees. By retarding the cams at idle or very low engine loads, you achieve a smoother, easier idle. From idle through medium engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves to begin opening during the last part of the exhaust stroke, when the exhaust valves are still slightly open. Some of the pressure created during the exhaust stroke flows into the intake manifold, having the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The intake valves also close earlier during the intake stroke. This helps with engine efficiency and fuel economy. At very high engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves further to open even sooner during the exhaust stroke. This produces a scavenging effect ‚Äì that is, intake airflow helps clear the cylinder of exhaust gas. It also closes the intake valves sooner on the compression stroke. This results in improved volumetric efficiency, increased dynamic compression, and helps to generate higher power output.

The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA). Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States. First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running and/or when the ball is dead. Second, in International Basketball Federation (FIBA) play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs. In most American competitions, ejection of the offender, that of the player, coach, or otherwise, is the penalty for being assessed two technical fouls in a game, if charged directly to him/her (some technicals committed by a player are charged to the team only). In addition, any single flagrant technical foul, or a disqualifying foul in FIBA, incurs ejection. FIBA rules do not provide for ejection for any number of non-flagrant technicals (known as unsportsmanlike fouls under that body's rules) against a player, except in 3x3, in which two unsportsmanlike fouls result in ejection. FIBA rules call for ejection when a coach draws two technicals, or a third is called on the bench. Infractions Many infractions can result in the calling of a technical foul. One of the most common is the use of profane language toward an official or another player. This can be called on either players who are currently active in the play of the game, or seated on a team's bench. It can also be assessed to a coach or another person associated with the team in an official capacity such as a trainer or an equipment manager. Additionally, coaches or players can be assessed a technical foul for disputing an official's call too vehemently, with or without the use of profanity. This verbal unsporting technical foul may be assessed regardless of whether the ball is dead or alive. Other offenses can result in technical fouls, such as: *Allowing players to lock arms in order to restrict the movement of an opponent (usually a team technical) *Baiting or taunting an opponent *Disrespectfully addressing or contacting an official or gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment *Faking being fouled (flopping) *Fighting or threatening to fight *Goaltending a free throw *Grasping either basket during pre-game or halftime warm-ups during the time of the officials' jurisdiction, including attempting to dunk or stuff a dead ball (whether successful or not) prior to or during the game or during any intermission of the game. Beginning in 2015‚Äì16, dunking is permitted during warmup periods in NCAA play, although hanging on the rim remains illegal. *Illegal substitution or entering the game at an impermissible time *Intentionally hanging on the basket at any time (except to prevent an injury) *Kicking or striking the basketball at any time using the foot (in an unsportsmanlike manner; unintentional kicking is a violation only) *Knowingly attempting a free throw or accepting a foul to which the player was not entitled *Lifting or jumping onto a teammate to gain a height advantage *Remaining out of bounds to gain an advantage *Removing the jersey or pants within the visual confines of the playing area * Shattering the backboard or rim of a goal. *Use of television monitoring or replay equipment, computers, or electronics such as megaphones for coaching purposes during the game *Using tobacco or smokeless tobacco Violations of the rules for delaying the game (in the NBA, NCAA, and NFHS) usually incur a team warning for a first offense, followed by a team technical, or sometimes a player technical, if the same team delays a second time, to include: *Going out of bounds during an opponent's throw-in without contact (warning, then a technical foul), or touching an opposing thrower-in (intentional foul on the violator in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) or the ball (a technical on the offender in NFHS, and is the warning for being out-of-bounds) as it is held entirely in out-of-bounds *Huddling at the foul line for an excessive time (warning, then a technical in NFHS) *Not being ready to start play after a time-out, or to begin a quarter or half, or to shoot a free throw(s) at such times (a special protocol, known as the \\"resumption-of-play procedure\\", is used in NFHS, where violations instead of technicals are initially called in some such situations) *Refusing to immediately pass the ball to the nearer official when a whistle blows *Failing as the free thrower to be in the free-throw semicircle when the official is ready to administer the free throw (unless the resumption-of-play procedure is in effect in NFHS, supra) *Throwing the ball into the stands or otherwise preventing a ball from being made live promptly after a made goal to allow one's team to set up on defense (if a blatantly unsportsmanlike act, a technical foul against the player; otherwise, a warning to that team and team technicals thereafter). This includes throwing the ball to an official when such act is not required‚Äîsuch would likely incur a warning. In addition, throwing the ball at an opponent's head may also be considered a technical foul. and more technical issues, such as: *Beginning the game with a starting player not so designated *Failure to supply the scorer with names and numbers of team players prior to the start of the scheduled contest, or at least 10 minutes prior to the contest in some jurisdictions *Having too many players on the court, or too few (NBA; NCAA and NFHS if intentional) *If the coach leaves his box, especially to argue. There are times when a coach may go to the scorer's table to correct a game error. *Failing, as the coach, to replace a disqualified player within the allotted time (charged to the coach) *(NBA only) playing a \\"scratched\\" player (a rule adopted in 2005 where up to two \\"scratches\\" are permissible on a 14-man roster) *Refusing to occupy the proper bench *Remaining in or returning to the game after being disqualified ** In the NBA, there must be five players on the court at all times. A Player Foul Penalty situation exists if a player is assessed a sixth or subsequent personal foul and must remain in the game because there are no eligible players on the bench, or if after an injury or ejection, the last player to be disqualified for his sixth personal foul must return to the game. The penalty is a technical foul (with one free throw) for each extra personal foul or returning to the game after disqualification. *Requesting an excess time-out *Uniform violations, including illegal insignia or numbers; having 2 or more players with the same number; or having the wrong number for a player in the official scorebook The NBA has an Illegal Defense rule. Until 2001, it was designed to stop defenders from dropping back into a zone and thus preventing drives to the basket. The penalty, after a warning, was a technical foul charged to the offending team and one shot for the offense, except that if the first violation occurred within 24 seconds of the end of a period, the technical was assessed without warning. Beginning with the , the rule, now known as \\"Defensive Three Seconds,\\" prohibits a defender from being in the shooting lane for three seconds, unless guarding an opponent within arm's reach (or the player with the ball, regardless of distance). The penalty is the same as it was for an illegal defense, except that no warning is issued. The WNBA implemented this rule in 2013. Additionally, home teams can be assessed technical fouls resulting from their partisans' misconduct for excessive use of artificial noise, the playing of music by their band, or for dangerous offenses such as throwing items (particularly ice or coins) onto the court. Usually a fight or lesser altercation between players results in a \\"double technical\\", in which a technical foul is issued to both players involved. If any player leaves the team bench during a fight, he can be charged with a technical foul and ejected, as can any coach that does so without the beckoning of an official. Rules against fighting vary from high school to college to the (W)NBA, but all levels penalize severely for such conduct, to include suspensions and (in the [W]NBA) heavy fines. NFHS and NCAA require the automatic ejection of bench personnel leaving the team area during a fight, whether or not these players actually participate in the fight. Beginning with the , the NBA began to crack down on general complaining. Technical fouls can now be issued for the following: *Making aggressive gestures anywhere on the court *Disagreement in which a player demonstrates how he was fouled *Running toward an official to complain about a call *Excessive inquiries about a call Penalty When shooting a free throw for a technical foul, only the free throw shooter, in this case Andrei Ivanov, is allowed within the area below the free throw line extended. In college basketball, NFHS, and lower divisions, the penalty for technical fouls has increased over the years. Initially, the opposing team was awarded one free throw. This later increased to one free throw and possession of the ball. For a while, \\"bench technicals\\" assessed on a non-active player, assistant coach, or anyone else on the team bench were considered more serious and resulted in the award of two shots. (Coaches have their own technical fouls, although they may be ejected and/or suspended if they have a mix of technicals totaling two or three fouls, depending on seriousness.) Today, high school basketball (NFHS in the United States) provides for two free throws and possession of the ball at the division line opposite the scorer's table, regardless of circumstances, for a technical foul. International basketball provides a similar penalty. Before the 2015‚Äì16 season, college basketball awarded two shots for all technical fouls, with the ball then put in play at the point of interruption (POI), the spot and circumstances where play was stopped for the technical. Since 2015‚Äì16, the NCAA awards only one free throw for so-called \\"Class B\\" technicals, such as hanging on the rim or delay of game; \\"Class A\\" technical fouls still result in two free throws. In the (W)NBA, the penalty remains one free throw for the opposing team, with play resuming from the point of interruption. The shot clock is reset to 14 seconds if it read less than such at the time of the foul. The team awarded the foul shots for a technical may select the player(s) to shoot them (this rule differs slightly from level to level and internationally), as opposed to personal fouls, where the player fouled, unless injured, must shoot his own foul shots. In the (W)NBA, technical fouls are split into two classes, unsportsmanlike and non- unsportsmanlike. A player assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul is fined, and accumulating sixteen unsportsmanlike technical fouls during the regular season will result in a one-game suspension. For every two technical fouls received thereafter during that regular season, the player or coach's suspension increases by one game. Penalties for unsportsmanlike technical fouls are even higher for playoff games. Players and coaches will be fined for every unsportsmanlike technical foul they receive. Those who accumulate seven unsportsmanlike technical fouls will be suspended for one game. For every two unsportsmanlike technical fouls received thereafter, the player or coach's next suspension increases by one game. Non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical fouls are defined per NBA Rule 12, Section V, Paragraph c, and none count towards a fine, ejection or suspension. These fouls are assessed for excessive time-outs, defensive three seconds, scratched player dressing and playing, a player foul penalty situation, shattering backboards, or delay of game. An offensive player who intentionally hangs on the backboard, unless it is legal for safety reasons, is fined $500 but is only assessed a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Technical fouls assessed for a player foul penalty situation caused by an offensive foul still results in one free throw. The league can reclassify an unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul as a non- unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul after a game following review. For example, the NBA changed the technical foul by DeMarcus Cousins for clearing Jeremy Lamb‚Äôs loose shoe off the playing court in a Golden State Warriors v. Charlotte Hornets game on February 25, 2019, from unsportsmanlike to non- unsportsmanlike, rescinding the fine and the foul count, primarily over safety issues. Notable instances One of the most famous technical fouls ever assessed was called on Chris Webber of the University of Michigan late in the 1993 NCAA championship game. Down by two points to North Carolina with only seconds remaining, Webber called a time-out when Michigan had none left. The resulting excessive time-out technical foul, for which North Carolina guard Donald Williams made both foul shots, ended any hopes Michigan had of claiming the championship. In what has been called the greatest game ever played, Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics, the Suns found themselves one point down with one second left in double overtime, no time-outs remaining and possession of the ball under their defensive basket after a John Havlicek bucket. Faced with the near-impossibility of sinking an 80-foot desperation shot, Suns guard Paul Westphal hit upon an unusual solution. He intentionally called a time-out the Suns did not have. While this gave the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White successfully converted to increase the lead to two, it gave the Suns possession at halfcourt, and enabled Gar Heard to sink an 18-footer as time expired to force a third overtime. NBA rules were changed the following year to prevent a repeat occurrence. An instance where many technical fouls could have been called, but were not (instead, the game was abandoned, a remedy available to the officials when too many players would have or have been disqualified or ejected for the game to continue, or when a team continually commits technical fouls in order to make a travesty of proceedings), was the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl involving players and spectators on November 19, 2004, in an NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. Ron Artest of the Pacers and Ben Wallace of the Pistons began scuffling after Artest fouled Wallace hard. This escalated into a brawl where players from both teams became involved, and grew worse after Artest retreated to the scorer's table and was hit by a cup thrown by a spectator. Artest and several teammates and opponents then ran into the stands and fought with fans. Had technical fouls been formally assessed, the result would likely have been the ejection of both teams' entire squads (except for Pistons player Tayshaun Prince, who was the only player from either team to remain on the bench for the entire incident). In the end, nine players were suspended for a total of 146 games, including Artest for the remainder of the season. In a 2007 game against the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs' power forward Tim Duncan was charged a technical foul by referee Joe Crawford for laughing at him while sitting on the bench (\\"gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment,\\" as indicated above). As he had already picked up a technical foul on the previous play, also while sitting on the bench, this led to his ejection. Upon further review it was determined that this technical foul was inconsistent with the league's game management, and NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Crawford for the rest of the season. Duncan was fined $25,000 for the incident. The most technical fouls ever charged to a team in a single professional game is 6 (all in the second half), to Aris Thessaloniki in a game against Olympiacos of the Greek A1 League on February 10, 2008. Rasheed Wallace holds the record for the most technical fouls received during one season in the NBA. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, he received 41 technical fouls in 80 regular season and postseason games played. Wallace also holds the all-time mark for most technical fouls by a player in a career with 317, a record previously held by Dennis Rodman. There have been a few instances in the NBA when a team's entire bench has either been injured or fouled out, and one of the five remaining eligible players fouls out, resulting in the technical foul that effectively acts as a bonus free throw situation. The Atlanta Hawks' Cliff Levingston (fouled out, but one of the five remaining players was ejected) and the Los Angeles Lakers' Robert Sacre (fouled out) have both taken advantage of the disqualified player rule. Under NBA Rule 3-I-a (player fouls out) and 3-I-b (player injured or ejected), the player was assessed with a technical foul for remaining in the game or returning to the game after fouling out.

The vivacious young girl was unhappy under the strict discipline of the nuns, and at the first opportunity she ran away with a touring theatrical group. At a young age, she made her way to Paris, France, where her appearance opened doors and she obtained work as a singer at one of the city's caf√©-concerts. From there she performed at a variety of music halls and other such venues around Europe, while still working to develop her voice. She took voice lessons and made her opera debut in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1900 (as Nedda in Pagliacci). The Russian Prince Alexander Bariatinsky was deeply in love with Lina, and they had an open affair, but never became husband and wife as his parents and Tsar Nicholas II himself strongly opposed this marriage.–ú. –°. –ë–∞—Ä—è—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è. –ú–æ—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å. –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–∞–º—ã. 1870‚Äì1918. ‚Äî –ú. : –ó–ê–û –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–ø–æ–ª–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ, 2006. ‚Äî 367 —Å.:ru:–ë–∞—Ä—è—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á (1870 In 1904, she sang at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo then in 1905, at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris, Cavalieri starred opposite Enrico Caruso in the Umberto Giordano opera Fedora. From there, she and Caruso took the opera to New York City, debuting with it at the Metropolitan Opera on 5 December 1906. Lina Cavalieri, as painted by Giovanni Boldini Cavalieri remained with the Metropolitan Opera for the next two seasons, performing again with Caruso in 1907, in Puccini's Manon Lescaut. She became one of the most photographed stars of her time. Frequently referred to as the \\"world's most beautiful woman\\", she was part of the tightlacing tradition that saw women use corsetry to create an \\"hour-glass\\" figure. During the 1909‚Äì10 season she sang with Oscar Hammerstein's Manhattan Opera Company. Her first marriage long over, she had a whirlwind romance with Robert Winthrop Chanler (1872‚Äì1930), a member of the Astor family and Dudley‚ÄìWinthrop family. They married on 18 June 1910 but separated by the end of their honeymoon, and their divorce became final in June 1912. After the divorce, Cavalieri returned to Europe where she became a much-loved star in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg, Russia. Other operas in her repertoire included La boh√®me, La traviata, Faust, Manon, Andrea Ch√©nier, Tha√Øs, Les contes d'Hoffmann (as the courtesan Giulietta), Rigoletto, Mefistofele (as both Margarita and Elena), Adriana Lecouvreur, Tosca, H√©rodiade (as Salom√©), Carmen (the title role), Siberia, and Zaz√†. During her career, Cavalieri sang with other prominent singers, including Giuseppe Anselmi, Mary Garden (the world premiere of Massenet's Ch√©rubin, 1905), Mattia Battistini, Titta Ruffo, Feodor Chaliapin, Nikolay Figner, Antonio Scotti, Vanni Marcoux, Giovanni Zenatello, Tito Schipa, and the French tenor Lucien Muratore, whom she married in 1913 after his divorce from soprano Marguerite B√©riza. After retiring from the stage, Cavalieri ran a cosmetic salon in Paris. In 1914, on the eve of her fortieth birthday ‚Äì her beauty still spectacular ‚Äì she wrote an advice column on make-up for women in Femina magazine and published a book, My Secrets of Beauty. In her Parisian Institut de Beaut√©, she licensed Parfums Isabey Paris and not only sold Isabey perfumes, but developed in 1926 a range of beauty products. The same year, she launched her own perfume, called \\"Mona Lina\\", apparently inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. In 1915, she returned to her native Italy to make motion pictures. When that country became involved in World War I, she went to the United States where she made four more silent films. The last three of her films were the product of her friend, the Belgian film director Edward Jos√©. Almost all of her films are considered lost films. After marrying her fourth husband Paolo d‚ÄôArvanni, she returned to live with her husband in Italy. Well into her sixties when World War II began, she nevertheless worked as a volunteer nurse. Cavalieri was killed on 7 February 1944 during an Allied bombing raid that destroyed her home in Florence near Poggio Imperiale, where she was placed under police surveillance because of her foreign husband. Hearing an American bomber nearby, Cavalieri, her husband, and servants ran to the air-raid shelter in the grounds, but Cavalieri and her husband were delayed because they were collecting her valuable jewellery from the house. Both Cavalieri and her husband were killed running to the air-raid shelter, while the servants inside the shelter all survived. Lina Cavalieri's discography is slim. In 1910, for Columbia, she recorded arias from La boh√®me, Tosca, Manon Lescaut, Carmen, Mefistofele, and Faust, as well as the song, \\"Maria, Mar√¨! (Ah! Mar√¨! Ah! Mar√¨!).\\" In 1917, for Path√©, the soprano recorded \\"Le r√™ve pass√©,\\" with Muratore. For American Path√©, she recorded arias from Carmen and H√©rodiade. Her portrait was painted by the Italian artist Giovanni Boldini (acquired by Maurice Rothschild) and by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury. The latter painting is now the property of the Metropolitan Opera, the gift of Nicholas Meredith Turner in memory of his wife, the soprano Jessica Dragonette. Hers is the face that appears repeatedly, obsessively, in Piero Fornasetti's designs. In 1955, Gina Lollobrigida portrayed Cavalieri in the film Beautiful But Dangerous (also known as The World's Most Beautiful Woman). In 2004, a book was published, written by Paul Fryer and Olga Usova, titled Lina Cavalieri: The Life of Opera‚Äôs Greatest Beauty, 1874‚Äì1944. In the silent drama A Woman of Impulse, Lina Cavalieri receives Raymond Bloomer, on one knee, and Robert Cain, in evening dress.

To be awarded the Pathfinder Badge, the soldier must complete Pathfinder instruction in advanced land navigation, advanced scouting, tactical air traffic control in the field, and the control of parachute operations; the badge is awarded on completing several examinations under field training exercise (FTX) conditions. Examinations include proficiency in sling load rigging and execution, planning and execution of helicopter landing zones (HLZ), air traffic control operations, aerial delivery of troops and supplies, and several others. The first Pathfinder Badge was designed by Lt. Prescott, a navigator in the 9th Troop Carrier Pathfinder Group (Provisional), in May 1944. Besides the paratroopers who earned it, the Pathfinder Badge was worn by IX Troop Carrier Command air crews who guided paratrooper transports and towed gliders. It was worn four inches above the left sleeve cuff on the service coat. The current Pathfinder Badge, originally made of felt, was approved on 22 May 1964. The badge began being made of enameled metal on 11 October 1968. The badge's wings symbolize flight and airborne capabilities, while the torch represents leadership and guidance. The torch traces back to the Olympians who carried the torch each year of the event to its location.

The explosions, which occurred on July 30, 1916, in the New York Harbor, killed four people and destroyed some $20,000,000 worth of military goods.Long, John. 2016. \\"Terrorism's 100th Anniversary\\". Roanoke Times. July 28, 2016. p. 7. This incident, which happened prior to U.S. entry into World War I, also damaged the Statue of Liberty. It was one of the largest artificial non- nuclear explosions to have ever occurred.  Black Tom Island  Black Tom Island, lying off Jersey City, 1880 The term \\"Black Tom\\" originally referred to an island in New York Harbor next to Liberty Island. The island was artificial, created by land fill around a rock of the same name, which had been a local hazard to navigation. Being largely built up from city refuse, it developed a reputation as an unseemly environmental hazard. On January 26, 1875, an accidental explosion killed four. By 1880, the island was transformed into a promontory,Roberts, Russell. Rediscover the Hidden New Jersey. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2015. and a causeway and railroad had been built to connect it with the mainland to use as a shipping depot. Between 1905 and 1916, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which owned the island and causeway, expanded the island with land fill, and the entire area was annexed by Jersey City. A mile-long pier on the island housed a depot and warehouses for the National Dock and Storage Company. Black Tom Island is now part of Liberty State Park. Black Tom was a major munitions depot for the Northeastern United States. Until early 1915, U.S. munitions companies could sell to any buyer. After the blockade of Germany by the Royal Navy, however, only the Allied powers could purchase from them. As a result, Imperial Germany sent secret agents to the United States to obstruct the production and delivery of war munitions that were intended to be used by its enemies.H. R. Balkhage and A. A. Hahling. The Black Tom Explosion, The American Legion Magazine, August 1964.  Explosion  View of the Lehigh Valley pier after explosion Wrecked warehouses and scattered debris after explosion On the night of the Black Tom explosion, July 30, 1916, about of small arms and artillery ammunition were stored at the depot in freight cars and on barges, including of TNT on Johnson Barge No. 17.Safety Engineering Vol 32 [1916] Calls this Johnson Barge No. 24 All were waiting to be shipped to Russia.Rielage, Dale C.: Russian Supply Efforts in America During the First World War; McFarland, 2002. (p. 71) Jersey City's Commissioner of Public Safety, Frank Hague, later said he had been told the barge was \\"tied up at Black Tom to avoid a twenty- five dollar charge.\\" After midnight, a series of small fires were discovered on the pier. Some guards fled, fearing an explosion. Others attempted to fight the fires and eventually called the Jersey City Fire Department. At 2:08 am, the first and largest of the explosions took place, the second and smaller explosion occurring around 2:40 am. A notable location for one of the first major explosions was around the Johnson Barge No. 17, which contained 50 tons of TNT and 417 cases of detonating fuses. The explosion created a detonation wave that traveled at with enough force to lift firefighters out of their boots and into the air. Fragments from the explosion traveled long distances: some lodged in the Statue of Liberty, and other fragments lodged in the clock tower of The Jersey Journal building in Journal Square more than away, stopping the clock at 2:12 am. The explosion was the equivalent of an earthquake measuring between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as Philadelphia. Windows were broken as far as away, including thousands in Lower Manhattan. Some window panes in Times Square were shattered. The stained glass windows in St. Patrick's Church were destroyed. The outer wall of Jersey City's City Hall was cracked and the Brooklyn Bridge was shaken. People as far away as Maryland were awakened by what they thought was an earthquake. Property damage from the attack was estimated at . On the island, the explosion destroyed more than one hundred railroad cars, thirteen warehouses, and left a crater at the source of the explosion. The damage to the Statue of Liberty was estimated to be , and included damage to the skirt and torch. Immigrants being processed at Ellis Island had to be evacuated to Lower Manhattan. Although one contemporary newspaper report estimated that up to seven people died in the attack, four did definitely die: a Jersey City policeman, a Lehigh Valley Railroad chief of police, a ten-week-old infant, and the barge captain.  Investigation  In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, two watchmen who had lit smudge pots to keep away mosquitoes were questioned by police but the police soon determined that the smudge pots had not caused the fire and that the blast had likely been an accident. Soon after the explosion, suspicion fell upon Michael Kristoff, a Slovak immigrant.Carmela Karnoutsos. Black Tom Explosion , New Jersey State University Kristoff would later serve in the United States Army in World War I, but admitted to working for German agents (transporting suitcases) in 1915 and 1916 while the US was still neutral. According to Kristoff, two of the guards at Black Tom were German agents. It is likely that the bombing involved some of the techniques developed by German agents working for German ambassador Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and German Naval Intelligence officer Franz von Rintelen, using the cigar bombs developed by Dr. Walter Scheele. Captain Franz Von Rintelen used many resources at his disposal, including a large amount of money. Captain Franz von Rintelen used these resources to make generous cash bribes, one of which was notably given to Michael Kristoff in exchange for access to the pier. Suspicion at the time fell solely on German saboteurs such as Kurt Jahnke and his assistant Lothar Witzke, who are still judged as legally responsible.Witcover, Jules. Sabotage at Black Tom: Imperial Germany's Secret War in America, 1914‚Äì1917. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1989.World War I Encyclopedia. Volume 4 S‚ÄìZ. Edited by Spencer Tucker, p. 1033. It is also believed that Michael Kristoff was responsible for planting and initiating the incendiary devices that led to the explosions. Later investigations in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair unearthed links between the Ghadar conspiracy and the Black Tom explosion. Additional investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence also found links to some members of the Irish Clan na Gael group, the Indian Ghadar Party and Communist elements. The Irish socialist James Larkin asserted that he had not participated in active sabotage but had encouraged work slowing and strikes for higher wages and better conditions, in an affidavit to McCloy in 1934.Millman, C. The Detonators: The Secret Plot to Destroy America and an Epic Hunt for Justice (New York: Little, Brown, 2006) .Review of Millman's book in The New York Observer, July 16, 2006. The United States did not have an established national intelligence service, other than diplomats and few military and naval attaches, making the investigation difficult. Without a formal intelligence service on the national level, the United States only had rudimentary communications security and no federal statute forbidding peacetime espionage or sabotage, making the connections to the saboteurs and accomplices almost impossible to track.  Aftermath  This attack was one of many during the German sabotage campaign against the United States, and it is notable for its contribution to the shift of public opinion against Germany, which eventually resulted in American support to enter World War I. The Russian government sued the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company operating the Black Tom Terminal on grounds that lax security (there was no entrance gate; the territory was unlit)Landau, Henry, Capt. The Enemy Within: The Inside Story of German Sabotage in America. New York: Putnam, 1937, pp. 78‚Äì80. permitted the loss of their ammunition and argued that due to the failure to deliver them the manufacturer was obliged by the contract to replace them. The Lehigh Valley Railroad, advised by John J. McCloy, sought damages against Germany under the Treaty of Berlin from the German-American Mixed Claims Commission. The Mixed Claims Commission declared in 1939 that Imperial Germany had been responsible and awarded $50 million (the largest claim) in damages which Nazi Germany refused to pay.Sabotage in New York Harbor, Smithsonian.com The issue was finally settled in 1953 on $95 million (interest included) with the Federal Republic of Germany.Michael Warner.

Access was not opened after the 1984‚Äì1986 restoration which included repairs to the arm and installation of a new gold-plated copper torch.Nina Ruggiero. Why can't we go up the Statue of Liberty's torch? amNewYork, October 28, 2016.  Legacy  The Black Tom explosion resulted in the establishment of domestic intelligence agencies for the United States. The then Police Commissioner of New York, Arthur Woods, argued, \\"The lessons to America are clear as day. We must not again be caught napping with no adequate national intelligence organization. The several federal bureaus should be welded into one and that one should be eternally and comprehensively vigilant.\\" The explosion also played a role in how future presidents responded to military conflict. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the Black Tom explosion as part of his rationale for the internment of Japanese-Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1942. The incident also influenced public safety legislation. As a result of the sabotage techniques used by Germany, and the United States' declaration of war on Germany, led to the creation of the Espionage Act passed by congress in late 1917. Landfill projects later made Black Tom Island part of the mainland, and it was incorporated into Liberty State Park. The former Black Tom Island is at the end of Morris Pesin Drive in the southeastern corner of the park, where a plaque marks the spot of the explosion. A circle of U.S. flags complements the plaque, which stands east of the visitors' center. The inscription on the plaque reads: > Explosion at Liberty! On July 30, 1916 the Black Tom munitions depot > exploded rocking New York Harbor and sending residents tumbling from their > beds.

B. (1971). Abilities: Their structure, growth, and action. New York: Houghton Mifflin. . According to Cattell's psychometrically-based theory, general intelligence (g) is subdivided into gf and gc. Fluid intelligence is the ability to solve novel reasoning problems and is correlated with a number of important skills such as comprehension, problem solving, and learning. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, involves the ability to deduce secondary relational abstractions by applying previously learned primary relational abstractions.Cattell, R. B. Intelligence: Its Structure, Growth and Action. Elsevier, 1987. History Fluid and crystallized intelligence are constructs originally conceptualized by Raymond Cattell. The concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence were further developed by Cattell and his former student John L. Horn.Horn, J. L., & Cattell, R. B. (1967). Age differences in fluid and crystallized intelligence. Acta Psychologica, 26, 107‚Äì129. https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-6918(67)90011-XHorn, J. L. (1968). Organization of abilities and the development of intelligence. Psychological Review, 75, 242-259. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0025662Cattell, R. B. (1971). Abilities: Their structure, growth, and action. New York: Houghton Mifflin. .  Fluid versus crystallized intelligence  Fluid intelligence (gf) refers to basic processes of reasoning and other mental activities that depend only minimally on prior learning (such as formal and informal education) and acculturation. Horn notes that it is formless, and can \\"flow into\\" a wide variety of cognitive activities Crystallized intelligence (gc) refers to learned procedures and knowledge. It reflects the effects of experience and acculturation. Horn notes that crystallized ability is a \\"precipitate out of experience,\\" resulting from the prior application of fluid ability that has been combined with the intelligence of culture.\\" = An example of the application of fluid and crystallized abilities to problem-solving = Horn Fluid ability and Piaget's operative intelligence both concern logical thinking and the \\"eduction of relations\\" (an expression Cattell used to refer to the inferring of relationships). Crystallized ability and Piaget's treatment of everyday learning reflect the impress of experience. Like fluid ability's relation to crystallized intelligence, Piaget's operativity is considered to be prior to, and ultimately provides the foundation for, everyday learning. Measurement of fluid intelligence Various measures have been used to assess fluid intelligence. = Raven's Progressive Matrices = The Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is one of the most commonly used measures of fluid ability. It is a non-verbal multiple choice test. Participants have to complete a series of drawings by identifying relevant features based on the spatial organization of an array of objects, and choosing one object that matches one or more of the identified features. This task assesses the ability to consider one or more relationships between mental representations or relational reasoning. Propositional analogies and semantic decision tasks are also used to assess relational reasoning. = Woodcock- Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Third Edition = In the Woodcock- Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, Third Edition, (WJ-III) gf was assessed by two tests: Concept Formation and Analysis Synthesis. On Concept Formation tasks, the individual had to use categorical thinking while Analysis Synthesis tasks required general sequential reasoning.  WJ-III Concept Formation  Individuals had to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \\"rules\\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. As the level of difficulty increased, individuals had to identify a key difference (or the \\"rule\\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons. For more difficult items, individuals needed to understand the concept of \\"and\\" (e.g., a solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \\"or\\" (e.g., to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items required fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee had worked with previously.  WJ-III Analysis-Synthesis  In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual had to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contained some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual was presented with a set of logic rules, a \\"key\\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual had to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items presented puzzles that required two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involved a mix of puzzles that required fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference. = Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, Fourth Edition = In the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assessed gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.  WISC-IV Picture Concepts  In the Picture Concepts task, children were presented a series of pictures on two or three rows and asked which pictures (one from each row) belong together based on some common characteristic. This task assessed the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g., rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials.  WISC-IV Matrix Reasoning  Matrix Reasoning also tested this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children were presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task was to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involved the use of visual stimuli and did not require expressive language, they were considered to be non-verbal tests of gf. = In the workplace = Within the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) measures a person's fluid intelligence and cognitive processes. It maps these against suitable work environments according to Elliott Jacques Stratified Systems Theory. = Factors related to measuring intelligence = Some authors have suggested that unless an individual is truly interested in a problem presented on an IQ test, the cognitive work required to solve the problem to may not be performed owing to a lack of interest. These authors contended that a low score on tests which are intended to measure fluid intelligence may reflect more a lack of interest in the tasks themselves rather than any sort of inability to complete the tasks successfully. Development across life span  Fluid intelligence peaks at around age 20 and then gradually declines.Cacioppo, John T.; Freberg, Laura. Discovering Psychology: The Science of Mind. Cengage Learning, 2012, p. 448 This decline may be related to local atrophy of the brain in the right cerebellum, a lack of practice, or the result of age-related changes in the brain. Crystallized intelligence typically increases gradually, stays relatively stable across most of adulthood, and then begins to decline after age 65. The exact peak age of cognitive skills remains elusive.  Fluid intelligence and working memory  Working memory capacity is closely related to fluid intelligence, and has been proposed to account for individual differences in gf.Fuster, Joaquin. The Prefrontal Cortex Elsevier, 2008, p. 44 = Neuroanatomy = According to David Geary, gf and gc can be traced to two separate brain systems. Fluid intelligence involves both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and other systems related to attention and short-term memory. Crystallized intelligence appears to be a function of brain regions that involve the storage and usage of long-term memories, such as the hippocampus. = Research on training working memory and the training's indirect effect on fluid ability = Because working memory is thought to influence gf, then training to increase the capacity of working memory could have a positive impact on gf. Some researchers, however, question whether the results of training interventions to enhance gf are long-lasting and transferable, especially when these techniques are used by healthy children and adults without cognitive deficiencies. A meta-analytical review published in 2012 concluded that \\"memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize.\\" In a series of four individual experiments involving 70 participants (mean age of 25.6) from the University of Bern community, Jaeggi et al. found that, in comparison to a demographically matched control group, healthy young adults who practiced a demanding working memory task (dual n-back) approximately 25 minutes per day for between 8 and 19 days had significantly greater pre-to-posttest increases in their scores on a matrix test of fluid intelligence. There was no long-term follow-up to assess how enduring the effects of training were. Two later n-back studies did not support the findings of Jaeggi et al. Although participants' performance on the training task improved, these studies showed no significant improvement in the mental abilities tested, especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity. Thus the balance of findings suggests that training for the purpose of increasing working memory has short- term or no effects on gf.

Having joined the French Revolutionary Army in his youth, S√©bastiani rose through its ranks before becoming a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte. S√©bastiani was the French Consulate's emissary to The Levant, notably drafting plans to reconquer Ottoman Egypt, and later served as the Empire's Ambassador to The Porte. In the latter capacity, he attempted to increase French influence and signaled pro-Russian activities in the Danubian Principalities, thus provoking the War of 1806‚Äì1812. In 1807, S√©bastiani organized the defense of Constantinople during the Dardanelles Operation. Recalled due to British pressure after the deposition of Selim III, he served in the Peninsular War and resided in the Alhambra, took part in the unsuccessful invasion of Russia, and defended the Champagne region in front of the Sixth Coalition. S√©bastiani recognized the Bourbon Restoration, but rallied with Napoleon during the Hundred Days, being elected to the Chamber for the first time in 1815. Briefly exiled after the return of King Louis XVIII, he was again admitted as a Deputy in 1819, sitting with the Left faction, supporting liberal politics, and coming into conflict with the Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le Cabinet. After the July Revolution, he endorsed Louis-Philippe. S√©bastiani's time as Foreign Minister saw France's involvement in the Belgian Revolution, its refusal to sanction the November Uprising, the controversial solution to a commercial dispute with the United States, and the French occupation of Ancona. In later years, he progressed in French Government service as an ambassador. The 1847 murder of his daughter, Fran√ßoise, Duchess de Praslin indirectly helped spark the 1848 Revolution. Early life Born in La Porta, Corsica, S√©bastiani was the son of a tailor \\"Horace S√©bastiani\\", in Charles Mulli√©, Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires des arm√©es de terre et de mer de 1789 √† 1850 (wikisource) and well-to-do craftsman,Germain Sarrut, Biographie des Hommes du Jour, H.

Fran√ßois Buloz, \\"Chronique de la quinzaine - 14 avril 1835\\" , in Revue des Deux Mondes, Tome 2, 1835 (wikisource) Initially destined for a religious career, he left his native island during the French Revolution, and entered the army in 1792. \\"S√©bastiani, Horace Fran√ßois de la Porta\\", in Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1888 edition, retrieved 5 May 2007 Briefly dispatched as a secretary to Conte Raffaele Cadorna in Casablanca, S√©bastiani participated in the Revolutionary Wars, including campaigns in Corsica, 1793, the Alps, 1794‚Äì1797, and at the Battle of Marengo, 1800. Having served as an officer in the 9th Dragoon Regiment, he was promoted to Colonel in 1799.\\"Sebastiani, Horace\\", in Encyclopedia Americana, Vol.XI, B. B. Mussey & Co., Boston, 1851, p.298‚Äì299 S√©bastiani joined Lucien Bonaparte's entourage, and endorsed Napoleon's political actions, taking an active part in the 18 Brumaire coup (9 November 1799). \\"Lettres sur les hommes d'√©tat de France - Le G√©n√©ral Horace S√©bastiani\\", in Revue des Deux Mondes, Tome 4, 1833 (wikisource) In 1802, the Consulate sent him on his first diplomatic assignments in the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Egypt, and other parts of The Levant. Among his first actions were the settlement of a conflict between Sweden and the Barbary State of Tripoli, as well as obtaining the latter's agreement to recognize the Italian Republic. Mission to Egypt and 1805 Campaign S√©bastiani negotiated with the British military commanders in the aftermath of the French invasion of Egypt (1798), asking them to abide by the newly signed Treaty of Amiens and withdraw from Alexandria; following this he met with Ottoman officials in Cairo, unsuccessfully offering to mediate between them and rebellious beys (see Muhammad Ali's seizure of power). In late 1802, he traveled to Akka, and negotiated a trade agreement with the local pasha. During this period, S√©bastiani theorized that, despite Egyptian Campaign's failure, the French could yet again establish their control over the region.Jeremy Black, From Louis XIV to Napoleon: the Fate of a Great Power, Routledge, London, 1999, p.183Edward Ingram, Empire-Building and Empire-Builders: Twelve Studies, Routledge, London, 1995, p.95‚Äì96 He publicized this view in a report, published by Le Moniteur Universel on 30 January 1803, posing a threat for both British and Russian interests; this probably contributed to deescalating relations between the latter two over the prolonged British presence in Malta, with Henry Addington's Cabinet indicating that British troops would remain as long as France held designs to invade Egypt. Returning to France, he was put in charge of the littoral from the mouth of the Vilaine (in Morbihan) to Brest, before, in 1804, being despatched on a short mission to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Promoted Brigadier- General in 1803, he commanded Grande Arm√©e troops during the Battle of Ulm. After leading a successful attack on G√ºnzburg, S√©bastiani followed the Austrians into Moravia (1805), having been promoted G√©n√©ral de division after the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, where he was wounded. Embassy to Selim III Order of The Crescent insignia Appointed French Ambassador to The Porte on 12 April 1806, and gaining his post on 10 August,Alastair Hamilton, Maurits H. van den Boogert, Alexander H. de Groot, Friends and Rivals in the East: Studies in Anglo-Dutch Relations in The Levant from the Seventeenth Century to the Early Nineteenth Century, Brill Publishers, Leiden, 2000, p.231 he attempted to convince Sultan Selim III to exclude the Royal Navy from access through the Dardanelles. According to a biographical essay published by the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1833, S√©bastiani faced almost universal hostility from the anti-French diplomatic corps‚Äîwhose opinions were influenced by the Russian Count Andrei Yakovlevich Budberg and the British Ambassador Charles Arbuthnot. The same article claimed: \\"France had for its allies only the envoys of Spain and Holland\\". Among Horace S√©bastiani's moves to enlist Ottoman support for Napoleon was the establishment of a printing press in Constantinople, which published works of French literature translated into Turkish and Arabic. S√©bastiani persuaded the Ottomans to take a stand against Russia after bringing attention to the anti-Ottoman conspiracy in Wallachia, formed around Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, as well as to the suspicious policies of Moldavia's Prince Alexander Mourousis.Neagu Djuvara, √éntre Orient ≈üi Occident. ≈¢ƒÉrile rom√¢ne la √Ænceputul epocii moderne, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995, p.284, 340‚Äì341 Ion Ghica, Scrisori cƒÉtre Vasile Alecsandri: \\"Polcovnicul Ioni≈£ƒÉ Ceganu\\"; \\"Din timpul zaverii\\" (wikisource) According to the aristocratic Wallachian memoirist and politician Ion Ghica, Selim \\"followed the advice of General S√©bastiani, who tried to bring him to Napoleon's side\\", and saw a connection between Ypsilantis and the Serbian Uprising: > \\"He felt that [Ypsilantis] sided with the Russians and had an understanding > with Pazvantoƒülu of Vidin and with Czerny-George the Serbian, both of whom > had rebelled against The Porte.\\" The conflict itself started when Russia considered Ypsilantis' deposition to go against the letter of the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca and the Treaty of Jassy. While the Russian Count and Ambassador Arbuthnot prepared to leave Constantinople, The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated. Despite this, Russian troops under General Ivan Michelson and Count Mikhail Miloradovich entered the two Danubian Principalities (see Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì12)). Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both principalities (just before Russian occupation took over); the French Consul to Moldavia, Charles- Fr√©d√©ric Reinhard, reportedly not informed of S√©bastiani's contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops. As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy. Philippe Joseph Tassaert, ca. 1800 During the parallel Anglo-Turkish War in 1807, S√©bastiani helped the Ottomans in the successful defense of Constantinople against the British squadron of Admiral Duckworth. The British bombardment, coming at a time when the Muslim population was celebrating Eid al-Adha, was met with panic, and S√©bastiani's group of French military officers was soon the only organized force present on the European side. In his messages to Selim, Sir John Duckworth asked for the French ambassador to be removed, for the Ottoman fleet and the Dardanelles military facilities to be handed over, and for Russia to be granted rule over Wallachia and Moldavia. The Sultan sent envoys requesting S√©bastiani to leave Ottoman territory, but the French Ambassador explained that he would not do so until being ordered by Selim himself. As the matter was being debated, Janissary forces on the Anatolian shore organized themselves, and, once increased in strength, began responding to the attack. Selim subsequently asked S√©bastiani and his men (including Louis Gustave le Doulcet and , as well as the embassy's secretary ), to oversee Constantinople's defense and the line of fire nearby Topkapƒ± Palace, organizing maneuvers which caused Duckworth to withdraw. In 1806, S√©bastiani married Jeanne-Fran√ßoise-Antoinette (Fanny) , only daughter of Fran√ßois-Henri de Franquetot, marquis de Coigny).Portland (London) Collection: Catalogue of Family and Financial Papers of the Dukes of Portland, 1583‚Äì1940 , at the University of Nottingham, retrieved 5 May 2007 She died in childbirth while in Constantinople, just a few days before the Sultan was deposed (14 April 1807),Honor√© Fisquet, \\"Praslin, Charles-Laure-Hugues-Th√©obald, duc de Choiseul\\", in Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu'√† nos jours, Tome 40, Firmin Didot, Paris, 1862, p.979‚Äì980 and left S√©bastiani a large fortune. Upon hearing news of her death, Sultan Selim transmitted condolences through his Grand Dragoman. Embassy to Mustafa IV L√©gion d'honneur The successful rebellion led by Kabak√ßƒ± Mustafa and the Janissary troops put an end to French diplomatic success. S√©bastiani negotiated with Kabak√ßƒ±, while the British sought support from various factions inside ConstantinopleAntoine de Juchereau de Saint-Denys, Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman depuis 1792 jusqu'en 1844, Tome II, Comptoirs des Imprimeurs- unis, Paris, 1844, p.205, 208‚Äì209, 211‚Äì215 ‚Äî the Grand Dragoman, , eventually informed the French Ambassador on the parallel British projects. This resulted in Soutzos' beheading ‚Äî that which, in Ion Ghica's version of events, caused the Soutzos family to abandon their commitment to France and begin supporting Russia. According to the Revue des Deux Mondes biography, S√©bastiani had betrayed Aleko Soutzos' confidence by revealing as many details of Anglo- Ottoman negotiations as to render it clear that the Dragoman had been acting as his spy, and by failing to respect the promise of French protection. Under the new monarch, Mustafa IV, he attempted to impose a pro-French pasha as governor of Baghdad, and later provoked a scandal by asking for the Imperial Executioner, the Bostanji-bashi, to be demoted‚Äîthis came after three Ragusan subjects, having been found guilty of theft, were subjected to the falaka torture, despite the facts that the recent annexation of Ragusa by France offered them a degree of immunity. As a result of his pressures, S√©bastiani obtained rule over the province of Baghdad for his favorite, and, in return, allowed the Bostanji-bashi to remain in office. He asked to be recalled in April 1807, being replaced by Charg√© d'affaires Fa√ø de La Tour Maubourg. This departure was also prompted by renewed British requests. Shortly before his leaving, Sultan Mustafa awarded S√©bastiani the Order of the Crescent 1st Class, which has been interpreted as a measure to alleviate the impact of British successes. According to other accounts, Mustafa himself had become deeply dissatisfied with S√©bastiani's interventions and policies. Upon his return to France, S√©bastiani received the Grand Aigle de la L√©gion d'honneur. The Revue des Deux Mondes speculated that, based on the Corsican heritage he shared with S√©bastiani: > \\"the Emperor would often keep his eyes closed in respect to his Generals' > mistakes. > As for [S√©bastiani's] diplomatic skills, Napoleon was so affected that he > sent him to the arms as soon as he returned from the Orient, and did not > assign him to any negotiations until his fall [of 1814].\\" Peninsular War and 1813 Campaign The Alhambra citadel, Granada S√©bastiani became a Count of the Empire, and commanded IV Corps in the Peninsular War, notably at the Battle of Ciudad-Real, the Battle of Talavera, and the Battle of Almonacid. In 1810, he took Linares, Ja√©n, Granada and M√°laga. Troops under his command included a group of Polish √©migr√© soldiers,S. B. Gnorowski, Insurrection of Poland in 1830‚Äì31: And the Russian Rule Preceding it Since 1815, James Ridgway, London, 1839, p.223‚Äì224Frederick Niecks, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin as a Man and Musician, Volume 2, Kessinger Publishing, Whitefish, 2004, p.8 among them Albert Grzyma≈Ça, who served on his staff and was later noted for his friendship with Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. Starting from that date, S√©bastiani gained a reputation for lacking leadership skills: popularly nicknamed \\"General Surprise\\" as a result of having been caught out by enemy troops a significant number of times, he was argued by Jean-Baptiste de Marbot to have been noted for nothing other than mediocrity.Philip J. Haythornthwaite, Napoleon's Commanders (2): c1809‚Äì15, Osprey Publishing, Botley, 2002, p.51 According to the 1833 Revue des Deux Mondes, he had also become known for his lassitude, to the point where Napoleon himself grew irate. The same source recounted that, after Talavera de la Reina and especially after Almonacid, the general raised suspicion that he wasted men and resources, systematically failed to report all his casualties, and seriously exaggerated the scale of his victories. It was contended that the Emperor eventually withdrew S√©bastiani's command of IV Corps after concluding that this assessment was correct. Some sources claim that S√©bastiani was created \\"1st Duke of Murcia\\" by Napoleon; according to the Revue, although nominated for the title by the new King of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, S√©bastiani was denied appointment by Napoleon (a gesture alleged to have itself been based on the General's conduct at Almonacid). Nonetheless, it was reported that S√©bastiani made use of the title for the rest of his participation in the Spanish expedition. The Revue claimed that the ducal title \\"of Murcia\\" was adopted by the General himself, after he reaped a minor victory in Lorca and reportedly advanced a project to gain the region back from guerrilla forces (the plan was to be discarded by S√©bastiani's commander, Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult). S√©bastiani is reported to have plundered a number of Roman Catholic convents during the Peninsular expedition. Having stationed his troops in the Alhambra,Washington Irving, \\"The Alhambra\\", in Bracebridge Hall, Tales of a Traveller and the Alhambra, Library of America, 1991, p.753 (\\"Notes\\", p.1101) where he himself resided in noted luxury, S√©bastiani partly destroyed the palace's fortifications after retreating. It is argued that he was also responsible for the partial devastation of the palace's interior. The American author Washington Irving, who visited Spain in the following period, recounted that: > \\"With that enlightened taste which has ever distinguished the French nation > in their conquests, this monument of Moorish elegance and grandeur was > rescued from the absolute ruin and desolation that were overwhelming it. The > roofs were repaired, the saloons and galleries protected from the weather, > the gardens cultivated, the watercourses restored, the fountains once more > made to throw up their sparkling showers; and Spain may thank her invaders > for having preserved to her the most beautiful and interesting of her > historical monuments.\\" Serving during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, under Marshal Joachim Murat, and in the Campaign of 1812‚Äì1813, he commanded a cavalry division, becoming noted in the battles of Borodino (being the first French commander to enter Moscow, but was later forced to retreat with heavy losses), Bautzen, L√ºtzen, Leipzig (where he was wounded), and Hanau. After attempting to hold Cologne, he took part in the defense of French territory, holding a command position in Champagne and organizing troops in Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne. In March, he assisted in the retaking of Reims, where he faced the Imperial Russian Army troops under the command of Emmanuel de Saint-Priest. Hundred Days and Second Restoration Caricature of S√©bastiani, drawn by Honor√© Daumier Changing sides to support Talleyrand on 10 April 1814, S√©bastiani was appointed to the Bourbon Restoration Government and was, on 2 June, awarded the Order of Saint Louis by King Louis XVIII. Nevertheless, upon news that Napoleon was returning from Elba, he abandoned his command and left for Paris, where, together with the Count de Lavalette, he organized National Guard detachments to assist the Emperor. Napoleon also sent him over to attract support from the liberal politician Benjamin Constant; soon after, Constant became involved in drafting the more permissive Acte Additionel, which amended the Constitution of the Year XII. During the Hundred Days, he was assigned the reviewing of legislation passed by Louis XVIII, and organized the National Guard in Picardy. S√©bastiani was elected to the Chamber for the department of Aisne. After the Battle of Waterloo, he voted in favor of Napoleon's abdication, and, eventually, was among those assigned with negotiating a peace with the Seventh Coalition (as part of a delegation also comprising Benjamin Constant de Rebecque, the marquis de La Fayette, marquis d'Argenson and comte de Pont√©coulant). During talks, he showed himself opposed to a second Bourbon return. S√©bastiani spent a year in England before being allowed to return (having retired from active service and receiving half pay). Starting in 1819, after being promoted by the Duke Decazes, he was a prominent member of the Chamber of Deputies, initially representing Corsica, rallying with the Left. According to the Revue's comments, his political choice was unusual, reportedly astonishing both members of the Left and the moderate Decazes, a Royalist. Inside the Chamber, he joined forces with Maximilien Sebastien Foy, notably pushing projects to recognize the merits of Grande Arm√©e veterans; a speech he held on the latter occasion, which gave praise to the French tricolor, caused an uproar among conservative deputies. During the 1824 French legislative election, his attempt to campaign in Corsica was frustrated by the local authorities representing the Royalist Government of Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le, and he subsequently won 1 out of 48 votes. Instead, after General Foy's death in late 1825, he was elected as replacement in his constituency, the Aisne town of Vervins, receiving 120 votes out of 200. July Revolution and Belgian question The deputies proclaiming their allegiance to Louis- Philippe in 1830, painting by Fran√ßois Gerard, 1836 After the July Revolution, he held the posts of Naval Minister under the nominal leadership of Fran√ßois Guizot (autumn 1830), and Foreign Affairs under Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Pierre Perier. During the Revolution, he parted with the Left, and made declarations in support of Charles X‚Äîincluding one which proclaimed that the only national flag was the white one for the Bourbons. Allegedly establishing links with the radical Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera society in the early days of the July Monarchy, he subsequently rallied with the centrist politics of the Orl√©anist camp.F. Rittiez, Histoire du r√®gne de Louis-Philippe Ier, 1830 √† 1848, pr√©cis, Tome I, V. Lecou, Paris, 1855, p.44‚Äì45, 251‚Äì267, 268‚Äì269, 274, 280, 445 With Laffitte, Benjamin Constant, Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville, Adolphe Thiers, and others, he played a prominent part in calling Louis- Philippe to the French throne. After that, the S√©bastianis became the most influential faction in Corsica, replacing the Legitimist Pozzo di Borgo family Alfredo Ortega, De la Corse √† l'Andalousie. Joseph Antoine Limperani , hosted by ADECEC (Association pour le D√©veloppement des Etudes Arch√©ologiques, Historiques, linguistiques et Naturalistes du Centre-Est de la Corse), retrieved 5 May 2007 ‚Äî one of the latter, Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, was a high-ranking Russian diplomat who negotiated with Horace S√©bastiani on several occasions. In the wake of the Belgian Revolution, when candidatures were considered for the Belgian throne, S√©bastiani had the task of undermining support for Auguste of Leuchtenberg and drawing allegiances for the Duke of Nemours. After Nemours refused the Belgian crown, he transferred French support to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the British-backed candidate, in exchange for Leopold's agreeing to marry Louise-Marie of France. This policy was viewed as a capitulation by the Legitimists, and most notably by Jean Maximilien Lamarque, who, while deploring the separation of the French and the French-speaking Walloons, accused S√©bastiani of having obtained the destruction of fortifications in Belgium not as a concession from other states, but rather because \\"the allied powers want to set aside the means of entering France without running into obstacles\\". When the London Conference compelled Dutch forces to evacuate Belgian territory, S√©bastiani indicated that the French troops under General G√©rard were to remain in the area until \\"all reasons why the French Army has maneuvered would be dealt with resolutely, and no danger would threaten us\\". Nevertheless, G√©rard retreated before the Conference came to an end. When Chamber called on the minister to answer about the discrepancy, he declared himself \\"astonished\\" by news of the retreat, attributing it to British pressures, and indicated that \\"we have entered Belgium in good will; good will is what led us to withdraw\\". November Uprising: early negotiations Honor√© Daumier's cartoon of the 1832 London Conference, with France depicted as a timid hare in front of other powers (Poland is the female figure trampled upon by Russia) In late 1830, after the November Uprising broke out in Congress Poland, S√©bastiani, despite the revolutionaries' expectations, chose to avoid his country's involvement. As Russian troops carried out a violent intervention against the rebellion, a deputy in the Sejm lamented that Poland was perishing without having even seen a French courier; the minister responded to similar accusations at home by stating that France was determined not to raise the anger of Emperor Nicholas. Nevertheless, some time after the Uprising erupted, S√©bastiani received Polish envoys with sympathy, and had felt secure that \\"a friendly arrangement with Russia\\" could be achieved. To this end, he sent a mission to Saint Petersburg, which attempted to mediate an understanding between the Polish revolutionaries and Russia; in order to undermine communications between France and Poland, the government of Viktor Kochubey took the decision of recognizing the July Monarchy, which it had refused to do until then. In January 1831, after pressures from the Marquis de La Fayette, the Duke of Mortemart was dispatched to Russia in order to seek a new agreement‚Äîhis mission was made ineffectual by the revolutionaries' decision to dethrone Nicholas from his position as King of Poland, which in turn led to a standoff between all sides involved. In parallel, S√©bastiani allegedly approved the designs of Armand Charles Guilleminot, the Ambassador to The Porte, who attempted to undermine the Holy Alliance by stressing that Russian actions in Poland and the Balkans could rally opposition from Austria, the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom. Guilleminot ultimately presented the Ottomans with an offer to back an independent Poland‚Äîas a consequence, Foreign Minister S√©bastiani was formally asked by Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo to recall the ambassador, and he ultimately agreed to do so. Historian Barth√©lemy Haur√©au indicated that the moderate path pursued by S√©bastiani had been largely responsible for convincing Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki to postpone military operations, to the point where it was later contended that the minister was plotting with Russian authorities. He referred to S√©bastiani's position as \\"a miserable role\\", and to his correspondence with the Poles as \\"perfidious epistles\\".Barth√©lemy Haur√©au, Histoire de la Pologne depuis son origine jusqu'en 1846, Pagnerre, Paris, 1846, p.204‚Äì205 November Uprising: aftermath J. J. Grandville, 1831 When Poland was ultimately pacified, S√©bastiani uttered the famous words: > \\"Order reigns in Warsaw.\\" The statement itself was not rendered verbatim by the Moniteur, allegedly due to their potential for causing scandal. As S√©bastiani's words began circulating freely, public opinion considered them evidence of callousness, and, in December, they were used by J. J. Grandville as title for a cartoon showing the effects of repression in Congress Poland. Another of Grandville's drawings, depicting the authorities' violent response to public manifestations of support for Polish revolutionaries, was titled Public Order Reigns Also in Paris (sold together, the two works caused the artist to be censored and his house to be raided by policemen).Robert Justin Goldstein, Censorship of Political Caricature in Nineteenth-Century France, Kent State University Press, Kent, 1989, p.143 It was also contended that the statement had been made by S√©bastiani with the specific goal of persuading Russia that France did not condemn the intervention ‚Äî reportedly, Emperor Nicholas normalized relations with France and received its ambassador, the Duke of Tr√©vise, only after hearing news of S√©bastiani's speech. Later, he justified himself in front of the Chamber by arguing that intervention in Poland was doomed to failure, noting that a French landing on Poland's Baltic shore was made impossible by both distance and the minor scale of facilities in Polangen. When interpellated in the Chamber, he also contended that France had managed to obtain consensus that Russia was to maintain a degree of Polish autonomy, as these had been stipulated by the 1814‚Äì1814 Congress of Vienna. Reflecting upon public sentiment at a time when Radicalism had become a European phenomenon, he was also quoted saying: > \\"There are those who want to drag us into a war of opinions, to dump us into > an apparent alliance of peoples versus governments; we ask them with what > right do they pretend to attribute themselves or assign us the mission of > revolutionizing all the peoples. We know their goal and their secret > thought. These people work to bring disruptions on the inside through > disruptions on the outside. What they want, we avoid; what they fear, we > seek. In the absence of set rules of conduct, their exhortations, their > fears and their joys would suffice for shedding light on our path and making > us perceive the abysses where they would like to throw us.\\" During a Chamber session in September 1831, the liberal Marquis de La Fayette publicly accused the Laffitte cabinet in general and S√©bastiani in particular of having secretly encouraged the Poles while persuading them to delay their attack on Russian troops (allegedly promising that France would give them official backing following that moment, and later forfeiting the pledge). La Fayette also stressed that it was possible for France to sanction Polish independence, especially since the Holy Alliance appeared to have been divided on the issue. According to Karl Marx, when S√©bastiani defended his ministry and stressed that he had not made Poland any promises, the Marquis confronted him with a letter signed by Karol Kniaziewicz, dated September 1830, which contained references to S√©bastiani's guarantees and his call to postpone the offensive.Karl Marx, \\"Note for Draft of Speech by Marx on France's Attitude to Poland\\", at Marxists Internet Archive, retrieved 5 May 2007 The Revue des Deux Mondes recounted that the diplomat Talleyrand and S√©bastiani both maintained an independent line in politics‚Äîtheir secretive notes reportedly contributed to the fall of the Laffitte government. P√©rier Cabinet Over the following year, he and Prime Minister P√©rier were called upon by the Marquis de La Fayette to express disapproval for reactionary politics in the Austrian Empire, and to allow Italian Carbonari refugees such as Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso to remain on French territory. La Fayette noted that S√©bastiani had undertaken: > \\"efforts to revoke and prevent the sequestration [of property] that was > inflicted [by Austria] on the Italian men and women who are traveling in > France.\\"Lloyd S. Kramer, Lafayette in Two Worlds: Public Cultures and > Personal Identities in an Age of Revolution, University of North Carolina > Press, Chapel Hill, 1996, p.174‚Äì176 In February 1832, S√©bastiani took initiative in ordering a French occupation of Ancona. The Revue argued that this was the most significant gesture of his career, and credited him with having planned it as an indirect but effective strike at Austrian economic interests, when implying that France would march into Rome and Trieste in the event of a war with Austria. Among his last actions in office as Foreign Minister were negotiations with the United States over losses suffered by American citizens during the Napoleon's Continental Blockade, when several ships bearing the American flag were arrested in European ports, on suspicion that they were in fact serving British commercial interests (see Embargo Act of 1807). Raising much controversy, he set the sum France agreed to pay at 25 million francs, 10 million more than what committees of the Conseil d'√âtat and Chamber had decided, although still significantly less than what had been asked by American plaintiffs. It was during the same period that S√©bastiani remarried, to Agla√©-Ang√©lique-Gabrielle de Gramont, one of H√©raclius, duc de Gramont's daughters and the widow of the Russian General Count Alexander Davidoff.Thomas Raikes, A Portion of the Journal Kept by Thomas Raikes, Esq., from 1831 to 1847, Vol. II, Longman, Brown, Green etc., London, 1856, p.40 He retired from office after suffering a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, and traveled in the Italian Peninsula. He was later Minister of State for a short period of time. Later years Marshal S√©bastiani in full dress uniform, portrait by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1841 In 1833, S√©bastiani was ambassador to the Two Sicilies, and in 1835‚Äì1840, to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.Adolphe Thiers, \\"Lettre aux √©lecteurs d'Aix\\", in √âlias Regnault, R√©volution fran√ßaise. Histoire de huit ans, 1840‚Äì1848, Pagnerre, Paris, 1852, p.119, 121 He was recalled and replaced by Fran√ßois Guizot after refusing, against his government wishes, to support the cause of Muhammad Ali's design to extend his rule out of the Egyptian realm by conquering Ottoman lands in Syria (see London Straits Convention). Adolphe Thiers later pointed out that he agreed with S√©bastiani's view, which he defined as: > \\"The apprehension [...] over seeing France engaging in the Oriental > question, to find herself the only one of that opinion, and from that moment > on to be reduced to the alternative of either ceding or risk a universal war > over an object that was not worth it [...].\\" During the ministerial crisis provoked by the fall of the Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult cabinet, before Thiers' nomination, S√©bastiani was considered for the office of Premier; his failure to gain the position was attributed to rejection from all political camps, based on the view that he was overtly subservient to King Louis-Philippe. He was made Marshal of France in 1840, replacing the deceased Nicolas Joseph Maison, and represented Ajaccio in the Chamber for several terms. He became a Peer of France in 1842. The Revue des Deux Mondes' Fran√ßois Buloz announced, in April 1835, that Vicomte Tiburce S√©bastiani was involved in heated disputes with other public figures, over repeated allegations that his brother had harmed French interests in the American creditors' affair. In this and other cases of the period, the same controversy almost erupted into duels. Having largely retired from public life, he had his last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole daughter from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin. Brigitte-Marie Le Brigand, \\"Choiseul-Praslin: les pi√®ces √† conviction\\", in Historia, Nr.704, retrieved 5 May 2007Christina Vella, Intimate Enemies: The Two Worlds of the Baroness de Pontalba, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 1997, p.138 Fanny had married Charles, duc de Praslin, in 1825.Henry James Gabriel de Milleville, Armorial historique de la noblesse de France, Bureau de l'Armorial Historique, Paris, 1845, p.67 In what was one of the most famous murders of the 19th century, the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children. Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke's plan to run away with their children's governess. Arrested and waiting to be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on parole, only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges. This event played a part in bringing about the 1848 Revolution, after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to take his own life rather than face trial, or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape. As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the S√©bastianis' influence in Corsica, especially after Tiburce S√©bastiani chose to retire to his domain in Olmeta-di-Tuda. Four years later, S√©bastiani died suddenly while having breakfast. His funeral service was held at Les Invalides and attended by President Charles-Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte among other officials of the Second Republic. Legacy Horace S√©bastiani's name is inscribed on the western side of the Arc de Triomphe. An avenue in Bastia was named in his honor (Avenue Mar√©chal S√©bastiani). In 1938, Rachel Field published her All This and Heaven Too, a novel which centers on the killing of S√©bastiani's daughter. The 1940 drama film of the same starred Barbara O'Neil as Fanny, Charles Boyer as De Choiseul-Praslin, and Bette Davis as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the governess. S√©bastiani is portrayed by Montagu Love.All This and Heaven Too at the Internet Movie Database, retrieved 5 May 2007 S√©bastiani is also one of the protagonists in Prince Michael of Greece's novel Sultana - La Nuit du S√©rail, which depicts fictionalized events of Selim III's rule.

He is best known for his research on epilepsy.  Biography  He was born at Providence Green, Green Hammerton, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, the youngest son of Samuel Jackson, a brewer and yeoman who owned and farmed his land, and Sarah Jackson (n√©e Hughlings), the daughter of a Welsh revenue collector. His mother died just over a year after giving birth to him. He had three brothers and a sister; his brothers emigrated to New Zealand and his sister married a physician. He was educated at Tadcaster, Yorkshire and Nailsworth, Gloucestershire before attending the York Medical and Surgical School. After qualifying at St Barts in 1856 he became house physician to the York Dispensary. In 1859 he returned to London to work at the Metropolitan Free Hospital and the London Hospital. In 1862 he was appointed Assistant Physician, later (1869) full Physician at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy located in Queen Square, London (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) as well as Physician (1874) at the London Hospital. During this period he established his reputation as a neurologist. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1878. Jackson died in London on 7 October 1911 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He was an atheist.Siegman, Aron Wolfe., and Stanley Feldstein. Nonverbal Behavior and Communication. Hillsdale, NJ: L. Erlbaum Associates, 1978. Print. The Hull York Medical School building at the University of York is named in his honour.  Science and research  Jackson was an innovative thinker and a prolific and lucid, if sometimes repetitive, writer. Though his range of interests was wide, he is best remembered for his seminal contributions to the diagnosis and understanding of epilepsy in all its forms and complexities. His name is attached eponymously to the characteristic \\"march\\" (The Jacksonian March) of symptoms in focal motor seizures and to the so-called \\"dreamy state\\" of psychomotor seizures of temporal lobe origin. His papers on the latter variety of epilepsy have seldom been bettered in their descriptive clinical detail or in their analysis of the relationship of psychomotor epilepsy to various patterns of pathological automatism and other mental and behavioural disorders. Jackson also did research on aphasia, noting that some aphasic children were able to sing, even though they had lost the power of ordinary speech. He also studied what types of language loss was found in patients with left-brain injury, including set phrases, such as \\"Good bye\\" and \\"Oh, dear.\\"Hughlings Jackson, J. (1874a/1932).

In his youth Jackson had been interested in conceptual issues and it is believed that in 1859 he contemplated the idea of abandoning medicine for philosophy.James Taylor, ‚ÄòJackson, John Hughlings (1835‚Äì1911)‚Äô, rev. Walton of Detchant, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Thus, an important part of his work concerned the evolutionary organization of the nervous system for which he proposed three levels: a lower, a middle, and a higher. At the lowest level, movements were to be represented in their least complex form; such centres lie in the medulla and spinal cord. The middle level consists of the so-called motor area of the cortex, and the highest motor levels are found in the prefrontal area. The higher centres inhibited the lower ones and hence lesions thereat caused ‚Äònegative‚Äô symptoms (due to an absence of function). ‚ÄòPositive‚Äô symptoms were caused by the functional release of the lower centres. This process Jackson called ‚Äòdissolution‚Äô, a term he borrowed from Herbert Spencer. The ‚Äòpositive-negative‚Äô distinction he took from Sir John Reynolds. Continental psychiatrists and psychologists (e.g. Th√©odule Ribot, Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud, Henri Ey) have been more influenced by Jackson‚Äôs theoretical ideas than their British counterparts.Berrios G E (1977) Henri Ey, Jackson et les id√©es obs√©dantes.

He also delivered the 1872 Hunterian Oration to the Hunterian Society. = Methodology = Jackson could not use modern sophisticated neuro-investigative technology (it had not been invented), but had to rely upon his own powers of clinical observation, deductive logic and autopsy data. Some of his eminent successors in the field of British neurology have been critical of many of his theories and concepts; but as Sir Francis Walshe remarked of his work in 1943, \\" ... when all that is obsolete or irrelevant is discarded there remains a rich treasure of physiological insight we cannot afford to ignore.\\" In Otfrid Foerster's research on the motor cortex, he cites exclusively Hughlings Jackson for the initial discovery (although without evidence) of the brain as the spring of neurological motor signalling.  Contributions  Together with his friends Sir David Ferrier and Sir James Crichton-Browne, two eminent neuropsychiatrists of his time, Jackson was one of the founders of the important journal Brain, which was dedicated to the interaction between experimental and clinical neurology (still being published today). Its inaugural issue was published in 1878. In 1892, Jackson was one of the founding members of the National Society for the Employment of Epileptics (now the National Society for Epilepsy), along with Sir William Gowers and Sir David Ferrier. Oliver Sacks repeatedly cited Jackson as an inspiration in his neurologic work.

The book explores the sexual revolution-era trend of \\"swinging\\" (partner-swapping) via a glimpse into the lives of two couples in a small New England college town who enter casually into such an affair, with disastrous consequences. Plot summary The narrator (who never identifies himself by name) is a college professor and a relatively unsuccessful author of historical novels. While doing research in Vienna, Austria, he met Utch, an orphaned survivor of the German occupation and the Russian siege at the end of World War II. At the opening of the novel, the narrator and Utch are married with two children and live a relatively placid existence until, at a faculty party, they become acquainted with Severin Winter, a Viennese-born professor of German and coach of the school's wrestling team, and his wife Edith, a WASP from a privileged background (she met her husband in Vienna while on a buying trip for MOMA) who is an aspiring fiction writer. The narrator begins a mentor-prot√©g√© relationship with Edith, and soon the couples are sharing dinners and play dates with their children. As the narrator becomes more attracted to Edith, and Utch begins to fall for Severin, the couples begin trading spouses for sexual encounters at the end of their dinner dates. At first the affairs proceed smoothly, with emotional conflict submerged beneath sexual curiosity, but soon enough, obsessive love rears its ugly head, and the narrator begins to discover that the Winters have not been entirely honest with him and his wife about their motives for entering the affair. It is ultimately revealed that sometime prior to the events of the novel Severin had an affair with a teacher at the school, and when Edith discovered this she became furious and depressed. In an attempt to provide her with some emotional leverage against him, Severin arranged for Edith to become sexually involved with the narrator, while he himself would sleep with Utch. This foursome soon thereafter fragments; Severin and Edith are able to repair their relationship and forgive each other for the pains they have inflicted on one another. The narrator and Utch, however, are a different story. The narrator had developed genuine feelings for Edith, and while she did seem to reciprocate them, at least to a small degree, he is left despondent after she ends their liaison to salvage her marriage to Severin. For her own part Utch had fallen completely in love with Severin, and she is left devastated upon learning he did not feel the same for her. Utch leaves and takes their children with her, returning to her native Austria to sort out her feelings; she also takes her husband's passport so he cannot follow her. Edith and Severin likewise move to Austria, though it is revealed through letters that Utch writes her husband that she and the Winters do not interact with each other. The novel ends with a small bit of hope for the narrator and Utch when she mails him his passport, indicating she is now ready to mend their relationship. The sport of wrestling featured prominently‚Äîthe novel's title refers to the 158-pound weight class, which Severin considers the most elite competitive weight‚Äîand a subplot eventually emerges involving Winter's prot√©g√©, a peculiar wrestling prodigy from Iowa who transfers to Winter's college because of its superior biology department and becomes a pawn in the fallout of the two couples' swinging relationship.

It marked the final flight of the Soyuz-T spacecraft, the third generation Soyuz spacecraft, which had been in service for seven years from 1979 to 1986. This mission marked the first time that a spacecraft visited, and docked with, two space stations in the same mission.  Crew  = Backup crew =  Mission parameters  * Mass: 6850 kg * Perigee: 331 km * Apogee: 366 km * Inclination: 51.6¬∞ * Period: 91.5 minutes  Mission highlights  Soyuz T-15 was both the first expedition to Mir and the last to Salyut 7. =Flight to Mir= Due to the pressure of launching Mir in time for the 27th Communist Party Congress, mission planners were left without the newer Soyuz-TM spacecraft or any of the planned modules to launch to the station at first. It was decided to launch an older Soyuz-T as Soyuz T-15 on a dual mission to both Mir and Salyut 7. Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyov first docked with the Mir space station on 15 March 1986 after their launch on 13 March. Plans for Mir intended that only the newer Soyuz-TM would dock with Mir's forward port, leaving the aft port free for arriving Progress spacecraft. However, the older Soyuz-T was not equipped with the Kurs approach system used on Mir's front port, but only with the older Igla approach system used for Mir's aft port. Therefore, Soyuz T-15 had to approach Mir's aft port, and then manually maneuver around the station to dock manually at the forward port. At 20 km Soyuz T-15's Igla system acquired its counterpart on Mir's aft port. At 200 meters, the Igla system was shut off, and the crew manually maneuvered around the station to dock at the front port. For this manual approach, the same laser range finder was used as for the Soyuz T-13 docking with the uncooperative Salyut 7 station in 1985. During their nearly 55-day stay on Mir, the crew unloaded two Progress spacecraft, launched after their arrival. The mission was mostly designed to test out the new space station's systems since it had been launched with little scientific equipment, most of which would have to wait for the launch of add-on modules. Despite Mir's name literally meaning \\"Peace\\", US officials during this time accused the Soviet Union of performing military experiments on their supposedly civilian space stations. After the cosmonauts' return to Earth, Leonid Kizim in an official press conference stated that Mir was not being used for any military purposes and that \\"The US is accusing us of this sort of action in order to justify their own plans to extend the arms race into space.\\" The Reagan Administration did not however reiterate these claims so as not to negatively impact the planned 1987 summit meeting between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. =The crew transfers to Salyut 7= In preparation for the trip to Salyut 7, the crew loaded Soyuz T-15 with their personal belongings, plants grown on Mir, and other items. At that time Salyut 7 was still 4000 km ahead of Mir in a lower orbit in the same inclination. Therefore, on 4 May, Mir was lowered by 13 km in order to expedite the approach to Salyut 7 and conserve Soyuz T-15's limited fuel supply for the transfer. On 5 May 1986 12:12:09 UTC they undocked from Mir for their journey to Salyut 7 ‚Äì at this time, the distance between the two space stations had been reduced to 2500 km due to Mir's maneuver. After a crossing of 29 hours, Soyuz T-15 docked with Salyut 7 on 6 May 16:57:52 UTC. =Experiments on Salyut 7= The previous crew on Salyut 7, Salyut 7 EO-4, had been assigned to conduct experiments with TKS-4 (Kosmos 1686). However, commander Vladimir Vasyutin had fallen ill and the crew had to return prematurely to Earth. Therefore, they were unable to perform EVAs, which would have had implications for the Mir program. After arriving at Salyut 7, the crew of Soyuz T-15 conducted two EVAs and collected experiment results, experimental apparatuses, and samples of materials to finish the work of the previous crew. The first EVA was on 28 May, when the crewmembers climbed outside to retrieve space exposure experiments and test the Ferma-Postroital (\\"girder-constructor\\") device. A deployment canister converted a folded girder cartridge into a 15-meter girder in only a few minutes. The girder was retracted by reversing the process at the end of the EVA. This first EVA lasted 3 hours and 50 minutes. The second EVA consisted of girder and welding experiments. On 31 May, Kizim and Solovyov attached measurement devices to the top of the retracted girder, then re-extended it with an aim toward studying its rigidity.

This second EVA lasted five hours. =Ferry flight back to Mir= The crew removed 20 instruments with a total mass of 350 to 400 kg from Salyut 7 before returning to Mir. Mir maneuvered twice again between 24‚Äì25 June, raising its orbit slightly and moving closer to Salyut 7. On 25 June, Soyuz T-15 undocked from Salyut 7 to begin their 29-hour journey back to Mir, to which they returned on 25‚Äì26 June. On 3 July, Kizim surpassed Valeri Ryumin's record for time spent in space. On 6 July, he became the first human to have spent a full year in space. The crew spent their last 20 days on Mir conducting Earth observations. Meanwhile, between 19 and 22 August, engines on Kosmos 1686 boosted Salyut 7 to a record-high mean orbital altitude of 475 km to forestall reentry. Atmospheric drag took its toll, however, and the station reentered over South America 55 months later. Pieces of Salyut 7 and Kosmos 1686 were found in Argentina. Soyuz T-15 was the last mission to use the Soyuz-T spacecraft, due to its replacement by the Soyuz-TM.

The district encompasses the coastal regions of North Carolina, from the Outer Banks and areas near the Pamlico Sound in the north, southwards to the northern suburbs of Wilmington. Jones's father was Walter B. Jones Sr., a Democratic Party congressman from the neighboring 1st district. Prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, he served ten years in the North Carolina House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party and worked as a business executive. He had been a Democrat like his father before changing parties in 1994, just before his first election to the U.S. House. Even after becoming a Republican, he frequently broke with the party over key issues. He supported the U.S. involvement in the Iraq War initially, but became one of its staunchest critics, arguing that the George W. Bush administration misinformed Congress with selective intelligence to win authorization for the war. He also was a critic of the Bush administration in their firing of federal prosecutors, and joined Democrats in supporting raises to the federal minimum wage. During the Obama administration, he voted against the Republican Path to Prosperity budget proposal of 2011, after which he was removed from key committee roles for defying party leadership. During the Trump presidency, he was a frequent voice on the floor of Congress calling for scrutiny of the Trump presidency, including demanding the release of his tax returns and calling for investigations into the Trump presidential campaign involvement in the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Having libertarian-leaning tendencies, he was a member of the Liberty Caucus. The American Conservative Union consistently rated Jones low among his Republican colleagues for support of the conservative political platform, though he received higher ratings from the Conservative Review and Club for Growth. Early life, education, and business career Jones was the son of U.S. representative Walter B. Jones Sr. (1913‚Äì1992) and Doris (Long) Jones (1914‚Äì1984). Jones was a lifelong resident of Farmville, a small town near Greenville, North Carolina. He attended Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia and graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts from Atlantic Christian College (now Barton College) in Wilson, North Carolina, before serving four years (1967‚Äì1971) in the North Carolina National Guard. He worked as an executive with his family's business supply company. North Carolina legislature Jones was first elected as a Democrat to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1982 and served for five terms, until 1992. He represented Pitt County.North Carolina Manual 1989‚Äì90, p. 395 He was known in the North Carolina House for his advocacy of campaign finance reform and lobbying reform. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= ;1992 After his father announced his retirement from Congress in 1992, Jones ran for his father's seat in North Carolina's 1st congressional district. He ranked first in the Democratic primary with 38% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win the nomination. In the run-off election, he was defeated by Eva Clayton, Chairwoman of the Warren County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 55%‚Äì45%. Clayton received support from three of the defeated primary candidates and from the African American community. Jones Sr. died before his term expired, and Clayton was elected to serve out the last two months of his term. ;1994 In 1994, he switched parties and ran in North Carolina's 3rd congressional district, which had absorbed a large chunk of his father's former territory. His race against incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster was initially very close until Jones released a picture of Lancaster jogging with President Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stances (especially on gays in the military) angered many voters in the district. Although Democrats have a large advantage in registered voters, the 3rd district has always had a very strong social conservative tint; Jesse Helms in particular had a large base of support there. As part of the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Jones defeated Lancaster 53%‚Äì47%. With his victory, Jones became the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction. Early portrait of Jones as a Congressman ;1996‚Äì2004 From 1994 on Jones won re-election with at least 61% in every general election. His most serious general election challenge came in 2000, when his opponent spent well in excess of $1.4 million in attempting to unseat him. Jones garnered 61% of the vote in that contest, largely helped by George W. Bush, winning the 3rd with his highest victory margin in the state. ;2006 He was easily re-elected to a 7th term in 2006, receiving 69% of the vote despite a very bad national result for Republicans overall. ;2008 Jones' change of heart on the Iraq War (see below) resulted in him facing serious primary opposition for the first time since his initial run for Congress. He was challenged by Onslow County Commissioner Joe McLaughlin. Jones defeated the poorly funded McLaughlin 59%‚Äì41%. In the general election, Jones defeated Craig Weber 66%‚Äì34%. ;2010 In the general election, he defeated Johnny Rouse with 73% of the vote. ;2012 He faced Frank Palombo, a former New Bern police chief in the Republican primary on May 8 and won. He won against Marine Corps Veteran Erik Anderson in the general election. ;2014 He faced Taylor Griffin, a former aide to President George W. Bush, who was heavily supported by outside money, and won the Republican Party primary on May 6.Renee Schoof, US House, District 3: Jones headed back to Congress, News Observer, May 6, 2014. ;2016 He defeated Democrat Ernest Reeves by 67%‚Äì32%. ;2018 Jones was re- elected to his final term in November 2018 unopposed. =Tenure= Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, meets with Jones on July 10, 2013, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia Jones had a lifetime rating of 84.69 from the American Conservative Union. However, his voting record had become somewhat more moderate in the years prior to his death, according to the group's ranking. In recent years, he had received some of the lowest ACU ratings of any Republican from the South. In 2006, he received a 79, in 2007 he received a 71, in 2008 he received a 58, in 2009 he received an 83, in 2010 he received a 65, and in 2011 he received a 60.ACU 2006 U.S. Congress Ratings. Retrieved August 10, 2007. The former five ratings were the lowest recorded in those years for a Republican from North Carolina. Jones was ranked as the 37th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). Jones said that his father was able to vote his conscience until he became a member of the House Democratic leadership, at which time he had to vote with the party line. For instance, his father voted for the 1975 federal bailout of a bankrupt New York City even though he personally opposed it. Jones said of that vote, \\"He had to vote it that way. I would rather do what I think is right than to sell my political soul.\\" Jones drifted towards the libertarian spectrum when he changed his positions on foreign policy including the Iraq War. Jones opposed pork barrel spending projects and was a staunch advocate of federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and voted for H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Jones sided with the Democrats on economic issues such as raising the minimum wage. He was an animal lover and said he would like a memorial created on the National Mall for war dogs. Jones endorsed Ron Paul in the 2008 race for president of the United States. In an annual survey conducted by Washingtonian magazine, congressional staffers voted Jones the kindest member of the House. In 2007, Jones cosponsored legislation with fellow North Carolina congressman Heath Shuler to require airlines to have sections of the aircraft where large movie screens were not visible. This was to avoid the situation where children could potentially watch films found objectionable by their parents. He also was the only Republican co-sponsor of legislation to challenge Tom DeLay's proposed changes to House ethics rules. On February 14, 2008, Jones was one of only three Republicans (along with Ron Paul and Wayne Gilchrest) to vote to hold George W. Bush confidantes Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers in contempt of Congress for failing to testify and provide documents relevant to the firing of federal prosecutors. On September 15, 2009, Jones was one of only seven Republicans to vote for a resolution of disapproval of fellow Representative Joe Wilson for his actions during President Obama's address to a Joint Session of Congress on September 9, 2009.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll699.xml Jones presented the Walter B. Jones Campus Defender of Freedom Award to a North Carolina activist selected by a committee at Duke University, including the Duke College Republicans; in 2009, Jones presented the award to B.J. Lawson. At the 2009 ceremony, Jones said that \\"The Republican Party needs to have a face that can be seen and identified with by people of all races. The future of the Republican Party lies in being able to relate to the average working family.\\" He also spoke in favor of making Duke's endowment more transparent, saying that he is in favor of more openness on the part of institutions: \\"To me, sunshine is the answer.\\" In 2010, congressional aides on Capitol Hill ranked Jones as the second nicest in the U.S. House of Representatives and the second least partisan member of the House. On April 15, 2011, Jones was one of four Republican members of Congress to vote against The Path to Prosperity. In December 2012, Jones was one of four House Republicans removed from their committees by Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor for defying party leadership. Jones was removed from the Financial Services Committee, a plum seat for fundraising, ostensibly as reprisal for not raising money for the Republican Party. However, it was speculated that Jones, who was popular in the caucus, was only removed as \\"cover\\" for the removal of Justin Amash of Michigan, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas and David Schweikert of Arizona from their own plum committee assignments, who were removed for being \\"assholes\\". Representative Lynn Westmoreland concluded, \\"some people ... just don't want to work within the system.\\" Jones maintained his seat on the Armed Services Committee. He is the author of Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act (H.R. 126;113th Congress). In February 2017, Jones signed a letter to urge Congress to request President Donald Trump's tax returns so that they can be reviewed in a closed session of Congress and determined whether the returns can be released to the public. On March 28, 2017, Jones became the first Republican Congressman to call for Representative Devin Nunes to recuse himself as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He cited the alleged impropriety of Congressman Nunes' meeting at the White House the previous week as the reason for breaking with his party on the issue. Foreign wars Congressional cafeteria featuring freedom fries Jones was initially a strong supporter of the conflict in Iraq, but then became one of the leading Republicans opposed to continued involvement in Iraq. Jones became well known for leading the effort, along with GOP Rep. Bob Ney, to have french fries renamed \\"freedom fries\\" on House cafeteria menus as a protest against French opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Jones later modified his stance on the war to a considerable extent. In 2005, he stated that he had come to believe that there had been little reason to go to war, despite his earlier support, which had been based upon selective intelligence supplied to Congress. He said of his previous position on the fries, \\"I wish it had never happened.\\" In July 2006, the names were quietly changed back. On March 17, 2005, he sponsored a bill endorsing the conduct of his Camp Lejeune constituent, controversial Marine Corps Lieutenant Ilario Pantano, who faced charges (subsequently dropped) for having shot two Iraqis (allegedly unarmed civilians) on April 15, 2004. Jones called on President George W. Bush to apologize for misinforming Congress to win authorization for the war. Jones said, \\"If I had known then what I know today, I wouldn't have voted for that resolution.\\" Jones contended that the United States went to war \\"with no justification.\\" On the subject, he said, \\"I just feel that the reason of going in for weapons of mass destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that's all been proven that it was never there.\\" He added that his change of opinion came about from attending the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006. Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq. He said, \\"If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong. Congress must be told the truth.\\" In 2007, he and Rep. William Delahunt (D‚ÄìMA) introduced the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, which seeks to \\"prohibit the president from ordering military action without congressional approval, except when the United States or U.S. troops were attacked or when U.S. citizens needed to be evacuated.\\" On January 12, 2007, he introduced H. J. Res. 14: Concerning the use of military force by the United States against Iran in the 110th congress. According to Jones on his web site, the resolution requires that ‚Äì absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces ‚Äì the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D‚ÄìCA) on March 13, 2007. On March 23, 2007, Jones was one of two Republicans to vote for a bill that would have required President George W. Bush to bring combat troops home from Iraq by September 1, 2008. The other Republican was Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland's 1st congressional district. Jones' views on the war in Iraq did not ingratiate him to Bush or to the Republican leadership, which prevented him from succeeding the late Jo Ann Davis as ranking Republican on the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee. He was passed over for Randy Forbes when the 110th Congress convened because the full committee's ranking member, Duncan Hunter of California, did not agree with Jones' change of heart on the war. He had been approached by some Democrats about bolting the GOP and either becoming an independent caucusing with the Democrats or switching back to the Democratic Party outright. Additionally, Jones' changed views on the war and other issues angered many Republicans in his district, which has the largest military presence of any in North Carolina. On March 7, 2012, Jones introduced House Concurrent Resolution 107, proposing that Congress should consider waging wars without an Act of Congress as grounds for impeachment of the President for High Crimes and Misdemeanors according to the Constitution of the United States of America. In April 2017, Jones criticized U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Al-Qaeda in Yemen \\"has emerged as a de facto ally of the Saudi-led militaries with whom [Trump] administration aims to partner more closely.\\" In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Jones put out a press release calling it \\"horrific and senseless.\\" He expressed that he was mourning the loss of Shane Evan Tomlinson, a graduate from East Carolina University. = Committee assignments (115th Congress) = * Committee on Armed Services **Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces ** Subcommittee on Military Personnel =Caucus memberships= Jones served on the Liberty Caucus (sometimes called the Liberty Committee), a group of libertarian-minded Republican congressional representatives. Congressman Ron Paul originally hosted a luncheon for the Liberty Caucus every Thursday. The caucus is now hosted and chaired by Congressman Justin Amash. Other members included Jim Duncan of Tennessee, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Jones was a member of the Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus and the Veterinary Medicine Caucus. Political positions Jones co-sponsored four cannabis bills, including supporting veterans' access to medical cannabis and hemp farming. He voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 due to the anticipated $2 trillion that would be added to the national debt. \\"I'm all for tax reform, but it must grow the economy, not the debt,\\" he stated. He also voted against it due to concerns that his constituents would pay more taxes. \\"That is the last thing struggling families need,\\" he stated in wake of the vote. Jones agreed with Michael Mullen and James Mattis that the national debt is the \\"biggest threat\\" to national security. Personal life Jones was raised a Southern Baptist, but was a Roman Catholic convert when he died. He married Joe Anne Whitehurst in 1966, and the two had one child, a daughter, Ashley. =Illness and death= In July 2018, Jones began to miss votes due to illness; in December 2018, the House granted him a leave of absence for the remainder of the session by unanimous consent.Ailing Rep.

The company had around 37,000 employees at the end of the 2019 financial year (31 March 2019) and is represented in 13 countries in Europe. In the 2019 financial year the company achieved a turnover of EUR 21.18 billion. The majority shareholder of the company is the US-based McKesson Corporation, which holds a share of 77.01%. The remaining 22.99% of shares are available on the open market. Kevin Kettler, a US citizen, has been Chairman of McKesson Europe since 1 November 2018. Overview The head office is situated at Stockholmer Platz in the new Europaviertel of Stuttgart, next to Stadtbibliothek and Milaneo shopping centre. The company's core business consists of pharmaceutical wholesale and pharmacies. In the pharmaceutical wholesaling sector, McKesson Europe has a market presence in 14 countries. It has a range of services for pharmacists on matters of health, medicines and wellness. An extensive distribution network of more than 134 branches provides deliveries to some 65,000 pharmacies and hospitals. Company structure The business is divided into two business areas: * In the Pharmacy Solutions division, McKesson Europe combines its wholesale activities with pharmaceutical products in nine European countries. More than 50,000 pharmacies and hospitals are supplied from 116 wholesale branches every day. Additional services for pharmacists are also provided, such as pharmacy cooperations and the provision of IT platforms. McKesson Europe also offers various services for suppliers, manufacturers and other companies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. * The Consumer Solutions division is aimed at patients and consumers and also includes activities in the areas of retail and mail-order pharmacies and home care.

History  =1835 - 1948= The chemist and paint business Gehe & Co. was founded on 1 May 1835 by Franz Ludwig Gehe in Dresden on K√∂nigstra√üe and opened to the capital market by converting it into a stock corporation on 1 January 1903. In January 1904, the shares were admitted to trading on the stock exchange in Dresden. In 1909, the company moved to the new location on Leipziger Stra√üe and the trading house in K√∂nigstra√üe was vacated. With capital increases in 1910 and 1912, the financial basis for the establishment and expansion of a German-wide distribution of \\"drugs and paints, pharmaceutical and chemical products\\" was created. In 1922, the company founded its first German branch in Stuttgart. After the Second World War, the parent company in Dresden and most of the branches were expropriated. Gehe & Co. AG made a fresh start in West Germany with branches in Stuttgart, Kassel and Sulzbach-Rosenberg. =1948 - 1981= The Gehe parent company continued to operate in 1947 in Dresden under the name Heilchemie as a publicly owned enterprise and on 1 April 1951 with the nationalised parent company of the pharmaceutical company Dr. Madaus & Co from Radebeul merged to form VEB Arzneimittelwerk Dresden. Haniel took over the majority of the Gehe & Co. AG shares with effect from 1 January 1973. The condition of Haniel was that the GEHE‚Äôs management remained in the company, in order to further expand the solid foundation that was established after the war. The name Gehe, known in the pre-war period, was brought to the attention of pharmacists with the revitalised or newly created branches. These branches were formed during the transition to Haniel: Bremen, Hamburg, Kassel, Kelkheim, Landshut, M√ºhldorf, Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg and Stuttgart. In 1973, the company achieved a turnover of DM 285 million. Other pharmaceutical wholesalers (Friedrich Sch√§fer GmbH, Weiterstadt and Kaiserslautern, Wilmaco GmbH, Hamm and Lieser Pharma-GmbH, Duisburg) were brought in to Gehe & Co. AG via the majority shareholder Franz Haniel & Cie. =1981 - 2008= In 1982, the Haniel Group acquired RUWA Rudloff & Watermann GmbH & Co. KG in Minden, a pharmaceutical wholesale company with a branch in Delmenhorst and integrated it into Gehe. In 1985, the Kaiser + Kraft Group, Stuttgart, a mail-order business for transport, storage, operational facilities and office equipment, was acquired. Until 1992, customers in Germany were supplied from the branches based in Hamburg, Berlin, Haan, Dresden, Stuttgart and Munich. In the following years, the group's trading structure spread across 14 countries in Europe and the USA. With the public offering of TAKKT on 15 September 1999, the spin-off of the Mail Order Division was ended. =From 2003= In April 2003, the company celebrated its 100th year. On the birthday of the conversion into a joint-stock company, the Annual General Meeting decided to change the name from Gehe AG to Celesio AG, with a majority of 99.98%. Today, the German subsidiary GEHE Pharma Handel still operates under its original name. In April 2007, Celesio announced the acquisition of 90% of the shares in the mail-order pharmacy DocMorris, in order to build up a pharmacy chain across Germany. The acquisition took place in hopes that the third-party ownership ban of the Pharmacies Act would fail, but it was legitimised in May 2009 by the EuGH. For the pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe, which was also part of the Celesio Group, the acquisition resulted in a loss of customers as pharmacists saw a threat in the chain. DocMorris was now operated as a franchise-like concept, in which pharmacists were allowed to use the DocMorris brand with the payment of a monthly licence fee. As a result, Celesio sold DocMorris in October 2012 to the company Zur Rose AG. In June 2009, it became known that Celesio had acquired the majority of the largest Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler, Panpharma. In April 2012, Panpharma was fully taken over. In February 2016, Celesio agreed to sell its Brazilian business, consisting of Panpharma and Oncoprod, to the holding of the Brazilian pharmaceutical wholesaler, SantaCruz. In September 2013, Celesio sold its subsidiary, Rudolf Spiegel GmbH, to the company WEPA Apothekenbedarf. On 24 October 2013, the US-based McKesson Corporation announced an agreement to acquire Celesio for EUR 6.1 billion (approx. EUR 23 per share). However, on 13 January 2014, the company reported that McKesson's acquisition of Celesio was unsuccessful, due to the 75% threshold not being reached. At the start of November 2013, the Elliot hedge fund acquired 12.68% of Celesio from Paul Singer, a well-known course of action by him to benefit from takeovers. Following McKesson's failed takeover, Singer increased his direct and indirect stake to around 32%. On 23 January 2014, Haniel took over the share from the Elliott hedge fund and served the 75.99% one day later to McKesson, which meant that the takeover was still a success. Sainsbury‚Äôs and Celesio announced the formation of a strategic pharmacy partnership in July 2013, in the course of which McKesson Europe's subsidiary LloydsPharmacy would acquire Sainsbury‚Äôs pharmacy business for GBP 125 million. Until 21 September 2015, the company's shares were listed in MDAX. The quotation in the index was removed, due to the change in the stock exchange segment from Prime Standard to the Regulated Unofficial Market. On 12 September 2017, Celesio was renamed McKesson Europe.

TM-2 was launched in February 1987, and it was first crewed spaceflight of the Soyuz-TM spacecraft, and the second crewed spaceflight to Mir (the first being Soyuz T-15). The crew of the long duration expedition, Mir EO-2, who were launched by TM-2 consisted of Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin. The spacecraft remained docked to Mir, functioning as a lifeboat for the EO-2 crew, until July 1987 when it returned to Earth carrying Laveykin and the two man crew of Mir EP-1. Romanenko later returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-3 at the end of EO-2.

The docking system, known as the \\"Igla system\\", was not behaving as expected. On April 5 the EO-2 crew retreated to the Soyuz TM-2 spacecraft so that they could escape in the event the module got out of control. About 200 m out, the docking system lost its lock on Mir's aft port antenna. The cosmonauts watched from within Soyuz TM-2 as the Kvant/ FSM combination passed within 10 m of the station. Following an emergency spacewalk, Kvant fully docked to the station on April 11.

Kubin is considered an important representative of Symbolism and Expressionism.  Biography  Kubin was born in Bohemia in the town of Leitmeritz, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Litomƒõ≈ôice). From 1892 to 1896, he was apprenticed to the landscape photographer Alois Beer, although he learned little. In 1896, he attempted suicide on his mother's grave, and his short stint in the Austrian army the following year ended with a nervous breakdown. In 1898, Kubin began a period of artistic study at a private academy run by the painter Ludwig Schmitt- Reutte, before enrolling at the Munich Academy in 1899, without finishing his studies there. In Munich, Kubin discovered the works of Odilon Redon, Edvard Munch, James Ensor, Henry de Groux, and F√©licien Rops. He was profoundly affected by the prints of Max Klinger, and later recounted: \\"Here a new art was thrown open to me, which offered free play for the imaginative expression of every conceivable world of feeling. Before putting the engravings away I swore that I would dedicate my life to the creation of similar works\\".Arnason & Wheeler 1986, p. 88. The aquatint technique used by Klinger and Goya influenced the style of his works of this period, which are mainly ink and wash drawings of fantastical, often macabre subjects. Kubin produced a small number of oil paintings in the years between 1902 and 1910, but thereafter his output consisted of pen and ink drawings, watercolors, and lithographs. In 1911, he became associated with the Blaue Reiter group, and exhibited with them in the Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin in 1913. After that time, he lost contact with the artistic avant-garde. Manor-House Zwickledt (Upper Austria): Last residence of Alfred Kubin. Kubin is considered an important representative of Symbolism and Expressionism and is noted for dark, spectral, symbolic fantasies, often assembled into thematic series of drawings. Like Oskar Kokoschka and Albert Paris G√ºtersloh, Kubin had both artistic and literary talent. He illustrated the works of Edgar Allan Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. Kubin also illustrated the German fantasy magazine Der Orchideengarten.Siegfried Sch√∂del, Studien zu den phantastischen Erz√§hlungen Gustav Meyrinks, Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, 1965, (p.27).Rosenberg, Karen. 15 October 2008. Mapping the Shadowy Corners of the Subconscious. The New York Times. Retrieved 3 April 2012. From 1906 until his death, he lived a withdrawn life in a Manor-House on a 12th-century estate in Zwickledt, Upper Austria. In 1938, at the Anschluss of Austria and Nazi Germany, his work was declared entartete Kunst or \\"degenerate art,\\"Karl-Heinz Meissner, Alfred Kubin, St√§dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus M√ºnchen, Edition Spangenberg, 1990 (p.114). but he managed to continue working during World War II.

The novel has an atmosphere of claustrophobic absurdity similar to the writings of Franz Kafka, who admired the book.Franz Rottensteiner,The Fantasy Book: An Illustrated History from Dracula to Tolkien (p. 143) Collier Books, 1978. The illustrations for the book were originally intended for The Golem by Gustav Meyrink, but as that book was delayed, Kubin instead worked his illustrations into his own novel.

Notably, McIntyre co-authored and co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Bill Jenkins (TN) titled, The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, otherwise known as the \\"tobacco buyout.\\" This legislation was the result of many years of work in an effort to relieve suffering tobacco farmers and after a long debate, this landmark legislation was signed into law as part of the American Jobs Creation Act in 2004. The tobacco buyout eliminated the quota and price support system that was in place and provided $10.1 billion in payments made over ten years to tobacco quota owners and growers for the elimination of their government created quotas. These payments, known as the Tobacco Transition Payment Program, allowed farmers to reduce debt and diversify or expand operations in tobacco and other farm enterprises such as vineyards. The last payment was made in January, 2014.

He worked closely with USDA Rural Development throughout his years in Congress to bring funding for town halls, public works facilities, day care centers, fire and rescue stations, police departments, courthouses, small businesses, housing assistance, health care facilities, hospitals and other public needs to southeastern North Carolina. McIntyre also worked on legislation to establish the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission which was signed into law as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. The purpose of the commission is to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth in the most distressed areas of the southeastern United States. The commission awards grants to areas in need to fund projects that meet the criteria for community betterment, including infrastructure, education and training, entrepreneurship, and leadership development. McIntyre was well known for his coordination of the annual North Carolina Business and Economic Summit in Washington, initially called \\"The Washington Perspective\\" and later called \\"Taking Care of Business\\", which attracted approximately 250 business, Chamber of Commerce and civic leaders annually in September.

Pate Award from the Cape Fear River Assembly; and was named Beach Preservationist of the Year by the Oak Island Beach Preservation Society. = Constituent Services = Constituent service was a top priority for McIntyre, and his work on behalf of constituents was considered first-rate by citizens who worked with him and his staff which handled constituent work in both the Washington and district offices. McIntyre placed a sign in the entry area of his office that stated: \\"This Office Belongs to the People of the Seventh Congressional District.\\" Helping a veteran obtain his or her medals earned during their service, assisting senior citizens with their social security or Medicare benefits, helping a citizen obtain a passport for travel, or personally welcoming constituents to the nation's capital, McIntyre's work and his staff's work were well-known. = Healthcare = During his time in office, McIntyre was a member and former co-chairman of the House Rural Health Care Coalition which advocates for advancing rural priorities in health care. Additionally, he was a member of several Congressional caucuses that worked to prevent disease and secure research funding including the Congressional Community Pharmacy Caucus, Congressional Diabetes Caucus, the House Cancer Caucus, the House Vision Caucus, and the Youth Sports Caucus.

Technological improvements affecting weather predictions, storm monitoring, agricultural production and global transportation have greatly affected our lives and helped our environment on earth. Fascination with the vastness of God's creation and the make-up of the universe is a never-ending discovery that always inspires us and advances our ingenuity and imagination and increases greatly our education in so many fields of learning and human endeavor. Indeed, there are no limits to space exploration and the discoveries made by the human spirit.\\" = Senior Citizens = McIntyre was recognized with a pair of boxing gloves from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare because of his advocacy work on behalf of senior citizens. He also received the M.V.P. Award for the entire Congress from the TREA Senior Citizens League in 2004 and later received the Seniors Advocate Award for his legislative leadership on behalf of seniors in 2012. = Youth Sports = Advocacy for youth sports was a priority during Mike McIntyre's congressional career. He coached youth sports in Robeson County for several years in T-ball, baseball, football, and basketball, including three All- American Drug-Free teams. McIntyre was the first volunteer coach in the county to be certified by the National Youth Sports Coaches Association and the first to qualify his teams for the All-American Drug-Free Team based on character development and drug education and awareness. He was a charter member of, and helped to incorporate, the Lumberton Youth Baseball Association, which has subsequently spawned several championship teams on the regional, state, and national levels. Congressman McIntyre is the Founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Youth Sports. Through cooperative efforts with the Citizenship through Sports Alliance, McIntyre and former NBA star Clark Kellogg, now a CBS Sports analyst and commentator, presented a National Report Card on the State of Youth Sports in 2005 at the National Press Club in Washington. Their goal was to draw attention to the need for greater respect, cooperation, discipline, and commitment to youth sports. Having introduced a Youth Sports Legislative Agenda, McIntyre has also hosted three regional youth sports conferences and has worked with the NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, NCAA, U.S. Soccer, U.S. Tennis and the U.S. Olympic Committee in promoting youth sports, fitness, and recreation nationally. Because of his commitment, Congressman McIntyre has been given several honors and recognitions. He was honored with the National Congressional Award in 2006 by the National Recreation and Park Association for his leadership in promoting youth sports and recreational programs. He was also recognized by the Positive Coaching Alliance for his promotion of teamwork, commitment, persistence, empathy, and leadership among young athletes. In 2008, he was named an International Sports Ethics Fellow by the Institute for International Sport in recognition of his leadership through positive example. His selection placed him among a unique group of sports celebrities such as Grant Hill, David Robinson, Mia Hamm, and Jeff Gordon. Congressman McIntyre continued to play sports and pursue a healthy lifestyle throughout his years in Congress. He played second base on the Congressional Baseball Team for a number of years, participated in Congressional Basketball and Football Games, as well as tennis, soccer and golf matches. These charitable events benefitted organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Literary Council, and efforts to fight breast cancer, prostate cancer, and homelessness. In 2012, he earned his black belt in Taekwondo from Grand Master Jhoon Rhee, an instructor of boxing champion Muhammad Ali and martial arts star Bruce Lee. Additionally, he earned the Presidential Champion Gold Award given under a tiered system designed to encourage physical activity and sponsored by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. = Notable Achievements =  Black History Celebrations & Recognitions  Congressman McIntyre had a strong relationship with the African-American community, and he was one of only two congressmen known to both host and sponsor his own event in recognition of Black History Month. Each year he would honor African-American elected officials from all levels of government throughout his district, and he would invite a colleague from the Congressional Black Caucus as his special guest of honor to come to southeastern North Carolina for the celebration, which regularly drew hundreds of attendees over the years. McIntyre also obtained appropriations for expansion of the African-American cultural center in Robeson County, where many of the celebrations were held. He was honored for his work by several African-American churches and communities through the years.  Lumbee Recognition Bills  McIntyre was a well-known champion of the fight for federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, which has its tribal headquarters in his home county of Robeson and is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River. Twice McIntyre successfully shepherded federal recognition bills through Congress, putting together a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, liberals, moderates and conservatives, after he personally lobbied his colleagues one-by-one. McIntyre argued that recognition for them was a matter of dignity and respect and would help the tribe with funding for education, health care and economic development. The House passed the bill he introduced in 2007 by a veto-proof margin (despite the Bush administration's opposition) of two-thirds of the House. The bill passed again in 2009 and was supported by the Obama administration. Both times, however, the Senate failed to bring the measure in that chamber to the floor for a vote.  Prayer Caucus Leadership  McIntyre was Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which had over 100 members. The caucus met regularly on the first night of each week that Congress was in session‚Äîjust across the hall from the House chamber to pray for wisdom for decisions to be made that week and to pray for constituents' needs in their communities back home. McIntyre also had the opportunity to serve as Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which is for current and former Members of Congress. This weekly breakfast is a time when these individuals get together to pray for each other and to hear testimony from a colleague in Congress. In this capacity, McIntyre has also spoken briefly at the National Prayer Breakfast, which has occurred every year with every President since Eisenhower. Nearly 3000 lay leaders, clergy, business leaders and other citizens join various world leaders, the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Pentagon, Senators, Members of Congress and other persons from the three branches of government, gathered in Washington for this event on the first Thursday in February. At the National Day of Prayer Ceremony on Capitol Hill, which occurs on the first Thursday in May in conjunction with the national celebration, McIntyre was invited twice to speak on behalf of the Legislative Branch of Government. In 2006 the Center for Christian Statesmanship selected him as the Distinguished Christian Statesman of the Year for \\"his character, leadership, integrity and faithfulness in public service.\\"  Scottish-American Relations  North Carolina's 7th district includes the largest number of Scottish-American descendants in the United States. McIntyre co-founded and co-chaired the Friends of Scotland caucus and was the original sponsor of the unanimously passed H.Res. 41 \\"Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as 'National Tartan Day' to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States.\\" In 2008, McIntyre came to the rescue for Scottish literature and poetry when it was discovered that the Library of Congress had made changes to its world renowned classification system, removing 40 headings and subheadings for Scottish writing and moving the body of work under the \\"English\\" classification heading. This move garnered concerns and protests from academics, writers, government ministers and many others. First Minister Alex Salmond called McIntyre about the matter while he was en route to Scotland on Armed Services business. The Washington Post noted that Linda Fabiani, the Minister of Culture in Edinburgh also lobbied McIntyre while he was visiting the country to see what he could do. Within the scope of a few phone calls, the changes were reversed by the Library of Congress and the Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, issued a letter to the National Library of Scotland. As a token of gratitude for McIntyre's leadership during his Congressional career, the Scottish Parliament passed a motion (S4M-10778) on December 8, 2014 at the First Minister's request, recognizing McIntyre's contributions to Scotland's relationship with the United States and congratulating him on his retirement from Congress.  Youth Initiatives and Volunteering in Schools  The Seventh Congressional District Annual Youth Leadership Summit, which McIntyre organized and hosted, has been heralded by educators, young people and their parents alike. McIntyre invited all public and private schools in his district to send an outstanding junior to a one-day seminar to discuss issues that affected their communities and also to propose ways in which to resolve them, encouraging the students to have a direct impact on their local communities. In addition, McIntyre was well known for his school volunteer work, which started when he first began his law career in 1981 when he organized the Robeson County Bar Association's Citizenship Education Committee. He continued throughout his congressional career to volunteer in the schools and has done so for over 35 years. From the Washington Workshops Foundation to the John C. Stennis Program for Congressional Interns on Capitol Hill, from elementary schools to graduate & professional schools, from hosting students in his office, to being invited as a freshman his first year in office to the Presidents' Summit for America's Future because of his long history of involvement in helping young people, McIntyre's work with youth and his inspirational speeches to school assemblies, in the classrooms and at events on Capitol Hill have reached thousands of students for more than three decades. He was recognized for his work with educators and youth prior to serving in Congress in 1989 with the Governor's Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service and during his congressional career with the North Carolina Parent ‚Äì Teachers' Association (PTA) bestowing upon him an honorary life membership. Political campaigns  Continuing Public Service in Private Practice  Upon his retirement from Congress, Mike McIntyre joined Poyner Spruill law firm in Raleigh, North Carolina as Senior Advisor and Director of Government Relations, concentrating on business and economic development, as well as working with a variety of clients on various government relations matters on the federal, state, regional, and local levels. In 2017, McIntyre worked with the North Carolina Bar Association to develop the Youth Leadership Challenge program which provides opportunities for civic engagement and community leadership to high school students. An earmarked contribution from McIntyre's congressional campaign fund for the North Carolina Bar Foundation Endowment made this initiative possible. Additionally, McIntyre assisted in establishing a new mentoring program through the UNC Christian Legal Society called, The McIntyre-Whichard Legal Fellows Program. Named in honor of McIntyre and former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Willis Whichard, the program pairs UNC law students with legal professionals in the community for a year-long mentorship which focuses on professional and spiritual growth. The inaugural class of McIntyre-Whichard Legal Fellows commenced during the 2016-2017 academic year. In June 2018, McIntyre was the recipient of The Chief Justice I. Beverly Lake Jr. Public Service Award given by the North Carolina Bar Association, honoring his commitment to public service throughout his life. The award recognizes an outstanding lawyer in North Carolina who has performed exemplary public service and is \\"reserved for those persons, families or organizations whose contributions are significant, whose conduct is consonant with the NCBA's and NCBF's stated mission and who are highly regarded by the legal community and the public.\\" For McIntyre's accomplishments and contributions to enhance UNC's School of Law and the profession more broadly, the UNC Law Alumni Association presented him with the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2019. The award ‚Äúrecognizes members of the UNC School of Law community who embody the law school‚Äôs mission to serve the legal profession, the people and institutions of North Carolina, the nation and the world with ethics and dedication to the cause of justice.‚Äù During the spring semester of 2019, McIntyre served as a Fellow with the UNC Institute of Politics (IOP). The program allows fellows to independently lead a series of non-credit seminars on relevant issues of national importance. The seminars are open to all UNC students. McIntyre's syllabus included topics such as leadership, civic engagement in the community, and public service through political involvement with an emphasis on recognizing the importance of the community in which one serves. McIntyre was also named an honoree for North Carolina Lawyers Weekly's 2019 \\"Leaders In Law\\" award and named \\"Lawyer of the Year\\" during the award ceremony held on October 25. The Leaders in Law program recognizes practicing legal professionals in the state of North Carolina who go above and beyond in their profession and community. Honorees are selected by a panel of independent legal professionals based on professional and personal accomplishment as well as community involvement. The Lawyer of the Year is presented to the honoree with the highest overall score from the judges. In 2020, McIntyre was selected to receive the Liberty Bell Award by the Young Lawyers Division of the North Carolina Bar Association for his \\"commitment to strengthening democracy and promoting civic engagement.\\" The award is given annually as part of Law Day to an \\"individual who has strengthened the American system of freedom under the law.\\" The North Carolina Bar Association celebrates Law Day on the first Friday in May, however events in 2020 were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis. Previous recipients of the Liberty Bell Award include twelve judges, five chief justices, a U.S. senator and two governors. On September 21, 2020, it was announced that McIntyre would join the Ward and Smith law firm as Senior Advisor for Government Relations and Economic Development. He will be based in the firm's Raleigh office and will work on behalf of clients across North Carolina and in Washington, D.C.

A Republican, he represented North Carolina's 10th Congressional district, centered in North Carolina's foothills, in the United States House of Representatives from 1986 to 2005. Biography Ballenger represented the 10th Congressional District of North Carolina from 1986 to 2005. He was also the founder and former Chairman of the Board of Plastic Packaging, Inc., a manufacturing company with plants in Hickory and Forest City, North Carolina. He also served in the North Carolina Senate (1977‚Äì86), the North Carolina House of Representatives (1975‚Äì77) and on the Catawba County Board of Commissioners (1966‚Äì74). In 38 consecutive years in elective office, serving at the local, state and federal levels, Ballenger never lost an election. He was a member of the Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as a Deputy Whip and as a member of the House Steering Committee. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the National Council on the Arts. During his time in the U.S. Congress, he was a renowned expert on business issues and foreign affairs, especially on issues dealing with Central and South America. Ballenger served on the Committee on Education and the Workforce and as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. During his Chairmanship, he authored legislation, which was later enacted, to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to make it less adversarial and more collaborative while still ensuring worker safety. It was the first major legislative revision to OSHA workplace rules since the agency was created. Other notable legislation Ballenger authored included a bill making the use of hypodermic needles safer for healthcare workers and a bill to designate Wilson Creek in Caldwell County, North Carolina, a Wild and Scenic River. He secured major funding for the completion of US321 between Hickory and Gastonia, North Carolina, and also established the Future Forward Economic Alliance, a regional economic development initiative serving 11 counties in Western North Carolina. Through Future Forward, Ballenger led the effort to secure funding to create the North Carolina Center for Engineering Technologies in Hickory, North Carolina. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Hickory Metro Higher Education Center (now the Appalachian State University Center at Hickory.) He also served on the International Relations Committee and as Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, where he worked to promote democracy and human rights, fight poverty and improve relations with developing countries in Central and South America. In 1990, he and his wife Donna founded the Ballenger Foundation to continue their longtime charitable work in Central America. They established several medical clinics in high-poverty locations, sponsored an orphanage, sent school furniture and textbooks and delivered loads of other relief supplies. Their efforts began after the devastating earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua, in 1972 and continued for decades thereafter. Ballenger prioritized constituent service in the U.S. House of Representatives. A Comprehensive Guide to Constituent Service, his benchmark publication, is still updated for each new Congress and used to train new congressional staff members. As a member of the North Carolina Senate and former Minority Leader, he introduced the government in the Sunshine Act of 1976, which was enacted into law. It was the first substantive Open Meetings law enacted in North Carolina. He also authored legislation, known as the Ridge Law, to protect scenic vistas in the North Carolina mountains. He was recognized as the Most Effective Republican Legislator by the North Carolina Institute of Government in 1981. Ballenger previously served as Chairman of the Catawba County, North Carolina, Board of Commissioners and was recognized as North Carolina's County Commissioner of the Year in 1974. Both Catawba Memorial Hospital (now Catawba Valley Medical Center) and Catawba Valley Community College (formerly Catawba Valley Technical Institute) were established during his two terms as a County Commissioner. He was at one time Chairman of the Catawba County Republican Party and also served on the Jim Martin for Governor Steering Committee; the North Carolina Reagan-Bush Campaign (Western Co-Chairman, 1984); and was a co-founder and former Chairman of the North Carolina Legislative Forum. He was active in many community organizations, including the Community Ridge Day Care Center in Hickory (co- founder); Greater Hickory United Fund (Chairman); Western Piedmont Council of Governments (Board Chairman); Greater Hickory Chamber of Commerce (Director); the North Carolina School of the Arts (Sustaining Member); the North Carolina Symphony (Patron) and the North Carolina Arts Society (Patron). He also served on the Board of Development and Board of Directors at Lenoir-Rhyne College; the Board of Directors for the Salvation Army and the Board of Trustees for the Florence Crittenton Home. After graduating from Episcopal High School, he attended the University of North Carolina and later received a liberal arts degree from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he was initiated into the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity. He served in the U.S. Naval Air Corps during World War II. He also volunteered as a Lay Reader for the Episcopal Diocese of Western North Carolina, traveling to lead services in parishes without rectors. He was a longtime active member of the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Hickory. Ballenger retired in 2004 and was succeeded by one-term Republican state representative Patrick T. McHenry. Ballenger died on February 18, 2015, aged 88.

The aircraft is capable of all basic training functions including aerobatics, instrument, tactical and night flying. The PC-7 was developed from the preceding Pilatus P-3, largely differing by the adoption of a turboprop engine, a bubble canopy, and a new one-piece wing. Introduced during the 1970s, it has since developed a sizable presence of the global trainer market.\\"Training - Bridging the gap.\\" Flight International, 10 July 2001. The type has been adopted by in excess of 20 air forces as their ab initio trainer, as well as multiple civilian operators. Over one million hours have reportedly been flown by PC-7s worldwide. In addition to training operations, some aircraft are armed and have been used for combat missions by several customers, including Chad, Iran, and Mexico, often in violation of the relevant export agreement between the customer and the Swiss government. An improved model of the aircraft, the PC-7 Mk II, was developed during the 1990s by combining the newer PC-9's airframe and avionics with the PC-7's smaller turbine engine. Reportedly, in excess of 500 PC-7s have been sold to various operators, the majority of which still being in service. In Pilatus' line-up, the PC-7 has been succeeded by the newer PC-9 and PC-21 trainers.\\"Elementary training role for PC-21?\\" Flight International, 14 August 2001. Development =Origins= Work on what would become the PC-7 commenced during the 1960s. It was based on the earlier piston-powered Pilatus P-3, the initial prototype being produced from the existing prototype P-3, principally differing by the substitution of its Lycoming O-435 engine with a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-20 turboprop powerplant. On 12 April 1966, the modified prototype performed its maiden flight. However, the PC-7 programme was abruptly shelved following an accident involving the aircraft.Air International September 1979, p. 112. The termination of work was reportedly driven by a lack of market interest.\\"Pilatus PC-7 Turbo Trainer.\\" Forecast International, September 1999. A PC-7 During 1973, it was decided to restart work on the programme; factors for its revival had included the 1973 oil crisis, the launch of the rival Beechcraft T-34C Turbo-Mentor, and the increasing age of existing trainer aircraft. To support the relaunch, another P-3 was obtained from the Swiss Air Force. After modifications, this aircraft first flew on 12 May 1975. Further extensive modifications followed later in the programme, including the adoption of a new one-piece wing complete with integral fuel tanks, along with an altered tailfin and a bubble canopy. The flight test programme came to a close during Autumn 1977. On 12 August 1978, the first production aircraft made its first flight. On 5 December of that year, Switzerland's Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) issued civil certification for the PC-7; immediately thereafter, initial deliveries of production aircraft commenced to customers Burma and Bolivia.Air International September 1979, p. 114. Over time, sales of the PC-7 generated considerable profits, allowing the company to finance the development of further types of aircraft.Wastnage, Justin. \\"Pilatus ponders additions to civilian aircraft offering.\\" Flight International, 26 February 2002. =Further development= The PC-7 Mk II is a development of the PC-9's airframe and avionics, which was powered by the PC-7's smaller turbine engine, which reportedly achieved lower operating and maintenance costs. This variant was developed at the behest of the South African Air Force (SAAF), who later adopted the type.Wastnage, Justin. \\"Peace dividend.\\" Flight International, 30 April 2002. A batch of 60 PC-7 MK IIs were locally assembled in South Africa using kits supplied by Pilatus for the SAAAF; due to political considerations, these aircraft were not fitted with the armament hardpoints. Deliveries to the SAAF took place between late 1994 and 1996. In addition to Pilatus' own improvement programmes, several third party companies have independently developed their own upgrades for customer's PC-7. During the late 1990s, Israeli engineering firm Radom began offering a kit of new avionics for the type, which included a new mission computer, a wide-angle head-up display, along with various replacement communications and weapons-delivery systems.\\"Radom offers PC-9 upgrade for training and combat.\\" Flight International, 25 November 1998. During July 1998, Pilatus announced that it has come to an agreement with American company Western Aircraft for the latter to act as a distributor for the PC-7 across the North American civil aviation market. At this time, there were already five civil-registered PC-7s in operation in North America; Pilatus believed that the region could be a viable market for both remanufactured and newly built examples of the type, which would be priced between $1 million and $2 million respectively. It was recognised that this market was limited, Western Aircraft expected to sell only a few aircraft per year.\\"Pilatus appoints Western to market PC-7 trainer.\\" Flight International, 22 July 1998. Operational history =General use= All export sales of the PC-7 are subject to approval by the Swiss Government, whose authorisation is required prior to any delivery taking place. The sale of combat-capable aircraft has been a controversial matter at times, and political pressure has been applied for PC-7s to be shipped without the fittings for armaments being installed. The Swiss government has occasionally held up or outright refused to issue export licences for some nations, a move which has reportedly lead to the loss of several potential sales, such as to South Korea and Mexico. A PC-7 in-flight, 2012 In addition to its adoption by numerous military customers, the PC-7 has also been used by private customers. It has been certified for civil use by both the FOCA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as compliant with regulations pertaining to general aviation operations in both Europe and the United States. Amongst its uses in the civilian sector has been aerobatic displays. During the 1990s, the PC-7 Mk II was adopted as the basic trainer of the Royal Brunei Air Force alongside the BAE Systems Hawk jet trainer; the acquisition was seen a key to its expanded operations with fixed-wing aircraft.\\"Brunei finalises MPA configuration.\\" Flight International, 18 October 1996.\\"Sultan of Brunei confirms Hawk deal.\\" Flight International, 12 March 1997. During June 2011, the Indian Air Force (IAF) selected the PC-7 MkII as its new basic trainer, signing a contract for an initial batch of 75 aircraft with an option for buying an additional 38 PC-7 MkIIs; the service had a total requirement of 181 trainers.Pilatus Press Release. \\"India Selects Pilatus Basic Trainer.\\" LiveFistDefence.com, 24 May 2012. Retrieved: 19 June 2011. The fast-tracked decision to procure a foreign aircraft over a domestically developed alternative proposed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was a controversial one; retired Air Marshal Anil Chopra argued that HAL had no viable design for the role and that the IAF could not have reasonably afforded the delay involved in the development of such an aircraft.Chopra, Anil. \\"Stuck at the basics of aircraft design.\\" Hindu Business Line, 7 October 2013. The procurement of an additional 106 trainers under the ‚ÄòMake & Buy (Indian) category was repeatedly deferred. In 2017, the maintenance agreement with Pilatus lapsed, resulting in the IAF becoming solely responsible for performing these activities.Raghuvanshi, Vivek. \\"Swiss Firm not expanding maintenance deal for India's PC-7 trainers.\\" defensenews.com, 20 July 2017. During 2018, India announced that it had chosen to exercise the option of buying a batch of 38 trainers. =Combat use= A number of PC-7s were employed by the Guatemalan Air Force in air strikes and for close air support (CAS) during the Guatemalan civil war, starting in 1982 until the end of the conflict in 1996. The PC-7s were typically deployed from the airfield in La Aurora, being armed with a mixture of gun pods and rocket pods. During the lengthy Iran‚ÄìIraq War of the 1980s, amid tensions between Iran and the United States, it is alleged that Iranian officials threatened to arm its PC-7 fleet with explosives and use them to launch suicide attacks against United States Navy vessels present in the Persian Gulf.Razoux 2015, pp. 421‚Äì422. Iran reportedly trained a number of suicide pilots and flew some operational missions, training was performed at Bushehr Air Base in Iran and overseas in North Korea.Bodansky 1993, p. 14.Cordesman and Wagner 1991, p. 285. In 1994, the Mexican Air Force used several armed PC-7s to attack units of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation during the Chiapas conflict in Mexico. This action was considered illegal by the Swiss government because the airplanes were sold for training purposes only, and as result, Switzerland issued a ban on the sale of additional units to Mexico.Aranda, Jes√∫s. \\"Ahora que la FAM pretende renovar su flota no puede adquirir aviones Pilatus C-9\\" (in Spanish). La Jornada. 13 November 2009. Retrieved: 9 November 2012. At the time, the Mexican Air Force was the largest single export operator of the type and had been seeking to acquire further PC-7s, thus the sales ban was viewed as an economic blow to Pilatus.\\"Government veto blocks PC-9 sale to Mexico.\\" Flight International, 8 February 1998. During the mid to late 1990s, Executive Outcomes, a private military contractor (PMC) led by Eeben Barlow, utilised three armed PC-7s (ex-Bophuthatswana Air Force aircraft) to provide close air support (CAS) during its operations in Sierra Leone.Barlow, Eeben. \\"Executive Outcomes: Against all Odds.\\" galago.co.

In December 2007, Taylor announced that he would not seek a rematch with Shuler in 2008.newsobserver.com  Taylor won't seek House seat in 2008 Positions Taylor was one of the most conservative members of the House. He had a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union. He was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative Republican congressmen. =Environment= Taylor was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, on the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations. Taylor served on the advisory board of the National Wilderness Institute, a \\"deceptively named\\" pro-timber group which worked to promote timber companies' private property rights and reduce environmental safeguards. =Spending= In 2005 and 2006, Taylor made national headlines for delaying full funding by the federal government for a $60 million memorial to United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. Taylor's preference was for federal funding to be lowered and supplemented by private donations. After pressure from a variety of people, including President George W. Bush, Taylor ended his opposition and allowed funding for the memorial; he had used his Appropriations subcommittee chairmanship to block the funding. At the time of his protest, private donors had only donated $7 million towards the cost, and Taylor feared that the government would be forced to come up with the other $53 million.Jonathan Weisman, \\"Lone Lawmaker Blocks Flight 93 Monument in Pa.\\", Washington Post, April 25, 2006 Taylor supported spending over $600 million for a road through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to settle a 1943 agreement with the federal government. Proponents of the road argue that if it were built, it would provide better access to ancestral cemeteries inside the park, as well as providing a tourist draw to the region. Critics call the project the \\"Road to Nowhere\\", and argue that if the road were built, it would cut through the largest roadless tract east of the Mississippi River; and prefer, instead, a cash settlement with the federal government. =Free trade= Taylor had been outspoken in his opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and other trade agreements that he argues would hurt his district, which has suffered from the closing of textile, furniture, and other plants when production has been moved abroad where labor costs are cheaper. However, he failed to register a vote during final approval of the agreement by the House, which passed 217‚Äì215. According to GOP aides, Taylor cast a no vote with a deactivated voting card. The glitch registered with the House Clerk's office, but Taylor had left the House floor and aides said attempts to locate him during the 62-minute vote were unsuccessful.\\"Tie Vote Avoided By Machine Malfunction And Day Trip\\" , Congressional Quarterly, July 28, 2005Joel Burgess, \\"Taylor explains absent nay vote\\" , Times-News, July 29, 2005 =Russian student exchange program= Taylor started exchange programs for Russian students and internships for aspiring bankers and entrepreneurs in 1994, at colleges in his district.Cory Reiss, \\"Rep.

When asked for a time line of when he thought American troops might pull out, Taylor estimated that a reduction in American forces should occur in 2006. But he said American troops could spend another two years in Iraq training the country's new army.Scott Parrott, \\"Hitting the issues\\" , Times-News, July 11, 2005 Taylor was one of a handful of Congressmen who have had children serve in Iraq.

Martin pleaded guilty in 2001. During the 2003 trial of attorney Thomas Jones, who handled the closing of the loans, Martin said that Taylor had first-hand knowledge of the loans. Cagle and Jones also said Taylor knew of the fraud. Taylor has refused to comment on the case. Congressional staff routinely said the fraud was bank business and referred questions to Blue Ridge President Dwayne Wiseman. Following the sentencing, Taylor press secretary Deborah Potter said Taylor still had no comment, and reviewed a statement by Wiseman: \\"For a number of years there has been an effort on the part of certain political opponents of Congressman Charles Taylor to slander him and Blue Ridge Savings Bank by indicating that neither he nor the bank or any present officers of the bank had any prior knowledge,\\" Wiseman said in the statement. \\"This went on for some nine years with the encouragement of the press. We would hope that the settlement of this case would put an end to such speculation.\\"Joel Burgess, \\"Taylor associates sentenced in case: Martin, Cagle get 2 years probation\\" , Times-News, January 28, 2005 Taylor was never targeted by authorities as having any involvement in helping Martin defraud Blue Ridge Savings Bank, which Taylor owned.\\"Lawyer: Taylor dodged inquiry\\" Published: Thu, Mar. 22, 2007 in Raleigh News and Observer =Russian investments= Starting in the mid-1990s, Charles Taylor began financing small businesses in and around Ivanovo, an industrial city of almost 500,000, about northeast of Moscow. In 2003, Taylor purchased the Commercial Bank of Ivanovo with a Russian partner, Boris Bolshakov, a former KGB colonel and Supreme Soviet deputy, and Bolshakov's wife Marina. Taylor owns 80 percent of the bank as well as Columbus, a Russian investment company. In December 2005, the Bank of Ivanovo opened a new four-story headquarters, its second office, in the city's downtown. Taylor said at the time that he didn't consider the bank to yet be particularly profitable. In mid-2006, Bolshakov said the bank's hard currency balance was more than $22 million and its loan portfolio was more than $18.6 million. One of the 2005 participants in the Russian student exchange program told Associated Press that she had a summer work-study internship at the Bank of Ivanovo after she returned to Russia. Taylor's office said that was a mistake because Institute policy forbids participants to work in \\"any business venture with which Congressman Taylor is associated.\\" The bank has since ended its participation in the work-study program, Taylor's office said. Bank of Ivanovo had its license revoked on April 5, 2019, by the Central Bank of Russia for regularly braking anti-money laundering regulations, misrepresenting the size of its provisions and using \\"schemes\\" to artificially inflate its capital, according to a central bank statement. =Cattle and tree farms= In 2000, Jackson County's tax collector asked the U.S. House of Representatives to garnish his wages to collect more than $3,583 in back taxes resulting from a dispute over parcels owned by Transylvania Tree Farms, a Taylor business. The county said that Taylor had failed to file a management plan for his property, despite repeated requests from the county, and so it could not be assessed at a lower rate through a forest land tax deferment. Taylor's attorney disputed the authority of the county to require such a plan.Lisa Majors-Duff, \\"County to garnish Taylor's salary to collect back taxes\\" , Sylvia Herald, May 25, 2000 In May 2006, Champion Cattle and Tree Farm, located in Transylvania County, was issued a notice of violation because rental property of the company had become a \\"public health nuisance.\\"John Boyle, \\"Congressman Taylor cited for trashy property in Transylvania County\\", Asheville Citizen-Times, May 18, 2006 Taylor owned on the North Carolina side of Sassafras Mountain, the highest point in South Carolina. In June 2010 it was announced he planned to sell the property to the Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy for $33 million. It had a market value of $63 million and the difference was considered a charitable gift for tax purposes. Most of the property was used to create Headwaters State Forest.

Apart from Dan Dare himself, he is the only character to appear in every one of the numerous versions of the comic strip that appeared in the Eagle, 2000 AD and Virgin Comics. In the 1950s, roughly every other story featured the Mekon. Description The Mekon was the ruler of the Treens of northern Venus, although he was ousted from this position at the end of the first story and had no fixed base of operations. He was created by scientific experimentation, engineered for a very high intelligence. As such he had a swollen head containing his massive brain and atrophied body, and moved around on a levitating chair. He typically invented new superweapons in the pursuit of his goal: the domination of the universe for the purpose of scientific research. In some stories he also sought personal revenge on Dan Dare. In the animated Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future television series (first aired in 2001), the animators took his nickname \\"Melonhead\\" literally and showed his cranium as not shiny smooth green but wrinkled like a cantaloupe. The voice of the Mekon was portrayed by Richard Pearce.  In popular culture  British politician Angus MaudeThe Hugo Young Papers: Thirty Years of British Politics ‚Äì Off the Record and Irish journalist Patrick Cosgrave were each nicknamed \\"The Mekon\\". British political strategist Dominic Cummings has also been nicknamed \\"The Mekon\\". In the \\"Genesis of A Classic\\" feature on the Doctor Who DVD release of Genesis of the Daleks, producer Philip Hinchcliffe cites the Mekon as one of his inspirations for the character Davros.David Butler, \\"Time and relative dissertations in space: critical perspectives on Doctor Who\\", Manchester University Press, 2007, , p.151 Elton John, in his \\"Rock of the Westies\\" album recorded in 1976, had a song called \\"Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)\\". One of the key repeated lines in the song is \\"Dan Dare doesn't know it, he doesn't know it, but I like the Mekon.\\" British rock band The Mekons named themselves after the character in 1977. In May 2013, the BBC radio soap opera The Archers featured a storyline in which regular character Brian Aldridge was aggrieved by a local newspaper article that compared him to the Mekon.

His grandfather, Joe Frost, was co-founder of Frost Brothers Department Store. In 1949, his family moved to Fort Worth, Texas where his father took a job with Convair Aircraft. In 1964, he graduated from the University of Missouri with a bachelor of journalism and a bachelor of arts in history. As a student, Frost was editor of The Maneater, is a brother of Zeta Beta Tau, and was tapped by Omicron Delta Kappa and QEBH.The Savitar, University of Missouri Yearbook (1964), p. 387, caption to image of Martin Frost. Retrieved from University of Missouri Digital Library 8 December 2011. After graduating, Frost worked as a newspaper reporter, including positions at The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware. He received his Juris Doctor degree from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1970. Following his graduation he worked as a law clerk for Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes of the Northern District of Texas, after which he practiced law in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In addition, Frost was a legal commentator on KERA-TV. Frost served in the United States Army Reserve from 1966 to 1972. Political career Frost ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House in 1974. He tried again successfully in 1978, becoming the first Jewish U.S. congressman from Texas. Frost was reelected 12 times without serious opposition. In 1980, he defeated an African American Republican opponent, Clay Smothers. On October 10, 2002, Martin Frost was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He served two terms as the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 1999 to 2003, the number three post in the Democrats' House leadership after the minority leader and minority whip. As Democratic Caucus Chair, Frost was often at odds with another prominent Dallas-area Congressman, Dick Armey, who was the Republican House Majority Leader. Due to term limits as Democratic Caucus Chair, Frost made a bid for Minority Leader after Dick Gephardt resigned in the wake of losing four seats in the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, but Frost dropped out of the race and supported eventual winner Nancy Pelosi. Frost was the ranking member of the House Rules Committee during his last term in the House. Due to his strong fundraising ability for fellow Democrats, and the fact that he led the 1991 redistricting in Texas, he was one of the targets of a controversial mid-decade redistricting engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. His district, which included portions of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, was redrawn to be much more Republican. Its portions of Fort Worth and Arlington were replaced with wealthier and more Republican territory around Dallas. While Al Gore won the old 24th fairly handily in 2000, the new 24th would have given George W. Bush a staggering 68 percent of the vote in that election. Moreover, Frost's home in Arlington was shifted into the heavily Republican 6th District, represented by 10-term incumbent Joe Barton. Frost decided to seek re-election in the newly redrawn 32nd District, which included a considerable amount of territory that he had represented from 1979 until 1993. He lost by 10 points to Republican Pete Sessions. Since Ralph Hall's party switch earlier in 2004, Frost had been the only white Democrat to represent a significant portion of the Metroplex. Retirement In 2005, Frost was a candidate for chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He dropped out of the race on February 1. On February 15, Frost was hired by Fox News as a political commentator. Frost is now an attorney at the Polsinelli law firmAttorney Bio and president of America Votes. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.https://www.issueone.org/reformers/#reformer-full-list In a July 2011 op- ed regarding the debt ceiling crisis, Frost wrote, \\"We now have a group of U.S. politicians seeking political purity, who seem to have much in common with the Taliban. They are tea party members.\\" Frost co-authored with Tom Davis, Richard E. Cohen, and David Eisenhower the 2014 book The Partisan Divide in which they attempt to explain the reasons behind an increasingly polarized U.S. Congress and offer possible solutions.

He was a Moderator and Convenor of the Church of Scotland and an unashamed scientific liberal reformer of anglicized evangelism across the Empire. He was the first overseas missionary of the Church of Scotland to India. On 13 July 1830 he founded the General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta, now known as the Scottish Church College. He also played a part in establishing the University of Calcutta. He was twice Moderator of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851 and 1873, the only person to serve the role twice. Early life Alexander Duff was born in the heart of Scotland, at Auchnahyle, in the parish of Moulin, Perthshire. His parents were James Duff, gardener and farmer at Auchnahagh, and Jean Rattray. After receiving his initial schooling at a local country school, he studied arts and theology at the University of St. Andrews.Emmott, D.H., \\"Alexander Duff and the Foundation of Modern Education in India\\", British Journal of Education Studies, Vol.13, No. 2 (1965): 167. He then accepted an offer made by the foreign mission committee of the Church of Scotland's general assembly to become their first missionary to India, and was ordained in August 1829. Mission in India After an adventurous voyage during which he was twice shipwrecked, Duff arrived in Calcutta on 27 May 1830. After inspecting the Bengali schools, he concluded that students were not receiving an adequate education in a broad range of subjects and secondly, that he would instruct his students using English instead of the local dialects. He at once identified himself with a policy which had far-reaching effects. Christian missions in India had been successful only in converting a few low-caste groups from a poor socio- economic background by giving them monetary benefits. The upper caste Hindu and Muslim communities had been practically untouched. Duff shrewdly assessed that these affluent communities could not be accessed by traditional evangelical methods. He recognised that holding out the prospect of upward mobility, by offering a western education, would bring the children of the affluent classes into his range of influence, which could then be extended to encompass religion. Duff devised the policy of an using western system of education to slowly convert Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. The success of his work had the effect: #of altering the policy of the government of India in matters of education; #of securing the recognition of education as a missionary agency by Christian churches at home; and, #of securing entrance for Christian ideas into the minds of high-caste Hindus. By teaching Biblical courses as well as courses in the physical sciences, Duff hoped that students would logically come to realize the contradictions and impracticality of Hinduism and embrace wholeheartedly the truth of Christianity. While a few students converted, Duff seems to have widely miscalculated the resilience of Hinduism as well as its ability to adapt itself to western knowledge. Whereas Duff and many of his fellow evangelists saw Christianity and Hinduism as diametrically opposed, Hindus did not generally consider the knowledge either tradition provided as mutually exclusive with the other.Emmott, D.H., 168 Education in English Duff opened a school in which all kinds of secular subjects were taught, from the rudiments upwards to a university standard, alongside the Bible. The English language was used as the medium of instruction on the grounds that it was the key to Western knowledge. Alexander Duff proposed a theory which he called the \\"downward filter theory\\" in which he believed that by catering to the middle and upper social classes, the knowledge of Christianity would eventually filter down the social ladder. Although he promoted the teaching of English in schools, he still viewed the vernacular as an important language for spreading Christianity among \\"the masses\\" but deemed it inferior to the English language because it was not progressive. Duff wrote a pamphlet on the question, entitled A New Era of the English Language and Literature in India. A government minute was adopted on 7 March 1835, to the effect that in higher education, the object of the British government in India should be the promotion of European science and literature among the natives of India, and that all funds appropriated for purposes of education would be best employed on English education alone. His views influenced Peter Percival, a pioneering educator, linguist and missionary who worked in Sri Lankan Tamil dominant Jaffna peninsula in Sri Lanka. Within the British Indian community of that era, there were not lacking those \\"Orientalists\\" who saw value in the traditional learning of India and wished to support and encourage it. They opposed Duff's policy of stringently disregarding the same while assiduously promoting the spread of western education, culture and religion. In 1839, Lord Auckland, the governor-general of India, yielded to them and adopted a policy which was a compromise between the two perspectives. Regardless, English became the tool through which Indians were able to understand and advance themselves through the British institutions of government. This opportunity to share in governance established one of the foundations on which eventual self-rule was built.Sangwan, Satpal., 85 The Institutes Shortly after landing in India in 1830, Duff opened his institution in a house located at upper Chitpur Road in the Jorasanko neighbourhood of Calcutta. The house was made available to him by Feringhi Kamal Bose, an affluent Hindu. The school soon began to expand into a missionary college, known as the General Assembly's Institution. The location was a source of controversy for the Missions Committee who wanted to remain at the heart of Bengali society in the city of Calcutta. In 1834, Duff returned to Britain broken in health. During this sojourn, He succeeded in securing the approval of his church for his educational plans, and in arousing much interest in the work of foreign missions. In 1836, the Calcutta institution was moved to Gorachand Bysack's house in the Garanhata neighbourhood. On 23 February 1837, Mr. MacFarlon, the Chief Magistrate of Calcutta, laid the foundation stone for a new building belonging to the mission itself. The building was designed by Mr. John Gray construction was superintended by Capt. John Thomson, both of the East India Company. The construction of the building was completed in 1839. Duff returned to India in 1840, by which time The Institution had expanded to 600 Indian pupils from five to nine years old. At the Disruption of 1843, Duff sided with the Free Church. He gave up the college buildings, with all their effects, and with unabated courage set to work to provide a new institution, which came to be known as the Free Church Institution. In 1857, when the University of Calcutta was established, the Free Church Institution was one of its earliest affiliates, and Duff would also serve in the university's first senate.A Tradition of Notable Firsts These two institutions founded by Duff, i.e., the General Assembly's Institution and the Free Church Institution would be merged in 1908 to form the Scottish Churches College. After the unification of the Church of Scotland in 1929, the institution would be known as Scottish Church College. He had the support of Sir James Outram and Sir Henry Lawrence, and the encouragement of seeing a new band of converts, including several young men born of high caste. In 1844, governor-general Viscount Hardinge opened government appointments to all who had studied in institutions similar to Duff's institution. In the same year, Duff co-founded the Calcutta Review, of which he served as editor from 1845 to 1849. Several important Indian figures were products of Duff's Institutions. Most notably, Rev. Lal Behari Dey, who wrote two books (Folk Tales of Bengal and Bengal Peasant Life) that were widely distributed among Indian schools, and Krishna Mohan Banerjee, who became registrar of Calcutta University .Edward Thompson and G.T. Garratt, Rise and Fulfillment of British Rule in India (1935): 310. Later years In 1849, Duff returned to Scotland. He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851, in succession to Very Rev Nathaniel Paterson. He gave evidence before various Indian committees of parliament on matters of education. This led to an important despatch by Viscount Halifax, president of the Board of Control, to governor-general the Marquess of Dalhousie, authorizing an educational advance in primary and secondary schools; the provision of technical and scientific teaching; and the establishment of schools for girls. In 1854, Duff visited the United States, where what is now New York University gave him the degree of L.L.D.; he was already D.D. of the University of Aberdeen. In 1856, Duff returned to India, where the mutiny broke out the following year; his descriptive letters written during this period were collected in a volume entitled The Indian Mutiny - its Causes and Results (1858). During this stint in India, Duff gave much thought and time to the University of Calcutta, which owes its examination system and the prominence given to physical sciences to his influence. In 1863, Sir Charles Trevelyan offered him the post of vice-chancellor of the University, but his health compelled him to leave India. As a memorial of his work, the Duff Hall was erected in the centre of the educational buildings of Calcutta. In 1864, Duff visited South Africa, and on his return, became convener of the foreign missions committee of the Free Church. In 1870 he was the principal force in founding the Anglo-Indian Christian Union (an alliance of Protestant churches to minister to scattered British communities in India), of which he became the first President, and sent Rev. John Fordyce to India as the Union's Commissioner there.The Scotsman, 31 October 1871; Berwickshire News & General Advertiser, 5 November 1872. He raised money to endow a missionary chair at New College, Edinburgh, and himself became first professor. Among other missionary labors of his later years, he helped the Free Church mission on Lake Nyassa, travelled to Syria to inspect a mission at Lebanon, and assisted Lady Aberdeen and Lord Polwarth to establish the Gordon Memorial Mission in Natal. In 1873, the Free Church was threatened with a schism owing to negotiations for union with the United Presbyterian Church. Duff was called to the chair, and guided the church through this crisis. He also took part in forming the alliance of Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian system. Alexander Duff died in Sidmouth, Devon England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007 on 12 February 1878. He is buried with his wife, Ann Scott Drysdale, in the north-east section of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh. By his will, he devoted his personal property to found a lectureship on foreign missions at New College (now part of the University of Edinburgh) on the model of the Bampton Lectures. Friendships and Other Achievements The Calcutta University by Francis Frith. Duff's foundation of 1857 Logo of Calcutta University - a very British institution founded for the education of Indians By the age of thirty he was already a remarkable preacher. Joining the Church Missionary Society in 1836 he was and his friend Rev Dr James Lewis were shapers of the new Church of Scotland Mission. Of his many Scottish friends, Dr Robert Hall was a leading academic, a powerful orator, with a large retentive memory whose impulsive liberalism formed his early beliefs. They helped him publish a pamphlet English Education in India which formed part of his address to the General Assembly of the Kirk in Edinburgh in 1837, which he dedicated to the students of the four ancient universities. A passionate advocate of reform he banished corporal punishments for girls, striving to Christianise education through humane methods of teaching. In seeking out W.H.Pearce for a new Baptist mission, he emphasised the inter-denominational character of united prayer events. He was unassuming, modest, pious, and quite uninterested in the politics of popery and anti-papism. Yet only the Episcopalians remained beyond his reach with their broad brush Quarterly publications. Despite the perceived handicap he could influence serious political figures in the Indian civil Service through the media of Calcutta Review. In one article he made an advancement in liberal theology exposing the cruelty of Female Infanticide in Central and Western India (1844). And in the same year his power in the Free Church was rehearsed in a lecture to The Free Churchmen of Calcutta in the Masonic Hall. Its title \\"The Sole and Supreme Headship of the Lord Jesus Christ over His Own Church, or a voice from the Ganges relative to the courses which led to the recent disruption...\\" symbolised his conviction in the supremacy of Christianity to bring enlightened education to Indians. Two Bengali intellectuals travelled to Edinburgh to be baptised at Duff's request. Mahendra Lal Bazak and Khailai Chandra Mukherjya were closely watched by Dr Thomas Chalmers, a renowned writer and church leader. Dr. Chalmers death in 1847 was a real blow to the Free Church; and to Duff, his pupil and then successor as professor. It forced Duff to deny his scottishness to maintain a life dedicated to working in India, he refused the principalship in 1874. Duff knew him well in the cultural capital of Scotland pursuing moral, material and spiritual development while steering his charges away from the temptations of Heathenism. During 1845-6 he conducted numerous Indian conversions with typical missionary zeal. Exhibiting a strong sense of Scottish character he personified individual freedoms baptizing Jewish refugees, overcoming prejudice, and persisting in the face of prohibitive rules among the Hindu caste system. A tireless campaigner, and restless traveller from Calcutta to Ceylon he visited thousands of missionaries and their stations. A profound sense of duty was monitored by legal correctness of his own opinions, that never ceased to improve. Deeply rooted in the doctrine of justification by faith alone he mixed doctrinal worship with regular business committees to raise money for the church. Eloquent, he recalled the poems of Ossian as closely as he expounded the values of liberal Zionsim. Richly endowed by a Jacobite tradition that informed a fierce feeling of injustice. On being appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1851 he was asked by Lord Granville to testify to the House of Lords in which he hoped to influence the Wood's Educational Despatch of 1854. Disappointed by the slow progress of change, he embarked on a trip to America. At Washington DC Dr Duff addressed the Congress. In Toronto he gave a sermon to Kroom's Church. On his last day he preached at the Broadway Tabernacle where he received benediction. Hugely popular, he was bade farewell by weeping crowds from the Hudson River wharves on 13 May 1854. Back in England he was met by Lord Haddo, son of Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen. After sipping the Malvern Spa waters for a cure, he decided on a Grand Tour of Europe and the Holy Land with his friend Dr Lumsden. Legacy and influence Duff Church 03 Alexander Duff was incredibly influential in Indian education and government and set several precedents. Almost as soon as he arrived his evangelising changed Indian education: in 1832 another scot, John Wilson (Scottish missionary) established a school in Bombay. Duff's methods were widely imitated and his cumulative twenty-five years in the subcontinent were largely characterized by the establishment of western-style educational institutions warmly received by Ram Mohan Roy. Duff can be credited with creating a framework that influenced educational policy and practice during the nineteenth century and beyond. Since his schools catered mostly to the Hindu middle class, he was able to receive attention from the government which helped to spread his methods and ideas. Several other English schools were established because the General Assemblies Institution was so successful. The success and influence of Duff's college led to the founding of the Calcutta Medical College. Hindu scriptures forbid people of higher castes from touching dead bodies, which prevented medical students from performing cadaver dissections. Students from Duff's college expressed that their liberal, English education had \\"freed their minds from prejudice and the dissection of the human body was not objectionable to them.\\"Emmott, D.H., \\"Alexander Duff and the Foundation of Modern Education in India\\", British Journal of Education Studies, Vol.13, No. 2 (1965): 164 This new idea allowed higher caste Indians to pursue medical professions, therefore advancing healthcare in India. The top-down theory of education described above typifies Duff's evangelical elitism, one of the main elements of his legacy in the subcontinent. Duff seems to have believed that there was a direct relationship between education and missionary work. Not only was the education of the Indian people critical to his goal of dispelling \\"Hindu ignorance\\" but it was in fact the duty of evangelicals to modernize and instruct Indian society using Western ideals and texts. While Duff was a highly skilled scholar who was devoted to India, his evangelist ideals and western prejudice may have influenced his students in ways that he did not anticipate. Instead of initiating a mass conversion to Christianity he may have instead provided another catalyst for Hindu reform movements.Emmott, D.H., 169 Duff hoped that through a western education in a time of enlightenment, Indians would be able to see the flaws in their religion and be compelled to convert to Christianity, but he did not consider the resilience of the Hindu religion and his efforts proved to be fairly unsuccessful on the broader scale.Emmott, 168. Educations of the Christian bible was accepted by Hindus because they were confident in their own religion and were not worried that their children would lose their faith. Hinduism was not only a religion but a culture, and the occupation of the British and their ideas was not drastic enough to change this. Because Alexander Duff was regarded well, his character served as a model to his students and friends and his teaching did eventually lead to some reformist movements within Hinduism. In fact, Duff's work led to the acceptance of more Indians into public official positions in government. This experience was critical to the transitional Indian government after Independence in 1947. A Church was established in 1848 and named as Duff Church in 1910 in memory of Alexander Duff.

Moore (November 16, 1939 ‚Äì March 21, 2019) was the 1973 recipient (with Larry Breed and Richard Lathwell) of the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was given: \\"For their work in the design and implementation of APL\\\\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.\\" Moore was a cofounder of I. P. Sharp Associates and held a senior position in the company for many years. Before this, he contributed to the SUBALGOL compiler at Stanford University and wrote the ALGOL 60 compiler for the Ferranti-Packard 6000 and the ICT 1900. Along with his work on the programming language APL, he was also instrumental in the development of IPSANET, a private packet switching data network. At Stanford University Roger D. Moore was born in Redlands, California. Before graduation, he worked as an operator of the Burroughs 220 computer at Stanford. During this time he provided some support for Larry Breed‚Äôs card stunt system. He also spent time studying the Burroughs 220 BALGOL compiler. This resulted in BUTTERFLY which was described by George Forsythe: > Each grader program was written as a BALGOL-language procedure. It was then > compiled together with a procedure called BUTTERFLY, written by Moore. The > result was a relocatable machine-language procedure, with a mechanism for > equating its variables to variables of any BALGOL program, in just the form > of the BALGOL compiler‚Äôs own machine-language library procedures (SIN, > WRITE, READ, etc). Forsythe anticipated a problem as described by Bob Braden: > BALGOL at Stanford outlived the B220 hardware. In 1962 Stanford contracted > with IBM to obtain an IBM 7090 for campus computing. This created great > consternation in Forsythe‚Äôs office. A significant body of faculty and > students was now familiar with BALGOL, and the high compiling speed of the > BAC was vital in an academic environment. To subject this community to the > production-oriented system software offered by IBM, including a slow Fortran > compiler and cumbersome operating system, would have moved academic > computing at Stanford backward by several years. To address this problem, in December 1961, Moore was hired by Forsythe to work on the SUBALGOL compiler for the IBM 7090. Braden and Breed were hired soon afterward. After completion of SUBALGOL, he was hired by Ferranti-Packard to write an ALGOL 60 compiler for the FP6000. This compiler was part of the software package which are included in the sale of the FP6000 to International Computers and Tabulators. At I. P. Sharp Associates In December 1964 most employees of Ferranti-Packard's computer group were laid off. Along with six other former FP employees he formed I. P. Sharp Associates. He was vice- president from incorporation to his retirement in 1989. In 1966 he, Larry Breed and Richard Lathwell began work on the APL\\\\360 interpreter. Lastly, APL\\\\360 owes much of its superior time-sharing performance to Roger D. Moore, of I.P. Sharp Associates, Toronto, who was principally responsible for the supervisor. Its design has not been described to the extent it deserves. This team received the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was given: \\"For their work in the design and implementation of APL\\\\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.\\" In 1970, Moore became project leader of IPSA's speculative DOS/360 COBOL compiler project.https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/conference/dyalog16/presentations/L03_Zoo_Story.pdf Although the compiler had satisfactory performance, the market did not accept it. IPSA offered APL time-sharing service starting in 1969. By 1975, the inflexibility and communication error intolerance of time-division multiplexing were no longer tolerable. He became the chief architect of the IPSANET packet switching computer network. In 1976 this system was deployed in North America and London. In 1984, IPSA released Sharp APL for the IBM PC. This package included a 370 emulator written by Moore. Retirement After retiring from IPSA in early 1989, he became interested in opera and chamber music. Along with attending many performances, he has supported concerts, commissions and advanced music education.

RAF Tangmere was a Royal Air Force station located in Tangmere, England, famous for its role in the Battle of Britain. The famous Second World War aces Wing Commander Douglas Bader, and the then inexperienced Johnnie Johnson were stationed at Tangmere in 1941. History =First World War= The aerodrome was founded in 1917 for use by the Royal Flying Corps as a training base. In 1918 it was turned over to the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) as a training ground, and continued as such until the end of the Great War in November of that year, after which the airfield was mothballed. In 1925 the station re-opened to serve the RAF's Fleet Air Arm, and went operational in 1926 with No. 43 Squadron equipped with biplane Gloster Gamecocks (there is a row of houses located near the museum entrance called Gamecock Terrace). =Second World War= As war threatened in the late 1930s, the fighter aircraft based at Tangmere became faster, with Hawker Furies, Gloster Gladiators, and Hawker Hurricanes all being used. In 1939 the airfield was enlarged to defend the south coast against attack by the Luftwaffe, with Tangmere's only hotel and some houses being demolished in the process. The RAF commandeered the majority of houses in the centre of the village, with only six to eight families being allowed to stay. The village would not resume its status as a civilian community until 1966. A line of Supermarine Spitfire Mark VBs of No. 131 Squadron RAF, being prepared for a sweep at Merston, a satellite airfield of Tangmere In August 1940 the first squadron (No. 602 Squadron RAF) of Supermarine Spitfires was based at the satellite airfield at nearby Westhampnett, as the Battle of Britain began. By now the villagers had mainly been evacuated, and extensive ranges of RAF buildings had sprung up. The first, and worst, enemy raid on the station came on 16 August 1940 when hundreds of Stuka dive bombers and fighters crossed the English coast and attacked Tangmere. There was extensive damage to buildings and aircraft on the ground and 14 ground staff and six civilians were killed. However the station was kept in service and brought back into full operation. Throughout the war, the station was used by the Royal Air Force Special Duty Service when 161 (Special Duty) Squadron's Lysander flight came down to do their insertion and pick-up operations into occupied Europe. The SOE used Tangmere Cottage, opposite the main entrance to the base to house and receive their agents. Today the cottage sports a commemorative plaque to its former secret life. Later in the war, as the RAF turned from defence to attack, Group Captain Douglas Bader, the legless fighter ace, commanded the Tangmere wing of Fighter Command. Today he is commemorated by a plaque outside the former Bader Arms public house, now a Co-operative Food outlet in the village. 616 Squadron, which included Johnnie Johnson and Hugh Dundas, arrived at Tangmere in late February 1941.Sarkar, Dilip.

Many of those killed at the base, from both sides in conflict, are buried in the cemetery at St Andrews Church, Tangmere, today tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. American RAF pilot Billy Fiske who died at Tangmere in 1940 was one of the first American aviators to die during the Second World War. =Postwar= After the war, the RAF High Speed Flight was based at Tangmere as part of Central Fighter Establishment. In September 1946, a world air speed record of 616 mph (991 km/h) was set by Group Captain Edward \\"Teddy\\" Mortlock Donaldson in a Gloster Meteor; after his death in 1992, he was buried in St Andrews Church. In September 1953, Squadron Leader Neville Duke became holder of the world air speed record when he flew a Hawker Hunter at 727 mph (1,170 km/h) ‚Äì the 50th anniversary of this event was commemorated in 2003. No 38 Group Tactical Communications Wing RAF and 244 Signal Squadron (Air Support) were the last units to leave the base, relocating to RAF Benson. On 1 June 1950, a Gloster Meteor flying eastwards over Portsmouth reported a UFO at 20,000 ft. It is also seen by the radar at RAF Wartling, and was described as Britain's first flying saucer, and led to the Flying Saucer Working Party later that year.A Need to Know: UFOs, the Military and Intelligence, Timothy Good In the late 1950s the flying was restricted to ground radar calibration and the Joint Services Language School moved there. In 1960 the station was granted the \\"Freedom of Chichester\\" and the event was marked by a march through the town and service in the Cathedral. Some of the last flying units to be based at the station included:http://rafweb.org *No. 245 Squadron RAF (25 August 1958 ‚Äì 19 April 1963) (Canberra B.2, disbanded by renumbering to No. 98 Squadron, 19 April 1963). *No. 98 Squadron RAF (19 April - 1 October 1963) (moved to RAF Watton) *No. 115 Squadron RAF (25 August 1958 ‚Äì 1 October 1963) *'B' Flt, No. 22 Squadron RAF (June 1961 - May 1964) In 1963-64 the last flying units left. However the station continued to be used for several years and, in 1968, Prince Charles took his first flying lesson at Tangmere. The station finally closed on 16 October 1970; a single Spitfire flew over the airfield as the RAF ensign was hauled down.  Present use  Following the closure of the RAF station, some of the land around the runways was returned to farming. Tangmere Airfield Nurseries have built large glasshouses for the cultivation of peppers and aubergines. RAF Tangmere Control Tower in 2009 Until 1983 of barracks, admin blocks and repair workshops remained derelict until bought by Seawards Properties Ltd. Housing soon spread around the airfield, and most RAF buildings were demolished. Officers' quarters have been retained as homes and a two original RAF buildings remain, the grade II listed Control Tower, and one of the ‚ÄòH Block‚Äô accommodation buildings. The majority of the airfield is now farmed, and since 1979 the runways have slowly been removed thus returning the whole airfield back to large scale farming once again. In 2016 the final piece of apron and the three T.2 hangars were removed, with houses built in their place on a street called Hangar Drive. The derelict control tower forms part of the farm but is now bricked up and partly overgrown. It became a grade II listed building as of 2011 and was placed on the heritage at risk register in 2015. A campaign is currently underway to restore the control tower which has received local and national press coverage. This is being led by Tangmere Tower Community Interest Company, who restaged 'The Eisenhower Dinner' at the Chichester Harbour Hotel in 2019 to mark the 75th anniversary of General Eisenhower's original meal in 1944. The CIC are working with the local Aviation Museum, the University of Chichester and Sussex Police and with their architect have submitted a planning application for phase one of the project. =Tangmere Military Aviation Museum= Tangmere Air Museum, February 1995 Tangmere Military Aviation Museum was founded by a group of enthusiastic veterans. It has a replica Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane as well as many original aircraft, including Neville Duke's speed record Hawker Hunter. On display is the 'Star' Meteor flown by Teddy Donaldson when he set the World Air Speed Record in September 1946, breaking the 1,000 km/h barrier.Thomas, Nick.

Some groups also advocate for some form of redress from the United States for the 1893 overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani, and for what is described as a prolonged military occupation beginning with the 1898 annexation. The movement generally views both the overthrow and annexation as illegal.\\"The Rape of Paradise: The Second Century Hawai'ians Grope Toward Sovereignty As The U.S. President Apologizes\\" , Perceptions Magazine, March/April 1996, p. 18‚Äì25 Palmyra Island and the Stewart Islands were annexed by the Kingdom in the 1860s and are regarded by the movement as being under illegal occupation along with the Hawaiian Islands. The Apology Resolution passed by the United States Congress in 1993 acknowledged that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 was an illegal act. Sovereignty advocates have attributed problems plaguing native communities including homelessness, poverty, economic marginalization, and the erosion of native traditions to the lack of native governance and political self-determination. They have pursued their agenda through educational initiatives and legislative actions. Along with protests throughout the islands, at the capitol (Honolulu) itself as well as the places and locations held as sacred to Hawaiian culture, sovereignty activists have challenged United States forces and law.  History  Coinciding with other 1960s and 1970s indigenous activist movements, the Hawaiian sovereignty movement was spearheaded by Native Hawaiian activist organizations and individuals who were critical of issues affecting modern Hawaii, including urbanization and commercial development of the islands, corruption in the Hawaiian Homelands program, and the appropriation of native burial grounds and other sacred spaces.Parker, Linda S. \\"Alaska, Hawaii, and Agreements.\\" Treaties with American Indians: An Encyclopedia of Rights, Conflicts, and Sovereignty, edited by Donald L. Fixico, vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, 2008, pp. 195‚Äì208. Gale Virtual Reference Library During the 1980s, the movement gained cultural and political traction and native resistance grew in response to urbanization and native disenfranchisement. Local and federal legislation provided some protection for native communities but did little to quell expanding commercial development. In 1993, a joint congressional resolution apologized for the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, and said that the overthrow was illegal. In 2010, the Akaka Bill passed, which provided a process for US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians and gave ethnic Hawaiians some control over land and natural resource negotiations. However, the bill was opposed by sovereignty groups because of its provisions that legitimized illegal land transfers, and was criticized by a 2006 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report (which was later reversed in 2018) for the effect it would have on non-ethnic Hawaiian populations.Beary, Brian. \\"Hawaiians (United States).\\" Separatist Movements: A Global Reference, CQ Press, 2011, pp. 96‚Äì99. A 2005 Grassroot Institute poll found the majority of Hawaiian residents opposed the Akaka Bill.  Background  The ancestors of Native Hawaiians may have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands around 350CE, from other areas of Polynesia. By the time Captain Cook arrived, Hawaii had a well- established culture with a population estimated to be between 400,000 and 900,000 people. Starting in 1795 and completed by 1810, Kamehameha I conquered the entire archipelago and formed the unified Kingdom of Hawaii. In the first one hundred years of contact with Western civilization, due to disease and war, the Hawaiian population dropped by ninety percent, to only 53,900 people in 1876. American missionaries would arrive in 1820 and assume great power and influence. Despite formal recognition of the Kingdom of Hawaii by the United States and other world powers, the kingdom was overthrown beginning January 17, 1893, with a coup d'√©tat orchestrated by, mostly, Americans within the kingdom's legislature, with aid from the United States military. The Blount Report is the popular name given to the part of the 1893 United States House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee Report regarding the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The report was conducted by U.S. Commissioner James H. Blount, appointed by U.S. President Grover Cleveland to investigate the events surrounding the January 1893 coup. This report provides the first evidence that officially identifies the United States' complicity in the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii.Ball, Milner S. \\"Symposium: Native American Law,\\" Georgia Law Review 28 (1979): 303 Blount concluded that U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens had, in fact, carried out unauthorized partisan activities that included the landing of U.S. Marines under a false or exaggerated pretext to support anti-royalist conspirators; the report went on to find that these actions were instrumental to the success of the revolution and that the revolution was carried out against the wishes of a majority of the population of the Hawaiian Kingdom and/or its Royalty.Tate, Merze. (1965). The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom: A Political History. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 235. Native Hawaiians, activists and supporters commemorate January 17 annually. On December 14, 1893, Albert Willis arrived unannounced in Honolulu aboard the USRC Corwin, bringing with him an anticipation of an American invasion in order to restore the monarchy, which became known as the Black Week. Willis was the successor to James Blount as United States Minister to Hawaii. With the hysteria of a military assault, he staged a mock invasion with the USS Adams and USS Philadelphia, directing their guns toward the capital. He also ordered rear admiral John Irwin to organize a landing operation using troops on the two American ships, which were joined by the Japanese Naniwa and the British HMS Champion. On January 11, 1894, Willis revealed the invasion to be a hoax.Report Committee Foreign Relations, United States Senate, Accompanying Testimony, Executive Documents transmitted Congress January 1, 1893, March 10, 1891, p 2144History of later years of the Hawaiian Monarchy and the revolution of 1893 By William De Witt Alexander, p 103 After the arrival of the Corwin, the provisional government and citizens of Hawaii were ready to rush to arms if necessary, but it was widely believed that Willis' threat of force was a bluff. On December 16, the British Minister to Hawaii was given permission to land marines from HMS Champion for the protection of British interests; the ship's captain predicted that the Queen and Sovereign ruler (Liliuokalani) would be restored by the U.S. military. In a November 1893 meeting with Willis, Liliuokalani indicated that she wanted the revolutionaries punished and their property confiscated, despite Willis' desire for her to grant amnesty to her enemies. In a December 19, 1893, meeting with the leaders of the provisional government, Willis presented a letter written by Liliuokalani, in which she agreed to grant amnesty to the revolutionaries if she was restored as queen. During the conference, Willis told the provisional government to surrender to Liliuokalani and allow Hawaii to return to its previous condition, but the leader of the provisional government, President Sanford Dole, refused to comply with his demands, claiming that he was not subject to the authority of the United States. The Blount Report was followed in 1894 by the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's report by concluding that all participants except for Queen Lili'uokalani were \\"not guilty\\". U.S. Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham announced on January 10, 1894, that the settlement of the situation in Hawaii would be left up to Congress, following Willis' unsatisfactory progress. Cleveland said that Willis had carried out the letter of his directions, rather than their spirit. Domestic response to Willis' and Cleveland's efforts was largely negative. The New York Herald wrote, \\"If Minister Willis has not already been ordered to quit meddling in Hawaiian affairs and mind his own business, no time should be lost in giving him emphatic instructions to that effect.\\" The Democratic New York World wrote: \\"Is it not high time to stop the business of interference with the domestic affairs of foreign nations? Hawaii is 2000 miles from our nearest coast. Let it alone.\\" The Democratic New York Sun said: \\"Mr. Cleveland lacks ... the first essential qualification of a referee or arbitrator.\\" The Republican New York Tribune called Willis' trip a \\"forlorn and humiliating failure to carry out Mr. Cleveland's outrageous project.\\" The Republican New York Recorder wrote, \\"The idea of sending out a minister accredited to the President of a new republic, having him present his credentials to that President and address him as 'Great and Good Friend,' and then deliberately set to work to organize a conspiracy to overthrow his Government and re- establish the authority of the deposed Queen, is repugnant to every man who holds American honor and justice in any sort of respect.\\" The Democratic New York Times was one of the few New York newspapers that defended Cleveland's decisions, saying that \\"Mr. Willis discharged his duty as he understood it.\\" Following the overthrow, in 1894 the Provisional Government of Hawaii became the Republic of Hawaii, and in 1898 the Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the United States in the Newlands Resolution, becoming the Territory of Hawaii. The territory was then given a territorial government in an Organic Act in 1900. While there was much opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and many attempts to restore the kingdom, it became a territory of the US in 1898, without any input from Native Hawaiians. Hawaii became a US state on March 18, 1959, following a referendum in which at least 93% of voters approved of statehood. By then, most voters were not Native Hawaiian. The 1959 referendum did not have an option for independence from the United States. Following Hawaii's admission as a state, the United Nations removed Hawaii from its list of non-self-governing territories (a list of territories that are subject to the decolonization process). The US constitution recognizes Native American tribes as domestic, dependent nations with inherent rights of self-determination through the US government as a trust responsibility, which was extended to include Eskimos, Aleuts and Native Alaskans with the passing of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Through enactment of 183 federal laws over 90 years, the US has entered into an implicit‚Äîrather than explicit‚Äîtrust relationship that does not give formal recognition of a sovereign people having the right of self-determination. Without an explicit law, Native Hawaiians may not be eligible for entitlements, funds and benefits afforded to other US indigenous peoples. Native Hawaiians are recognized by the US government through legislation with a unique status. Proposals have been made to treat Native Hawaiians as a tribe similar to Native Americans; opponents to the tribal approach argue that it is not a legitimate path to nationhood. = Historical groups = Members of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I in 2012. * Royal Order of Kamehameha I :The Royal Order of Kamehameha I is a Knightly Order established by His Majesty, Kamehameha V (Lot Kapuaiwa Kalanikapuapaikalaninui Ali'iolani Kalanimakua) in 1865, to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawai'i. Established by the 1864 Constitution, the Order of Kamehameha I is the first order of its kind in Hawaii. After Lot KapuƒÅiwa took the throne as King Kamehameha V, he established, by special decree, the Order of Kamehameha I on April 11, 1865, named to honor his grandfather Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the House of Kamehameha. Its purpose is to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Until the reign of Kalakaua, this would be the only Order instituted. :The Royal Order of Kamehameha I continues its work in observance and preservation of some native Hawaiian rituals and customs established by the leaders of the Kingdom of Hawai'i. It is often consulted by the U.S. government, State of Hawai'i and the various county governments of Hawai'i in native Hawaiian-sensitive rites performed at state functions. * Hui KƒÅlai'ƒÅina :This organization existed before the overthrow to support a new constitution and was based in Honolulu, Oahu. * Hui Hawaii Aloha 'ƒÄina :A highly organized group formed in 1883 from the various islands with a name that reflected Hawaiian cultural beliefs. * Liberal Patriotic Association :The Liberal Patriotic Association was a rebel group formed by Robert William Wilcox, to overturn the Bayonet Constitution. The faction was financed by Chinese businessmen who lost rights under the 1887 Constitution. The movement initiated what became known as the Wilcox Rebellion of 1889, ending in failure with seven dead and 70 captured. Opposition to the overthrow and annexation included Hui Aloha 'ƒÄina or the Hawaiian Patriotic League. * Home Rule Party of Hawaii :Following the annexation of Hawaii, Wilcox formed the Home Rule Party of Hawaii on June 6, 1900. The Party was generally more radical than the Democratic Party of Hawaii. They were able to dominate the Territorial Legislature between 1900 and 1902. But due to their radical and extreme philosophy of Hawaiian nationalism, infighting was prominent. This, in addition to their refusal to work with other parties, meant that they were unable to pass any legislation. Following the election of 1902 they steadily declined until they disbanded in 1912. * Democratic Party of Hawaii :The Democratic Party of Hawaii was established April 30, 1900, by John H. Wilson, John S. McGrew, Charles J. McCarthy, David KawƒÅnanakoa and Delbert Metzger. The Party was generally more pragmatic than the radical Home Rule Party, which included gaining sponsorship from the American Democratic Party. They attempted to bring representation to Native Hawaiians in the territorial government and effectively lobbied to set aside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 for Hawaiians.  Sovereignty and cultural rights organizations  = ALOHA = The Aboriginal Lands of Hawaiian Ancestry (ALOHA) and the Principality of Aloha were organized sometime in the late 1960s or '70s when the Native Alaskan and American Indian activism was beginning. Native Hawaiians began organizing groups based on their own national interests such as ceded lands, free education, reparations payments, free housing, reform of the Hawaiian Homelands Act and development within the islands. According to Budnick, the group was established by Louisa Rice in 1969. Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell claims that it was organized in the summer of 1972. ALOHA sought reparations for Native Hawaiians by hiring a former US congressman to write a bill that, while not ratified, did spawn a congressional study. The study was only allowed six months and was accused of relying on biased information from a historian hired by the territorial government that overthrew the kingdom as well as US Navy historians. The commission assigned to the study recommended against reparations. = Ka LƒÅhui = Ka LƒÅhui Hawai'i was formed in 1987 as a local grassroots initiative for Hawaiian sovereignty. Mililani Trask was the first leader of the organization. Trask was elected the first kia'aina (governor) of Ka Lahui. The organization has a constitution, elected offices and representatives for each island. The group supports US Federal recognition and its independence from the United States and supports inclusion of Native Hawaiians in federal Indian policy. The organization is considered the largest sovereignty movement group, claiming a membership of 21,000 in 1997. One of its goals is to reclaim ceded lands. In 1993, the group led 10,000 people on a march to the Iolani Palace on the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani. Ka LƒÅhui and many sovereignty groups oppose the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 (known as the \\"Akaka Bill\\") proposed by Senator Daniel Akaka that begins the process of federal recognition of a Native Hawaiian government, where the US State Department would have government-to-government relations with the US. The group believes that there are concerns with the process and version of the bill. Although Ka LƒÅhui may oppose the Akaka Bill, its founding member, Mililani Trask, supported the original Akaka Bill and was a member of a group that crafted the original bill. Trask has been critical of the bill's 20-year limitation on all claims against the US, stating: \\"We would not be able to address the illegal overthrow, address the breach of trust issues.\\" and \\"We're looking at a terrible history.... That history needs to be remedied.\\" = Ka PƒÅkaukau = Kekuni Blaisdell, leader of the organization, is a medical doctor and Founding Chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of Hawai'i John Burns School of Medicine, who advocates for the independence of Hawaii. The group began in the late 1980s as the PƒÅ Kaukau coalition along with Blaisdell and others to supply information that could support the sovereignty and independence movement. Blaisdell and the 12 groups that comprise the Ka PƒÅkaukau, believe in a \\"nation-within-a-nation\\" concept as a start forward to independence and are willing to negotiate with the President of the United States as \\"representatives of our nation as co- equals.\\" In 1993, Blaisdell convened Ka Ho'okolokolonui Kanaka Maoli, the \\"People's International Tribunal\\", which brought indigenous leaders from around the world to Hawaii to put the U.S. Government on trial for the theft of Hawaii's sovereignty, and other related violations of international law. The tribunal found the U.S. guilty, and published its findings in a lengthy document filed with the U.N. Committees on Human Rights and Indigenous Affairs. = Nation of Hawai'i = The Nation of Hawai'i is the oldest Hawaiian independence organization. It is headed by Dennis Pu ªuhonua \\"Bumpy\\" Kanahele, who is the group's spokesperson and Head of State. In contrast to other independence organizations which lean to the restoration of the monarchy, it advocates a republican government. In 1989 the group occupied the area surrounding the Makapu ªu lighthouse on O ªahu. In 1993 its members occupied Kaupo Beach, near Makapu ªu. Kanahele was a primary leader of the occupation, and was the leader of the group overall. Dennis Pu ªuhonua Kanahele is a descendant of Kamehameha I, eleven generations removed and is the spokesperson for the organization and the \\"Head of State\\" of the Nation of Hawai ªi. The group ceased their occupation in exchange for the return of ceded lands in the adjacent community of WaimƒÅnalo, where they established a village, cultural center, and pu ªuhonua (place of refuge). Kanahele made headlines again in 1995 when his group gave sanctuary to Nathan Brown, a Native Hawaiian activist who had refused to pay federal taxes in protest against the US presence in Hawaii. Kanahele was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to eight months in federal prison, along with a probation period in which he was barred from the pu ªuhonua and from participation in his sovereignty efforts. In 2015, Bumpy portrayed himself in the movie Aloha filmed on location in Hawaii at Pu ªuhonua o Waimanalo. This was followed by a 2017 episode of Hawaii Five-0 entitled \\"Ka Laina Ma Ke One (Line in the Sand)\\". = Nou Ke Akua Ke Aupuni O Hawai ªi ‚Äì The Kingdom of Hawai ªi = Edmund Keli ªi Silva Jr., who many in Hawaii recognize as king, announced a $2.5bn (¬£1.6bn) plan to reorganize and restore the Kingdom of Hawai ªi and published the Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii on October 27, 2003. According to Eugene Bai of Russia Direct, In late September 2015 at the Moscow President Hotel in Russia, a 2 million rubles conference was organized by a Kremlin endowment for military-patriotic activities set up by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The conference was for separatist movements around the world including Northern Ireland's nationalist republican party. Four days before the conference, Lanny Sinkin, representing an \\"Independent Sovereign State of Hawaii\\" and Edmund Keli ªi Silva Jr. received his invitation and funding for the trip to Moscow. He and the Hawaiian contingency were well received. = Mauna Kea Anaina Hou = Kealoha Pisciotta is a former systems specialist for the joint British-Dutch-Canadian telescope, who became concerned that a stone family shrine she had built for her grandmother and family, years earlier, had been removed and found at a dump. She is one of several people who sued to stop the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope and is also director of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou (\\"People who pray for the mountain\\",) and its sister group, Mauna Kea Hui, are indigenous, Native Hawaiian, cultural groups with environmental concerns located in the state of Hawaii. The group is described as \\"Native Hawaiian organization cultural and lineal descendants, and traditional, spiritual and religious practitioners of the sacred traditions of Mauna Kea.\\" The issue of cultural rights on the mountain was the focus of the documentary: Mauna Kea ‚Äî Temple Under Siege which aired on PBS in 2006 and featured Kealoha Pisciotta. The Hawaii State Constitution guarantees the religious and cultural rights of Native Hawaiians. Many of the state of Hawaii's laws can be traced back to Kingdom of Hawaii law. Hawai ªi Revised Statute ¬ß 1-1 codifies Hawaiian custom and gives deference to native traditions. In the early 1970s, managers of Mauna Kea did not seem to pay much attention to complaints of Native Hawaiians about the sacred nature of the mountain. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, the Royal Order of Kamehameha I and the Sierra Club, united their opposition to the Keck's proposal of adding six addition outrigger telescopes. = Poka Laenui = Hayden Burgess, an attorney who goes by the Hawaiian name Poka Laenui, heads the Institute for the Advancement of Hawaiian Affairs. Laenui argues that because of the four international treaties with the United States government (1826, 1849, 1875, and 1883) the \\"U.S. armed invasion and overthrow\\" of the Hawaiian monarchy, a \\"friendly government,\\" was illegal in both American and international jurisprudence. = Protect Kahoolawe Ohana (PKO) = Aerial view of Kahoolawe, Molokini, and the Makena side of Maui In 1976, Walter Ritte and the group Protect Kahoolawe Ohana (PKO) filed suit in U.S. Federal Court to stop the Navy's use of Kahoolawe for bombardment training, to require compliance with a number of new environmental laws and to ensure protection of cultural resources on the island. In 1977, the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii allowed the Navy's use of this island to continue, but the Court directed the Navy to prepare an environmental impact statement and to complete an inventory of historic sites on the island. The effort to regain Kaho ªolawe from the U.S. Navy inspired a new political awareness and activism within the Hawaiian community. Charles Maxwell and other community leaders began to plan a coordinated effort to land on the island, which was still under Navy control. The effort for the \\"first landing\\" began in Waikapu (Maui) on January 5, 1976. Over 50 people from across the Hawaiian islands, including a range of cultural leaders, gathered on Maui with the goal of \\"invading\\" Kahoolawe on January 6, 1976. The date was selected because of its association with the United States' bicentennial anniversary. As the larger group headed towards the island, they were intercepted by military crafts. \\"The Kaho ªolawe Nine\\" continued and successfully landed on the island. They were Ritte, Emmett Aluli, George Helm, Gail Kawaipuna Prejean, Stephen K. Morse, Kimo Aluli, Aunty Ellen Miles, Ian Lind, and Karla Villalba of the Puyallup/Muckleshoot tribe (Washington State). The effort to retake Kaho ªolawe would eventually claims the lives of George Helm and Kimo Mitchell. In an effort to reach Kaho ªolawe, Helm and Mitchell (who were also accompanied by Billy Mitchell, no relation) ran into severe weather and were unable to reach the island. Despite extensive rescue and recovery efforts, they were never recovered. Ritte became a leader in the Hawaiian community, coordinating community efforts including for water rights, opposition to land development, and the protection of marine animals and ocean resources. He now leads the effort to create state legislation requiring the labeling of genetically-modified organisms in Hawai ªi. = Hawaiian Kingdom = David Keanu Sai and Kamana Beamer are two Hawaiian scholars whose works use international law to argue for the rights of a Hawaiian Kingdom existing today and call for an end to US occupation of the islands. Trained as a U.S. military officer, Sai uses the title of Chairman of the Acting Council of Regency of the Hawaiian Kingdom organization. Sai has done extensive historical research, especially on the treaties between Hawaii and other nations, and on military occupation and the laws of war. Dr. Keanu Sai teaches Hawaiian Studies at Windward Community College. Sai claimed to represent the Hawaiian Kingdom in a case, Larsen v. Hawaiian Kingdom, brought before the World Court's Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague in the Netherlands in December 2000. Although the arbitration was agreed to by Lance Paul Larsen and David Keanu Sai, with Larsen suing Sai for not protecting his rights as a Hawaiian Kingdom subject, his actual goal was to have U.S. rule in Hawaii declared in breach of mutual treaty obligations and international law. The arbiters of the case affirmed that there was no dispute they could decide upon, because the United States was not a party to the arbitration. As stated in the award from the arbitration panel, \\"in the absence of the United States of America, the Tribunal can neither decide that Hawaii is not part of the USA, nor proceed on the assumption that it is not. To take either course would be to disregard a principle which goes to heart of the arbitral function in international law.\\" In an arbitration hearing before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in December 2000, the Hawaiian flag was raised at the same height at and alongside other countries. However, the court accepts arbitration from private entities and a hearing before the court does not equal international recognition. = Hawaiian Kingdom Government = About 70 members of one separatist group, called \\"Hawaiian Kingdom Government\\", and claiming roughly 1,000 members in 2008, chained the gates and blocked the entrance to Iolani Palace for about two hours, disrupting tours on April 30, 2008. The incident ended without violence or arrests. Led by Mahealani Kahau, who has taken the title of \\"Queen\\", and Jessica Wright, who has taken the title of \\"Princess\\", they have been meeting each day to conduct government business and demand sovereignty for Hawaii and the restoration of the monarchy. They negotiated rights to be on the lawn of the grounds during regular hours normally open to the public by applying for a public-assembly permit. Kahau said that \\"protest\\" and \\"sovereignty group\\" mischaracterize the group, but that it is a seat of government.

Act 200 amended Act 359 establishing the Hawai ªi Sovereignty Elections Council\\". Those that were involved with the Advisory Committee forums believed that the question of the political status for Native Hawaiians has become a difficult issue to deal with. However, in 2000 a panel of the committee stated that Native Hawaiians have maintained a unique community. Federal and state programs have been designated to improve conditions for Native Hawaiians, including health, educational, employment and training, children's services, conservation programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural programs, and native language immersion programs. The Hawaiian Homes Commission (HHC) was created by Congress in 1921. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) was the result of a 1978 amendment to the Hawai ªi State Constitution and controls over a billion dollars from the Ceded Lands Trust, spending millions to address the needs of Native Hawaiians. Mahealani Kamau ªu, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation states that only in the last 25 years that Native Hawaiians \\"had a modicum of political empowerment and been able to exercise direct responsibility for their own affairs, that progress has been made in so many areas\\". These programs have opposition and critics that believe they are not effective and managed badly. = The Apology Bill and the Akaka Bill = In the past decades, the growing frustration of Native Hawaiians over Hawaiian homelands as well as the 100-year anniversary of the overthrow, pushed the Hawaiian sovereignty movement to the forefront of politics in Hawaii. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the United States Public Law 103-150, known as the \\"Apology Bill\\", for US involvement in the 1893 overthrow. The bill offers a commitment towards reconciliation. US census information shows there were approximately 401,162 Native Hawaiians living within the United States in the year 2000. Sixty percent live in the continental US with forty percent living in the state of Hawaii. Between 1990 and 2000, those people identifying as Native Hawaiian had grown by 90,000 additional people, while the number of those identifying as pure Hawaiian had declined to under 10,000. Senator Daniel Akaka sponsored a bill in 2009 entitled The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 (S1011/HR2314) which would create the legal framework for establishing a Hawaiian government. The bill was supported by US President Barack Obama. Even though the bill is considered a reconciliation process, it has not had that effect but has instead been the subject of much controversy and political fighting from many arenas. American opponents argue that congress is disregarding US citizens for special interests and sovereignty activists believe this will further erode their rights as the 1921 blood quantum rule of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act had done. In 2011, a governor-appointed committee began to gather and verify names of Native Hawaiians for the purpose of voting on a Native Hawaiian nation. In June 2014, the US Department of the Interior announced plans to hold hearings to establish the possibility of federal recognition of Native Hawaiians as an Indian tribe. = Opposition = There has also been opposition against the concept of ancestry-based sovereignty, which critics maintain is tantamount to racial exclusion. In 1996, in Rice v. Cayetano, one Big Island rancher sued to win the right to vote in OHA elections, asserting that every Hawaiian citizen regardless of racial background should be able to vote for a state office, and that limiting the vote to only Native Hawaiians was racist. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favor and OHA elections are now open to all registered voters. In reaching its decision, the court wrote that \\"the ancestral inquiry mandated by the State is forbidden by the Fifteenth Amendment for the further reason that the use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order democratic elections seek to preserve....Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality\\". = Proposed United States federal recognition of Native Hawaiians = The year of hearings found most speakers with strong opposition to the United States government's involvement in the Hawaiian sovereignty issue, with opponents believing that tribal recognition of Native Hawaiians is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood, and that the United States government should not be involved in re-establishing Hawaiian sovereignty. On September 29, 2015, the United States Department of the Interior announced a procedure to recognize a Native Hawaiian government. The Native Hawaiian Roll Commission was created to find and register Native Hawaiians. The nine member commission with the needed expertise for verifying Native Hawaiian ancestry has prepared a roll of registered individuals of Hawaiian heritage. The nonprofit organization, Na ªi Aupuni will organize the constitutional convention and election of delegates using the roll which began collecting names in 2011. Kelii Akina, Chief Executive Officer of the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, filed suit to see the names on the roll and won, finding serious flaws. The Native Hawaiian Roll Commission has since purged the list of names of deceased persons as well as those whose address or e-mails could not be verified. Akina again filed suit to stop the election because funding of the project comes from a grant from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and citing a United States Supreme Court case prohibiting the states from conducting race-based elections. In October 2015, a federal judge declined to stop the process from proceeding. The case was appealed with a formal emergency request to stop the voting until the appeal was heard but the request was denied. On November 24, the emergency request was made again to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. November 27, Justice Kennedy stopped the election tallying or naming of any delegates. In the United States Supreme Court case, Rice v. Cayetano, Kennedy wrote, \\"Ancestry can be a proxy for race\\". The decision did not stop the voting itself, and a spokesman for the Na ªi Aupuni continued to encourage those eligible to vote before the end of the set deadline of November 30, 2015. The election was expected to have a cost of about $150,000, and voting was carried out by Elections America, a firm based in Washington D.C. The constitutional convention itself has an estimated cost of $2.6 million.

From 1993 through 2005, McCarty played with the Minnesota Twins (1993‚Äì1995), San Francisco Giants (1995‚Äì1996), Seattle Mariners (1998), Kansas City Royals (2000‚Äì2002), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2002), Oakland Athletics (2003) and Boston Red Sox (2003‚Äì2005). He batted right-handed and threw left-handed. Career McCarty attended Stanford University, and in 1989 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted by the Twins in the 1st round (3rd overall) of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft. In an eleven- season career, he was a .242 hitter with 36 home runs and 175 RBI in 630 games. A utility player in the purest sense, McCarty was a defensive first baseman and outfielder who occasionally was called upon to pitch. His most productive season came in 2000 for the Royals, when he posted career-highs in batting average (.278), home runs (12), RBI (68), runs (34), hits (75), doubles (14) and games played (103). McCarty, who was released by the Boston Red Sox in May 2005 after the team signed first baseman, John Olerud, refused a minor league assignment. He retired and was a Red Sox analyst on NESN from July 1, 2005 until the end of the 2008 season. McCarty was an oddity in MLB in that he batted right-handed and threw left-handed, and was a position player as opposed to a pitcher. =Pitching= McCarty made three pitching appearances for the Red Sox in 2004. The first was during the April 9 home opener against the Toronto Blue Jays. The second was in the June 12 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in which he struck out Jayson Werth and finally, in the final game of the season, McCarty went 2 scoreless innings against the Baltimore Orioles in which he struck out Rafael Palmeiro, Larry Bigbie and David Newhan.

He became the first Russian count in 1706. His children included Pyotr Sheremetev and Natalia Sheremeteva. Early life In his youth, Sheremetyev was a page to Tsar Alexis I before starting his military career. From 1671 he served at the imperial court. In 1681 he was a leader at Tambov, commanding the armies fighting the Crimean Khanate, and from 1682 he was a boyar. From 1685 to 1687 he participated in negotiations and the conclusion of the \\"Eternal Peace of 1686\\" with Poland and the allied treaty with Austria. From the end of 1687 he commanded the armies in Belgorod defending Russia's southern border, and participated in the Crimean campaigns. After Peter I gained power in 1689, he joined him as a fellow campaigner. He participated along with Mazepa in the war against Turkey during the 1690s. During the Azov campaigns in 1695-96 he commanded armies on the Dnieper River in actions against the Crimean Tatars. In 1697-99 he carried out diplomatic assignments in Poland, Austria, Italy and Malta. In 1698, czar Peter sent a delegation to Malta under Sheremetyev to observe the training and abilities of the Knights of Malta and their fleet. Sheremetyev also investigated the possibility of future joint ventures with the Knights, including action against the Turks and the possibility of a future Russian naval base. Great Northern War Decisive Russian victory at Poltava 1709 During the Great Northern War (1700-1721) Sheremetev proved a capable but cautious and sluggish military leader. For much of the war he served as the commander-in-chief and most senior officer in the Russian army. Sheremetev was very cautious in his movements but proved more effective than the younger Prince Menshikov, the second-in-command, whose impulsiveness did not always lead to success. In 1700 he joined the Russian army in its attack on Narva at the outbreak of the Great Northern War, but King Charles XII of Sweden drove him back from his position in Estonia. He then became commander of the Russian forces fighting the Swedish armies in the Baltic provinces. Colonel W. A. Schlippenbach defeated Sheremetev at Rauge in September 1701, but the Russians turned the tables on Schlippenbach (now a Major-General) at Erastfer in December 1701. This victory won Sheremetev the title of field marshal, and another Russian victory ensued at the battle of Hummelshof in July 1702. Sheremetev's army's attack on Marienburg (August 1702) led to Martha Skavronskaya coming to the tsar's court, where she eventually became Empress Catherine I (reigned 1725-1727). Sheremetev took the Swedish Ingrian fortresses of N√∂teborg (October 1702) and Nyenskans (1 May 1703) (allowing the foundation of the city of Saint Petersburg later in May 1703)) and the important Baltic cities Dorpat and Narva in 1704. In 1705 Peter I sent him to Astrakhan, where he forcefully and successfully repressed the Cossack Astrakhan revolt of 1707-1708. In the course of the Great Northern War, Sheremetev clashed with the Swedish general Lewenhaupt, who beat him at Gem√§uerthof in July 1705, and Charles XII, who defeated him at Holowczyn (July 1708). Sheremetev's revenge came at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, where he functioned as the senior Russian commander of the forces which soundly defeated the Swedish army. Armies under his command conquered Riga in 1710. Sheremetev then led the main forces of the army against the Ottomans in the Prut campaign of 1710-1711. Fighting against Turkey in 1711, he suffered encirclement at the Battle of StƒÉnile≈üti on the Prut (July 1711). In 1715-17 Sheremetev commanded armies in Pomerania and in Mecklenburg. Although sympathetic to Peter I's policy of Westernising Russia, Sheremetev never became close to the tsar. He died in 1719 in Moscow; Peter I had him buried in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg.

The character is usually depicted as a foe of Thor and Thunderstrike. This character first appeared in Thor (1st series) #449, though she did not adopt her name and appearance until #450. The name also applies to the axe used by this character. Bloodaxe's identity was initially a mystery; all early panels of the character's alter ego were depicted as being concealed by shadow or as a silhouette. Due to the sheer muscular mass of Bloodaxe (a direct result of the Asgardian magic within the axe), it was also impossible to determine whether the mortal alias was even male or female. Many supporting cast members of Thunderstrike were hinted at being Bloodaxe but many of those clues would later turn out to be red herrings to conceal 'his' true identity. It was only after Bloodaxe was defeated that the mortal alias was revealed to be Jackie Lukus, a confidant and love interest of Thunderstrike's alias Eric Masterson.Thunderstrike #22 Fictional character biography A figure in shadow found the axe once wielded by Skurge the Executioner, and in picking it up was transformed by its magic into a superhuman being.Thor #449 This new being then went into action as Bloodaxe, battling the police and slaying drug dealers.Thor #451 Bloodaxe first fought Thor when the mortal Eric Masterson was using the identity of Thor.Thor #452 Bloodaxe then battled Doctor Strange, and encountered Susan Austin.Thor #455 He then fought Code: Blue and Earth Force.Thor #456 When the real Thor returned, Masterson became Thunderstrike and fought Bloodaxe again. Bloodaxe first encountered Thunderstrike when she arrived to kill a low-level villain called Carjack and his gang.Thunderstrike #1 Thunderstrike thwarted Bloodaxe and took custody of the axe.Thunderstrike #22 Thunderstrike later defeated Bloodaxe and succumbed to the axe's will in an attempt to obtain more power to defeat an even more powerful villain, Set the Serpent God of Death.Thunderstrike #22-23 After Set was destroyed, Thunderstrike was possessed by the axe's murderous curse. As no-one was able to stop his rampage, Masterson chose to sacrifice himself in order to destroy the Bloodaxe forever.Thunderstrike #24 The axe was then re-introduced during Dan Jurgens' Thor run, where it was used by Thor in conjunction with Mjolnir. Thor later destroyed it with the Odinforce after he felt the curse beginning to work on him. Powers and abilities By wielding the Executioner's enchanted Asgardian axe, its wielder is transformed into the superhuman Bloodaxe, increasing the wielder's size and mass while flooding the body with magical energy. Bloodaxe was endowed with superhuman strength, speed, durability, reflexes, and endurance by enchantments on the axe. The evil that remained within the axe also takes partial possession of the wielder's mind, warping its personality and making it murderously aggressive, overpowering its rationality with a lust for combat, vengeance, and bloodshed. Bloodaxe was invulnerable to conventional firearms, and incendiary or ballistic devices. Bloodaxe's double-bladed axe was mystically enchanted and virtually indestructible, and can be used to deflect bullets. Thanks to enchantments from the Enchantress, the axe had the magical ability to create dimensional rifts. It could be used to teleport to places the wielder has previously been, project fire or ice energy, concussive bolts of Asgardian mystical force, and hurricane winds. However, if the user was separated from the axe for more than 60 seconds, they would lose their enchanted form and revert to their original mortal identity, much like the enchantment once placed on Mjolnir by Odin. Other versions =Bloodaxe 2099= Bloodaxe was also a name taken by a minor Spider-Man 2099 villain, who also called himself Bloodmace, Bloodsword and Bloodhammer, depending on what kind of weapon he was holding at the time.

Raghad can be seen the 3rd from top right carrying a child. Raghad Saddam Hussein (; born 2 September 1968) is the eldest daughter of Saddam Hussein, the former president of Iraq.  Biography  Raghad Hussein was married in 1983 to Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a high-profile Iraqi defector who shared weapons secrets with UNSCOM, the CIA and MI6. Al-Majid was killed, along with his brother, by fellow-clan members, who declared them traitors. Saddam Hussein had allegedly made it clear that although he had pardoned both al-Majid and his brother, they would lose all status, and would not receive any protection. Hussein's sister, Rana Hussein, was married to al-Majid's brother, Saddam Kamel, who suffered the same fate. Hussein bore five children to al-Majid: three sons, Ali, Saddam and Wahej; and two daughters, Haris and Banan. In 2003, she and many prominent Iraqi Baathists fled to Jordan where King Abdullah II gave her personal protection. On July 2, 2006, the government of Iraq national security advisor Muwaffaq al-Rubaie declared that Hussein and her mother Sajida Talfah were wanted because they supported the insurgency in Iraq, namely for financing terror movements and supporting militant groups fighting to topple the Iraqi government.https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/01/14/585758/Jordan-king- visits-Iraq The Jordanian Prime Minister, Marouf al-Bakhit, made a statement that \\"Raghad was under the royal family's protection,\\" and \\"The presence of Mrs. Raghad Saddam Hussein and her children in Jordan is motivated by humanitarian considerations. She is the guest of the Hashemite royal family (of King Abdullah II), and under its protection as a seeker of asylum in accordance with Arab tradition\\". Her exact location, however, has not been disclosed. On December 30, 2006, Saddam Hussein was executed in Iraq. Prior to the execution, Raghad Hussein asked for her father's body to be temporarily buried in Yemen, until coalition forces are expelled from Iraq. In August 2007, the international police agency Interpol announced that it had circulated an arrest warrant for Hussein, on suspicions that she and her aides had been assisting the insurgency in Iraq. These suspicions were reflected in an August 2014 article in Spiegel Online, which proposed the title \\"Terror Godmother\\". The article reports that, while living in opulence in Jordan, Hussein's fortune in the double-digit millions is used to support the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), with the ultimate goal of returning to avenging power in Baghdad. Earlier in June, Fox News Channel had quoted such an intention expressed by Hussein in an interview she had given. Hussein is listed on Iraq's most wanted list of individuals alongside 59 others. It also features 28 ISIL fighters, 12 from Al-Qaeda and 20 from the Baath party, giving details of the roles they play in their organisations, the crimes of which they are suspected, and, in most cases, photographs. As of 2018 she was still living in Amman, but longed for coming back to Iraq.

Notable editors include Frank Mentzer (1-4); Mary Kirchoff (5-21); Penny Petticord (22-31); Skip Williams (33, 34, 37, 39); Jean Rabe (36, 38, 40-103); Dave Gross (104-107); Duane Maxwell (107-118); Jeff Quick (122-134); and Erik Mona (138 onward). Two special issues were also published‚Äîan Introductory Issue (Jean Rabe, 1989) that was sent thereafter to new RPGA members, and a Gen Con Issue (Sean Glenn, 1999) that was distributed only at that year's Gen Con. The magazine's publication was fairly erratic and the contents very uneven until Jean Rabe's period as editor where the magazine was put on a regular schedule and contents were developed into recurring topical columns and monthly themed materials. Rabe also strengthened the quality of content and applied more rigorous editing to articles which had previously tended to be somewhat amateurish and personal. During this time also, cover art improved markedly and, notably, focused on strongly presented (and fully clothed) female adventurers. Rabe also converted the magazine from bi-monthly to monthly. Pagination of Polyhedron is problematic, because often (but not always) the mailing wrapper (generally containing printed matter) was counted in the pagination, and often (but not always) the cover was counted in the pagination as well. Given this, the magazine generally was 16-20 pages in length for issues 1-8; 32-36 pages in length for issues 9-128; and 32-48 pages in length for issues 131-143 (at this point, the magazine started to carry advertisements). From issue 144 onwards page counts became fairly variable but generally ran near to either 60 or 40 pages. Polyhedron featured several notable cover styles, including black and white art on issues 1-39; a single- colored left-hand stripe with hexes on issues 40-51; a single colored cover (retaining the hex stripe) from issues 52-74; single color cover with a cluster of hexes in the top-left corner on issues 78-119; increasingly variable covers on 120-143; and full-glossy covers from 144 onwards. Collectors should note that the magazine was serially issued but also published in volumes and numbers for issues 1-148 and then again for issue 161. However, the volume and numbers printed in the magazine frequently were wrong (at least fifteen errors are known during the 148 issues); the issue number should be taken as authoritative. 2002 to 2004 In September, 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired publishing rights and merged the Polyhedron magazine with the sister publication Dungeon to form a single magazine (issue 90 of Dungeon and issue 149 of Polyhedron were one and the same magazine, and this dual numbering continued throughout this period). This ended the association of Polyhedron with the RPGA. It also marked a major change in the magazine's focus, from a primarily Dungeons & Dragons-oriented magazine similar to Dragon to a general d20 system magazine that often featured entirely new, simple role-playing games based on this system, along with support for non-D&D; d20 games such as d20 Modern. Eventually another formerly separate magazine, the Living Greyhawk Journal, briefly became a section in Polyhedron as well. Though this version of Polyhedron had many vocal supporters, sales were poor, a situation many blamed on putting two magazines with distinct target audiences together in one somewhat higher-priced package. The Polyhedron section was removed from Dungeon as part of a major revamp of the latter magazine in 2004 and Polyhedron is no longer published in any form. 2005 From March to November, 2005, Wizards of the Coast used the name \\"Polyhedron\\" for a Dungeons & Dragons email newsletter with links pointing to content on their website. The newsletter typically contained product reviews and announcements and a cartoon. Reception Polyhedron was awarded the Origins Award for \\"Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1987\\".

It was incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1973, and it acquired the C&O; (which controlled the other companies) on June 15. C&O; had been popularly known as \\"Chessie System\\" since the 1930s, and a version of the image of the \\"Chessie\\" mascot kitten used in advertising earlier in the C & O's history. The three railroads had been closely related since the 1960s. C&O; had acquired controlling interest in B&O; in 1962, and the two had jointly controlled WM since 1967. On November 1, 1980, Chessie System merged with Seaboard Coast Line Industries to form CSX Corporation. However, the Chessie image continued to be applied to new and re- painted equipment until mid-1986, when CSX introduced its own paint scheme. The former SCL railroads were merged into the Seaboard System Railroad in 1982, but the three Chessie System railroads continued to operate separately until 1983, when the WM was merged into the B&O.; In April 1987, the B&O; was merged into the C&O.; In September 1987, C&O; merged into CSX Transportation, a 1986 renaming of the Seaboard System Railroad, and the Chessie System name was retired. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, the Chessie System was the creation of Cyrus S. Eaton and his prot√©g√© Hays T. Watkins, Jr., then president and chief executive officer of C&O.; A chief source of revenue for the Chessie System was coal mined in West Virginia. Another was the transport of auto parts and finished motor vehicles. The signature symbol of the Chessie System was its \\"Ches-C\\", a large emblem incorporating the outline of the C&O;'s famous \\"Chessie\\" the kitten logo. The Ches-C was emblazoned on the front of all Chessie System locomotives, and also served as the \\"C\\" in \\"Chessie System\\" on the locomotive's flanks, and on other rolling stock. The Chessie System itself did not own any locomotives or other rolling stock; rather, equipment would be placed on the roster of one of the three component railroads. While all three companies shared a common paint scheme of yellow, vermillion, and blue, actual ownership of the equipment was denoted by the reporting marks C&O;, B&O;, or WM.

The 4-8-4 had previously been used as one of three locomotives pulling the American Freedom Train. The train was painted in the Chessie System motif and consisted of the locomotive, two tenders, and eighteen to twenty passenger and baggage cars. The locomotive was severely damaged in a fire in March 1979 while stored in a Chessie System roundhouse. It has since been cosmetically restored to its American Freedom Train paint scheme, and is on static display at the B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore, although has been exposed to the elements for a majority of its time there. Recently, the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society acquired C&O; 8272, a GE B30-7, in 2017 and it has been restored in the Chessie System paint scheme and currently resides at the Lake Shore Railway Museum.

His genres include rock and roll, country, blues and more commonly rockabilly, and because of his unusual playing and singing style, he is often cited as an example of outsider music. He generally performed as a one-man band, playing guitar and drums at the same time. Adkins was born during the Great Depression and grew up in poverty. His spirited, unusual lifestyle is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for chicken, sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly. Personal life Adkins was born in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the youngest of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper shack on property rented from a local coal company. Born at the time of the Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade. Adkins' given name, Hasil, pronounced \\"Hassel\\", was often mispronounced. One of his brothers was named Basil, similarly pronounced \\"Bassel\\". Hasil dated a girl named Hazel, and was later given the nickname The Haze. As he explained it, the nickname came about \\"'cause Starlight records wanted something catchy and I didn't have no middle name.\\" Hasil Adkins loved to eat meat, specifically poultry, the subject of many of his songs. Following the release of 2000's Poultry in Motion, Adkins toured with \\"dancing go-go chicken\\" dancers. His diet also reportedly consisted of as much as two gallons of coffee a day, and copious amounts of liquor and cigarettes. Aside from his fondness for meat, Adkins claimed to have but three loves in life, \\"girls, guitars, and cars. All three of [which] got me into trouble over the years.\\" One such incident occurred in 1957 when he and three friends drove a car off a mountain. A local newspaper reported the car tumbled 70 feet into nearby Pond Fork. While the driver died at the scene, Adkins survived, although he sustained a permanent back injury. In the 1980s Adkins again found himself in trouble with the law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor. Her mother reported to police that she had been raped, and Adkins was subsequently charged with third-degree sexual assault, although the girl insisted the sexual acts were consensual. In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband. No one was hurt, but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five months in jail. Adkins was said to have suffered from manic depression and insomnia among other mental illnesses. He never married. On April 15, 2005, Adkins was deliberately run over in his front yard by a teenager on an ATV. Eleven days later, on April 26, Adkins was found dead in his home, three days before his 68th birthday. Career Nicknamed \\"The Haze\\", Adkins career began in the mid 1950s in an improvised studio in his home near Madison, West Virginia. There he put his vibrant Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis influences to work by recording scores of songs, beginning with the track \\"I'm Happy\\". In a later interview he exclaimed \\"I couldn't afford no drums so I just stomped my feet.\\" He eventually learned to use percussive instruments to accompany his guitar and vocals, which would become his hallmark sound. In 1961 Adkins headed to California in search of fame, auditioning with talent agencies in and around Los Angeles. With little to go on, he returned to West Virginia, though claimed he missed a callback from an agency a single day after departing for his home. Back at home, Adkins began performing at local nightclubs, behind a store-bought sign that read One of the Greatest Shows on Earth, the One Man Band Haze Adkins and his Happy Guitar. Adkins performing at The Milestone Club in alt=Adkins playing guitar, singing, surrounded by his drumkit The mid-1960s brought Adkins first official release through a local micro-label, with the 45 record Chicken Walk / She's Mine. What followed were the releases of some of his most notable songs, though at the time they received little attention outside of Madison. \\"She Said\\" revealed his imaginative tone in writing, in which he compared the woman of a one-night stand he had to \\"a dying can of that commodity meat.\\" \\"No More Hot Dogs\\" was a song about decapitating a girlfriend and keeping her head as a wall mount. Adkins began to transition from his rockabilly roots to country music by the 1970s, producing several self-released records. It was a tradition of his to mail a copy of each single he released to the sitting President of the United States. In 1970 Richard Nixon wrote back, saying \\"I am very pleased by your thoughtfulness in bringing these particular selections to my attention.\\" The early 1980s saw a resurgence in Adkins' fan base when the American punk rock band The Cramps did a remake of Adkins' \\"She Said\\". In 1985, he was approached by former Cramps drummer Miriam Linna and her husband Billy Miller about releasing some of Adkins' work. Resultantly they created the independent record label Norton Records and released the compilation album Out To Hunch in 1986, which became an underground success. Billy Miller soon was appointed as Adkins' manager, and together with Linna they headed to New York City for Adkins' first professional recording session, yielding 1987's The Wild Man. Upon release, the album was featured as The New York Times \\"Rock Album of the Week\\". By the 1990s Adkins had gained a cult following and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased the rights to Adkins' recordings, and although an album was planned for release, it never materialized. Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights to some of his songs after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999's What The Hell Was I Thinking? and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams. In 2000 Norton released a compilation of new and previous recordings about Adkins' devotion to chicken, entitled Poultry in Motion that included such songs as \\"Chicken Run,\\" \\"Chicken Hop,\\" \\"Chicken Flop,\\" \\"Chicken Wobble,\\" and \\"Chicken on the Bone.\\" In total, Adkins claimed nearly 7,000 songs to his repertoire. While music was his true passion, Adkins enjoyed a career in the film and television industry. He played himself as a street musician in 2004's The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, partially narrated The Red's Breakfast Experience and starred in a comedic horror film entitled Die You Zombie Bastards!. As a composer he helped score Hair High in 2004. Adkins was also the subject of the Julien Nitzberg documentary The Wild World of Hasil Adkins, distributed by Appalshop. Adkins was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame in 2018.Lynch, William. \\"Unexpected connections in new class of West Virginia Music Hall of Fame inductees, Charleston Gazette-Mail, February 1, 2018. Accessed 2018-03-28. Legacy Adkins is often cited as an important precursor to the psychobilly genre. Sacramento, CA‚Äôs The Cramps attribute many of their punk-psychobilly traits to Adkins, and covered \\"She Said\\" live and released a studio version as the b-side of 'Goo Goo Muck' (1981) and then on their compilation album Bad Music for Bad People (1984). This helped usher Adkins into cult status as an underground musician, and inspired Cramps' drummer Miriam Linna and her husband Billy Miller to found the Norton Records label. North Carolina psychobilly group Flat Duo Jets also covered Adkins with \\"Let Me Come In\\" on the 1993 lo-fi compilation Safari, which was released on Norton Records. Musical style Adkins playing guitar and drums during a 2003 performance at Seidel Lanes in alt=Adkins sitting down, singing, playing guitar with his hands and drums with his feet Frenetic in progression and explicit in lyrical content, Adkins was known for having an unconventional take on traditional rockabilly. His unpolished sound was a praised by-product of the makeshift studio equipment used for the majority of his career. \\"I didn't try to be primitive, I just had bad microphones\\", he wrote. His lyrics explored topics such as eating peanut butter on the moon and the suggestive strut of a chicken. Recurring themes in Adkins' catalogue included sex, heartbreak, decapitation, aliens, hot dogs and poultry. Together with country and honky-tonk, Adkins' assortment of styles helped delineate a genre known as psychobilly. Adkins performed as a one-man band, using foot pedals to play the drums, or simply stomped his feet on the floor to an often detuned guitar. He once vowed that he would play \\"twelve to twenty\\" instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with his elbows. He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating that when he was a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. The first time he saw a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own. Many of Adkins' songs were accompanied by a dance of the same name. \\"The Hunch\\" was understood to be a dry humping dance craze, although Adkins failed to define it in interviews. He used the term to describe anything of sexual relation, even naming his car the \\"Hunchin' Wagon\\". \\"The Slop\\" was a song and dance Adkins pioneered for \\"the drunks\\", which he made so \\"you could just go left or right or fall down or anything you ran into\\". 2000's Poultry in Motion introduced a slew of chicken dances. \\"The Chicken Walk\\" involved \\"quiver[ing] yourself from head to toe\\" to mimic that of a chicken, while \\"The Chicken Flop\\" was simply \\"flopping all over the place\\". Adkins primarily recorded and performed his own songs, although Peanut Butter Rock and Roll included covers of Carl Perkins's \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" and Harry Belafonte's \\"Day-O\\". Additionally, Achy Breaky Ha Ha Ha, a country album, included covers of songs by Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Carter Stanley, and A. P. Carter.

He was responsible for encouraging the massive amount of immigration in Canada which occurred during the first decade of the 20th century. In 1905, he broke with Laurier and resigned from cabinet on the issue of publicly funded religious education in the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Early life Born in Middlesex County, Canada West (now Ontario), Sifton's father, John Wright Sifton, was a contractor and businessman who moved with his family to Manitoba when Clifford was a boy. He trained as a lawyer and graduated from Victoria University in the University of Toronto, where he was the founding manager of Acta Victoriana.  Political career  = Manitoba provincial politics: Attorney General for Manitoba = Sifton worked on his father's political campaigns before being himself elected to the legislative assembly of Manitoba in 1888. Sifton served in the cabinet of Thomas Greenway from 1891 to 1896 as attorney general and Provincial Lands Commissioner. He played a role in negotiating the Laurier-Greenway Compromise, which temporarily resolved the Manitoba Schools Question. = Federal politics: Minister of the Interior = In 1896, Sifton was first elected a Member of Parliament after being acclaimed in a by-election in Brandon, and would subsequently be re- elected in 1900 Canadian federal election against a strong challenge from former Manitoba Premier Hugh John Macdonald. Sifton would be re-elected two more times in 1904, and 1908 Canadian federal elections. Sifton was appointed Minister of the Interior under Laurier and implemented a vigorous immigration policy to encourage people to settle and populate the West. Sifton established colonial offices in Europe and the United States. He enticed people to come to western Canada. While many of the immigrants came from Britain and the United States, there was also, to Canada, a large influx of Ukrainians, Scandinavians, Doukhobors, and other groups from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He famously defended the \\"stalwart peasants in sheep-skin coats\\" who were turning some of the most difficult parts of the western plains into productive farms. Between 1891 and 1914, more than three million people came to Canada, largely from continental Europe, following the path of the newly constructed continental railway. In the same period, mining operations were begun in the Klondike and the Canadian Shield. After presiding over the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905, Sifton resigned from cabinet following a dispute with Laurier over religious education. Especially later in his life, Sifton battled increasing deafness, which precluded any further potential political advances.Mr. Prime Minister 1867‚Äì1964, by Bruce Hutchison, Toronto 1964, Longmans Canada. Later life Sifton retired from politics in 1911 but crusaded against the government policy of reciprocity, because he believed that increased economic integration between Canada and the United States would result in Canada being taken over by the Americans. Sifton died in 1929 in New York City, where he had been visiting a heart specialist. He left a fortune estimated at $3.2 million, equivalent to about $ in present-day terminology. Sifton is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. Family Mrs. Clifford Sifton in 1903, by William James Topley Sifton, then a young lawyer, was married in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on August 18, 1884, to Elizabeth Armanella Burrows. She was the daughter of Henry James Burrows and his wife, Sarah Sparks. Elizabeth was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and educated at the Ottawa Ladies' College. The couple had five sons. She founded and presided over the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Brandon, Manitoba. His brother- in-law Theodore Arthur Burrows would also serve as a Liberal MP in the Laurier government, and was later appointed the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. His brother Arthur Sifton served as the second Premier of Alberta.  Archives  There is a Clifford Sifton fonds at Library and Archives Canada.  References  Further reading * Dafoe, John W.

Considered a fast luxury car, it was closely patterned on the Hispano-Suiza and offered in two models. One had a 3104 cc four-cylinder engine while the other had a 4521 cc six-cylinder engine. Soon after the inception of the Abadal line, the Belgian company Imp√©ria began building Abadals under license as Imp√©ria-Abadals. In 1916 Abadal acquired the Buick agency, and Barcelona-built Abadals after that year had Buick power units and featured custom coachwork. These cars were called \\"Abadal-Buicks\\". M. A. Van Roggen (formerly of Springuel) took over the Belgian operation soon after, and built around 170 more Imp√©ria-Abadals. Among the models produced were a 2992cc 16-valve four-cylinder OHC sports model and three prototype 5630 cc straight- eights. The company ceased automobile production in 1923. Francisco Abadal (nicknamed Paco) was a Hispano-Suiza salesman and racing driver in Barcelona. He began this enterprise in 1912, and upon its cessation became an agent of General Motors in Spain.

He is known for his political cartoons and his nationally syndicated comic strip Zits. He was the editorial cartoonist at The Cincinnati Enquirer from 1976 to 2008. Biography Borgman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to James and Marian Borgman, where he began his career in journalism as a student at Elder High School. He then attended Ohio's Kenyon College where he started as an English major, then switched to being an art major. He graduated in 1976 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. Borgman met his first wife Lynn Goodwin during his senior year of college at a class called \\"Jesus and the Gospels\\". They had two children named Dylan and Chelsea. Lynn died in 1999 from a blood clot following a surgery to ease chronic neck and shoulder pain. In 2003 he married Suzanne Soled, an educational psychologist and professor at Northern Kentucky University. Career At Kenyon College, Borgman drew editorial cartoons for the Kenyon Collegian. He became The Cincinnati Enquirers editorial cartoonist in 1976. Since 1980, his editorial cartoons have been nationally syndicated, at first by King Features Syndicate. In 2007, Universal Press Syndicate took over the distribution of his editorial cartoons. In 2008, he took a voluntary buyout offered by Enquirer parent Gannett Company but continued to work on Zits after leaving the paper. Comic strip series =Wonk City= His body of work has included the weekly comic strip \\"Wonk City,\\" which ran from 1994 to 1996 on the editorial pages of The Washington Post. A surreal send-up of inside-the-beltway mores during the administration of Bill Clinton, many of the cartoons featured a cat involved in behind-the-scenes political skullduggery. =Zits= While on vacation in Sedona, Arizona, Borgman met up with fellow cartoonist, Jerry Scott. Scott pitched the idea of a cartoon about a teenager and thus the comic strip \\"Zits\\" was born, debuting in July, 1997, with Borgman cartooning and Scott writing. \\"Zits\\" is syndicated in over 1500 newspapers around the world and is translated into nine languages, including German, Chinese, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Finnish and Polish. Awards In 1991, when Borgman was 37 years old, he won the Pulitzer Prize. He has also won the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1994, and 2006, their Newspaper Comic Strip for 1997, their Newspaper Comic Strip (with Jerry Scott) in 1998 and 1999 for Zits, and their Reuben Award in 1993. Borgman also won the Reuben Award for editorial cartooning in 2006, and has achieved a great deal of recognition for his work.

Life Tichborne was born in Southampton sometime after 24 August 1562Phillimore, Hampshire Parish Records, Vol VI, page 78, marriage of Peter Tychborne, gent to Elizabeth Midleton, 24 August 1562 to Roman Catholic parents, Peter Tichborne and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Middleton).Penry Williams, 'Babington, Anthony (1561‚Äì1586)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 His birth date has been given as circa 1558 in many sources, though unverified, and thus his age given as 28 at his execution. It is unlikely that he was born before his parents' marriage, so he could have been no more than 23 years old when he died. Chidiock Tichborne descended from Sir Roger de Tichborne, who owned land at Tichborne, near Winchester, in the twelfth century. Chidiock's second cousin and contemporary was Sir Benjamin Tichborne who lived at Tichborne Park and was created a Baronet by King James I in 1621. In Chidiock's reported oration from the scaffold before his execution he allegedly stated: \\"I am descended from a house, from two hundred years before the Conquest, never stained till this my misfortune\\".Isaac D'Israeli (circa 1859) (1st collected edition 1881) Curiosities of Literature, Vol II, pp177 Chidiock's father Peter appears to have been the youngest son of Henry Tichborne (born circa 1474) and Anne Mervin (or Marvin) but the records are unclear. Peter was clerk of the Crowne at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554 and was an ardent Catholic supporter. Being the youngest son of a youngest son he was of little means and required to make his own way. He secured an education and the patronage of his distant kinsman, Lord Chidiock Paulet (1521‚Äì1574, son of the 1st Marquess of Winchester), after whom he named his son. In later life he spent many years imprisoned unable to pay recusancy fines. Chidiock's mother was Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of William Middleton (grandson of Sir Thomas Middleton of Belso, Kt.) and Elizabeth Potter (daughter of John Potter of Westram). William had been servant to John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, and a banner bearer at Islip's funeral 1532,Kenning's Masonic Encyclopedia and Handbook of Masonic Archeology, History and Biography (1878) page 299 and later bought lands in Kent. The name \\"Chidiock\\", pronounced ‚Äòchidik‚Äô, as derived from his father's patron, Chidiock Paulet, originates from a Paulet ancestor, Sir John de Chideock, who owned land at Chideock, a village in Dorset. Chidiock Tichborne was never called Charles ‚Äì this is an error that has grown from a misprint in the AQA GCSE English Literature syllabus which has included the Elegy in its early poetry section for several years. Unfortunately, this error persists in much of the educational literature supporting the syllabus. At least two of Chidiock's sisters are recorded by name: Dorothy, first wife of Thomas Muttelbury of Jurdens, Somerset;Visitation Somerset 1623 (1876) page 76 and Mary, second wife of Sir William Kirkham of Blagdon in the parish of Paignton in Devon.Visitation of Kent 1574, page 9 At his execution Chidiock mentions his wife Agnes, one child, and his six sisters. In his letter to his wife, written the night before his execution he mentions his sisters ‚Äì and also 'my little sister Babb'.Harl. MSS. 36. 50. as quoted by Isaac D'Israeli, page 177 Another sister is implied in a secret intelligence note to Francis Walsingham, dated 18 September 1586, in which the writer has had conference with \\"Jennings of Portsmouth\\" who reports that Mr Bruyn of Dorset and Mr Kyrkham of Devon are persons to be suspect as they had married Tychbourn's sisters.Cal. State Papers, Domestic Series, Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth I, 1547-(1625), Vol CXCII, Number 62 History After the succession of Elizabeth I to the throne after the death of Mary I, Chidiock was allowed to practice Catholicism for part of his early life. However, in 1570 the Queen was excommunicated by the Pope for her own Protestantism and support of Protestant causes, most notably the Dutch Rebellion against Spain; in retaliation she ended her relative toleration of the Catholic Church. Catholicism was made illegal, and Roman Catholics were once more banned by law from practising their religion and Roman Catholic priests risked death for performing their functions. Tower of London, Traitor's Gate In 1583, Tichborne and his father, Peter, were arrested and questioned concerning the use of \\"popish relics\\", religious objects Tichborne had brought back from a visit he had made abroad without informing the authorities of an intention to travel. Though released without charge, records suggest that this was not the last time they were to be questioned by the authorities over their religion. In June 1586 accusations of \\"popish practices\\" were laid against his family. In June 1586, Tichborne agreed to take part in the Babington Plot to murder Queen Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, who was next in line to the throne. The plot was foiled by Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster, using double agents, most notably Robert Poley who was later witness to the murder of Christopher Marlowe, and though most of the conspirators fled, Tichborne had an injured leg and was forced to remain in London. On 14 August he was arrested and he was later tried and sentenced to death in Westminster Hall. While in custody in the Tower of London on 19 September (the eve of his execution), Tichborne wrote to his wife Agnes. The letter contained three stanzas of poetry that is his best known piece of work, Tichborne's Elegy, also known by its first line My Prime of Youth is but a Frost of Cares. The poem is a dark look at a life cut short and is a favourite of many scholars to this day. Two other poems are known by him, To His Friend and The Housedove. On 20 September 1586, Tichborne was executed with Anthony Babington, John Ballard, and four other conspirators. They were eviscerated, hanged, drawn and quartered, the mandatory punishment for treason, in St Giles Field. However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until 'quite dead' before being eviscerated. Tichborne's poetry =Elegy and others= Elegy My prime of youth is but a frost of cares, My feast of joy is but a dish of pain, My crop of corn is but a field of tares, And all my good is but vain hope of gain; The day is past, and yet I saw no sun, And now I live, and now my life is done. My tale was heard and yet it was not told, My fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green, My youth is spent and yet I am not old, I saw the world and yet I was not seen; My thread is cut and yet it is not spun, And now I live, and now my life is done. I sought my death and found it in my womb, I looked for life and saw it was a shade, I trod the earth and knew it was my tomb, And now I die, and now I was but made; My glass is full, and now my glass is run, And now I live, and now my life is done. This is the first printed version from Verses of Prayse and Joye (1586). The original text differs slightly: along with other minor differences, the first line of the second verse reads \\"The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,\\" and the third line reads \\"My youth is gone, and yet I am but young.\\" The last word in the third line, \\"tares,\\" refers to a harmful \\"weed\\" that resembles corn when young, and is a reference to Matt. 13:24‚Äì30. To His Friend (assumed to be Anthony Babington) Good sorrow cease, false hope be gone, misfortune once farewell; Come, solemn muse, the sad discourse of our adventures tell. A friend I had whose special part made mine affection his; We ruled tides and streams ourselves, no want was in our bliss. Six years we sailed, sea-room enough, by many happy lands, Till at the length, a stream us took and cast us on the sands. There lodged we were in a gulf of woe, despairing what to do, Till at the length, from shore unknown, a Pilot to us drew, Whose help did sound our grounded ship from out Caribda's mouth, But unadvised, on Scylla drives; the wind which from the South Did blustering blow the fatal blast of our unhappy fall, Where driving, leaves my friend and I to fortune ever thrall; Where we be worse beset with sands and rocks on every side, Where we be quite bereft of aid, of men, of winds, of tide. Where vain it is to hail for help so far from any shore, So far from Pilot's course; despair shall we, therefore? No! God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow, And send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow As shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place, And we shall joy each others' chance through God's almighty grace, And keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas. Sweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release. The Housedove A silly housedove happed to fall amongst a flock of crows, Which fed and filled her harmless craw amongst her fatal foes. The crafty fowler drew his net ‚Äì all his that he could catch ‚Äì The crows lament their hellish chance, the dove repents her match. But too, too late! it was her chance the fowler did her spy, And so did take her for a crow ‚Äì which thing caused her to die. The only known manuscript versions of \\"To His Friend\\" and The Housedove\\" are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the \\"Elegy\\" (or \\"Lament\\") are known and there are many variations of the text. =Comment= Tichborne's authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir Walter Raleigh. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called Verses of Praise and Joy in 1586, published by John Wolfe of London to celebrate the Queen's survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled \\"Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne\\" (\\"T. K.'s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne's Swan Song\\") is most likely by the poet and dramatist Thomas Kyd, author of The Spanish Tragedy. Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults, Thy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall; Thy crop of corn is tares availing naughts, Thy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all. Short were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun, T'obscure thy light unluckily begun. Time trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped; Thy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been: Thy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt; And God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen. Her thread still holds, thine perished though unspun, And she shall live when traitors lives are done. Thou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert, Thou look'dst for life, yet lewdly forc'd it fade: Thou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art, As men may wish thou never hadst been made. Thy glory, and thy glass are timeless run; And this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done. =Critical appreciation= Elegy Tichborne's \\"Elegy\\" (his rhyming, final soliloquy poemHirsch, Edward, How to read a Poem, Harvest Harcourt Inc, New York, 1999 ), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech ‚Äì antithesis and paradox ‚Äì to crystallise the tragedy of the poet's situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt's \\"I find no peace, and all my war is done\\", with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I, \\"I grieve and dare not show my discontent\\", e.g., \\"I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.\\" A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., \\"My tale is heard, and yet it was not told\\", or \\"My glass is full, and now my glass is run.\\" Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox. The \\"Elegy\\" is remarkable for being written almost entirely in monosyllables: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each line, monostich style), with the possible exception of the word \\"fallen\\". However, in early editions it was written as \\"fall'n\\" which is monosyllabic.University of Buckingham, England. \\"The poem is immediately striking both for its deft use of antithesis, and for its relative brevity and clarity. With the exception of 'fallen' (which in early editions is 'fall'n' and, as the metre indicates, pronounced as a monosyllable) every word in the poem is of one syllable, something that adds to its stark and plain effect.\\" The \\"Elegy\\" has inspired many \\"homages\\" and \\"answers\\" including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; After Reading Tichborne's Elegy by Dick Allen (2003) and Tichborne's Lexicon by Nick Montfort. The \\"Elegy\\" has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in An Hour's Recreation in musicke, 1606), John Mundy (1592) and Charles-Fran√ßois Gounod (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see Tichborne's Elegy Poem Animation) and Taylor Momsen. The Housedove \\"The Housedove\\" exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet 1.5.48). The \\"crafty fowler\\" is probably Sir Francis Walsingham, the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot. Sources *Richard S. M.

The genre often addresses issues of modern womanhood ‚Äì from romantic relationships to female friendships to matters in the workplace ‚Äì in humorous and lighthearted ways.\\"In the Classroom or In the Bedroom\\" Review of Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction. At its onset, chick lit's protagonists tended to be \\"single, white, heterosexual, British and American women in their late twenties and early thirties, living in metropolitan areas\\". The genre became popular in the late 1990s, with chick lit titles topping bestseller lists and the creation of imprints devoted entirely to chick lit. Chick lit critics generally agreed that British author Catherine Alliott's The Old Girl Network (1994) was the start of the chick lit genre and the inspiration for Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary (1996) which was wildly popular and is the \\"ur-text\\" of chick lit. History =Origins of the term= \\"Chick\\" is American slang for a young woman, and \\"lit\\" is a shortened form of the word \\"literature\\". Chick lit scholars note that the term was first used ironically in 1995 by Cris Mazza and Jeffrey DeShell as the title for their edited anthology Chick Lit: Postfeminist Fiction, which contains 22 short fiction pieces in response to Mazza and DeShell's call for \\"postfeminist writing\\". In the mid-1990s, the term was used by various media outlets to describe fiction written by women authors for women readers. The term has been expanded to include female stories in historical fiction, otherwise known as \\"chick lit in corsets\\". In addition, \\"chick lit jr.\\" is chick lit for younger readers, combining elements of the genre with coming-of-age tales. =Controversy= While chick lit has become very popular with readers, critics have largely disapproved of the genre. Reviewer Alex Kuczynski, writing for The New York Times, condemned Fielding's novel in particular, writing: \\"Bridget is such a sorry spectacle, wallowing in her man-crazed helplessness, that her foolishness cannot be excused.\\" Writer Doris Lessing deemed the genre \\"instantly forgettable\\" while Beryl Bainbridge called the genre \\"a froth sort of thing\\". Debate continued with the publication of editor Elizabeth Merrick's anthology This Is Not Chick Lit (2005), where Merrick argued in her introduction that \\"Chick lit's formula numbs our senses\\", and editor Lauren Baratz-Logsted's 2006 response This Is Chick Lit whose project was \\"born out of anger\\". Writers of the genre have come to its defense. Chick-lit author Jenny Colgan immediately fired back at Lessing and Bainbridge. Jennifer Weiner, author of numerous chick-lit novels, including Good in Bed (2001) and In Her Shoes (2002), has been a vocal defender of chick lit. On May 22, 2013, Slate published an article which Weiner wrote in response to a comment that novelist Claire Messud, author of The Woman Upstairs (2013), made about women's fiction and the likeability of protagonists. Weiner used this moment as an opportunity to question the bias that exists toward commercial fiction, particularly women's commercial fiction. Weiner has continued to challenge people's perceptions of chick lit, including writing \\"The Snobs and Me\\" for The New York Times; the article chronicles her personal struggle to believe in her own writing in a cultural climate that devalues it. Other writers such as Diane Shipley and D.J. Connell have come to the genre's defense. Most notably, high-profile feminist Gloria Steinem has echoed Weiner's sentiments and asked people to interrogate their use of the term and what it says about women and women's fiction, noting the prejudice against women's lit. Author Kim Gruenenfelder refused to continue labeling her books as \\"chick lit\\", seeing the phrase as dismissive of books written by women and largely directed at female audiences. She instead calls her books \\"rom-com\\", after the film genre of romantic comedy, but even this term is largely inaccurate of what chick lit is. = Recent years = Publishers continue to push the subgenre because sales continue to be high. Various other terms have been coined as variant in attempts to attach themselves to the perceived marketability of the work. Refinery 29 writer Lauren Le Vine published a listicle in March 2016 entitled \\"The Chick-Lit Books That Won't Destroy The Feminist Inside You\\", which includes eight books written by women for women. Le Vine recognizes the argument that literary tradition in novels about women sometimes include narratives about shopping- obsessed women looking for husbands, and these books contradict feminist values. However, when Le Vine introduces Helen Fielding's 1996 novel Bridget Jones's Diary, she writes that \\"a book focusing solely on one woman's quest to find personal contentment, which for her means love, career success, and body acceptance, is what feminism (no matter which wave) is about.\\" Publishers Weekly editor Sara Nelson suggested in 2008 that the definition of what's considered to be within the genre of chick lit has become more accomplished and \\"grown up\\". In 2000, The Sydney Morning Herald described a trend of new fiction books aimed at women readers which were characterized by \\"...a spirit of post-Tory, post-grunge lightness [that] tapped into hordes of female magazine-readers and TV-watchers\\". This fiction was called the birth of a \\"publishing phenomenon\\" which can be called \\"chick fiction\\" \\"...or chicfic\\", all unified by subject-matter, packaging and marketing\\", with \\"candy-bright, heavy in pink and fluorescen[t]\\" covers, and \\"candy-bright\\" titles, \\"hinting at easy digestion and a good laugh...Such books are positioned in a marketplace as hybrids of the magazine article, fictional or fictionalised, television...and comfort food digestible over a single' night at home.\\" Composition Chick lit typically features a female protagonist whose womanhood is heavily thematized in the plot. Though most often set in a contemporary world, such as in Waiting to Exhale, there is also historical chick lit. The issues dealt with are often more serious than consumerism. Marian Keyes's Watermelon, for instance, features a protagonist who wrestles with how to be a mother in a modern world. There is a growing market for religious chick lit. As with other types of genre fiction, authors and publishers target many niche markets. Protagonists vary widely in ethnicity, age, social status, marital status, career, and religion. According to goodreads, chick-lit is not considered a subgenre of romance because although plots may include romantic elements, \\"because the heroine's relationship with her family or friends is often just as important as her romantic relationships.\\" The somewhat strict genre rules of chick lit make it difficult for these authors to branch into different genres, although chick lit can tie into historical fiction. Some female authors take steps to avoid having their work labeled as chick lit. For example, in a 2010 Guardian article, humor writer DJ Connell leads with changing her writing name from Diane to DJ to avoid the chick lit label. She said having a female name and writing humor would jeopardize her work and would not be taken seriously if labeled chick lit. In another example, author Ruth Gilligan wrote about how she garnered disrespect from the general public, agents and publishers for her chick lit- branded books. When she tried out a new style in a book about sexual assault on college campuses, the publishers presented her with a bright flowery cover, which Gilligan deemed disrespectful.

The site was split between a commercial airport Kent International Airport (KIA), since closed, and a continuing military use by the Defence Fire Training and Development Centre (DFTDC), following on from a long-standing training facility for RAF firefighters at the RAF Manston base. In March 2017, RAF Manston became the HQ for the 3rd Battalion, Princess of Wales Royal Regiment (PWRR). History =First World War= At the outset of the First World War, the Isle of Thanet was equipped with a small and precarious landing strip for aircraft at St Mildreds Bay, Westgate, on top of the chalk cliffs, at the foot of which was a promenade which had been used for seaplane operations. The landing grounds atop the cliff soon became the scene of several accidents, with at least one plane seen to fail to stop before the end of the cliffs and tumble into the sea, which for the fortunate pilot had been on its inward tide. In the winter of 1915-1916 these early aircraft first began to use the open farmlands at Manston as a site for emergency landings. Thus was soon established the Admiralty Aerodrome at Manston. It was not long after this that the training school, set up originally to instruct pilots in the use of the new Handley Page bombers, was established, and so by the close of 1916 there were already two distinct units stationed at Manston, the Operational War Flight Command and the Handley Page Training School. Its location near the Kent coast gave Manston some advantages over the other previously established aerodromes and regular additions in men and machinery were soon made, particularly, in these early days, from Detling. By 1917 the Royal Flying Corps was well established and taking an active part in the defence of England. At a time when Zeppelin raids were bringing the war directly to English civilians, daylight bombing raids by German 'Gotha' Bombers, a twin engined biplane, would have been considerably more effective were it not for the RFC's presence at Manston. The German air raids had lasted for thirteen weeks, the last being on 22 August 1917. On this occasion, of the 15 bombers that set out for England five did not reach the Kent coast, and the 'spirited' intervention from Manston-based fighters prevented those remaining from flying further west, three being destroyed outright and the remaining seven returning to Germany with dead and wounded on board. Shortly after such formation raids and in consequence the Cabinet recommended the creation of a separate Air Ministry. The RAF was officially formed on 1 April 1918. =Second World War= A Luftwaffe aerial photograph of RAF Manston at the outbreak of war in 1939 when it was still an all-grass airfield At the start of the Second World War, Manston hosted a School of Air Navigation but this was quickly moved out. On 10 September 1939, No. 3 Squadron flew in equipped with Hawker Hurricanes and Manston was put under the command of No. 11 Group Fighter Command. During an eventful Battle of Britain, Manston was heavily bombed; at its height (August 1940) diary entries recorded a steady stream of damage to aircraft and buildings. The station was also littered with unexploded bombs. This caused many staff to move to nearby woods for at least a week.Hogben, Arthur Designed to Kill (1987) p 88 Patrick Stephens Limited Others were dispersed to surrounding housing. For example, WAAFs (members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force) stationed at Manston were billeted at the nearby Ursuline Convent in Westgate on Sea. Barnes Wallis used the base to test his bouncing bomb on the coast at nearby Reculver prior to the Dambusters raid. A prototype is on public display at the Spitfire & Hurricane Museum. Hawker Typhoon attack aircraft were based there later in the war, and also the first Meteor jet squadron of the RAF. It was used as a departure point for airborne forces in Operation Market Garden. It was one of the few airfields installed with the Fog, Intensive, Dispersal Of (FIDO) system designed to remove fog from airfields by burning it off with petrol. Along with RAF Carnaby and RAF Woodbridge, Manston was developed as a South coast emergency landing ground for bomber crews. These airfields were intended for use by returning bombers suffering from low-fuel and/or suspected damage to their pneumatic (wheel brake) and/or hydraulic (undercarriage) systems. All three airfields were equipped with a single runway, 9,000 ft (2,700 m) long and 750 ft (230 m) wide. There was a further clear area of 1,500 ft (460 m) at each end of the runway. At each of the three airfields, the runway was divided into three 250 ft (76 m) lanes. The northern and central lanes were allocated by flying control, while the southern lane was the emergency lane on which any aircraft could land without first making contact with the airfield. The hilltop site was chosen as it was usually fog-free and had no approach obstructions. Being close to the front line, the airfield became something of a magnet for badly damaged aircraft that had suffered from ground fire, collisions, or air attack but retained a degree of airworthiness. The airfield became something of a \\"graveyard\\" for heavy bombers and no doubt the less- damaged portions of aircraft landing or otherwise arriving here sometimes provided spare parts for other Allied aircraft in need of repair. The museums on site display some startling aerial views dating from this era and the post- war years. After the war, the runway was reconfigured, becoming 200 feet wide with a full-length parallel taxiway, both within the original paved width. = USAF use = USAF Boeing B-47E-50-LM, AF Ser.

No. 52-4063, of the 513th Fighter Interceptor Squadron During the Cold War of the 1950s the United States Air Force used RAF Manston as a Strategic Air Command base for its bomber, fighter and fighter-bomber units. In the early 1950s, SAC's backbone bombers were the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 Stratojet. To support this strategy, the SAC 7th Air Division was established in May 1951. At the time, Manston had only partially recovered from the ravages of the Second World War. There were still makeshift bomb shelters, i.e. trenches with tin roofs, and many large circles of lush green grass where Luftwaffe bombs had cratered the runway. The RAF control tower overlooked a bizarre hilltop runway, which was an extraordinary wide and long. The 7th AD expanded Manston by building concrete bunkers suitable for nuclear weapons and upgrading the support facilities for long-term use. By the summer of 1953, the 7th AD began a series of temporary deployments of B-47 and B-36 wings from the United States to the United Kingdom. These deployments generally involved about 45 aircraft, together with about 20 KC-97 Stratofreighters which were maintained at the English bases for 90 days. At the end of the Temporary Duty (TDY), they were relieved by another SAC wing that was generally stationed at a different airfield. These deployments continued until 1955 when SAC shifted its rotational deployments to RAF Fairford and Manston was turned over to the United States Air Forces in Europe. In July 1951 SAC deployed the 12th Fighter-Escort Wing to Manston to provide fighter escort for its rotational bombardment wings. The 12th, however, only remained at Manston until 30 November when it was replaced by the 123d Fighter-Bomber Wing, with the 12th being transferred to Japan for combat duty during the Korean War. The 123d was an umbrella wing that was formed from several Air National Guard squadrons activated for federal service during the Korean War. This wing was activated at Manston with three ANG fighter squadrons: * 156th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (North Carolina ANG) * 165th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Kentucky ANG) * 167th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (West Virginia ANG) The 123d utilized the F-84E \\"Thunderjets\\" left behind by the 12th FEW and continued the same mission of fighter escort of SAC's bombers. In July 1952 the Air National Guard squadrons were returned to State control, and USAFE assumed the fighter escort role. In its place, the 406th Fighter-Bomber Wing was activated in place at Manston with the following squadrons assigned: * 512th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Yellow Stripe) * 513th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Red Stripe) * 514th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Dark Blue Stripe) Initially, the 406th utilized the existing F-84Es, however in August 1953, the F-86F \\"Sabre\\" began to arrive to replace them. 100px A change of mission for the 406th in April 1954 from fighter-bomber to fighter-interceptor came with a change of equipment. The F-86D Sabre interceptor began to arrive and the F-86F's were transferred to other USAFE squadrons and NATO countries. In addition, the 512th FBS was transferred to Soesterberg Air Base, Netherlands with their F-86Fs. In June F-86D's arrived from CONUS to equip the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was transferred to the 406th from the 81st FBW assigned to RAF Shepherds Grove. The 87th FIS, however, physically remained at Shepherds Grove, but was under the organisational command of the 406th at Manston. In September 1955, the 87th was redesignated the 512th FIS. On 15 May 1958 the 406th was inactivated, with its three air defence squadrons being assigned to continental Europe under the 86th Air Division (Defense) at Ramstein Air Base West Germany. The squadrons were transferred to the following bases: * 512th FIS to Sembach Air Base, West Germany * 513th FIS to Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base France * 514th FIS to Ramstein Air Base, West Germany The F-86D's were eventually withdrawn from Europe in 1961, and the 512th, 513th and 514th were inactivated. After the transfer of the USAFE interceptors at Manston the base was returned to the RAF control. = Return to RAF use = With the USAF's withdrawal from Manston, the airfield became a joint civilian and RAF airport from 1960 and was thence employed for occasional package tour and cargo flights, alongside its continuing role as an RAF base. The Air Cadets used the northern side of the airfield as a gliding site, and 1 Air Experience Flight flying De Havilland Chipmunks was also based there. Thanks to its long runway, Manston was designated as one of the UK's MEDAs (Military Emergency Diversion Airfields) for emergency military and civilian landings. Others included RAF Greenham Common, RAF Aldergrove and RAF Machrihanish. For a number of years, the base operated as a Master Diversion Airfield, open 24 hours every day. Manston, uniquely in the UK, also had a 'foam carpet' crash landing system, where two tractors would pull tankers laying a metre thick layer of foam over a strip of runway, for aircraft with landing gear problems. =Search and rescue base= Sea King HAR.3 of 202 RAF Squadron, who operated this type of aircraft from RAF Manston between 1988 and 1994 RAF Manston was home to a helicopter search and rescue (SAR) flight from No. 22 Squadron RAF from 1961, operating Westland Whirlwind aircraft. The flight was withdrawn in 1969, but the outcry led to the RAF contracting Bristow Helicopters from 1971 to 1974 to provide a continued service (also using MK3 Whirlwhinds). In 1972, the Bristow crew was awarded the \\"Wreck Shield\\" for \\"Most Meritorious Rescue in 1972\\" by the Department of Trade and Industry. In 1974, the RAF SAR teams returned, with No. 72 Squadron RAF operating two Westland Wessex HC2 aircraft to replace the Bristow cover. The flight was transferred back to No. 22 Squadron in June 1976. In 1988 No. 202 Squadron RAF moved to Manston with their Sea King HAR.3, with the Wessex aircraft moving to RAF Coltishall. The Sea Kings remained at Manston until July 1994, when SAR activity at the base was halted, and SAR cover for the channel relocated to RAF Wattisham. =Units= The following units were here at some point: Civilian use For some years two commercial airlines operated out of Manston, Invicta Airways and Air Ferry. Many thousands of holiday passengers started their journeys from Manston. From 1989 Manston became styled as Kent International Airport, and a new terminal was officially opened that year by the Duchess of York. Closure The DFTDC is still an active military base. In 1996, Manston's satellite station RAF Ash, was closed, and in 1999, it was decided to close the RAF Manston base. The 'airside' portion of the base was signed over to the commercial operator of Kent International Airport. The MoD decided to keep the central fire training school (CTE) facility open, and almost the entirety of the 'domestic' side of the base became FSCTE Manston (Fire Service Central Training Establishment). In 2007 the Army took over responsibility for firefighting across the armed services (except the Royal Navy whose Aircraft Handling Branch are the fire fighters at Naval Air Stations and are trained it RNAS Culdrose at the School of Flight Deck Operations) and the school became the Defence Fire Training and Development Centre (DFTDC). In January 2017 it was announced that the 3rd Battalion, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment would be based at Manston. Accidents * On 18 September 1948, an RAF de Havilland Mosquito crashed during an air show at RAF Manston, killing both crew and ten members of the public. * On 27 April 1952, an American Republic F-84E Thunderjet (Serial Number 49-2111), of 165 Fighter Bomber Squadron, 1323 Fighter Bomber Group, United States Air Force, that was based at Manston crashed at nearby St Peter's as a result of an engine fire. The pilot, Captain Clifford Vincent Fogarty, was killed, as were three St Peter's residents.  Museums  There are currently two museums on the former RAF Manston site, in a cluster on the north side : * The RAF Manston History Museum * The Spitfire and Hurricane Memorial Museum A third museum in the cluster, the Manston Fire Museum within the DFTDC site, is now closed.

Remy grew up in Somerset, Massachusetts. An all-star second baseman originally drafted by the California Angels in 1971, he was traded to his hometown Boston Red Sox in 1977. He retired from the sport in 1985 after a series of injuries and ventured into a career in broadcasting. He has served as a color commentator for NESN's Red Sox broadcasts since 1988, only taking some occasional time off for health problems. Early life Remy was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, on November 8, 1952, and grew up in nearby Somerset. He attended Somerset High School and Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island.

Bill James, in his Historical Abstract, rated Remy as the 100th greatest second baseman of all time as of 2001. Post-playing career Since 1988, Remy has found success in broadcasting, working for the New England Sports Network (NESN), as the regular color commentator for NESN's Red Sox broadcasts. From 2001 through the end of the 2015 season, Remy teamed with play-by-play announcer Don Orsillo; since the 2016 season, Remy has worked with Dave O'Brien. Remy and Orsillo won four New England Emmy awards, and Remy was voted Massachusetts' favorite sports announcer in 2004 by Sports Illustrated. NESN and the Red Sox celebrated Jerry Remy Day at Fenway Park on June 24, 2008, in honor of Remy's 20 years of service for the network. He also runs a web site, The Remy Report. Remy owns a hot dog stand, \\"RemDawg's\\", located just outside Fenway Park, as well as Jerry Remy's Sports Bar & Grill in Terminal C of Logan International Airport since 2008. There were three other Bar & Grill locations: one behind Fenway Park on Boylston Street that opened March 9, 2010, which was reported closed in March 2015, and subsequently became a Tony C‚Äôs Sports Bar & Grill (named after another former Red Sox player, Tony Conigliaro); a second in the Seaport District of South Boston, which in December 2016 also became a Tony C‚Äôs Sports Bar & Grill; and a third in Remy's hometown of Fall River that opened in October 2012, which in March 2018, The Herald News of Fall River reported would be closed. Remy was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2006, elected honorary President of Red Sox Nation in 2007, and was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2017. =Books= Remy is the author of three books about baseball, and several children's books about Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster, which began as an idea based on Remy's storytelling while broadcasting Red Sox games.  ;Wally the Green Monster series  Dustin Pedroia has authored another book in the series, Wally The Green Monster's Journey Through Time. Health In November 2008, Remy had surgery to remove a \\"very small, low-grade cancerous area\\" from his lung, most likely a result of years of smoking cigarettes. During his recovery from the surgery, he suffered from an infection as well as a bout of pneumonia. Due to fatigue and depression, Remy took an indefinite leave of absence from his broadcast duties for NESN, starting April 30, 2009. Jerry Remy Takes Leave of Absence to Recover From Cancer Surgery On August 12, 2009, Remy went to Fenway Park and attended Red Sox manager Terry Francona's pre-game press conference. He told both NESN and The Boston Globe that he had every intention of returning to broadcasting Red Sox games during the remainder of the 2009 season. He entered the NESN's broadcast booth during the top of the second inning during the night's game to speak with broadcasters Don Orsillo and Dennis Eckersley. It was the first time he had been in the booth since he took his leave of absence in April. In between the top and the bottom of the second inning, Remy, still in the booth, was shown on Fenway's center field scoreboard display, to which he received a standing ovation from the crowd attending the game. He revealed during the visit that he had suffered from depression following his physical problems of 2008 and that he was receiving therapy.Remy visits TV booth during tonight's game On August 19, 2009, Remy released a statement announcing his return to commentating on August 21, 2009, against the New York Yankees. Remy stated that he would likely skip some road trips. He returned full-time for the 2010 baseball season. In April 2013, Remy announced that he‚Äôd suffered a relapse that offseason when cancer was found in a different spot on his lungs during his regular six-month CT scan that January. Remy took time off starting May 28, 2013, due to a bout of pneumonia. He returned to the booth on June 25, 2013.Jerry Remy says he will return Tuesday Chad Finn, boston.com, June 19, 2013 On August 16, 2013, Remy announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence after his son was arrested for murder. Remy did not return to the broadcast booth until the beginning of the 2014 season. Remy had another leave during the 2016‚Äì17 off-season, missing nearly all of 2017 spring training until returning for the last week. On June 12, 2017, Remy announced that the lung cancer had returned. In January 2018, he announced via Twitter that he had completed treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital. A fourth diagnosis of cancer was announced on August 7, 2018. After undergoing treatments, Remy announced in early November 2018 that he was cancer-free. Family Remy and his wife Phoebe have three children, Jared, Jordan, and Jenna. Jared worked for the Red Sox as a security guard, but was fired in 2008 after another guard told the State Police that Jared had sold him steroids. On August 16, 2013, Jared was arrested in the fatal stabbing of his girlfriend, Jennifer Martel, a charge he pleaded guilty to on May 27, 2014. Jared Remy was sentenced to life in state prison without the possibility of parole. Jordan was selected by the Red Sox in the 49th Round of the 1999 MLB draft. In 2010, he was charged with indecent assault and battery. Jenna was arrested on July 25, 2013, for disorderly conduct, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, resisting arrest, wanton malicious defacement, and misdemeanor breaking and entering after she broke into her ex-boyfriend's home.

Cox announced her resignation as Wonkette's editor on January 5, 2006, in order to promote her book, Dog Days, and was succeeded by David Lat, the author of Underneath Their Robes, a blog about the federal judiciary, and Alex Pareene, a young New York University student and Gawker intern/guest editor in New York who moved to D.C. for the Wonkette position. (In late 2007, Pareene moved to the flagship Gawker site and, in April 2010, to Salon.) In June 2006, Lat announced his decision to leave Wonkette. His slot was to be filled by guest editors until August 2006, when longtime political blogger Ken Layne joined as editor. Wonkette reached its largest pre-2008 audience during the 2006 midterm elections due to scandal coverage of Mark Foley and other incumbents involved in corruption, sex-abuse and bribery scandals. After Pareene and Layne's departure in October 2007, a team of new editors including John Clarke, Jr. and Megan Carpentier was installed by Gawker management. Gawker publisher Nick Denton brought Layne back as sole editor two months later, who put in place the team of Jim Newell of IvyGate, videographer Liz Glover, former Gawker blogger Sara K. Smith, Columbia literary magazine The Blue and White editor Juli Weiner, and longtime contributors Princess Sparkle Pony (Peter Huestis) and Josh Fruhlinger, the Comics Curmudgeon. Wonkette teams covered both the Denver DNC and St. Paul RNC conventions. Newell and columnist Josh Fruhlinger covered Barack Obama's inauguration in Washington. As with many political websites, readership hit new records between the November 2008 election and January 2009 inauguration. Past and current guest editors and contributors include Reason Magazine editor Nick Gillespie, Washington Post reporter David Weigel, DCeiver editor and Huffington Post writer Jason Linkins, Gawker editor and The Awl founder Choire Sicha, New York comedian and author Sara Benincasa, Chicago artist and journalist Lauri Apple, Boston Globe political blogger Garrett Quinn, cartoonist Benjamin Frisch, and Vanity Fair online writer Juli Weiner. In April 2011, Wonkette came under criticism after blogger Jack Stuef wrote a post that was interpreted as mocking Trig Palin for his having Down syndrome. The post suggested that Trig was possibly the result of incest between Todd Palin and Bristol Palin. In response, at least 14 advertisers, including major companies such as Ford, Toyota, Verizon, Nordstrom, and Papa John's, announced that they would exclude their network remnant advertising from Wonkette. Editor Ken Layne announced that Stuef was placed on probation and Stuef apologized for the post. The name of the site is a play on the slang word wonk, meaning a \\"zealous student of political policy\\", adding the feminine ending to best describe founding editor Cox and as a play on the word \\"gazette.\\" =Separation from Gawker Media= On April 14, 2008, Gawker Media announced that it was selling Wonkette and that Layne would remain managing editor and part owner. Gawker Media head Nick Denton attributed the sale to \\"hunkering down\\" before another dot com downturn and the Internet bubble bursts: \\"And, even if not, better safe than sorry; and better too early than too late...\\" Gawker's Silicon Valley gossip site, Valleywag, was merged with the flagship Gawker.com site, its popular music site, Idolator, was sold to Buzznet, and The Consumerist was sold to Consumers Union as part of the same divestiture effort. Wonkette Media also launched Wonkabout, a D.C. culture guide, which ran from February 12, 2009 until April 28, 2011, and was edited by Arielle Fleisher.\\"Introducing Wonkabout\\" In February, 2017, Wonkette went ad-free , and it is now supported by reader donations. Style and frequent targets Wonkette makes frequent targets of mainstream media outlets like CNN, The Washington Post and Politico, when they are perceived as missing opportunities for substantive political analysis by attempting to get \\"scoops\\" or simply covering the actions of others in the mainstream media. Truck Nutz references became very popular during the 2008 Presidential Election, while following the election of Barack Obama, the site also published humorous pieces about Tea Party Protesters, Birthers, Peggy Noonan's weekly column and Sarah Palin.Sara K.

Right-wing blogs such as Andrew Breitbart's Big Government and National Review Online's The Corner are constant targets.\\"Andrew Breitbart Longing To Shoot The Next Person Who Insults Him\\" Wonkette.com September 19, 2011.  Reception  The Bloggies at SXSW selected Wonkette as Best Political Blog in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Wonkette was chosen as a top political blog by Vanity Fair and Real Simple in 2008. Wonkette won the Best Liberal Blog category in the 2008 Weblog Awards and is nominated in the humor, politics and group-blog categories in the 2009 and 2010 Bloggies. Items are frequently picked up by national broadcasts including Colbert Report, Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me and CNN. Alex Nichols, writing in The Outline in 2017, described Wonkette, saying, \\"This is why I love Wonkette, the gossip blog that refuses to die. Wonkette is Bush-era liberalism frozen in amber, motionless and immortal, forced to passively observe a changing world until the end of time. Why does it still exist? Hard to say. But as long as it is here, we must celebrate its inanity.\\" He wrote, \\"The site isn't an indictment of centrists, the Democratic Party, or neoliberalism. It doesn't prove a point about anything, and it isn't an example of any trend or political tendency, which makes it all the more baffling ... Wonkette simply exists, and it might outlast us all.\\" References  External links  * Category:American political websites Category:Satirical magazines published in the United States Category:Gawker Media Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Online magazines published in the United States Category:American political blogs ","title":"Wonkette"},{"id":"850349","text":"Wild Style is a 1982 American hip hop film directed and produced by Charlie Ahearn. Released theatrically in September 1982 by First Run Features, it is regarded as the first hip hop motion picture. The film included seminal figures such as Fab Five Freddy, Lee Qui√±ones, Lady Pink, The Rock Steady Crew, The Cold Crush Brothers, Queen Lisa Lee of Zulu Nation, Grandmaster Flash and Zephyr. The protagonist \\"Zoro\\" is played by New York graffiti artist \\"Lee\\" George Qui√±ones. The film was later released on home video by Rhino Home Video in 1997. In 2007, it was released on DVD for the 25th anniversary. A 30th anniversary collector's edition was released on Blu-ray in 2013. Background An early version of the Wild Style logo appeared in 1981 when Charlie Ahearn hired graffiti writer Dondi to paint the \\"window down\\" subway car piece that appears in the film. The Dondi piece was the inspiration for the animated title sequence designed by the artist, Zephyr and animated by Joey Ahlbum in 1982. The Wild Style mural was painted by Zephyr, Revolt and Sharp in 1983. Charlie Ahearn and Fab 5 Freddy began working on the film on late 1981. The approach was a hybrid of a narrative musical and documentary, having the real hip hop pioneers play themselves in a loosely scripted story shot entirely in the South Bronx, the Lower East Side and MTA subway yards. Plot Wild Style takes place in 1981 in New York and centers around graffiti artists, Zoro (played by Lee Qui√±ones) and his encounters with an uptown journalist named, Virginia (played by Patti Astor). More so than its story, however, the film is notable for featuring several prominent figures from early hip hop culture such as Busy Bee Starski, Fab Five Freddy, The Cold Crush Brothers and Grandmaster Flash. Throughout the movie there are scenes depicting activities common in the early days of hip hop. These include MCing, turntablism, graffiti and b-boying. The film demonstrates the interconnections between music, dance and art in the development of hip hop culture. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 18 reviews. Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian noted that despite the low production values, 'nothing else comes close to capturing the atmosphere of the early days of hip-hop and spraycan art...' Reviewing the film for BBC, David Mattin wrote that \\"Wild Style is a cult classic - indisputably the most important hip hop movie, ever.\\"  Impact  The film has received a large cult following over the years after its initial release. Highly regarded hip hop albums such as Illmatic by Nas, Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sunday by Cypress Hill, Resurrection by Common, Big Shots by Charizma, Operation: Doomsday by MF Doom, Check Your Head by Beastie Boys, Beat Konducta by Madlib, Jay Stay Paid by J Dilla and Quality Control by Jurassic 5 have used samples from the film. In 2007, the VH1 Hip Hop Honors paid tribute to Wild Style in recognition of its influence upon the culture. The film was also voted as one of the top ten rock and roll films of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The film has been exhibited as part of a 1980s art retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston.http://dailyfreepress.com/2012/11/15/art-love-and-politics-in- the-80s-an-exhibition-at-the-ica/  Soundtrack  The original 1983 soundtrack consisted of 13 tracks recorded by various artists included in the film. A 25th anniversary edition expanded this to 17 tracks, plus a bonus disc of remixes, instrumentals and DJ tools. The album has been described by Allmusic as \\"one of the key records of early 1980s hip-hop\\".

The ABC was an English car manufactured between 1920 and 1929 by ABC Motors. It was a light car (305 kg), powered by a 1203 cc flat-twin, air-cooled engine designed by Granville Bradshaw (the man who was also responsible for the ABC Motorcycle). The engine however was difficult to start, loud, inefficiently lubricated, and prone to breakages, particularly the quite long, exposed push rods. Over time quality improved dramatically. Combined with the vehicle's light weight, the powerplant made the car quite fast for its size, capable of speeds approaching , and boasting quite good acceleration. ABC was originally part of the Harper Bean combine, and was based in Hersham, Surrey and Harper Bean supplied castings, stampings, and forgings utilized on the first ABCs. The car was expensive; in 1920 it sold for ¬£414 but came down to ¬£265 for a four seater in 1923. The \\"radiator\\" cap was actually the fuel tank filler, which led to problems when mechanics unfamiliar with air-cooled cars topped off the fuel tank with water. In 1925 a more refined version came featuring stronger valve gear, a better system of lubrication, and enclosed pushrods. Front-wheel brakes became an option. The company introduced a Super Sports model in 1925 with a 1320 cc engine. This was the only model offered for the last four years of ABC's production.

She was the Conservative Party member of the House of Commons for Sturgeon River‚ÄîParkland between 2015 and 2017, and had previously represented Edmonton‚ÄîSpruce Grove from 2004 to 2015. In her first term as an Opposition MP, she was the Conservative Party's Intergovernmental Affairs critic. Ambrose also served as vice-chair of the Treasury Board and has held multiple cabinet positions as Canada's Minister of Health, Minister of the Environment, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Labour, Minister of Public Works and Government Services, and Minister of Status of Women. She was President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. She is also a former communication consultant and public policy consultant for the Alberta government. On May 15, 2017, she announced her retirement from federal politics to take effect during the summer. The next day, she was named a visiting fellow by the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-canada-institute- names-the-honourable-rona-ambrose-global-fellow She retired on July 4, 2017, stating that she hoped she was \\"able to inspire women to consider public service\\". In August, 2017, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government appointed Ambrose to a 13-member NAFTA advisory council that would provide opinion and feedback on the negotiations with the United States and Mexico. Early life and education Ambrose was born Ronalee Chapchuk in Valleyview, Alberta, as the daughter of Colleen (n√©e Clark) and James Chapchuk.http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf3/2008/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_2008-44.pdfhttp://yourlifemoments.ca/sitepages/printer_friendly_version.asp?oId=554511 She grew up in both Brazil and Parkland County of Alberta. In addition to English, she also speaks Portuguese and Spanish but is less fluent in French. Ambrose has a Bachelor of Arts in women's and gender studies from the University of Victoria and a Master of Arts degree in political science from the University of Alberta. Political views Ambrose is a feminist. Prior to her work in Canadian federal politics, Ambrose's community service included involvement with organizations working to end violence against women; including the Status of Women Action Group, the Victoria Sexual Assault and Sexual Abuse Crisis Centre, and the Edmonton Women's Shelter. Ambrose also calls herself a libertarian and is a fan of Ayn Rand novels such as Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. She was a member of the Trilateral Commission, as reported in Vancouver's Georgia Straight, August 24, 2006. According to the Trilateral Commission's 2018 membership list, Ambrose was a current member of the North American group. Political career Ambrose was first elected as a Member of Parliament in the 2004 federal election for the newly created riding of Edmonton-Spruce Grove in west Edmonton. On February 16, 2005, she made headlines after making a remark in Parliament directed at Liberal Social Development Minister Ken Dryden saying \\"working women want to make their own choices, we don't need old white guys telling us what to do\\", in reference to the Liberal national child care plan.Tory says child-care policy set by 'old white guys' CBC News = Environment Minister = In 2006 elections, Ambrose successfully defended her seat in Edmonton‚ÄìSpruce Grove with 66.8% of the vote in the riding. She was then appointed Environment Minister in Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority government. Ambrose's appointment to cabinet made her the youngest woman appointed to cabinet at the time. On April 7, 2006, Ambrose announced that Canada had no chance of meeting its targets under the Kyoto Protocol and must set more realistic goals for cutting greenhouse gases. \\"My departmental officials and the department officials from natural resources have indicated that it is impossible, impossible for Canada to reach its Kyoto target. And let me be clear. I have been engaging with our international counterparts over the past month, and we are not the only country that is finding itself in this situation\\", said Ambrose. On April 13, 2006, Ambrose stopped an Environment Canada scientist, Mark Tushingham, from speaking at the launch of his science fiction novel, Hotter than Hell, set in a dystopian future caused by global warming. Tushingham's publisher and environmentalists believed this was because the book was not in line with the government's views on climate change, but Ambrose's spokesperson said that the speech was billed as coming from an Environment Canada scientist speaking in official capacity and thus out of process. On April 25, 2006, Ambrose expressed her support of the (now defunct) Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as an alternate to the Kyoto Protocol, because it includes China and India, two large polluting nations that are not bound by the latter agreement. The APP had voluntary emissions reduction targets and was focused on developing technological solutions to solving climate change. In May 2006, Ambrose criticized the previous Liberal government's failure to meet the high targets that they had negotiated at Kyoto, saying, \\"We would have to pull every truck and car off the street, shut down every train and ground every plane to reach the Kyoto target the Liberals negotiated for Canada.\\" In June 2006, opposition discontent over Ambrose's actions as environment minister prompted the NDP and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois to try and table a motion in the Commons environmental committee calling for her resignation. The motion was blocked with the help of the Liberals after the Conservatives said that the motion would be a confidence motion, that if passed would trigger an election in Fall 2006. In August 2006 she stated, \\"I welcome the commitment from British Columbia to preserve and increase the population of Northern Spotted Owls ... It is my opinion that, given the measures they are taking, such as stopping logging in areas currently occupied by the owls, there is no imminent threat to the survival or recovery of the Northern Spotted Owl at this time.\\" On October 19, 2006, Ambrose introduced a Clean Air Act that aimed to reduce the level of greenhouse emissions starting in 2020, cutting them to about half of the 2003 levels by 2050. She also introduced other regulations to industries and vehicles as well as a possible cooperation between the federal government and the provinces to create a system that would report air emissions. In an interview with the media, Ambrose denied that the Conservative government had withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol despite its previous opposition to it. However, industries will have until 2010 before they are expected to reduce emissions, and the government will not have final (and voluntary) targets ready until 2020. Oil companies will have to reduce emissions on a per-barrel basis, reduction proportional to production basis. Ambrose attended the November 2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. A few weeks before Ambrose was shuffled out from the environment portfolio, she told a parliamentary committee that Canada had paid its debts under the Kyoto Protocol only to have an Environment Canada official point out that the bill was still unpaid. = Western Economic Diversification and Intergovernmental Affairs = News stories began to appear in late 2006 of a possible Cabinet shuffle that included shifting Ambrose from her environment portfolio. As part of the January 4, 2007 cabinet shuffle, Ambrose was replaced as Environment Minister by John Baird and became Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. = Minister of Labour and Minister of Public Works and Government Services = After winning reelection in the 2008 election, Ambrose was appointed Labour Minister on October 30, 2008. On January 19, 2010, Ambrose succeeded Christian Paradis and was appointed as the new Minister of Public Works and Government Services where she introduced a major project to improve the way the government administers its pay and pension systems and \\"which will modernize service, introduce efficiencies, and improve our stewardship responsibilities in those areas.\\" That system was to be the Phoenix Pay System. = Minister responsible for the Status of Women = On April 9, 2010, Ambrose was also named Minister responsible for the Status of Women after Helena Guergis was dismissed from Cabinet. The International Day of the Girl Child was formally proposed as a resolution by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly. Rona Ambrose, Canada's Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations in support of the initiative at the 55th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution adopting October 11, 2012, as the inaugural International Day of the Girl Child. On September 26, 2012, Ambrose voted in favour of Motion 312, a motion by Conservative MP Stephen Woodworth that would have directed a Commons committee to revisit the section of the Criminal Code defining at what point human life begins. Viewing the motion as an attempt to re-open debate on abortion laws, Canadian pro-choice groups and Commons opposition parties considered her vote inconsistent with her ministerial role and prompted a call for her resignation. The motion was eventually voted down. Ambrose responded to her critics, stating her concern of discrimination against girls that is made possible by sex-selection abortion. Pro-Life groups praised Ambrose for supporting the Motion. = Minister of Health = Ambrose at a Trilateral with Mercedes Juan L√≥pez and Kathleen Sebelius in 2014 In July 2013, Stephen Harper appointed Rona Ambrose as Minister of Health and kept her as Minister of Western Economic Diversification. While she was an MP, Ambrose worked closely with Nadia Murad, a Yazidi refugee and Nobel Peace Prize winner, in pushing the House of Commons to label the persecution of Yazidis a genocide. She also led the fight for a Canadian refugee program to bring Yazidi women and girls who have been sexually enslaved by ISIS to safety in Canada, which resulted in the rescue of over 1000 women and girls. On June 11, 2015, she made headlines for being \\"outraged\\" that (in a unanimous decision) the Supreme Court of Canada expanded the definition of what constituted medical marijuana to include oils, teas, brownies, etc. from its previous limitation to dried leaves, arguing \\"Marijuana has never gone through the regulatory approval process at Health Canada, which requires rigorous safety reviews and clinical trials with scientific evidence\\". When asked why the testing has not been done when people are taking medical marijuana every day, she responded, \\"It is not my job as Minister. If there is clinical evidence and a company decided ... to submit it to the regulatory approval process, it would be looked at. That has never happened.\\" = Leader of the Opposition = Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative party leader after the party was defeated by the Liberals in the 2015 election. Ambrose, who was elected in the new riding of Sturgeon River- Parkland‚Äîessentially the suburban portion of her old riding‚Äìannounced that she would run for the interim leadership of the Conservative Party. She was elected to that post on November 5, 2015‚Äîbecoming the third woman to hold the post. Ambrose was the third female leader of Canada's major centre-right party. The first was former Prime Minister Kim Campbell who led Canada's now defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and the second was Deborah Grey, of the former Canadian Alliance. She is also the third woman to be Opposition Leader, after Grey and the NDP's Nycole Turmel. All three of them served in an interim capacity. Under the party constitution, as interim leader she was not eligible to run for the leadership at the subsequent Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. On November 13, 2015, Ambrose responded to the terrorist attacks in Paris committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Ambrose stated, \\"The fight against ISIS (ISIL) requires a strong humanitarian response, but also a military response ... It's important that we remain resolute and support our allies.\\" Ambrose supports an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-needs-to-protect- canadian-jobs-from-trump-policies-rona-ambrose/article33466032/ In February 2017, while still a sitting MP, Ambrose introduced Private Member's Bill C-337, An Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code, also known as the JUST Act. If passed, this bill would require judges in Canada to undergo training on sexual assault law, involving education on rape myths, stereotypes about victims, and the impact of trauma on memory. The JUST Act gained widespread support from experts and victim advocacy groups and was subsequently passed unanimously by the House of Commons. However, the bill did not pass third reading in the Senate, as the Senate rose for Summer 2019 without voting on the JUST Act, resulting in expiration on the order paper, as the order paper is wiped clean for the October 2019 federal election. = Resignation from Parliament = In May 2017, Ambrose announced to her caucus that she would leave federal politics at the end of the spring session of Parliament, in June 2017, several weeks after her successor as Conservative leader is chosen.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rona-ambrose-conservative- mp-1.4116233 = Post resignation = Ambrose has stated that though she supports the merger of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and the Wildrose Party, she will not be a candidate for the leadership of the proposed new United Conservative Party of Alberta.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ambrose-pc-wildrose-merger-1.4121908 She joined the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington, D.C. based think tank, as a visiting fellow focused on Canadian‚ÄìAmerican trade and to lead the organization's campaign to educate officials in both countries about the benefits of an integrated North American economy. She was also appointed a member of the NAFTA advisory council set up by the Trudeau Liberal government in August 2017. In 2018, Rona Ambrose and Laureen Harper, wife of former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, launched the She Leads Foundation. She Leads is a non-profit organization based in Alberta focused on encouraging women to run for office and participate in public life. Alongside UN Women, Ambrose assisted in the launch of SHEInnovates Alberta, a campaign providing tools necessary to encourage women to seek leadership positions and innovation. In May 2020, it was announced that Rona Ambrose had joined the board of directors of the e-cigarette company Juul. Personal life Ambrose is married to J.P. Veitch, a private investment businessman and former rodeo bull rider. She was previously married to Bruce Ambrose from 1994 to 2011. Following Andrew Scheer's resignation after the Conservative loss in the 2019 Canadian federal election, Ambrose faced pressure from many prominent Conservatives to run for party leader in the 2020 leadership race. Ambrose announced she would not run for party leader in January 2020, during a Facebook live stream in the Alberta mountains. She joined the Board of Directors of JUUL Labs Inc in May 2020. Honours In 2008, Ambrose was No. 17 on the Western Standard's \\"Liberty 100\\" top Canadian \\"pro-freedom activists, journalists, think-tankers and partisans\\".

Early life Whittingham was born in Heaton, West Yorkshire, England, and educated at Charterhouse between 1924 and 1929. He then went up Lincoln College, Oxford to read law. During the early 1930s he was briefly engaged to the Wrigley heiress, Ada Elizabeth Offield. Between 1932 and 1937, Whittingham worked for a number of newspapers and in 1937 joined Alexander Korda as a contract screenwriter. During the Second World War, he was based on Iceland with an artillery regiment. Film career Beginning with the film Q Planes in 1938, Whittingham was a prolific screenwriter. Between 1937 and 1948, he wrote 14 screenplays for companies including RKO, Associated British Picture Corporation, British National and Ealing Studios. =Ealing Studios= In 1948 he was a contracted screenwriter for Ealing Studios. He wrote the original story and screenplay for Cage of Gold (1950), Pool of London (1951), Hunted (1952), The Divided Heart (1954) and the screenplay for I Believe in You (1954), Mandy (1952) and West of Zanzibar (1954). =British Lion= In 1956 he joined British Lion Films where he wrote The Birthday Present (1957). =Thunderball= Whittingham collaborated with Ian Fleming and producer Kevin McClory on a screenplay for a James Bond film. However, when Fleming developed cold feet about McClory as producer of this first James Bond screenplay, he novelised the work into his ninth official novel, Thunderball; however, the novel only credited Fleming. McClory and Whittingham then sued Fleming, which led to a settlement in 1963 that gave McClory the film rights to the novel. During the lawsuit, Whittingham stepped down as 'co-plaintiff' and stood by McClory as 'principal witness', having previously signed away all his rights \\"of whatsoever nature\\" entirely when the screenplay was presumed finished. As a result of the settlement, future versions of the novel were forced to credit, based on the screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming (in that order). Two adaptations of Thunderball were subsequently made, the first being Thunderball in 1965 as part of the series of films from Eon Productions. The second adaptation was the film Never Say Never Again in 1983. Further adaptations had been planned at one point or another by McClory, but were scrapped due to lawsuits from MGM and United Artists. In the film Thunderball, credits are somewhat complex. Like a good number of James Bond films, it was promoted as being \\"Ian Fleming's\\". The screenplay was credited to Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins. However, it was also credited as having been \\"based on an original screenplay by Jack Whittingham,\\" which also was credited as being \\"based on the original story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming\\". Whittingham's sole original screenplay credit has been omitted from posters and other promotional materials. =Post Thunderball= Whittingham worked on screenplays about the lives of Ian Fleming (The Life of Ian Fleming) and Oleg Penkovsky. Personal life In 1942 he married Margot Isobel Gough and they had a daughter, Suilven (Sylvan) born 2 December 1943, and boy, Jonathan, born 5 June 1946.

He has been nominated for five Eisner Awards. Career Harris began his comics career in 1989. Initially, he flitted from assignment to assignment and worked on T-shirts and ads to pay the bills during dry spells in his comics work. He rose to prominence in 1994 with the publication of DC comics‚Äô Starman. Summarizing his career up to this point, he remarked \\"When you jump around as a freelancer, it's easy to have your attention span dwindle down to that of a gnat. When I got Starman, I had to buckle down and just get serious about the work.\\" Co- created with James Robinson, Starman led the two to critical acclaim and eventually an Eisner Award for the \\"Sand and Stars\\" story arc.1997 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners at the Comic Book Awards Almanac After four and a half years on Starman, Harris left to pursue other projects but remained the cover artist on for another year and a half. During this time he was also one of the original members of Atlanta's Gaijin Studios. He pencilled the series Ex Machina with Brian K.

In April of 2013, Harris was paid by Comic Book Store Owner Mike McDaniel of Heroes and Villains in Warner Robins, GA for a commission to honor Bert Christman, a Golden Age comic book creator who died in World War Two. Despite repeated inquires by McDaniel on the status of the commission, Harris has not completed the work and McDaniel remains not refunded. McDaniel went public on his store's Facebook page in June of 2019 with the issue. In October 2019, Harris had failed to deliver a $1200 commission to fan Seth Talley. Talley had paid for the commission seven years prior. Talley had reached out to Harris' agent, who reported that Harris had not worked on them. Comic news website \\"Bleeding Cool\\" reached out to Harris, who provided visual evidence of the commission, but then reported he would be destroying the piece rather than finishing it. After Bleeding Cool ran an article on the matter, Talley was repaid via the CashApp. Technique Harris makes extensive use of models and photo reference in his work, and composes panels featuring multiple characters with models he uses to represent specific characters.

Biography = Early career= Todd Klein broke into comics in the summer of 1977, hired by DC Comics as a staff production worker. This job entailed pasting together text pages (such as letter columns), putting logos, display lettering, and type on covers, and doing art and lettering corrections on comics pages. Other staffers included colorists Bob LeRose and Anthony Tollin, writer Bob Rozakis, inker Steve Mitchell, and letterer John Workman. Over the next months and years, Klein tried his hand at all those things, but found lettering suited him best. Workman helped Klein get started with the basic tools and techniques, and Klein studied the work of Gaspar Saladino, Workman, Ben Oda, and John Costanza; as well as Marvel Comics letterers Tom Orzechowski, Jim Novak, and Joe Rosen. Klein landed his first freelance lettering job in the fall of 1977, and by late 1977 was entrusted with an entire issue: Firestorm #1.Klein, Todd. \\"How I Began,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering - Logos - Design. Retrieved July 22, 2008. =Freelancer= In the 1980s, Klein mainly worked for DC, where in addition to lettering many of their titles, he also designed logos and title headers for various letter pages. As DC emerged from a late 1970s/early 1980s slump, new opportunities opened up for freelancers. Klein got more work as a letterer (and also a fair amount as a writer), keeping him very busy. Books he worked on during this period included Alan Moore's Swamp Thing, Batman: Year One, and Detective Comics; as well as his own scripts for Omega Men. As a freelancer, Klein also performed production work on such works as Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen, Frank Miller's Ronin, and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. In the 1990s, despite being a freelancer, Klein worked for long periods on a number of comics titles, including the entire runs of Suicide Squad (1987‚Äì1992), Sandman (1989‚Äì1996), The Spectre (1992‚Äì1998), The Dreaming (1996‚Äì2001), and The Invisibles (1997‚Äì2000) for DC/Vertigo; and Deathblow (1994‚Äì1996) for Image Comics). He also has long stints on DC's Batman (1990‚Äì1992 and 1996‚Äì1999); The Demon (1990‚Äì1994); Shade, the Changing Man (1990‚Äì1994); and Batman: Shadow of the Bat (1992‚Äì1994); as well as Marvel's Captain America (1998‚Äì2002) and Earth X (1999‚Äì2000). In the 2000s, Klein lettered all the Alan Moore America's Best Comics titles, including Promethea, Tom Strong, and Top 10. He also lettered the entire runs of Marvel's Universe X (2000‚Äì2001); DC/Vertigo's Fables (2002‚Äì2015), Books of Magick: Life During Wartime (2005‚Äì2006), Justice (2005‚Äì2007), Jack of Fables (2006‚Äì2011), and Simon Dark (2007‚Äì2009). Klein has also spent long periods on DC's Detective Comics (2000‚Äì2003); Wonder Woman (2003‚Äì2006) and Vertigo's Testament (2006‚Äì2008). = Sandman = Klein is most known for his work on Neil Gaiman's Sandman, where he developed very distinctive dialogue balloons and lettering for various characters, especially Dream and his siblings. Klein discussed the process by which he came up with these distinctive styles on his website: \\"Each of them needed some sort of special lettering style, . . .to show that they are all equals in their iconic power. Destiny's speech was simply italic (really just slanted) [...] Neil had a specific idea about Delirium's style, that it represent a sort of mad variety, getting louder and softer, like something going in and out of focus. This was fun to do in small amounts, but tedious in large ones. Despair just had a rough balloon edge to denote a ragged, rough voice. (Destruction, when we finally met him, had an extra bold border to denote a loud, booming voice.)\\"\\"Klein, Todd. \\"Lettering: Sandman/Neil Gaiman,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering - Logos - Design. Retrieved July 22, 2008. As comics critic Alan Donald notes in this discussion at Silver Bullet Comic Books, \\"Klein's work on Sandman was not simply distinctive but revolutionary, and showed a trend that should have been followed. The letterer‚Äôs art would have been forced to the fore and one could have seen ou(r) beautiful synergistic art form become further enriched by this new trend.\\"  Technique  To read about Klein's technique one need look no further than The DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics, published by Watson-Guptill Publications. In this guide, Klein gives a thorough review of how he mentally approaches a page and then goes about doing the actual lettering, either by hand (pen and ink), or by use of the computer (Adobe Illustrator). = Computer lettering = Klein saw the growing prevalence of computerized lettering in the early 1990s and quickly realized it was the wave of the future. He had met Comicraft owners Richard Starkings and John Gaushell at the 1993 San Diego Comic-Con, and in 1994, he asked them to help him get started with computer lettering by creating a few fonts based on Klein's hand lettering. Klein bought his first Macintosh computer in late 1994 and started learning how to make fonts himself. Since 1995, Klein has created a library of over 100 of his own fonts.Klein, Todd. \\"Computer lettering,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering - Logos - Design. Retrieved July 23, 2008. The first book that Klein fully computer lettered was Image Comics' Deathblow #20.  Logos  Klein began creating logos for DC when he started there in 1977. Most of his logos were for DC until he became a full-time freelancer in 1987, when he began creating logos for other companies as well.Klein, Todd. \\"Todd Klein Logos: Hand-Lettered Favorites,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering - Logos - Design. Accessed Oct. 15, 2008. Some of the notable logos he created during the period 1977-1995 include the Batman logo used for the Batman: Year One storyline, The New Teen Titans (including character logos for team members Nightwing, Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, the Changeling, and Jericho), Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld, Camelot 3000, Doctor Strange, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Magneto. From 1995 to the present, most of Klein's logos have been done on the computer (although many began as hand-drawn sketches that were scanned and traced in Adobe Illustrator).Klein, Todd. \\"Todd Klein Logos: Computer-Created Favorites,\\" Todd Klein: Lettering - Logos - Design.

It served as the basis for Aston Martin's production cars up until the introduction of the Aston Martin DB11 in 2016, which featured an all-new bonded-aluminium platform that would underpin future Aston Martins. The VH platform was used in all of Aston Martin's lineup at the time excluding the One-77, which uses Carbon Architecture and the Cygnet which is based on the Toyota iQ. There are four variations of the VH platform. Variants =Pre-VH Vanquish and VH Generation I= The original first-generation Aston Martin Vanquish used an advanced and complex carbon fiber and aluminium chassis that predated the VH platform. However, experience building the V12 Vanquish led Aston Martin to develop a simpler platform that would go on to underpin all future Aston Martins. While the original V12 Vanquish is not considered to be a VH platform car, some consider it to be the \\"Ur-VH\\" platform vehicle as elements of the Vanquish evolved into the VH architecture. The first true VH Chassis made its debut in the Aston Martin DB9 in 2004, and has underpinned the DB9 through the course of its production run from 2004 to 2012. It was refined in 2008 for the 2009 model year DB9. The 2013 model year DB9 was underpinned by the Generation III platform (VH300), where it shared carbon fibre components and hardware technology from the Generation III architecture that was used in the 2011 Virage and the second-generation Vanquish (VH310) in 2012. =VH Generation II= The second VH platform underpinned the 2005 Aston Martin V8 Vantage and its V12 and S variants, as well as the Vantage V12 S based Zagato (VH290Z) and the bespoke Aston Martin DB10 concept car for the James Bond film Spectre. The DB10 was based on the V8 Vantage chassis albeit with modifications, as it featured a longer wheelbase and is nearly as wide as the Aston Martin One-77. This platform was also used in the 2007 DBS. =VH Generation III= The third VH platform underpinned the 2011 Virage and facelifted DB9 (VH300), Virage Volante and facelifted DB9 Volante (VH340), the Vanquish (VH310), the Vanquish S (VH320) and the Vanquish Volante/Vanquish S Volante (VH340). It was also used as the platform for the Vanquish Zagato (VH319Z), the Vanquish Zagato Volante (VH340Z), the Vanquish Zagato Speedster (VH3612ZS), the Vanquish Zagato Roadster (VH3410Z) and the Vanquish Zagato Shooting Brake (VH324ZB). =VH Generation IV= Based on VH Generation III, Generation IV is a stretched and re-engineered Generation III platform used on the Rapide (VH410/VH410D) and its variants.

After 2015 bankruptcy, the club had used A.S.D. Reggio Calabria as the new name of the new legal person, and then the club changed to the denomination Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l. in 2016. Since 2019, Reggina 1914 S.r.l.. History The club was founded on 11 January 1914. =Serie A (1999‚Äì2009)= In the late 1990s to 2000s, Reggina have been alternating between the top two levels of the Italian league system. They reached the Italian top division Serie A for the first time in 1999. Two years later, they lost a relegation playout to Verona, being consequently relegated to 2001‚Äì02 Serie B. Reggina finished third in Serie B in 2002, earning a return to Serie A. In 2003, Reggina survived a relegation playout against Atalanta. They would spend the next 7 years maintaining their Serie A status until their eventual relegation in the 2008‚Äì09 season. They were indicted in 2006 for sporting fraud as part of the second wave of Serie A scandal investigations. Originally punished with a 15-point deduction for the 2006‚Äì07 Serie A season, then reduced to 11 points following appeal. Despite the heavy deduction of points, Reggina managed to save themselves from relegation, defeating newly crowned UEFA Champions League winners Milan on the final matchday and ending the season with 40 points (including the deduction), just one single point above the third relegation spot, occupied by Chievo. They however poorly started their 2007‚Äì08 campaign, causing head coach Massimo Ficcadenti to be sacked and replaced by Renzo Ulivieri. A third managerial change, with Ulivieri fired and replacing with team scout Nevio Orlandi, proved to be successful as Reggina improved their results and performances, escaping relegation with key wins at Catania, and home to Empoli. Orlandi was subsequently confirmed at the helm of the amaranto for the 2008‚Äì09 season. =Serie B (2009‚Äì2014)= Since their relegation in 2008‚Äì09 season, Reggina has become slightly inconsistent in their attempts to return to Italy's top flight. The 2009‚Äì10 season would see three coaches at the helm; Walter Novellino, Ivo Iaconi, Roberto Breda. Despite possessing Bonazzoli, Carmona, Tedesco, Brienza and home grown star Missiroli they were unable to gain a better position than 13th. Disappointing for a team just relegated from the top division. Top goal scorer for the campaign was Brienza with 12. The 2010‚Äì11 season was regarded as one of the Amaranto's best in Serie B. Shockingly they would conduct their usual coaching merry go round, as Gianluca Atzori would lead them to a 6th-place finish and playoffs to Serie A. they would stumble at the last hurdle losing to Novara in a two legged play off. Top players include; Acerbi, Missiroli, Tedesco, Brienza, Bonazzoli (C) and Milan Loanee Adiyiah. Top goal scorer: Bonazzoli with 19 goals The 2011‚Äì12 season was another disappointing season from the Amaranto, with a 12th-placed finish. Two coaches took charge of Reggina this season; Roberto Breda initially, before being sacked and replaced by Angelo Gregucci, only to be replaced by Breda again towards the end of the season. Unlike the previous season they did not make the play-offs. Top players in this season's squad include: Adejo, Emerson, (Ramos Borges Emerson), Missiroli, Bonazzoli (C), and Ceravolo. Top scorcer was Ceravolo with 11 The 2012‚Äì13 season would be marred with yet another controversy similar to that of 2006. Reggina were penalised for the latest match fixing scandal that hit Italian shores and were given a ‚àí4 penalty as a result. After appeal it was reduced to ‚àí2 instead. They were in contention for playoff places right until the last few rounds where poor form saw them end the season in 11th place. The 2013‚Äì14 season ended in disaster, as Reggina won just six out of 42 games and finished second bottom, resulting in relegation to Lega Pro. The season also marked Foti's retirement from his role as president, who was handed over to Giuseppe Ranieri. =Lega Pro= For the club's 2014‚Äì15 Lega Pro campaign, Reggina began the season with former captain Francesco Cozza as head coach. After a difficult start to the season and two coaching changes, youth team coach and former player Giacomo Tedesco was hired as head coach for the final three weeks of the season. Despite winning two of the final three matches, Reggina finished last in the league and would have to rely on an appeal of their point penalty to lift them out of the relegation zone. The appeal was successful and 2 points were returned to move them out of last place. Tedesco guided the team to survival in the playout over rivals Messina. =Serie D one-year stint= Despite avoiding relegation in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Reggina failed to meet the deadline to register for Lega Pro and the club declared bankruptcy. A new legal person of the club, \\"A.S.D. Reggio Calabria\\", was formed to play in Serie D for the 2015‚Äì16 season, Reggio Calabria ended the season in 4th place, losing in the first round of playoffs against Cavese. During the season the club also re- incorporated from associazione sportiva dilettantistica to societ√† sportiva dilettantistica a responsabilit√† limitata legal form. Reggio Calabria was owned by Mimmo Pratic√≤, former regional president of CONI. =Back to Serie C= In June 2016, it was reported that the club was renamed from \\"S.S.D. Reggio Calabria a r.l.\\" to \\"S.S.D. Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914 a r.l.\\". The club was then renamed as Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l.. Despite finishing as the losing side of the first round of the promotion playoffs of 2015‚Äì16 Serie D, the club filed for Lega Pro (later renamed Serie C) repechage to fill one of the vacancies for the 2016‚Äì17 season and was successfully admitted. Reggina ended the season in 13th place. In January 2019, facing a crisis with a potential player strike due to non-payment of salaries, the club was sold to Italian entrepreneur Luca Gallo. On 1 July 2019, the club announced to change the name to \\"Reggina 1914 S.r.l.\\". =Serie B return= Reggina won its Serie C group in 2020, earning a promotion back to the Serie B for the upcoming season. The team upon its Serie B return included experienced players from higher levels including J√©r√©my M√©nez and Germ√°n Denis. Rivalries Reggina are fierce rivals with neighbours Messina, who are just a twenty-minute ferry ride apart from each other. Twice every season they clash in the Derby dello Stretto (Strait of Messina Derby). In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Reggina defeated Messina in both legs of the playout to send Messina down to Serie D. There is also a major Calabrian derby between Reggina and Crotone, but both teams have not played in the same league in over five years. Currently in Serie C, Reggina has a derby with fellow Calabrian team Catanzaro. Colours and badges Reggina used a logo with a letter R and a football on it. Some variant of the logo, had 1986, the year of foundation of Reggina Calcio on it. Due to 2015 bankruptcy, the new owner introduced a new logo as the old design was tied to the old legal person of the club. Due to 2016 renaming, some modification was introduced, which a letter R was re-introduced in the logo. However, the design of the ball on the 2016 logo was different from the historical logo, which the 2016 logo used a leather ball. In 2019, the club reverted to use the historical design of the logo. Players =Current squad= =On loan= Notable players Managerial history Reggina have had many managers and trainers throughout the history of the club, in some seasons more than one manager was in charge.

C170 ","title":"Ford C170 platform"},{"id":"850381","text":"Mike Mignola (; born September 16, 1960) is an American comics artist and writer best known for creating Hellboy for Dark Horse Comics, part of a shared universe of titles including B.P.R.D., Abe Sapien, Lobster Johnson, Witchfinder and various spinoffs. He has also created other supernatural and paranormal themed titles for Dark Horse including Baltimore, Joe Golem and The Amazing Screw-On Head. Mignola's film work includes Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001), Blade II (2002), the 2004 adaptation of Hellboy, its 2008 sequel and 2019 reboot. Early life Mike Mignola was born September 16, 1960. He was raised Catholic. Career =Marvel and DC= Mignola was born in Berkeley, California. He began his career in 1980 by illustrating spots in The Comic Reader. His first published piece was in The Comic Reader #183, a spot illustration of Red Sonja (pg. 9). His first published front cover was The Comic Reader #196 in November 1981. In 1982 he graduated from the California College of the Arts with a BFA in Illustration. In 1983 he worked as an inker at Marvel Comics on Daredevil and Power Man and Iron Fist and later on titles such as The Incredible Hulk, Alpha Flight, and the Rocket Raccoon limited series. In 1987, he began working for DC Comics as well. He drew the Phantom Stranger and World of Krypton limited series. With writer Jim Starlin, Mignola produced the Cosmic Odyssey miniseries in 1988. Mignola drew covers for several Batman stories, including \\"Batman: A Death in the Family\\"Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 235: \\"Written by Jim Starlin, with art by Jim Aparo and haunting covers by Mike Mignola, 'A Death in the Family' proved a best seller with readers in both single-issue and trade paperback form.\\" and \\"Dark Knight, Dark City\\". Writer Brian Augustyn and Mignola crafted the Gotham by Gaslight one-shot in 1989.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 241: \\"An 'alternate history of the Batman' was spawned in this dark prestige format one-shot by writer Brian Augustyn and artist Mike Mignola.\\" Through the early 1990s Mignola worked on covers and backup features for various DC and Marvel Comics. He collaborated twice with writer Howard Chaykin. In 1990-1991, they produced the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser limited series for Epic Comics, with inker Al Williamson. This was followed with the Ironwolf: Fires of the Revolution graphic novel in 1992. =Hellboy and related spinoffs= Hellboy Prior to 1994 Mignola had done work-for-hire illustration. That year, Dark Horse Comics released Hellboy: Seed of Destruction, Mignola's creator-owned project. Though he wrote the story himself, it was scripted by John Byrne. The next Hellboy story, The Wolves of Saint August, was completely written and drawn by Mignola. Since then all Hellboy stories have been written solely by Mignola with the exception of They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships, which was co-written by Joshua Dysart. Makoma (2006) was the first Hellboy story not drawn by Mignola, featuring the art of Richard Corben. Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series. Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including Jason Shawn Alexander, Kevin Nowlan and Scott Hampton. In 2007, following after 2005's The Island, British artist Duncan Fegredo took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of Hellboy from Darkness Calls onwards. Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for Hellboy in 2012 for the ongoing series, Hellboy in Hell. The series is currently published sporadically, but multiple-issue stories are monthly. Abe Sapien In 1998 the first Hellboy spinoff, Abe Sapien, was launched. It was not written by Mike Mignola, but it did feature his Hellboy short story \\"Heads\\" as a back-up. Abe Sapien did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008's The Drowning. Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with Scott Allie as the lead writer with Mignola. Lobster Johnson Lobster Johnson was the next spinoff, debuting as a back-up feature in 1999's Box Full of Evil. The series got its own title later in 2007's Lobster Johnson: The Iron Prometheus. It returned again with the miniseries The Burning Hand in 2012, followed by various short stories. B.P.R.D. B.P.R.D. was the third spinoff, but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story, but rather a series of stories. It began with 2002's Hollow Earth, which continued on from Hellboy: Conqueror Worm. Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B.P.R.D. series could be. 2004's Plague of Frogs was the story that solidified what the series was, and would set the direction for future books to come, so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs. A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with John Arcudi and drawn by Guy Davis. B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the Plague of Frogs cycle. Guy Davis left the series in 2011 with the conclusion of Hell on Earth: Gods. Tyler Crook became the new ongoing artist beginning with Hell on Earth: Monsters, but he is joined by several regular artists, most notably James Harren and Laurence Campbell. Continuing where Hell on Earth left off, The Devil You Know is written by Mike Mignola and Scott Allie with Laurence Campbell serving as the regular artist. Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder (more commonly known simply as \\"Witchfinder\\") began with a teaser story in 2008's MySpace Dark Horse Presents #16, followed by a full miniseries in 2009. It follows the stories of the occult investigator, Sir Edward, agent of Queen Victoria. Frankenstein The Frankenstein began with Frankenstein Underground in 2015. Set in 1956, this miniseries follows Frankenstein (in the Hellboy Universe, the Frankenstein monster takes his father's name) as he ventures into the Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth. This also canonized Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. The series was further expanded in 2020 with Frankenstein Undone, a direct sequel to Shelley's novel. Spinoff miniseries The Hellboy Universe also includes numerous spinoffs that only span a single book: * Sledgehammer 44: Set in World War II, this series is about the Epimetheus Vril Energy Suit created by Doctor Helena Gallargas. * Frankenstein Underground: Set in 1956, this series follows the Frankenstein monster as he ventures into the Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth. * Rise of the Black Flame: Set in 1923, this series explores how Raimund Diestel became the Black Flame. * The Visitor: How & Why He Stayed: This series follows the life of an alien visitor set to kill the infant Hellboy in 1944. * Rasputin: The Voice of the Dragon: Set in 1941, this series follows Trevor Bruttenholm as he becomes an agent for the allied forces in World war II. * Koshchei the Deathless: Hellboy and Koshchei sit in a pub in Hell and chat. =The Outerverse= Baltimore began with a 2007 illustrated novel, and continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden. Like Baltimore, Joe Golem: Occult Detective began as an illustrated prose novel (2012's Joe Golem and the Drowning City) and later continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden and exists in a shared universe with Baltimore called \\"The Outerverse\\". Style Alan Moore has described Mignola's style as \\"German expressionism meets Jack Kirby\\". His style has also been likened to an amalgamation of Jack Kirby and Alex Toth. Film and television Mignola worked as an illustrator for Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 movie Bram Stoker's Dracula. He was also the production designer for the Disney feature film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire in 2001, and was a concept artist for 2002's Blade II, also directed by del Toro, and a concept artist for Pixar's Brave. Mignola was hired by Bruce Timm to provide character designs for Batman: The Animated Series in 1991. His redesign of Mr. Freeze was used for the series. Mignola's design of the 1880s Batman costume from the comic Batman: Gotham by Gaslight appeared in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Hellboy was made into a feature film in 2004 by director Guillermo del Toro. Mignola was closely involved with the movie's production, and a sequel was released in 2008. Hellboy has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, Sword of Storms in 2006 and Blood and Iron in 2007. Mignola's The Amazing Screw-On Head debuted in 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel, starring the voices of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce.\\"Fanboy Radio #353 - Mike Mignola LIVE\\" . Fanboy Radio. November 30, 2006. Mignola worked on the script for the R-rated Hellboy reboot film (2019), that was directed by Neil Marshall, and starred David Harbour as Hellboy. He ended up receiving only a \\"based on\\" credit in the film. Personal life As of 2014, Mignola resides in Los Angeles with his wife and daughter. Regarding the influence of his religious upbringing on his artwork, Mignola explained in a 2014 interview, \\"No, I don't believe in anything, really. Not on a conscious level. That is the beauty of it. I was raised Catholic. I was taught a bunch of stuff. I find religion fascinating, but at no time does any of that tie my hands. I get to play with stuff without getting to reverential. There's some Miltonian stuff to the geography of my Hell, the Hell I'm doing is much closer to the world I created in The Amazing Screw-On Head. It's this pile, this jumble of old buildings for the most part. It's entirely made out of everything I want to draw.\\" Awards * 1995: ** Won \\"Best Writer/Artist\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Seed of Destruction ** Won \\"Best Graphic Album: Reprint\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Seed of Destruction ** Won \\"Best Artist\\" Harvey Awards ** Won \\"Best Achievement by an Inker\\" Don Thompson Award * 1996: ** Won \\"Best Artist\\" Harvey Awards ** Won \\"Best Graphic Album of Previously Released Material\\" Harvey Awards, for Hellboy: The Wolves of Saint August * 1997: ** Won \\"Best Writer/Artist\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Wake the Devil * 1998: ** Won \\"Best Writer/Artist\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Almost Colossus, Hellboy Christmas Special and Hellboy Jr. Halloween Special * 2000: ** Won \\"Best Artist\\" Harvey Award, for Hellboy: Box Full of Evil * 2002: ** Won \\"Best Finite Series/Limited Series\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Conqueror Worm * 2003: ** Won \\"Best Humor Publication\\" Eisner Award, for The Amazing Screw-On Head ** Won \\"Best Short Story\\" Eisner Award, for \\"The Magician and the Snake\\" * 2004: ** Won \\"Favourite Comics Writer/Artist\\" Eagle Award ** Won \\"Best Comics-Related Book\\" Eisner Award, for The Art of Hellboy ** Received \\"Inkpot Award\\" * 2006: ** Won \\"Favourite Comics Writer/Artist\\" Eagle Award * 2007: ** Won \\"Roll of Honour\\" Eagle Award ** Won \\"Favourite Colour Comicbook ‚Äì American\\" Eagle Award, for Hellboy: Darkness Calls * 2008 ** Won \\"Best Cover Artist\\" Harvey Awards ** Won \\"Award for Favourite Colour Comicbook ‚Äì American\\" Eagle Award ** Won \\"Roll of Honor\\" Eagle Awards ** Won \\"Best Horror Comic Book\\" Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards, for Hellboy: In the Chapel of Moloch * 2009 ** Won \\"Best Finite Series/Limited Series\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: The Crooked Man ** Won \\"Best Graphic Album: Reprint\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy Library Edition, vols. 1 and 2 ** Won \\"Best Publication Design\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy Library Edition, vols. 1 and 2 ** Won \\"All-in-One Award\\" Inkwell Awards * 2010 ** Won \\"Best Cover Artist\\" Harvey Awards, for Hellboy: Bride of Hell * 2011 ** Won \\"Favorite Writer/Artist\\" Eagle Award ** Won \\"Favorite Artist:Inks\\" Eagle Award ** Won \\"Best Single Issue (or One-Shot)\\" Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Double Feature of Evil *2019 ** Harvey Awards Hall of Fame inductee.

Ryan (born February 21, 1946) is an American sportswriter, formerly with The Boston Globe, and author. He has been described as \\"the quintessential American sportswriter\\" and a basketball guru,Dan Shaughnessy, Bill Simmons, and many others and is well known for his coverage of the sport including his famous stories covering the Boston Celtics in the 1970s. After graduating from Boston College, Ryan started as a sports intern for the Globe on the same day as Peter Gammons,SportsFanMag.com article and later worked with other notable Globe sportswriters Will McDonough and Leigh Montville. In early 2012, Ryan announced his retirement from sports writing after 44 years, effective at the conclusion of the 2012 Summer Olympics. His final column in the Globe was published August 12, 2012. Biography and career Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Ryan grew up in a house \\"that revolved around going to games,\\"Replacement Level Podcast: Featuring Bob Ryan, http://www.replacementlevelpodcast.com/?p=38 and went to high school at the Lawrenceville School from 1960 to 1964. He graduated from Boston College as a history major in 1968. =Celtics beat writer= In the fall of 1969, a vacancy on the Celtics beat of The Boston Globe was created, and Ryan got the job. Ryan was hired by the paper's morning sports editor Francis Rosa. While covering the Celtics, Ryan developed a close relationship with the Celtics organization. Ryan would even go out to dinner with the team. Ryan sat at the press table eight seats from the Celtics' bench, where colleagues referred to him as the \\"Commissioner\\", not unlike Peter Gammons's nickname. Boston Sports Media critic Bruce AllenOf bostonsportsmedia.com has said, \\"His passion is not faked.\\"Post on bostonsportsmedia.com, \\"10 people whose work I enjoy in the Boston Sports Media\\", Ryan is included on the list, also included fellow sports columnist at the Globe Jackie MacMullan One night Hue Hollins, the referee, went to the press table to explain a call to Ryan during a time-out even though he was not obligated to. Another time Ryan wrote a column about the Washington Bullets' Rick Mahorn and how he played dirty under the hoop. When Mahorn was called for a foul Gene Shue, the Bullets' coach, turned around and said, \\"That's your fault, Bob Ryan, your fault!\\" Dennis Johnson was often annoyed with Ryan and would go up to the press table and say, \\"Hey, Bob, keep it down. We got a game going on here\\" when Ryan sideline coached.Ever Green by Dan Shaughnessy, p. 46-7 From Ryan's first column on Larry Bird headlined \\"Celtics draft Bird for oh what a future\\" to his last \\"Larry! Larry! Larry!\\" Ryan was always a fan of his and eventually co-authored a book with him.The Boston Globe June 10, 1976 and February 25, 1993 In Tom Heinsohn's book Give 'em the Hook, Heinsohn is negative towards Ryan. Ryan, who began writing for the Globe in Heinsohn's rookie season as a coach, would make friends with the players and vent their feelings towards Heinsohn, their fans, and their teammates, claims Heinsohn. Heinsohn didn't like how he didn't feel in control of his team. Heinsohn believes that Ryan started to \\"think of himself as another member of the family\\" and that he even started coaching the team through his beat stories. Heinsohn goes on to talk about Ryan's bloated ego and the fact that he was then thinking of himself as a basketball guru. Heinsohn also says while noting disapproval of Ryan that at the time anyone who lived in Boston and even remotely followed basketball read Bob Ryan.Give Em' the Hook by Tom Heinsohn, Joe Fitzgerald In recent years Ryan has been less critical of Celtics coaches, including Doc Rivers, of whom he said, \\"I'm a Doc guy.\\" = General sports columnist = In 1982, Ryan would hand the torch of the Globe Celtics beat to the not-yet well-known Dan Shaughnessy, and later Jackie MacMullan. He did this in order to go to Boston television station WCVB for a couple of years. Ryan ended up hating it and moved back to the Celtics beat in 1984 for two more seasons, before getting promoted to general sports columnist in 1989.A bio of him on a page of one of his books Ryan would cover 20 NBA finals, 20 Final Fours, nine World Series, five Super Bowls, the last seven Olympics and many other events. Later, Ryan became less basketball-oriented and more general sports-oriented. He continues to write for Basketball Times. Ryan is a voter for the Baseball Hall of Fame.Column in The Boston Globe, 11/28/06 = Awards = * National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association National Sportswriter of the Year four times (2000, 2007, 2008, 2009). * College Basketball Writers and New England Basketball Halls of Fame. * 1996 Curt Gowdy Award from the Basketball Hall of Fame * 2000 Associated Press \\"National Sportswriter of the Year\\" * 2006 Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism * 2015 PEN/ESPN Lifetime Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing = Retirement = At 60, Ryan wanted his retirement from the job to be graceful: \\"I'm not bitter. I enjoy my job and I still think I do it well, but they are chipping away, chipping away and they are making it far less pleasurable. I want to get out when I feel like getting out. If you stay around too long, there is no way you can dictate your terms,\\" he said. Ryan also asked, \\"How do you explain to Stephen A. Smith that he has no idea of the game and how much fun it was?

From August 2007 to December 2010, Waid served as Editor- in-Chief, and later, Chief Creative Officer of Boom! Studios, where he wrote titles such as Irredeemable, Incorruptible, and The Traveler. Early life Waid was born in Hueytown, Alabama. He has stated that his comics work was heavily influenced by Adventure Comics #369‚Äì370 (1968), the two-part \\"Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story by Jim Shooter and Mort Weisinger that introduced the villain Mordru, was \\"a blueprint for everything I write.\\" Career =1980s‚Äì1990s= Waid entered the comics field during the mid-1980s as an editor and writer on Fantagraphics Books' comic book fan magazine, Amazing Heroes. Waid's first comic book story \\"The Puzzle of the Purloined Fortress\\", an eight-page Superman story, was published in Action Comics #572 (Oct. 1985). In 1987, Waid was hired as an editor for DC Comics where he worked on such titles as Action Comics, Doom Patrol, Infinity, Inc., Legion of Super-Heroes, Secret Origins, and Wonder Woman, as well as various one-shots including Batman: Gotham by Gaslight. With Gotham by Gaslight, and in tandem with writer Brian Augustyn, Waid co-created DC's Elseworlds imprint. In 1989 Waid left editorial work for freelance writing assignments. He worked for DC's short- lived Impact Comics line where he wrote The Comet and scripted dialogue for Legend of the Shield. In 1992 Waid began the assignment which would bring him to wider recognition in the comics industry, when he was hired to write The Flash by editor Brian Augustyn. Waid stayed on the title for an eight-year run. He wrote a Metamorpho limited series in 1993 and created the character known as Impulse in The Flash #92 (July 1994).Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 265: \\"The brainchild of writer Mark Waid and artist Mike Wieringo, Impulse burst onto the scene at quite a pace.\\" Impulse was launched into his own series in April 1995 by Waid and artist Humberto Ramos.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 270 In November of that same year, Waid and Howard Porter collaborated on the Underworld Unleashed limited series, which served as the center of a company-wide crossover storyline.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 271: \\"The villains of the [DC Universe] underwent their own extreme makeovers in Underworld Unleashed, a three-issue miniseries by writer Mark Waid and artist Howard Porter.\\" His first major project for Marvel Comics was as one of the writers of the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" crossover.

Waid and Garney garnered critical praise for their run on the title, remaining on it until the title was relaunched with a different creative team as part of the 1996‚Äì1997 \\"Heroes Reborn\\" storyline. Rob Liefeld offered Waid the opportunity to script Captain America over plots and artwork by his studio, but Waid declined. That storyline ran a full year, after which Waid and Garney returned to the title for another relaunched series, Captain America volume 3, issues #1‚Äì23.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 288: \\"Writer Mark Waid began what many fans still consider to be the ultimate run on the Captain America title with this series penciled by Ron Garney.\\" Waid also wrote the short-lived spin-off series Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty from 1998‚Äì1999, having written 10 of the 12 issues (skipping issues #7 and 10).

It was written in reaction to the \\"grim and gritty\\" comics of the 1980s and 1990s. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that \\"Waid's deep knowledge of the heroes' pasts served them well, and Ross' unique painted art style made a powerful statement about the reality of the world they built.\\" Many of the ideas introduced in Kingdom Come were later integrated into the present-day DC Universe, and Waid himself wrote a follow-up to the series, The Kingdom.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 286: \\"Writer Mark Waid returned to the kingdom he helped envision with this series of specials designed as a sequel to the hit miniseries Kingdom Come.\\" Waid and writer Grant Morrison collaborated on a number of projects that would successfully reestablish DC's Justice League to prominence.

The series was originally published by Gorilla Comics, a company formed by Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others, but the company folded after only two issues were published. Empire was completed under the DC Comics label in 2003 and 2004. Waid wrote the first year of Crossgen's Ruse series. Waid began an acclaimed run as writer of Marvel's Fantastic Four in 2002 with his former Flash artist Mike Wieringo, with Marvel releasing their debut issue, Fantastic Four vol. 3 #60 (Oct. 2002) at the promotional price of 9 cents U.S. By June 2003, Marvel publisher Bill Jemas tried to convince Waid to abandon his \\"high-adventure\\" approach to the series, and making the book into, in Waid's words, \\"a wacky suburban dramedy where Reed's a nutty professor who creates amazing but impractical inventions, Sue's the office-temp breadwinner, the cranky neighbor is their new 'arch-enemy,' etc.\\" Waid, who felt that this was too much of a departure from what he had been hired to write, initially declined. After some discussion with editor Tom Brevoort, Waid found a way to make the requested changes, but by then, the decision had been made to fire Waid and Wieringo from the series. The resulting fan backlash led to Waid and Wieringo's reinstatement on the title by that September. Waid and Wieringo completed their run on Fantastic Four with issue #524 (May 2005), by which time the previously relaunched series had returned to its original numbering. In 2003 Waid wrote the origin of the \\"modern\\" Superman with Superman: Birthright, a twelve-part limited series which was meant to be the new official origin story of the Man of Steel.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 310: \\"Superman's post-Crisis on Infinite Earths origin had remained lore since John Byrne's seminal Man of Steel series in 1986, but by 2003 it was time for an update.\\" Birthright contained several characters and elements from the Silver and Modern Age Superman comic books and homages to Superman: The Movie and the Smallville television series. Waid returned to writing Legion of Super-Heroes in December 2004, teaming again with Barry Kitson.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 318: \\"Top writer Mark Waid and artist Barry Kitson joined forces to relaunch one of DC's best-loved super-teams.\\" He finished his run on the series with issue #30 (July 2007).

Meyer accused Waid of convincing Antarctic Press not to publish Meyer‚Äôs graphic novel Jawbreakers. Waid launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to fight the suit, and denied having anything to do with Antarctic Press' decision, a statement verified in deposition by the publisher of Antarctic Press. Waid's fellow comics creators Neil Gaiman, Kurt Busiek, Dan Slott and Yanick Paquette contributed to his campaign, while artist Ethan Van Sciver began a similar campaign for Meyer.

Morales is the co-creator, along with Brian Augustyn, of the 1990s version of Black Condor. Early life Morales attended a number of vocational art classes, including The Kubert School.O'Donnell, Chuck (April 18, 2010). \\"Northjersey.com : NewsMorris County school specializes in training comic-book artists\\". NorthJersey.com. Career Morales' first professional work was penciling 19 issues of Forgotten Realms with writer Jeff Grubb as part of the TSR line of books. Following Forgotten Realms, Morales co-created and pencilled Black Condor. Morales left DC Comics to do work for Valiant Comics, including Turok, Archer & Armstrong and Geomancer. He also did some licensed work on a Sliders comic book, and work for Wizards of the Coast. After Valiant closed, Morales returned to his TSR roots, doing work for Dungeons and Dragons magazines and novella work for Harper Collins, such as Isaac Asimov's Robotics and pen and ink work for Margaret Weis' Testament of the Dragon. He also taught anatomical illustration at a vo-tech school. In 1999, Morales was made the penciler on DC's on Hourman, penciling 20 of that series 25 issues before it was canceled in 2001. Over the course of the following year, he drew nine intermittent issues of JSA between issue #9 and issue #34, before moving onto Hawkman with writer Geoff Johns. As the end of that year loomed while on Hawkman. It was also on Hawkman that he first worked with inker Michael Bair, with whom he has worked on most of his projects since.

Comic Book Resources. After Hawkman, Morales illustrated Brad Meltzer's limited series Identity Crisis. Because of the importance of Identity Crisis to DC's ongoing company-wide storyline, and because of the number of characters in it, including minor ones that had barely been seen in years, Morales used copious amounts of reference materials for character studies, including the use of famous actors' faces to give the characters unique facial features, and sometimes updating their costumes in the process. The series was eventually selected by The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA)'s 2007 recommended list of Great Graphic Novels For Teens.

FBI files dating back to before the attacks demonstrate that he is a Saudi Arabian intelligence agent. Saudi Arabia claims that al-Bayoumi is not an agent of theirs. Per previously-classified memoranda released by the National Archives in May 2016, as of June 6, 2003, \\"the FBI \\"believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to the Saudi Government officials. In addition, during its investigation, the FBI discovered that al-Bayoumi has ties to terrorist elements as well.\\"page 7, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/17/us/document-saudi- memos-9-11.html Income Al-Bayoumi was probably born around 1958, but virtually nothing is known of al-Bayoumi's early life. Until 1994, he lived in Saudi Arabia, working for the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation, a department headed by Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz. In August 1994, al-Bayoumi moved to the United States and settled down in San Diego, California, where he became involved in the local Muslim community. He was very inquisitive, and was known to always carry around a video camera. According to several sources, al-Bayoumi was strongly suspected by many residents of being a Saudi government spy. The man the FBI considered their \\"best source\\" in San Diego said that al-Bayoumi \\"must be an intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia or another foreign power,\\" according to Newsweek magazine. During this time, al- Bayoumi was in the United States as part of a work-study program. The Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation paid al-Bayoumi's salary through a government contractor. When the contractor proposed terminating its relationship with al-Bayoumi in 1999, a Saudi government official replied with a letter marked \\"extremely urgent\\" that the government wanted al-Bayoumi's contract renewed \\"as quickly as possible.\\" As a result, Al-Bayoumi's employment with the project continued. In June 1998, an anonymous Saudi philanthropist donated $500,000 to have a Kurdish mosque built in San Diego, on the condition that al-Bayoumi be hired as maintenance manager with a private office. The donation was accepted, but because al-Bayoumi rarely showed up for work, the mosque's leadership became unhappy with him. Eventually, they moved to fire him. Some time in late 1999 or early 2000, Omar al-Bayoumi began receiving another monthly payment‚Äîthis one from Princess Haifa bint Faisal, the wife of Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Checks for between $2,000 and $3,000 were sent monthly from the princess, through two or three intermediaries, to al-Bayoumi. The payments continued for several years, totaling between $50,000 and $75,000. According to the recent release of documents by 2002 Congressional Inquiry into the September 11 Attacks, Omar al-Bayoumi was not the recipient of the checks Osama Bassnan wife was. He was a close associate of Omar al-Bayoumi, Bassan made comments to an FBI source \\"That he did more for the hijackers than al-Bayoumi did.\\" The report further states the even though the money was meant for Bassnan, al- Bayoumi's wife had attempted to deposit three of the checks into her own account. Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar On January 15, 2000, after attending the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, future 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar flew from Bangkok, Thailand to Los Angeles. Al- Bayoumi reportedly helped these two hijackers to settle in the United States. During the period that he did so, his salary greatly increased.http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/sep/07/questions-linger-over-two-san- diego-september-11th/ The final 9/11 Commission Report noted: :Hazmi and Mihdhar were ill-prepared for a mission in the United States. ... Neither had spent any substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, English. It would therefore be plausible that they or [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] would have tried to identify, in advance, a friendly contact for them in the United States. ... We believe it unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdhar ... would have come to the United States without arranging to receive assistance from one or more individuals informed in advance of their arrival.\\" After they landed, Al-Bayoumi met them at a restaurant. He invited them to move to San Diego with him, where he found them an apartment, co-signed the lease, and advanced them $1,500 to help pay for their rent. (The 9/11 Commission, however, concluded that \\"[n]either then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either Hazmi or Mihdhar.\\") Al-Bayoumi also helped them obtain driver's licenses, rides to Social Security, and information on flight schools. While they lived across the street from al-Bayoumi, they had no furniture, they constantly played flight simulator games, and limousines picked them up for short rides in the middle of the night. Their neighbors later said they perceived them as strange. They later moved into the house of Abdussattar Shaikh, a friend of al-Bayoumi's, who was secretly working as an FBI informant at the time. An October 2012 FBI report (declassified several years after it was written) named Fahad al-Thumairy, a Saudi Islamic Affairs official and King Fahd Mosque imam, as having worked with al-Bayoumi. The report also named a third man who allegedly had ordered al-Bayoumi and al-Thumairy to assist the hijackers; this man's name was not declassified, but was accidentally revealed when the FBI neglected to redact his name from a document filed in April 2020. Al-Bayoumi claims he met them by accident, was being kind to fellow Muslims in need, and had no idea of their plans. Some FBI officials concluded that al- Bayoumi was not a witting accomplice of the hijackers. As one explained: \\"We could not find any contact between him and terrorists, any involvement (with al-Qaeda). There was nothing to indicate he's any different from any of the hundreds of people who had contact with the hijackers, who were unwitting to the fact that they were going to be hijackers. It just wasn't there.\\" But one former top FBI official told Newsweek: \\"We firmly believed that he had knowledge [of the 9/11 plot] and that his meeting with them that day was more than coincidence.\\" Arrest and release In July 2001, Omar al-Bayoumi moved to England to pursue a PhD at Aston University. Ten days after the September 11 attacks he was arrested by British authorities working with the FBI. He was held on an immigration charge while the FBI and Scotland Yard investigated him. His phone calls, bank accounts, and associations were researched, but the FBI says they found no connections to terrorism. When interrogators asked Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, whether he knew al-Bayoumi, he said that he did not. He was released, and went back to studying at Aston, and later moved to Saudi Arabia. The issue was reopened when the potential links between al-Bayoumi and the Saudi Embassy were reported in the press. Under pressure from Congress, the FBI re-examined the case. They concluded that the allegations were \\"without merit,\\" and they \\"abandoned further investigation.\\" However, contemporary news accounts reported that \\"countless intelligence leads that might help solve [the case] appear to have been under investigated or completely overlooked by the FBI.\\" The final 9/11 Commission reports stated \\"we have seen no credible evidence that he believed in violent extremism, or knowingly aided extremist groups.\\" Per previously-classified memoranda released by the National Archives in May 2016, as of June 6, 2003, \\"the FBI \\"believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to the Saudi Government officials.

The studio primarily produces award shows and other music entertainment programs, including the Academy of Country Music Awards, the DCP-created American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards (presented by co-owned music magazine Billboard), Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, the Golden Globe Awards, and So You Think You Can Dance? (with 19 Entertainment). Some of its earlier productions, such as American Bandstand, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Bloopers, were hosted by Clark himself. The company was sold to a group led by Daniel Snyder in 2007 for $150 million. Clark died on April 18, 2012 and in September of that year, his studio was sold again to Guggenheim Partners, Mandalay Entertainment and Mosaic Media Investment Partners for $350 million. Guggenheim's stake was later spun out to former president Todd Boehly. In 2016, Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group announced its intent to acquire DCP, but the deal was thrown out in early 2017 due to regulatory issues. The company has since become a part of Valence Media, which merged Boehly's entertainment and media assets with the film studio MRC. Valence as a whole rebranded as MRC in 2020, with DCP being part of the MRC Live & Alternative division. History The Dick Clark radio show began syndication in the late 1950s as part of MARS Broadcasting. The name and lower-case stylization of Dick Clark Productions dates back to, at latest, 1964, when Dick Clark's public relations manager, Henry Rogers of Rogers & Cowan, suggested naming his production company after himself, so he could be more visible following American Bandstands move to Hollywood. Later, Clark rented a building on the Sunset Strip, in an area among visible, legendary clubs and landmarks. As Clark recounted in his 1976 book, Rock, Roll and Remember: \\"I hung up a very modest sign in lowercase print ‚Äî dick clark productions ‚Äî and started producing.\\" Dick Clark Productions went public on NASDAQ in 1986. It was taken private in 2002 by an investment group that included Mosaic Media Group and Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec. Mandalay Entertainment bought CDP's stake in 2004. On June 19, 2007, Dick Clark Productions was sold to Daniel Snyder, Washington Redskins owner and former chairman of Six Flags, for $175 million. After founder Dick Clark's death on April 18, 2012, Snyder commented that he was proud when he purchased Dick Clark Productions, adding that Clark was \\"in every sense of the word, a giant.\\" Until 2012, Dick Clark Productions was majority owned by Red Zone Capital Management, a Daniel Snyder-controlled private equity firm, with a 40 percent stake held by Six Flags. The week of June 13, 2012, Red Zone confirmed a possible sale of the company, and that investment bank Raine Group had been tapped to determine possible suitors. Rumored suitors included CORE Media Group, whose 19 Entertainment produced So You Think You Can Dance with DCP, and Ryan Seacrest Productions, whose namesake founder worked with and was mentored by Dick Clark. On September 4, 2012, Red Zone Capital Management reached an agreement to sell Dick Clark Productions to a group partnership headed by Guggenheim Partners, Mandalay Entertainment, and Mosaic Media Investment Partners for approximately $350 million. In December 2012, reports by several baseball insiders indicated that the Los Angeles Dodgers (also owned by Guggenheim Partners) were in talks with Dick Clark Productions to potentially form a regional sports network for the team once its contract with Fox Sports West concluded. The Dodgers instead partnered with Time Warner Cable to launch Time Warner Cable SportsNet LA. In 2014, DCP took over production of the Billboard Music Awards, an awards show presented by Guggengeim-owned Billboard magazine. In July 2014, DCP settled a lawsuit with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association over its contracts with NBC to broadcast the Golden Globe Awards. On December 17, 2015, in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company announced that it would spin out its media properties, including Dick Clark Productions, to a group led by its former president Todd Boehly. Variety reported that CEO Allen Shapiro was \\"likely to be a key player in the spinoff, given his experience in running entertainment firms\\". Boehly's stake is represented by Eldridge Industries. In September 2016, it was reported that the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group (which owns AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment) was in talks to acquire Dick Clark Productions. This was confirmed on November 4, 2016, when Wanda Group announced the purchase for $1 billion. On February 20, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that the sale was facing regulatory issues in China. On March 10, 2017, an Eldridge Industries spokesperson stated that the sale had been scrapped. DCP received $50 million from Wanda Group in breakup and extension fees. The studio later sold Chinese rights to the Golden Globes and New Year's Rockin' Eve to STX Entertainment. On February 1, 2018, DCP merged with Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group and Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media. Mike Mahan was appointed CEO of DCP. In November 2019, the company's COO and CFO Amy Thurlow became president of Dick Clark Productions, with Mike Mahan expected to become a vice chairman in 2020.

The seat had fallen vacant in a Parliamentary recess, and the law does not permit a by-election to be called during a recess if the sitting member resigns by taking the Chiltern Hundreds. Robertson was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Robertson of Port Ellen on 24 August 1999, instantly vacating his seat. The writ for the by-election was moved immediately.

Ewing was the daughter of Winnie Ewing; who had famously defeated Labour to win the Hamilton by-election of 1967. The Scottish Socialist Party fought a strong campaign for the seat, and Stephen Mungall was nominated by a local group protesting against the ownership of the local football team, Hamilton Academical F.C.

His father was a painter of altarpieces and small-scale cabinet paintings.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 754, 981‚Äì1008 Three of his brothers also became painters: Juliaan III (1616‚Äì1679), Theodoor (1619‚Äì1697) and Abraham (1629‚Äì1670). The work of his two oldest brothers is virtually unknown. The work of his youngest brother Abraham was very close to David's own. From 1626 David the younger studied under his father.Charles Sterling, Maryan W. Ainsworth, Charles Talbot, Martha Wolff, Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann, Jonathan Brown, John Hayes, Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-Century European Paintings: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New, 1998, pp. 129‚Äì133 A collaborator of his father early on in his career, the father and son pair created together a series of twelve panels recounting stories from Torquato Tasso's epic Gerusalemme Liberata (Museo del Prado, Madrid). His father was frequently in financial straits and his debts landed him occasionally in jail. David the younger had to make copies of old masters in order to support the family. In 1632‚Äì33 he was registered as 'wijnmeester' (i.e. the son of a master) in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. A David Teniers is recorded in the Antwerp records as having been issued in 1635 a passport to visit Paris. The artist likely also travelled to England as on 29 December 1635 of the same year he signed in Dover a contract with the Antwerp art dealer Chrisostomos van Immerseel, then resident in England. Village festival, 1645, oil on canvas Rubens received in 1636 a commission from the Spanish king Philip IV of Spain to create a series of mythological paintings to decorate the Torre de la Parada, a hunting lodge of the king near Madrid. The mythological scenes depicted in the series were largely based on the Metamorphoses of Ovid. Rubens realized this important commission with the assistance of a large number of Antwerp painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Cornelis de Vos, Jan Cossiers, Peter Snayers, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Theodoor van Thulden, Jan Boeckhorst, Peeter Symons, Jacob Peter Gowy and others, who worked after Rubens' modellos.Javier Port√∫s P√©rez, Torre de la Parada on the Prado website Teniers was also invited to participate in this project and make a picture after Rubens' design. That painting is considered lost. Teniers married into the famous Brueghel artist family when Anna Brueghel, daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder, became his wife on 22 July 1637. Rubens, who had been the guardian of Anna Brueghel after her father‚Äôs death, was a witness at the wedding. Through his marriage Teniers was able to cement a close relationship with Rubens who had been a good friend and frequent collaborator with his wife's father. This is borne out by the fact that at the baptism of the first of the couple's seven children David Teniers III, Rubens' second wife, H√©l√®ne Fourment was the godmother. Around this time Teniers started to gain a reputation as an artist and he received many commissions. The Guild of St George (Oude Voetboog Guild), a local militia in Antwerp, commissioned a group portrait in 1643 (Hermitage Museum). Card players, c. 1644‚Äì45, oil on panel Teniers was a dean of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1644‚Äì1645. When Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria became the Governor General of the Southern Netherlands in 1647, the Archduke soon became an important patron of Teniers. The success went to the artist's head. He claimed that his grandfather Julian Taisnier, who had moved from Ath (now located in the Walloon province of Hainaut) to Antwerp in the 16th century had been from a family that had been entitled to bear a coat of arms. Teniers started to use this coat of arms consisting of a croaching bear on a field of gold encircled by three green acorns. His brother-in-law Jan Baptist Borrekens reported him and Teniers was prohibited from using the coat of arms. =Court painter in Brussels= Around 1650 Teniers moved to Brussels to formally enter into the service of the Archduke as a \\"pintor de c√°mara\\" (court painter).Matthias Depoorter, David Teniers II at Baroque in the Southern Netherlands The Archduke asked him to be the keeper of the art gallery he had set up in his palace in Brussels.

Teniers put together a collection for the art gallery which included his own work and that of other artists, which he selected. He was involved in the purchase of a large number of Italian, and especially Venetian, masterpieces from the confiscated collections of Charles I of England and his Jacobite supporters. One of his most important successes was the acquisition of the major part (about 400 paintings) of the collection owned by James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, who had been a close associate and favorite of the English King and was, like the King, executed in 1649.David Teniers II, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels at Christie's The Conde de Fuensalda√±a, then acting as Leopold Wilhelm's lieutenant in the Southern Netherlands, also sent Teniers to England in 1651 to purchase paintings at the Pembroke and presumably other sales.Marcus B. Burke, Peter Cherry, Collections of Painting in Madrid, 1601‚Äì1755 (Parts 1 and 2), Getty Publications, 1 Jan 1997, p. 132 The collection of the Archduke grew to incorporate about 1,300 works, mainly of leading Italian artists such as Raphael, Giorgione, Veronese and Titian (15 works by this artist alone) as well as of famous Northern artists such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan van Eyck. The collection became the foundation and nucleus of the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting 19 October 2006 to 21 January 2007 at the Courtauld Gallery Mountain landscape with a gypsy fortune teller, after 1644, oil on canvas The Archduke also promoted Teniers's art by giving his compositions to other European rulers as presents. As a result, many of these rulers also became patrons of the artist. The bishop of Ghent Anthonius Triest, the Stadtholder Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange, Christina, Queen of Sweden, William II, Prince of Orange and Philip IV of Spain were among his patrons. Only king Louis XIV of France does not seem to have liked Teniers's work. According to a story, when presented with a peasant scene by Teniers the French king asked for the 'magots' ('baboons') to be removed from his sight as soon as possible. Teniers bought a house close to the Brussels court and was promoted in 1655 to 'camerdiender' or 'ayuda de c√°mara' (chamberlain) by the Archduke. It was most unusual for a painter to serve as chamberlain at the Spanish court. In fact, there was only one other case, which dates from the same time: that of Vel√°zquez, whose aim was also to be elevated to the nobility.Teresa Posada Kubissa, Review of Hans Vlieghe, David Teniers the Younger (1610‚Äì1690). A Biography (Pictura Nova. Studies in 16th- and 17th- Century Flemish Painting and Drawing, XVI). Turnhout: Brepols Publishers, 2011. 214 pp, 86 b&w; illus. .] at historians of Netherlandish art Not long after the Archduke resigned from his position as Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands and returned to Vienna with his large art collection. A Flemish priest, who was also a gifted still life painter, Jan Anton van der Baren, moved with Leopold Wilhelm from Brussels to Vienna where he was the successor of Teniers as the director of the archducal gallery in Vienna.A. Hajdeski, Die Niederl√§nder in Wien, Oud-Holland 25 (1907), p. 9-26; p. 14-19 The new Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands, Don Juan of Austria continued the support for the artist that he had enjoyed from his predecessor the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. The early Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie reports in his Het Gulden Cabinet published in 1662 that Don Juan was an amateur artist who regularly asked Teniers to give him instructions in art. Don Juan was so taken by Teniers that he even drew a portrait of Teniers son.Cornelis de Bie, Het Gulden Cabinet vande Edel Vry Schilder-Const, 1662, p. 338 A family concert on the terrace of a country house: a self-portrait of the artist with his family, c. 1640‚Äì49, oil on canvas Teniers's wife died on 11 May 1656. On 21 October of the same year the artist remarried. His second wife was Isabella de Fren, the 32-year-old daughter of Andries de Fren, secretary of the Council of Brabant. It has been suggested that Teniers's main motive for marrying the 'spinster' was her rather elevated position in society. His second wife also brought him a large dowry.F. P. Dreher, 'The Artist as Seigneur: Chateaux and Their Proprietors in the Work of David Teniers II', in: The Art Bulletin, vol. 60, no. 4 (Dec., 1978), pp. 682‚Äì703 The couple had four children, two sons and two boys. His second wife's attitude to Teniers's children from his first marriage would later divide the family in legal battles. Teniers petitioned the king of Spain to be admitted to the aristocracy but gave up when the condition imposed was that he should give up painting for money. In 1660 Teniers's Theatrum Pictorium was published in Brussels. When Don Juan of Austria ended his term as Governor General of the Southern Netherlands in January 1659, Teniers appears to have withdrawn from active court duty. He purchased from the husband of H√©l√®ne Fourment, the widow of Rubens, a country estate called the 'Drij Toren' ('Three towers') located in Perk, in the environs of Brussels and Vilvoorde. Teniers did not cut his links with Antwerp while living and working in Brussels. Teniers maintained close contacts with artists as well as the influential art dealers in Antwerp. In particular; the firm of Matthijs Musson was instrumental in building Teniers's international reputation. A peasant holding a glass, 1640s, oil on copper At the behest of his Antwerp colleagues of the Guild of Saint Luke, Teniers became the driving force behind the foundation of the Academy in Antwerp, only the second of such type of institution in Europe after the one in Paris. The artist used his connections and sent his son David to Madrid to assist in the negotiation to successfully obtain the required licence from the Spanish King. This involved Teniers's son presenting a very expensive golden watch to one of the courtiers who could influence the Spanish King's decision on the matter. As soon as he received the royal charter creating the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Teniers travelled with it from Brussels to Antwerp and celebrated the accomplishment with a big banquet in the Schilderskamer of the Guild of St. Luke. When in 1674 the existence of the Academy was threatened he again used his influence at the Spanish court to save the institution. As a court painter Teniers was not required to become member of a local guild. Nevertheless, he became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1675. In his later years Teniers was also active as an art dealer and he organised art auctions. This brought him into conflict with his fellow artists who started proceedings to prohibit him from holding an auction in 1683. Teniers argued that he needed the proceeds of the auction because his children were suing him for their mother's part of her estate. The matter was finally settled between the parties themselves. In his final years he lost his second wife and was involved in further lawsuits over her estate with the two surviving children of his second wife. There is evidence that in these years he suffered a decline in his prosperity and that his output was diminished.David Teniers, in: Flemish Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1984, p. 255-268 On 25 April 1690 David Teniers died in Brussels. His pupils included his son David, Ferdinand Apshoven the Younger, Thomas van Apshoven, Jan de Froey, Aert Maes, Abraham Teniers, and Aert van Waes.David Teniers III at the Museo del Prado site Gillis van Tilborgh is also presumed to have studied under Teniers.L. J. Wassink. \\"Tilborgh, Gillis van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 11 April 2017 Work =Subjects= The Temptation of St. Anthony, oil on panel Teniers was known as a hard worker who was extremely prolific. About two thousand paintings are thought to have been painted by the artist. He was extremely versatile and tried his hand at all the genres then practised in Flanders including history, genre, landscape, portrait and still life. Teniers is particularly known for developing the peasant genre, the tavern scene and scenes with alchemists and physicians. He also painted many religious scenes among which stand out his many compositions treating the subjects of the Temptation of St Anthony and hermit saints in grottoes or deserts. =Evolution= Teniers's early works show the influence of Elsheimer. This influence was transmitted to him through his father, who had studied under Elsheimer in Rome and is regarded as a follower of Elsheimer. Elsheimer was mainly known for his small cabinet paintings characterised by their innovative treatment of landscape and light effects.Keith Andrews. \\"Elsheimer, Adam.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 March 2017 Peasants playing cards in an interior, between 1630 and 1645, oil on copper Another major influence on David Teniers the Younger's early work was the work of the Flemish painter Adriaen Brouwer. Adriaen Brouwer was working in Antwerp from the mid 1620s to the mid 1630s after an extended residence in Haarlem. He was an important innovator of genre painting through his vivid depictions of peasants, soldiers and other 'lower class' individuals, whom he showed engaged in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fighting, music making etc. usually in taverns or rustic settings.Matthias Depoorter, Adriaen Brouwer at Baroque in the Southern Netherlands Brouwer also contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression.Ingrid A. Cartwright, Hoe schilder hoe wilder: Dissolute Self- Portraiture in Seventeenth-Century Dutch and Flemish Art, Advisors: Wheelock, Arthur, PhD, 2007 Dissertation, University of Maryland University of Maryland (College Park, Md.), p. 8 Teniers's early work up to the end of the thirties was very close to that of Brouwer in terms of subject matter, technique, color and composition. He took from Brouwer the gross types, placed in the characteristic smoky, dimly lit taverns. He also treated these subjects with the same monochrome tonality as Brouwer. Landscape with peasants playing bowls outside an inn, c. 1660, oil on canvas The personal style of Teniers was visible from the outset. An important distinction was that unlike Brouwer who placed these genre scenes mainly indoors, Teniers gradually moved his scenes into the open air and started to give the landscape a major place in his work from the 1640s. This was a common development in Flemish painting at the time.Karolien De Clippel, Facetten van de Vlaamse genreschilderkunst in de zeventiende eeuw in: Vlaanderen. Jaargang 56(2007), pp. 215‚Äì219 The smoky and monochrome tonality of the interiors from the 1630s was replaced by a luminous, silvery atmosphere, in which the peasants sit at their ease, conversing or playing cards. These paintings show a radical move towards a more positive attitude towards country life and the peasantry than was reflected in his earlier satirical pieces influenced by Brouwer. Teniers's later works such as his Flemish kermesse (1652, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) breathe an idyllic Arcadian spirit. The peasant characters have lost their ungainly appearance and people from the higher social classes are now mixed in with the common people. The artist's new status as court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm from 1651 may have contributed to this 'gentrification' of his work. This type of rural scene became very popular. In many of Teniers's late paintings, the excitement of his earlier peasant feasts is gradually replaced by tranquil scenes populated with only a few human figures. In this later period Teniers also adopted a more painterly and looser style.David Teniers (II), A cobbler in his workshop at Sphinx Fine Art River landscape with rainbow, after 1644, oil on canvas Teniers's scenes with peasants were so well known that compositions with this subject came to be called 'tenierkens' ('small teniers') and tapestries with peasant scenes were referred to as 'Teniers tapestries'. Teniers did not design any Teniers tapestries himself. Only a few of these tapestries can be directly linked to works by Teniers. Teniers tapestries were particularly popular from the last third of the 17th century and well into the 18th century. The Teniers tapestries were woven by many Brussels weavers and also in other centers such as Lille, Oudenaarde, Beauvais and Madrid.Guy Delmarcel, Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1999, p. 342 =Country and pastoral landscapes= In the early 1640s Teniers began to paint more landscape paintings and in these he developed his own pictorial language. He started to focus on the Flemish countryside as a subject in itself rather than solely as a backdrop to his outdoor peasant scenes. In his landscapes he paid particular attention to the variegated light of the Flemish countryside in different weather conditions. In his River landscape with rainbow he included thin, dark clouds, with streaking sun rays piercing through rain and a rainbow in the left background. Along with Rubens, Teniers was among the first Flemish 17th-century artists to include rainbows in his compositions, not for their religious or allegorical meaning, but rather as another means by which to showcase his careful study of nature. Other examples of this include other works from the mid 1640s such as The Reaping (Hermitage Museum).David Teniers (II), River landscape with rainbow at Sotheby's Teniers depicted real as well as imaginary landscapes. Although he did not intend these works to be topographically accurate, he spent a lot of time sketching in the countryside. This explains why certain motifs recur in his landscape oeuvre.David Teniers II, Landscape with a Drover and his Herd by a River at Sphinx Fine Art A pastoral landscape with a herdsman playing a pipe near a waterfall, 1660s, oil on canvas In the 1660s Teniers started to paint pastoral scenes. It is likely that the increased prominence of rural life and nature in his work of that period was connected to his 1662 purchase of Drij Toren, a country house in Perk in which he maintained a studio. In contrast to the sophisticated compositions he painted as a court painter, the landscapes he painted at Perk stand out by their simplicity. They expressed an Arcadian view of life in the countryside and eulogized the advantages of a peaceful existence on the land. He presented the rural life as happy and carefree.David Teniers II, A pastoral landscape with a washerwoman and a herdsman with cattle and sheep at Christie's The landscapes themselves were a combination of fantasy and reality. The Arcadian spirit was conveyed through stock motifs such as cattle and sheep, bridges and classical ruins on a hill as well as through the general tonality and style of these works.David Teniers II, A pastoral landscape with a shepherd playing a pipe with cattle and sheep at Christie's David Teniers II, A pastoral landscape with a herdsman playing a pipe near a waterfall at Sotheby's View of Drij Toren at Perk, with David Teniers' family, 1660s, oil on canvas Teniers's interest in pastoral paintings has been linked to his ambition to be elevated to the nobility. Agriculture and animal husbandry were regarded as proper occupations of the nobility. An estate in the countryside was therefore a necessary part of the status of nobles of that time. Teniers had himself acquired the country estate Drij Toren in Perk near Rubens' country estate Het Steen. Teniers painted his own country estate several times. In the View of Drij Toren at Perk, with David Teniers' family (c. 1660, Boughton House) Teniers placed his estate in the center of the composition and included a portrait of his family, servants and tenant farmers at the harvest. He paid homage to Rubens by including Rubens' nearby estate called Het Steen in the far distance. He depicted himself in the picture as a country gentleman, who through his graceful bearing and costly clothing sets himself apart from the servants and toiling peasants in the picture. Teniers also made many paintings of other chateaux and estates. Only a few of the chateaux and estates he represented in these paintings are of known estates. It is believed that they are imaginary creations intended to present a generic view of what a country estate should look like: large, stately and dominating the countryside around it. These paintings often include depictions of the tenant farmers who pay deference to their masters. They thus give expression to the prevalent worldview of the ruling class of his day, of which Teniers aspired to be a part, which was that the good and humble peasant would always show reverence to his noble lord. =Gallery paintings= Teniers painted 10 paintings representing the collection of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels. Of these only three are dated. Nine are painted on canvas and one on copper. The paintings are believed to depict a fictitious space rather than the actual location of the Archduke's collection in his Brussels palace. The paintings shown in them, however, are known to have formed part of the Archducal collection.David Teniers the Younger (1610‚Äì1690), Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist on his left in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels at Sotheby's Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his gallery in Brussels, c. 1647‚Äì1651, oil on copper Teniers's paintings of the Archduke's collection fall into a genre referred to as 'gallery paintings' or 'pictures of collections'. Gallery paintings typically depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. Antwerp artists Jan Brueghel the Elder and Frans Francken the Younger were the first to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. The genre was further developed by Hieronymus Francken the Younger, Willem van Haecht and Hendrik Staben. The genre became immediately popular in Antwerp where many artists practised it in Teniers's time: they included artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, Gonzales Coques, Jan van Kessel the Elder and Hieronymus Janssens. Later practitioners included Teniers's presumed pupil Gillis van Tilborgh as well as Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, Jacob de Formentrou and Balthasar van den Bossche. Teniers played an important role in the development of the genre of gallery paintings and his mid-17th-century gallery paintings of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm are among the most famous examples of the genre.Scott J. Mangieri, Curiosity and Identity in Cornelius Gijsbrechts' Trompe L'oeil Studio Walls, ProQuest, 2008, p. 30-31 The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. These paintings expressed the Early Modern culture of curiosity, in which art works and scientific instruments were mixed together in so-called cabinets of curiosities. The persons populating the galleries in these early works are 'virtuosi' who appear as keen to discuss scientific instruments as to admire an artwork. Teniers transformed the genre in the mid 17th century by moving away from the depiction of cabinets of curiosities to depicting art galleries, and in particular the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. In the final, 'late' phase of the genre from c. 1660 to 1690, artists such as Teniers's pupil Gillis van Tilborgh went further in removing non-art objects from the gallery and introduced figures in the gallery setting who claimed elite status by virtue of their knowledge of (and, as in some cases artists are present, ability to produce) art.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his gallery in Brussels, 1650‚Äì52, oil on canvas Teniers first depicted Archduke Leopold Wilhelm with his collection in two pictures dated 1651 (one in Petworth House and the other in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium). The only other dated gallery painting by Teniers is dated 1653. The fact that the other gallery paintings of Teniers are not dated has made it difficult to establish a chronology and evolution of his work in this genre. Two of the ten known gallery paintings with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm have similar compositions and include the same paintings: the large, undated canvas in the Kunsthistorisches Museum likely followed the equally large painting dated 1651 in Petworth House. The others are all independently composed and display different works or when the same works are included they are hung in a different order. Although Teniers's gallery paintings depict pictures known to have been part of the Archduke's collection, the precise arrangements in which he depicted those pictures is believed to be fictional. Teniers strove in these paintings to arrive at a visual survey of the collection. Some of the paintings show the Archduke visiting the collection accompanied by courtiers and other art collectors. Teniers included in some a portrait of himself apparently in the act of providing his patron some explanation on a particular work of art in the collection. In the Archduke Leopold Willem in his gallery at Brussels (c. 1650, Kunsthistorisches Museum) Teniers included a portrait of Jan Anton van der Baren (the third man from the right) who later followed the Archduke upon his return to Vienna where he took over Teniers's role as director and cataloger of the Archduke's collection. Karl Sch√ºtz, Die Sammlung Erzherzog Leopold Wilhelms, in: 1648: Krieg und Frieden in Europa, M√ºnster, 1998, Volume 2, p. 181-190 A picture gallery with two men examining a seal and a red chalk drawing, and a monkey present, oil on panel It is likely that these gallery paintings of the Archduke's collection were painted to memorialize and eulogize it and anyone associated with it. The gallery painting with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Peftord House was made on copper. This was unusual for a picture of such a large size and was presumably done so that the Archduke could send it as a present to Philip IV of Spain. By sending this work to Philip IV, the Archduke may have intended to pay homage to his uncle as a prominent connoisseur of Italian painting known for his large collection at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. His secondary intention may have been to demonstrate to the King that his collection in Brussels could emulate the King's collection in Madrid. As in the 17th century the power of a prince was no longer judged solely based on his military success, but even more so on his taste in, and appreciation of, art, the Archduke thus wanted to show that he could hold his own against the King.David Teniers, The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Picture Gallery at Brussels at the Museo del Prado site Teniers also painted a few gallery paintings showing artists at work or cognoscenti inspecting a collection. An example is A picture gallery with two men examining a seal and a red chalk drawing, and a monkey present (At Sotheby's New York, 24 January 2002, lot 169). These gallery paintings are heavy with symbolism and allegory and are a reflection of the intellectual preoccupations of the age, including the cultivation of personal virtue and the importance of connoisseurship. They accentuate the notion that the powers of discernment associated with connoisseurship are socially superior to or more desirable than other forms of knowing. Teniers also created an allegorical or satirical interpretation of a gallery painting in the drawing Monkeys' Masquerade: The Painter‚Äôs Studio, an Artist Seated (British Museum). The drawing is clearly a pun on the popular 'art as the ape of nature' present in many pictures of collections through the inclusion of a monkey among the art lovers. =Theatrum pictorium= Jesus among the Doctors, modello by Teniers after Ribera c. 1651‚Äì1656, oil on panel During his tenure as keeper of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's collection, Teniers undertook the preparation and publication of the first ever illustrated catalog of old master paintings.Ernst Vegelin van Claerbergen (editor), David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting, Courtauld Institute of Art Gallery, 2006 His brother Abraham Teniers was involved in organizing the publication of the work.Theatrum pictorium at the British Museum The first official publication of the work in bound book format was published by Hendrick Aertssens in Brussels in 1660 (although the title page states the date as 1658). The title page of the book refers to it as 'Hoc Amphiteatrum Picturarum' ('This amphitheatre of pictures').Th. van Lerius, Biographies d'Artistes Anversois at P. Kockx, Antwerp, 1880, p. 96. Full title is SERENISS. PRINCIPI / LEOPOLDO GVILLIEL: / Archiduci Austr. etc. / Dno. suo clement: / HOC AMPHITHEATRVM / PICTVRARVM / ex su√¶ Serent: archetypis / delineatum sua manu / dedicauit / Ao.

The publication is now often referred to as Theatrum pictorium ('Theatre of Paintings'). The cover of the Theatrum pictorium contained a bust portrait of the Archduke with a dedication to the Archduke as well as introductions in Latin, French, Spanish and Dutch. The title page clarifies that Teniers funded the publication project out of his own pocket. The Theatrum pictorium was published in four languages (Latin, French, Dutch, and Spanish) and further editions appeared in 1673 and 1688 and in the 18th century. The last edition was published in 1755. The publication comprised 246 engravings of important Italian paintings in the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. While the project was initially planned to include the entire collection of the Archduke, the Archduke returned to Vienna before the project was completed. As a result, ultimately only a series of 246 plates was produced, of which 243 depicted about half of the Italian paintings then owned by the Archduke). View into the picture gallery of the Archduke Leopold in Brussels, by Nikolaus van Hoy from Theatrum Pictorium, 1656‚Äì1660 In the preparation of this project, Teniers first painted reduced modelli after the original works on panels of roughly 17 by 25 in dimensions. These were then engraved on the same scale by a pool of 12 engravers.The principal engravers were: Jan van Troyen, Lucas Vorsterman II, Pieter van Lisebetten, Coryn Boel, Theodor van Kessel. Other engravers included Jan van Ossenbeeck, Frans van der Steen, Nicolaus van Hoy, Remoldus Eynhoudts, Coenrad Lauwers, Dominicus Claessens and Jan Popels. Teniers used full colour in the modelli, rather than grisaille. This could mean that he intended these reproductions to function as independent records of some of these Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection. From the many modelli, which have been preserved, it is obvious that Teniers's copies constitute a true record of the originals even while he left out details and painted them in his typical fluid and transparent manner. The engraving of the catalog by engravers who worked after the modelli, not the originals, was started by 1656.Charles Sterling, Fifteenth- to Eighteenth- century European Paintings: France, Central Europe, the Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 129-137 In the 17th century there existed no efficient method for inverting images. As a result, most of the prints in the catalog are reverse images of the originals.David Teniers‚Äôs Theatrum Pictorium and the John G. Johnson Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Each print gives the name of the author of the original work on the left hand side (indicated by the letter 'p' for 'pinxit', Latin for 'painted by') and the engraver of the print on the right hand side (indicated by the letter 's' for 'sculpsit', Latin for 'engraved by'). Some editions also indicated the original dimensions of the paintings.Maria H. Loh, Titian Remade: Repetition and the Transformation of Early Modern Italian Art, Getty Publications, 2007, p. 156 Teniers's modelli and the Theatrum pictorium serve as a record for some important paintings the whereabouts of which are currently unknown. For instance, the modelli in the Metropolitan Museum of Art of the Old Age in Search of Youth attributed by Teniers to Correggio and the Adam and Eve after Padovanino are the most important records of these lost paintings. The Theatrum Pictorium had an important impact on the manner in which collections were organised, appreciated and published and continued to be used as a reference book during the 18th century. =Singeries= Smoking and drinking monkeys, c. 1660, oil on panel Teniers contributed to the spread of the genre of the 'monkey scene', also called 'singerie' (which in French means a 'comical grimace, behaviour or trick' and is derived from 'singe', the French word for monkey).'Singerie' in Larousse online Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century.Bert Schepers, Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp, in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5 Monkeys were regarded as shameless and impish creatures and excellent imitators of human behaviour. These depictions of monkeys enacting various human roles were a playful metaphor for all the folly in the world.Jan Brueghel I, Monkeys feasting (singerie) at the Rubenshuis In 16th century visual and literary sources, the image of the monkey was typically used to symbolise the unreasonable and foolish aspect of human nature. It is this quality that Teniers refers to in his Allegory of Vanitas (1633, private collection) in which he included a chained monkey in fool's clothes who is looking through a telescope from the wrong end. In addition, monkeys were associated with the Antichrist and the Devil and regarded as the opposite of god. In D√ºrer's print Madonna with a monkey the Virgin, who represents holiness, is contrasted with the monkey chained at her feet who symbolizes evil.David Teniers II, Guardroom with monkeys at Christie's Guardroom with monkeys, c. 1633, oil on panel The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which were strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was the Antwerp artist Frans Francken the Younger, who was quickly followed by Jan Brueghel the Elder, the Younger and Sebastiaen Vrancx. David Teniers the Younger, following in the footsteps of his father-in-law Jan Brueghel the Elder, became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these 'monkey scenes' as well. Teniers painted singeries in two distinctive periods. During the first period in the early 1630s he was still working in Antwerp. He returned to the subject in the 1660s when he was working in Brussels as the court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. In the early period Teniers's singeries typically depicted monkeys as soldiers. From this period dates his Festival of monkeys (1633, private collection). Monkey soldiers are shown enjoying themselves in front of a tent set up on what is likely a town square with a landscape in the distance. Food and wine are in abundant supply. On the tent is pinned an image of an owl with spectacles. The owl recalls the Flemish proverb 'wat baten kaars en bril als de uil niet zien en lezen wil' ('what good are candle and spectacles if the owl does not want to see and read'). The Festival of monkeys can be regarded as a criticism of the role of 'fools in high places'. Teniers evidently identified close with the singerie genre in this early period of his career as two monkey scenes ‚Äì the Guardroom with monkeys and the Festival of monkeys ‚Äì are reproduced in his self-portrait of 1635, known as The Artist in his studio (private collection, a workshop copy was sold at Sotheby's New York sale of 27 May 2004 as lot 16). The artist is shown sitting in front of an easel holding his brush and palette. In an exceptions combination of the genre of artist studio and gallery painting, some young connoisseurs are visiting the artist's studio and are examining some of his works. =Guardroom scenes= Guardroom with the Deliverance of Saint Peter, c. 1645, oil on panel Teniers painted several guardroom scenes or corps de garde such as The Sentinel (1642). A guardroom scene is a type of genre scene that became popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders Teniers was one of the principal practitioners of the genre together with his brother Abraham, Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu and Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger. A guardroom scene typically depicts an interior scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities.Jochai Rosen, The Dutch Guardroom Scene of the Golden Age: A Definition, Artibus et Historiae Vol. 27, No. 53 (2006), pp. 151‚Äì174 Many of Tenier's guardroom interiors date to the mid-1640s and are painted on copper. The subject of the guardroom and its contents such as armor, colorful flags and banners, saddles, drums, pistols allowed Teniers to showcase his brilliance as a still life painter.David Teniers (II), A guardroom interior at Sotheby's Teniers also used the subject to demonstrate his ability to use light to achieve a perfect representation of the quality of painted objects.David Teniers II, Un cuerpo de guardia at the Museo del Prado site A guardroom with a self-portrait of the artist, 1640s, oil on copper The armour depicted in the guardroom pictures was already out of date at the time it was painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s.Gillis II van Tilborgh Guardroom scene at Jean Moust It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.Abraham Teniers, Un cuerpo de guardia at the Museo del Prado site In one of his guardroom interiors referred to as A guardroom with a self-portrait of the artist (At Sotheby's London sale of 7 July 2010, lot 12) Teniers included his own portrait at about 36 years of age. The artist has dossed himself out as an officer wearing an exotic fur-trimmed coat and a fur hat with plume. This self-portrait within this picture may have been intended as a tronie, which often depicted a stock character in an exotic costume.David Teniers (II), A guardroom with a self-portrait of the artist at Sotheby's Teniers combined the genres of singerie and guardroom scene in the composition Guardroom with monkeys (Private collection). At a first glance, the Guardroom with Monkeys is no different from other guardroom scenes. It is clear from the round moon above the door that the scene is set late at night. The off-duty monkeys have removed their armor, stowed their pikes and rolled up their company flag and placed it against the far wall. Like their human counterparts, the monkey soldiers are loitering about, some of them are drinking and smoking, others are playing games. At the door a cat wearing respectable civilian clothes is led into the room by two monkeys who restrain it. The contrast between the properly dressed cat and the bizarre outfit of the monkey soldiers, one of which is wearing a funnel on his head while another has an upturned pot on his head, raises doubt as to the legitimacy of the monkeys' authority. As was customary in singeries, the dress and behaviour of the monkeys highlight the foolishness of human undertakings. Teniers may also have intended to criticize the bloated military in the Southern Netherlands in the 1630s. =Physicians and alchemists= An alchemist in his laboratory, oil on canvas The theme of physicians and alchemists was popular in 17th century Flemish and Dutch genre painting. Teniers was the principal contributor to this genre and its iconography in Flanders. The view of the public towards practitioners of either craft was ambivalent. Physicians and alchemists were regarded either as quacks or charlatans using deception to seek material gain or as persons seriously committed to the pursuit of knowledge. The ambivalence of this attitude was reflected in the artistic representations of physicians and alchemists. The first approach was to satirise the alchemist and turn him into a symbol of human folly. The artists would stress that the alchemist's research into creating gold from base metals was solely driven by a sinful pursuit of personal gain. Symbolism was used to show that alchemists were wasting precious time and money, and in the process sacrificed the well-being of their families. In his famous drawing of an alchemist dated to 1658 (Kupferstichkabinett Berlin) Pieter Brueghel the Elder depicted the alchemist as recklessly extravagant and wasteful in the use of resources. This drawing set the standard for the imagery of alchemists that was adopted by 17th century artists such as Jan Steen, David Rijckaert III and Adriaen van Ostade. In the 1640s Teniers created the second imagery of the alchemist. Teniers portrayed the alchemist as a learned and humble scientist diligently pursuing his research in his laboratory crowded with instruments. In the laboratory one or two assistants typically assist the alchemist with the performance of an experiment. Teniers's Alchemist (between circa 1640 and circa 1650, Mauritshuis) is an example of one of his alchemist laboratory scenes, which is devoid of the symbols of self-deception and consequent misery that Breughel had associated with alchemy, such as empty purses or tearful families. Teniers's new way of depicting alchemists was followed by contemporary artists such as Thomas Wijck, Frans van Mieris the Elder, Jacob Toorenvliet and Cornelis Bega.Jacob van Toorenvliet, Alchemist at the Leiden Collection The alchemist, c. 1650, oil on panel While alchemists were mainly concerned with transmutation of base metals into more noble ones, their endeavors were wider and also involved the use of their techniques to diagnose or cure people (the so-called 'iatrochemistry', which aimed to provide chemical solutions to diseases and medical ailments). There was therefore an overlap with the role of physicians. One of the popular methods of medical diagnosis was the so- called 'uroscopy', the analysis of the urine of a patient. Whereas this was considered a valid diagnostic method in the Middle Ages its validity had come under attack by more modern-minded physicians in the 17th century. The practice of uroscopy and the questions surrounding its use by medical practitioners were the impetus for genre paintings on the theme of the 'piskijker' ('pee examiner'). They typically showed the inspection by a physician or a quack of a flask of urine provided by a young woman. If the inspection revealed the image of a fetus this was proof that the woman was pregnant. It is assumed that the genre was started by Adriaen Brouwer and that a now lost work of Brouwer inspired Teniers and Gerard ter Borch to paint works in this genre.Claire Witlox, De kunst van het piskijken in de Gouden Eeuw in Nederland, Over de ontwikkeling van een apart genrestuk, Master thesis 2011, Faculty of Humanities, University of Utrecht Village doctor examining a urine flask, 1645, oil on panel An example of Teniers's contribution to the genre is the composition Village doctor looking at a urine sample (1640s, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium), which shows a man examining a urine flask for the purpose of medical diagnosis while an anxious peasant woman is looking on. Teniers also depicted physicians performing various operations such as foot and back operations.David Teniers, Operaci√≥n quir√∫rgica on the Prado website =Still lifes= Teniers is not generally known as a still life painter. Nevertheless, many of his interiors include elaborate still lifes, some of them painted by specialist still life painters, others painted by Teniers himself. The subject of the guardroom and all its trappings such as armor, colorful flags and banners, saddles, drums and pistols gave Teniers ample opportunity to showcase his capabilities as a still life painter.David Teniers II, A guardroom interior at Sotheby's This can be seen in the Guardroom with the Deliverance of Saint Peter (c. 1645‚Äì47, Metropolitan Museum of Art).David Teniers the Younger, Guardroom with the Deliverance of Saint Peter at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Still-life with overturned jug, 1635, oil on panel A few independent still life paintings have also been attributed to Teniers. One of the most accomplished ones of these is the Still-life with overturned jug (At Sotheby's on 5 December 2007, lot 5).The work is dated to the mid-1630s on stylistic grounds. This work seems to show the influence of the Dutch monochrome still life painters. In particular, its simplicity and studied informality and the use of subtle muted colours bring to mind the work of contemporary artists from Leiden and Haarlem. However, is not clear whether Teniers was in fact directly influenced by these artists, and if so how. No similar still life paintings are known in Antwerp at this early date. At the time Teniers created this still life painting, the principal influence on him was Adriaen Brouwer, who had returned from Haarlem to Antwerp around 1631-2. To date Brouwer is not known to have been active as a painter of still lifes. While Teniers's early work also reveals his knowledge of Dutch artists in Rotterdam such as Pieter de Bloot and the Saftleven brothers, none of these artists were still life painters. The still life may possibly reflect the influence of the important Dutch still life painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who had arrived in Antwerp in 1635, the year this picture was made.David Teniers the Younger, Still-life with overturned jug at Sotheby's =Collaborations= Collaboration between artists specialized in distinctive genres was a defining feature of artistic practice in 17th-century Antwerp. Teniers was likewise a frequent collaborator with fellow artists. His collaborators included Lucas van Uden, Jan Davidsz. de Heem, Adriaen van Utrecht, Jacques d'Arthois, his nephew Jan van Kessel the Younger and Gualterus Gysaerts. An example of such a collaboration is the Kitchen still life with a vase of flowers, dead birds, a fish and a cat, which depicts a kitchen in which two men appear to be roasting meat and fish. The left foreground of the painting is dominated by a bouquet of flowers and a still life of game; which were painted by Antwerp still life specialists Nicolaes van Verendael and Carstian Luyckx.David Teniers, Vor der K√ºche at the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden Teniers collaborated on a series of twenty copper panels commissioned by two members of the Moncada family, a noble Catalan family. The panels illustrate the deeds of Guillermo Ram√≥n Moncada and Antonio Moncada, two brothers from the Moncada House who lived at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century in Sicily. Five prominent Flemish artists collaborated on the panels. Of 12 scenes devoted to Guillermo Ram√≥n Moncada, Willem van Herp painted six, Luigi Primo five and Adam Frans van der Meulen one. Teniers was responsible for all eight panels describing the deeds of Antonio Moncada. He painted them not long after the first part of the series had been finished. Jan van Kessel the Elder, a nephew of Teniers and a still life specialist, realised the decorative borders framing each episode.David Teniers II and Jan van Kessel I, The Submission of the Sicilian Rebels to Antonio de Moncada in 1411 at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Kitchen still life with a vase of flowers, dead birds, a fish and a cat, with Nicolaes van Verendael and Carstian Luyckx, c. 1670, oil on canvas =Garland paintings= Another example of a collaborative painting made by Teniers is the composition The Soap Bubbles (c. 1660‚Äì1670, Louvre). In this work Teniers collaborated again with his nephew Jan van Kessel the Elder who painted a decorative garland representing the four elements around a cartouche showing a young man blowing soap bubbles, which was painted by Teniers. The young man blowing bubbles and the elements in the garland surrounding him such as the flowers, the dead fish and the armor and flags are all references to the theme of vanitas, i.e. the transience of life and the worthless nature of all earthly goods and pursuits.Jan van Kessel, Les Bulles de savon at the Louvre The Soap Bubbles, c. 1660‚Äì1670, oil on canvas This type of painting belongs to the genre of the 'garland painting', which was invented and developed by Teniers's father-in-law Jan Brueghel the Elder in the first two decades of the 17th century. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Danielsz., Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. The genre was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The earliest specimens of the genre often include a devotional image of Mary in the cartouche but in later examples the image in the cartouche could be religious as well as secular as is the case of Teniers's The Soap Bubbles. In 1676 Teniers collaborated with his nephew or cousin Gualterus Gysaerts, a still life painter, on a series of 19 garland paintings depicting the martyrs of Gorkum. The series was made for the Minorite Church in Mechelen following the beatification of the martyrs on 9 July 1676. Teniers painted the monochrome bust portrait of each martyr in a cartouche while Gysaerts painted the cartouche and the flower garland surrounding it. Of these paintings, eight are known still to exist, one of which, depicting the martyr Hieronymus van Weert, is in the Rijksmuseum. Both Gysaerts and Teniers signed the painting in the Rijksmuseum.J√∫lia T√°trai, The beatified martyrs of Gorkum.

Budapest: Sz√©pm≈±v√©szeti M√∫zeum; Elektropoduct Nyomdaipari Kft., 2012, pp. 26‚Äì33 Influence Teniers's genre paintings were influential on northern painters of the 17th century. His work was easily accessible to other artists as he was one of the most reproduced artists of his time and prints after his work were produced in large quantities.Colin B. Bailey, Jean-Baptiste Greuze: The Laundress, Getty Publications, 2000, p. 40 In Flanders he influenced his pupil Gillis van Tilborgh and David Rijckaert III.Jetty E. van der Sterre. \\"Rijckaert, David, III.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 9 April 2017 In the Dutch Republic Thomas Wijck, Frans van Mieris the Elder, Jacob Toorenvliet and Cornelis Bega were influenced by his scenes of alchemists. Peasant Wedding, 1650, oil on canvas In the 18th century, Parisian collectors eagerly competed to lay their hands on Teniers's works. They knew the artist chiefly for his idealized scenes of rural life, paintings of village feasts, interiors with peasants and guardroom scenes. Teniers's work was very much admired by French painters of that time, particularly Antoine Watteau. Without Teniers's influence it is unlikely that Watteau would have developed his typical style and subjects. In particular the village feasts of Teniers had shown the way for Watteau in the development of his f√™tes galantes, which featured figures in ball dress or masquerade costumes disporting themselves amorously in parkland settings. In the 18th century, Watteau was commonly described as the 'French Teniers', thus showing that the comparison between the two artists contributed to Watteau's success. Other French painters of this time who were influenced by Teniers include Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, √âtienne Jeaurat and Jean-Baptiste Greuze.Ella Snoep-Reitsma, Chardin and the Bourgeois Ideals of his Time, in: Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek (NKJ) / Netherlands Yearbook for History of Art, Vol. 24 (1973), p. 158 Some art historians see a direct link between Teniers's A cobbler in his workshop and Chardin's Canary based on thematic as well as compositional similarities.

After beginning his career as a designer, he moved to directing and worked on many BBC children's series. He was involved for several years as both a director and producer on the long-running school-based drama series Grange Hill. He remained active in television into the 21st century, directing for the ITV soap opera Coronation Street in 2005. Career Cant initially trained as an architect, but switched to working in television design after watching a documentary programme about it, and realising how much more quickly his work could be realised in that area as opposed to the longer construction time of architecture. He began his career in television in the 1960s, earning his earliest credits as a scenic designer on programmes such as the BBC Scotland series This Man Craig. He was encouraged by one of his colleagues there, future film director Ridley Scott, to make the move into directing. His first directing work came on Coronation Street in 1971; he had written an on-spec letter to the soap opera's production team pitching for directing work, which happened to coincide with new directors being needed for the programme. Cant was the first ever director on Grange Hill in 1978, and was responsible for much of the original casting for the programme. Cant's work on Grange Hill saw him awarded - jointly with Anna Home - a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) in 1979. He also received two further BAFTA nominations for his work on the series, in 1981 and 1982. Cant also directed several stand-alone children's drama serials and literary adaptations, including Moonfleet (1984), Moondial (1988), Dark Season (1991) and Century Falls (1993). The latter pair of serials were two of the earliest works from the writer Russell T Davies, who went on to have a distinguished career in British television drama. Cant had specifically asked Davies for a new serial after having been impressed with his work on Dark Season, as he had been commissioned to direct a serial by another writer with whom he was not impressed, and asked if Davies could come up with something better instead. In Dark Season, Cant had cast future Academy Award winner Kate Winslet in one of her first leading roles on screen. Cant also worked in adult television, including three stints as a director on Coronation Street; in 1971‚Äì72, 1995‚Äì96 and 2000‚Äì05. He also directed episodes of the police drama Juliet Bravo, legal drama Crown Court and another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale.

He became the Star-Spangled Kid in order to battle Nazism during World War II. He was unique in that he was a kid superhero who had an adult sidekick, Stripesy a.k.a. Pat Dugan. Both he and Dugan were superb acrobats along with having sufficient training in hand-to-hand combat, but the pair regularly bickered about which of them should get top billing. Decades later, he changed his name to Skyman and led Infinity Inc. He was killed when Harlequin III made Solomon Grundy touch Pemberton with Mister Bones's hand.

In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", S.T.R.I.P.E. returns alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe when Doctor Manhattan, inspired by Superman, undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erased the Justice Society and the Legion of Super- Heroes.Doomsday Clock #12 (February 2020). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Pat Dugan didn't possess any special powers, but he is a gifted mechanic, having built Sylvester Pemberton's Star-Rocket Racer, the JSA's Steel Eagle. =Equipment= Pat also operated an armor suit named \\"S.T.R.I.P.E.\\" equipped with a range of ballistic weapons and utilities, and that also gave him enhanced strength and flight ability. Its circuitry was vulnerable to water. Other versions In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross portrays Stripesy as a black adult, renamed \\"Stripes\\", and is equipped with various military accoutrements such as automatic weaponry, knives, and kevlar padding. In other media =Television= S.T.R.I.P.E. with Stargirl, as featured in the Justice League Unlimited episode, \\"Dark Heart\\". * S.T.R.I.P.E. (alongside Stargirl) made several appearances in the Justice League Unlimited television series voiced by an uncredited Phil LaMarr. While the pair did not get much recognition in the first season, they made more notable, speaking appearances starting in season two. In the first season, S.T.R.I.P.E.'s armor was of considerable size, large enough to let Stargirl sit on his shoulder and to where Pat had to climb up to get in the armor. However, in the second season, the armor appeared to be a perfect size for Pat to fit in. In the episode, \\"Patriot Act\\", S.T.R.I.P.E. was a part of a team that resembled the first line-up of The Seven Soldiers of Victory, however in the episode Pat is S.T.R.I.P.E. instead of Stripesy and Stargirl is featured on the team in place of her predecessor Sylvester Pemberton, the Star-Spangled Kid. Also, Crimson Avenger is portrayed in his red trenchcoat instead of his red and yellow costume. * Pat Dugan is mentioned a few times by his daughter in the Smallville two-part episode Absolute Justice. Courtney mentions her dad starting out as a sidekick to Star-Spangled Kid, then got powers of his own and began fighting crime as Stripesy which she considered as the stupidest codename ever. Courtney admits that she herself began fighting crime to pester Pat but eventually came to love it after saving someone for the first time. * Pat Dugan appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Luke Wilson. The character is largely based on his appearance in the Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. comic, being a former member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory and Justice Society of America and sidekick to Sylvester Pemberton (Starman). When his stepdaughter, Courtney, decides to become Stargirl, Pat assists her in a mechanized battle suit he built years earlier but never used until then. Despite his reluctance to become a superhero again, Courtney anoints him as her partner, and changes his original codename, \\"Stripesy\\", to S.T.R.I.P.E. based on an acronym she coined for his armor. When the family moves to Blue Valley, he opens and runs a garage called the Pit Stop. Initially disliked by Courtney owing to her hoping that her birth father would return to her life, Pat eventually won her over after she learned of his past, devotion to his family, and brilliance in mechanical engineering; becoming a surrogate father figure and reluctant mentor to her and later her new iteration of the JSA. Legacy Effects created a practical S.T.R.I.P.E. to be used during filming. =Film= An alternate universe version of Pat Dugan appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced by Dan Gilvezan. He is a scientist that was part of Luthor's \\"Project Fair Play\\", a weapons program contingency to destroy the Justice League if necessary. Later, Pat was discussing with the other scientists involved (consisting of Will Magnus, John Henry Iron, Michael Holt, Karen Beecher, Kimiyo Hoshi, Emil Hamilton, Thomas Morrow, and Stephen Shin) before they are all killed by the Metal Men where he was ripped apart by the Batdroid. Will Magnus survived as he secretly orchestrated the attack on his fellow scientists. =Miscellaneous= S.T.R.I.P.E. appears in Justice League Unlimited's spin-off comic book. He appears in issues #9, 11, 25, 31, and 33.

Fictional character biography Nimrod is a mutant-hunting Sentinel from an alternative future and was created by the Sentinels ruling that timeline. When Rachel Summers travels backwards in time to the present, he follows Rachel. Although not capable of time travel by himself he was transported back in time by Doctor Strange and Magik using their powers to change time to prevent Kulan Gath's occupation of New York. Thus Nimrod saves the life of construction worker Jaime Rodriguez by slaying a mugger (Kulan Gath's destined host), who would have otherwise killed Rodriguez. In gratitude Rodriguez offers Nimrod a job and a home with his family, not realizing who or what the shape-shifting Sentinel truly is.Uncanny X-Men #193 Nimrod in Uncanny X-Men #194 (June 1985); art by John Romita Jr. After gathering information about the timeline in which he finds himself, Nimrod eventually changes his prime directive from the extermination of all mutants, having determined that such widespread destruction is not necessary in this era, to only the extermination of mutants who were regarded as outlaws by the government, such as the X-Men. He fights the Juggernaut. He hunts Summers and the X-Men, but is defeated by Rogue when Rogue absorbs the mutant powers of Nightcrawler, Kitty Pryde and Colossus. Based on a plan that Kitty conceives before losing consciousness, Rogue uses Nightcrawler's teleportation to teleport part of Nimrod's body away, with Rogue's and Colossus's combined invulnerability protecting Rogue from the resulting physical strain in a manner that Nightcrawler could not have handled.Uncanny X-Men #194 Some time after this, Nimrod garners a reputation with the public of New York City as a heroic vigilante, assuming he is simply a man in powered armor. He also adopts the more human personality Nicholas Hunter as part of a cover alias as a construction worker.Uncanny X-Men #246 Nimrod later faces the combined forces of the X-Men and the Hellfire Club and proves himself as a powerful threat, killing Black Rook Friedrich Von Roehm, causing Harry Leland's fatal heart attack, nearly killing Nightcrawler and badly injuring Rogue and Sebastian Shaw.Uncanny X-Men #209 When Nimrod comes across a piece of the gigantic Sentinel Master Mold while working on a construction site, his programming is immediately co-opted; Master Mold merges with Nimrod, using its systems to rebuild Nimrod in its own image. The X-Men are initially hard pressed to defeat the reborn Master Mold, but Nimrod comes to their aid, claiming he has evolved as well and no longer views them or mutants as a threat. Nimrod asserts enough control over Master Mold to render it immobile, and even convinces it that it has become a mutant as well. Thus, to fulfill its prime directive to exterminate mutants, it must self-destruct. The remains of both robots are pushed through the Siege Perilous, a mystical gateway that causes all who passed through it to be reborn with new bodies.Uncanny X-Men #247 Though the exact moment is unclear, Nimrod and Master Mold are merged into the being Bastion, a man who had absolutely no memory of his former existence.Machine Man & Bastion Annual #1998 In X-Force #35, a modern-day version of Nimrod appears. Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake, this version is based on the technology derived from the Nimrod from the future.X-Force #35 In truth, between the time of Nimrod's first arrival and its apparent destruction when it merged with the Master Mold and had traveled through the Siege Perilous, it had taken precautionary measures to ensure its survival. By downloading a self-awareness program into the base's military computer cybernet, the program served as a sleeper virus that awaited the opportunity to access a Sentinel development program so it could use it to re- create Nimrod itself. Nimrod's detection of the invading X-Force had caused it to act before it had originally intended to fulfill its imperative. It deactivates itself when Cable convinces Nimrod that its earlier creation in the timeline would cause a paradox and incalculable damage to the timestream.X-Force #36 Reverend William Stryker later found a damaged Nimrod as he enters the 616 Marvel timeline from an alternate one.New X-Men #26 Stryker uses Nimrod's memories to plan an attack on the X-Men and other mutants, but Nimrod alters its memories to facilitate its own escape, and Stryker is defeated. During the New X-MenFormerly New X-Men: Academy X story arc \\"Nimrod\\", it searches for Forge, whom it believes is its creator. Nimrod believes Forge can repair its damaged body, but Forge instead transfers Nimrod's programming into a new body which Forge can control. Believing Forge to be in danger, the New X-Men travel to his apartment to help him. This eventually leads to Nimrod gaining control over his body and attacking Forge and the New X-Men. Nimrod is defeated when Surge overloads Nimrod's temporal unit, blasting Nimrod out of the timestream.

Bastion appears to be reverting more and more to fully being Nimrod. Some time later, Bastion unleashes an endless horde of Nimrods from an unknown future to destroy the X-Men. However, X-Force, Cypher and Cable go to that future and destroy the Master Mold controlling them. At the end of the crossover, the original Nimrod (Bastion) takes his original form but is destroyed by Hope. The chest and head of Nimrod are later shown to be exhibited in X-Force Headquarters. Deathlok identifies it as version 32.1 and the possibility for its future to come to be is 1.34%.Uncanny X-Force #8 During a brief glimpse three months into the future seen in Uncanny Avengers, Havok, Scarlet Witch and Sunfire are shown fleeing from a new model of Sentinel. Havok refers to the machines as Nimrod units, and mentions that they were built by Tony Stark.Uncanny Avengers #4 In the Dawn of X timeline, \\"Nimrod the Lesser\\" is seen 90 years in the future, along with \\"Nimrod the Greater\\" seen 990 years in the future.Powers of X #1 It was soon revealed that a human coalition of scientists and espionage agents from various secret agencies have joined forces to form Orchis, the ultimate mutant-fighting organization. Along with the former X-Man Omega Sentinel and built on the remains of Sol's Hammer, they have created the Orchis Forge solar orbiting space station which serves as a construction platform for the Mother Mold, a Master Mold capable of creating other Master Mold Sentinels. After intel provided by Moira MacTaggart suggests that this event is the probable origin of the Nimrod Sentinels, a team of X-men invade the Orchis Forge and successfully decouple the giant Sentinel before it fully awakens, sending it plummeting into the sun.House of X #4. Later, on the Orchis Forge, it is discovered by Mystique during an infiltration mission that Director Killian Devo has completed work on an unknown component that Dr. Alia Gregor installs inside the torso of a Nimrod unit that is in the initial stages of construction.X-Men (vol. 5) #6 Powers and abilities Nimrod is the most advanced form of Sentinel robot. Nimrod can convert his outward appearance to resemble that of an ordinary human being. Nimrod can also reconstruct himself so as to make improvements in his robotic form and internal systems that will make him a more formidable opponent. Even when smashed to pieces, Nimrod can reintegrate the portions of his body to become whole again. Apparently Nimrod's electronic consciousness can somehow exist independently of his physical body, at least temporarily. Physically Nimrod is categorized in the \\"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\\" as possessing \\"Class 100\\" strength because Nimrod could engage the Juggernaut in hand-to-hand combat. Nimrod contains highly advanced computer systems as well as scanning devices that make it possible for him to determine whether a human being is a superhuman or not; if they are, he can determine the nature of their superhuman abilities. Like present day Sentinels, Nimrod can draw upon devices and systems within his robotic body in order to cope with or neutralize an opponent's superhuman power once he has determined the nature of that power. Nimrod is capable of projecting energy blasts, magnetic energy to levitate material, create force fields, and can teleport. Nimrod has a weakness for elemental attacks such as lightning or extreme cold. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel reality featured Nimrod-esque Sentinels as new Sentinels developed by the US government after the Ultimatum Wave. One such model chases and successfully takes down Rogue until rescued by Kitty Pryde. They are eventually infused with William Stryker's brain-patterns when manifesting mutant powers for the first time in years.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #5 The Nimrod Sentinels later build a base for their operations based for Master Mold.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #6Ultimate Comics: X-Men #9-11 In other media =Television= * Nimrod appeared in X-Men: The Animated Series. Similar to the original comics, this version is a futuristic Sentinel from Bishop's timeline. In the episode \\"Days of Future Past\\" [Part 1], it fought Wolverine and then followed Bishop to the 1990s. Nimrod later fights the X-Men while trying to go after Bishop. It was defeated by Storm's mutant weather- controlling ability and Bishop. Nimrod had a supporting role in \\"One Man's Worth\\" [Parts 1 & 2]. Nimrod, under Master Mold's orders, acts as a warden to Trevor Fitzroy and Bantam in Charles Xavier's assassination in 1959. After disguising itself as its intended target, Nimrod fights Bishop, Shard, and alternate versions of Wolverine and Storm but is once again defeated. Although Fitzroy and Bantam are successful, Nimrod is tasked by Master Mold to eliminate the four time-traveling mutants then Master Mold's own reluctant mutant allies. While Fitzroy and Bantam defect, Nimrod presumably eliminates Shard and Forge but not other three time-traveling mutants. Returning to 1959, Nimrod again disguises itself as a friend (voiced by Kay Tremblay) to get close to Xavier. However, Nimrod's fight with the three time-traveling mutants doesn't end in its favor. * Nimrod has a cameo appearance in X-Men Evolution. In the series finale, one of Professor X's glimpses into the future shows Nimrod leading an army of Sentinels. * A Nimrod-esque concept called Sentinel Hounds appear in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series. The Sentinel Hounds are based on Bolivar Trask's experiments to replicate Wolverine's mutant healing factor in order to combat mutants in a Sentinel-dominated future. =Film= Nimrod-esque Sentinels appear in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past. This variation are smaller than the original predecessors at about four meters tall, and have the ability to change themselves to mimic and counter mutant abilities, based on Trask Industries' experiments with Mystique's self-altering adaptable abilities and later Rogue's absorbing abilities. Because of this, these Sentinels can be seen altering their bodies to imitate the abilities of their mutants targets. They are also seen altering the shapes of their arms into extremely sharp blades and claws to impale their victims and can fire energy blasts from their heads. Some of these Sentinels' powers and overall resistance are very similar to Nimrod from the original comic story. =Video games= * Nimrod appeared in the X-Men arcade game. It acts as the Stage 4 Boss. It also returns in Stage 7 as the fourth boss (of five) after the White Queen and before Juggernaut on Magneto's base in Asteroid M. * Nimrod is a boss character in X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy for the Sega Game Gear. * Nimrod appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. In Chapter 2, the players fight a Nimrod Series MK IV. * Nimrod is a boss in The Uncanny X-Men - Days Of Future Past android game based loosely on the Days of Future Past comic storyline.

The Acadian was introduced so Canadian Pontiac-Buick dealers would have a compact model to sell, since the Pontiac Tempest was unavailable in Canada. Plans originally called for the Acadian to be based on the Chevrolet Corvair, which was produced at GM's Oshawa plant; however, the concept was moved to the Chevy II platform to be introduced for 1962. The brand was also offered in Chile, with models built in Arica. 1962 to 1971 To promote automobile manufacturing in Canada, the APTA in the 1960s had provisions prohibiting sales of certain United States- made cars. General Motors responded by offering certain makes of cars manufactured in Canada primarily for the Canadian market such as Acadian, and Beaumont, which started as an offering in the Acadian line, but later became its own brand. Initially, Acadians were retrimmed Chevy IIs, offered as a base model, mid-priced Invader and top-line Beaumont. The car used Pontiac styling cues, such as a split grille, but was marketed as a separate make, never as a Pontiac. As with the concurrent Chevy II, Acadians were offered with four- cylinder, six-cylinder, and V8 engines. No Mark IV (big block) Acadians were ever produced in any year, unlike the sister car Nova SS. The choice of transmission depended upon the model and engine installed, three- and four- speed manual gearboxes or the two-speed Powerglide automatic. During its early years, the top-line Beaumont offered more brightwork than the equivalent Chevy II Nova. For 1964 and 1965, the Beaumont name was moved to a retrimmed version of the intermediate Chevrolet Chevelle, when the name Canso was applied to the top-line compact model, equivalent of the Nova. Invader became the series name for the base model. Data for the 1966 Acadian were: engines available were six-cylinder (194 cid, 8.5 compression ratio, 120 bhp rated), V8 (283 cid, 9.25 compression ratio, 195 bhp), or the L79 (327 cid, 11.00 compression ratio, 350 bhp rated), overall length of 15.25 feet (4.65 m); overall width of 5.94 ft (1.81 m); height of 4.48 ft (1.37 m); turning circle of 38.4 ft (11.7 m); front track of 4.73 ft (1.44 m), and rear track of 4.69 ft (1.43 m). Its fuel tank held 13.5 imperial gallons.L. A. Manwaring, The Observer's Book of Automobiles (12th ed., 1966) Library of Congress catalog card #62-9807, p. 30 From 1966, Beaumont was designated as a separate make, without the Acadian name; 1966-67 Beaumonts continued to use the Chevrolet Chevelle body with minor styling revisions, including different taillights and a Pontiac-style split grille. The interior used the instrument panel from the American Pontiac Tempest/LeMans/GTO series. Drivetrains were the same as the contemporary Chevelle with the exception of the 396 with 375 rated bhp, as were model offerings. The one exception to Chevelle/Beaumont availability was a base- model Beaumont convertible. Such a model was never available in the Chevelle line in the USA, although it was in Canada. All Acadians and Beaumonts used Chevrolet engines and drivelines. The Beaumont was discontinued after 1969, after which Canadian dealers sold the Pontiac LeMans. The Acadian continued using the Chevy II/Nova body through mid-1971, after which it was replaced by the Pontiac Ventura II. GM would not market another Canadian-exclusive brand until the launch of Passport starting in the 1989 model year. =Gallery 1962-1971= File:Acadian (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg1962 Acadian Beaumont Sport Coupe File:'62 Acadian (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg1962 Acadian two-door sedan File:1963 Acadian Beaumont convertible.jpg1963 Acadian Beaumont convertible File:1964 Acadian.JPG1964 Acadian Beaumont Sport Coupe File:1965 Acadian Beaumont Sport Deluxe (28276863452).jpg1965 Acadian Beaumont Sport Deluxe File:1965 Acadian Beaumont Sport Deluxe (27764337644).jpg1965 Acadian Beaumont Sport Deluxe rear view File:'65 Acadian (Orange Julep '10).jpg1965 Acadian Canso Sport Coupe File:66 Acadian Canso.jpg1966 Acadian Canso Sport Deluxe File:'67 Acadian Canso (Les chauds vendredis '11).JPG1967 Acadian Canso =Sport Deluxe= During the muscle- car craze in the late 1960s, Chevrolet Chevelle offered the Super Sport and SS 396 models that offered high performance, bucket seats, and sport stripes. In Canada, Beaumont offered an equivalent model, the Sport Deluxe (SD). For 1966, the SD was combined with the Chevrolet 230 cid six- cylinder, 283 or 327 cid small-block V8, or 396 cid Mark IV big-block V8, along with the same optional bucket seats/console package as the Chevelle SS 396, along with unique trim and emblems. Up until approximately the start of December 1966 the Beaumont Sport Deluxe package was an option available on a Beaumont Custom, option A51. After the start of December 1966 the Sport Deluxe became a unique model, not just an option on a Custom. When the SD became a separate model, Strato bucket seats and the floor console became an option, whereas earlier the A51 option package included those items. Many collectors consider the Beaumont SD396 even more desirable than the Chevelle SS 396, since it is far more rare. Many Acadians and Beaumonts succumbed to rough Canadian winters, suffering from rust and mechanical wear and tear, leaving very few original specimens left, in addition to much lower production than equivalent Chevy models. An equivalent Acadian, the Canso Sport Deluxe, was offered as similar package equivalent to the Chevy II Super Sport, which included the same Strato-bucket seats, console, and floor shift, along with unique SD trim and emblems. Top performance option for any Acadian including the Canso SD was Chevrolet's 350-bhp 327 cid L79 small-block V8 (in 1966 only), along with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. During the late 1960s, the Beaumont was also available in Puerto Rico. A Beaumont Cafeteria actually was co-located with the local Beaumont dealer in San Juan. Pontiac Acadian (1976 to 1987) 1986 Pontiac Acadian Scooter From 1976 to 1987, the Pontiac Acadian was a version of the Chevrolet Chevette sold by Canadian Pontiac-Buick dealers, initially identical to the Chevette except for badging, but picking up the distinctly \\"Pontiac\\" design cues of the U.S. market Pontiac T1000 after that model's 1981 introduction.

Created by writer Mort Weisinger and artist Paul Norris, he first appeared in Adventure Comics #69. After being unutilized for several years, he was reintroduced by writers David S. Goyer and Geoff Johns in the comic JSA in the late 1990s and with a greatly expanded set of powers and responsibilities. He eventually became a new version of his former mentor, donning the identity and costume of Sandman. Publication history =Golden Age= The character of Sandy the Golden Boy was created as a sidekick to the Sandman. Created by Mort Weisinger and Paul Norris, the nephew of The Sandman's girlfriend Dian Belmont, the character debuted as a tights-wearing youth (in the same vein as Robin the Boy Wonder) in Adventure Comics #69 (Dec 1941). This same issue also showcased a new yellow-and-purple costume for The Sandman. =Silver Age= The flourish of mystery-men comic books came to an end in the late 1940s. About ten years later DC Comics reintroduced some of the mystery-men characters in new books, but reimaged them as super-heroes, characters such as Green Lantern and Hawkman. September 1961 saw the publication of \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" in The Flash #123. This was the first new story using an original mystery-man character, namely, the Flash (Jay Garrick). The concept of an Earth-1 and Earth-2 began to be developed and soon other 1940s characters were being used in modern stories. Sandy the Golden Boy was reintroduced to the public by writer Len Wein in Justice League of America #113 in 1974. Len Wein wrote of his inspiration in the compilation book Crisis on Multiple Earths Volume 3 (2004): \\"I had always been a fan of the Golden Age Sandman, and had always wondered why he'd been put back into his double-breasted Man of Mystery Gas- Mask outfit when he was revived, instead of the more traditional purple-and- yellow super-hero costume he'd worn in the latter days of the 1940s. This would make the perfect place to find out. Thus was born The Creature in the Velvet Cage\\". In this story, it was revealed that in the 1940s Sandy had been transformed into a huge, sand-like creature when an experimental weapon Sandman was testing exploded. Wracked with guilt, Sandman stopped wearing the costume he'd worn as Sandy's partner, and went back to his original outfit. The transformed Sandy had been kept in a glass cage for decades. In a later story (DC Comics Presents #47, July 1982), Sandy was finally turned back into his human self, and found that he hadn't aged in all that time; physically, he was still a teenager.DC Comics Presents #47 at ComicVine.gamespot.com =The 1980s and 1990s= The 1980s saw writer Roy Thomas' World War II era series The All-Star Squadron (pre-Crisis) and the Young All-Stars (post-Crisis). Sandy was brought into the Squadron storyline during the Crisis crossover, beginning with issue #51 (Nov 1985). That book soon ceased printing and was replaced by the Young All-Stars (June 1987) where Sandy played a role in issues 2 through 8. This series states that Sandy is fourteen going on fifteen in the spring of 1942. Also written by Roy Thomas, the one-issue special Last Days of the JSA published in 1986 depicts the departure of the JSA characters. Although taking place in the modern era (within weeks of the Crisis), Sandy is still depicted as a teenager wearing his World War II uniform of yellow-and- red. The story relates how he and other JSA members are taken into Ragnarok where they must fight forever. Published in 1992, the Armageddon Inferno miniseries written by John Ostrander takes the JSA members out of Ragnarok and brings them back to Earth, allowing writers to use them in future stories. Sandy is one of these characters. The 1999 series JSA was preceded by a JSA Secret Files special. The special and the series reintroduced Sandy, but now as a young man calling himself Sand. This new and further development of the character was written by James Robinson and David S. Goyer. Issue 18 of the series, written by David Goyer and Geoff Johns, introduced retconned history for the character including his \\"killing\\" of Johnny Sorrow in 1944. The JSA‚ÄìJSA storylineJSA #68‚Äì72. DC Comics. has Sand time travel to 1951 and interact with The Sandman; writer Geoff Johns states the present-day age of the character as being \\"biologically 25\\", but his birth year is changed to 1926 (Roy Thomas had given the character an age of 14 in 1942 making the birth year 1928), the \\"Velvet Cage\\" story from the 1970s is also referenced and rewritten to an extent, the year of the silicoid accident is changed from 1947JSA Secret Files #1. DC Comics. to 1945. Issue #83 (2006) is part of the One Year Later reboot of the DC comics line; in this issue written by Paul Levitz, Sand is no longer shown as a member of the JSA. Sand makes no more appearances in the series which ended with issue #87 (2006). This book debuted in February 2007, written by Geoff Johns. The cover of this book shows the round table of the JSA surrounded by 17 heroes including Sanderson Hawkins, now wearing a black cape and fedora reminiscent of the original Sandman, but also gloves and a mask unlike any other incarnation of Sand or The Sandman‚Äîit appears to be a cross between the masks of Hawkins & Dodds, and mixed with designs borrowed from the Helm of Dream of the Endless. According to Geoff Johns' interview in Wizard #180 (October 2006) Sand would become the JSA's \\"Recon Man\\" doing more detective work in the process. He was brought in on issue #3, appearing in a cloud of smoke and speaking of nightmares, attributes more recognizable of Wesley Dodds than for Sanderson Hawkins. Issue #5 shows this version of Hawkins as more sober and serious than previous incarnations. For about a year the character was not used in the series, nor were his face and name shown in the JSA roll call found framing the main story pages.

He is a professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a senior scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI). He is the inventor of the Ames test, a system for easily and cheaply testing the mutagenicity of compounds. Biography Ames, raised in New York City, is a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. His undergraduate studies were at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and his graduate studies were completed at the California Institute of Technology. Ames was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. He is a recipient of the Bolton S. Corson Medal in 1980, Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 1985, the Japan Prize in 1997, the National Medal of Science in 1998 and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal in 2004, among many others. His research focuses on cancer and aging and he has authored over 550 scientific publications. He is among the few hundred most-cited scientists in all fields. Ames' current research includes identifying agents that delay the mitochondrial decay of aging, understanding the role of mitochondrial decay in aging, particularly in the brain, optimizing micronutrient intakes in the population to prevent disease, malnutrition, and obesity. He is also interested in mutagens as they relate to cancer prevention and aging.Bruce N. Ames. University of California Dr. Ames received more than $650,000 in support from the National Foundation for Cancer Research between 1998 and 2007. He is married to Giovanna Ferro-Luzzi Ames, who was also a professor of Biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley Ames on synthetic carcinogens In the 1970s, Bruce Ames developed the Ames test which is a cheap and convenient assay for mutagens and therefore potential carcinogens. Previous carcinogenic testing used live animals, and the procedures are expensive and time-consuming. This made animal testing impractical for use in screening on a wide scale, and reduced the number of compounds that could be tested. The Ames test on the other hand uses the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium to test for mutagens, and is considerably cheaper and faster. The Ames test became widely used as an initial screen for possible carcinogens and has been used to identify potential carcinogens previously used in commercial products. Their identification led to some of those formulations, such as chemicals used in hair dye, being withdrawn from commercial use. The ease with which Ames test allows widely used chemicals to be identified as possible carcinogens made him an early hero of environmentalism. Subsequent work in Ames' lab involved looking at an overview of what was mutagenic or carcinogenic, and to what degree. Previously, scientists tended to only look for positive or negative results without considering the magnitude of the effect, which meant that as more and more items were shown to be potentially mutagenic, there was no system for evaluating the relative dangers. He also continued to test various natural and man-made compounds, and discovered that, despite what he and others had assumed, naturally occurring compounds were not turning out to be benign as compared to man-made ones. His continued work eventually led to his falling out of favor with many environmentalists. As natural chemicals turned out to also be frequently mutagenic, he argued that environmental exposure to manufactured chemicals may be of limited relevance to human cancer, even when such chemicals are mutagenic in an Ames test and carcinogenic in rodent assays. He contended that most human genetic damage arises from essential micronutrients lacking in poor diets and the oxidation of DNA during normal metabolism, and that the most important environmental carcinogens may include some whose chief effect is to cause the chronic division of stem cells whereby the normal protective mechanisms of a cell become less effective. He argued against the banning of synthetic pesticides and other chemicals such as Alar which have been shown to be carcinogenic. Ames published results showing that many ordinary food products would be found carcinogenic according to the same criteria.Synthetic v. Natural Pesticides. New York Times (June 6, 2007)Gold, L.S., Slone, T.H., Ames, B.N., and Manley, N.B., Pesticide Residues in Food and Cancer Risk: A Critical Analysis. In: Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology, Second Edition (R. Krieger, ed.), San Diego, CA: Academic Press, pp. 799-843 (2001) Ames was concerned that overzealous attention to the relatively minor health effects of trace quantities of carcinogens may divert scarce financial resources away from major health risks, and cause public confusion about the relative importance of different hazards. Ames considered himself a leading ‚Äúcontrarian in the hysteria over tiny traces of chemicals that may or may not cause cancer\\", and said that \\"if you have thousands of hypothetical risks that you are supposed to pay attention to, that completely drives out the major risks you should be aware of.\\"  Notable awards  * Eli Lilly Award of the American Chemical Society 1964 * Elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1970 * Elected to National Academy of Sciences 1972 * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 1980 * Wadsworth Award 1981 * Charles S.

The Starjammers have often appeared in the pages of the X-Men comic books. The Starjammers first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #107 (October 1977) and were created by Dave Cockrum. The name \\"Starjammers\\" was created on the basis of the type of sailing ship known as \\"Windjammer\\". Concept and creation Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel's two try-out series, Marvel Spotlight and Marvel Premiere, he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Running out of patience, Cockrum showed the Starjammers to X-Men writer Chris Claremont and convinced him to use the characters for this series. In order to provide a plausible excuse for the Starjammers to make repeat appearances in X-Men, they decided to make Corsair, the leader of the Starjammers, be the father of Cyclops, the leader of the X-Men. History =Origin= The story of the Starjammers began with Christopher Summers, a military pilot returning with his family from a trip to Alaska. Without warning their plane was attacked. Chris's wife, Katherine, strapped their two sons (Scott Summers and Alexander Summers, who later became the X-Men Cyclops and Havok) to their only parachute and pushed them out of the plane, saving their lives. The husband and wife were then teleported from their plane to the ship of an advanced alien race called the Shi'ar. This had been a zoological scouting mission to bring in a human specimen. They were brought before D'Ken, the then ruler of the Shi'ar Empire, who was immediately smitten with Katherine, making her his concubine and sending her husband to the slave pits. Eventually, Christopher escaped and reached D'Ken's private quarters to try to assassinate him. However, he was caught and punished by having his wife murdered before his eyes, and his unborn son cut out of her womb. His spirit broken, he was sent to a mining camp on another planet. =Formation of the team= While working in the mining camp, Christopher witnessed the guards mercilessly beating a feline-like female. He stepped in, trying to get them to stop, but was then beaten himself. The woman was taken to the holding cells and Christopher huddled up in a corner, ashamed of himself. A little while later, Raza and Ch'od passed by and asked Christopher for the whereabouts of their comrade Hepzibah. Christopher was too afraid to answer. After they had left, he felt guilty and went to the guards' quarters, starting a fight after killing one of them. Raza and Ch'od jumped in, and together they got past the guards, freed the cat-woman, and sneaked on board a Shi'ar starship. Christopher used his pilot call-sign, Corsair. Naming Christopher their captain, they became the Starjammers, a group of space pirates rebelling against D'Ken's tyranny. =Further adventures= The Starjammers have had many adventures across the universe, many of them on Earth with the X-Men, during which Christopher Summers finally met his long lost sons, now X-Men. At times, the group ran with Professor X and even his consort, the Shi'ar ruler, Lilandra. The group participated in the defeat of the cosmic threat Magus, assisted by Professor X and the New Mutants. When the Skrulls made an incursion into Shi'ar territory, the Starjammers were overwhelmed, kidnapped and duplicated. They were later rescued from their imprisonment by the X-Men. The Hulk and Silver Surfer recruited the Starjammers to assist in a raid on Troyjan held space, to rescue several friends of the Hulk. A violent fight broke out, with the Starjammers slaying several enemies. It was ended with an alien bureaucrat offered the option of the Starjammers and allies simply asking to see the person they wished to confront. The group was also temporary allies of the Avengers. For some time, they were prisoners of the Collector, a cosmic being interested in preserving unique specimens of life. They became trapped in a conflict between the Collector, Galactus and the well-meaning but dangerous efforts of Wolverine of the X-Men. A recent Starjammers series introduced a new member of the Starjammers. Although some readers believed it was out of Marvel Universe continuity, the events of the series were referenced in a recent entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe series, confirming its canonical status. =The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire= The Starjammers figured significantly in the Uncanny X-Men story arc \\"The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire\\", a 12-issue story arc following on the events of X-Men: Deadly Genesis. Within this story arc, the long-lost third son of Corsair, Gabriel Summers, now the powerful mutant known as Vulcan, travels from Earth to Shi'ar space seeking revenge against the mad emperor D'Ken and the Shi'ar empire for the death of his mother and his own mistreatment by the Shi'ar. Through the course of the story, Vulcan allies himself with Deathbird to depose her brother the emperor, but later seems to side himself with D'Ken against the X-Men and the Starjammers, who seek to stop his plans for revenge. Vulcan soon turns on and kills D'Ken, and by marrying his ally (and sister of D'Ken) Deathbird, assumes the throne of the Shi'ar empire himself. In the course of the finale, Corsair, Vulcan's father, is seemingly killed. Hepzibah is returned to Earth with the X-Men, while Havok, Polaris and Marvel Girl remain behind. Havok decides to assume his father's position as leader of the Starjammers. Polaris opts to stay with him. Marvel Girl remains behind as well, having developed an intimate relationship with Korvus, a Shi'ar warrior whose ancestor was once a host of the Phoenix force (like Marvel Girl); his giant sword allows him to access the force to a degree as well. The Starjammers' new mission is to defeat Havok's brother and return Lilandra to the throne of the Sh'iar Empire. Hepzibah expresses no wish to return to the Starjammers following Corsair's death, and has decided to stay on Earth and become an X-Man. The Starjammers are now: Havok, Polaris, Ch'od, Marvel Girl, Raza, Korvus, Sikorsky, and Cr'eee.Uncanny X-Men #486 =X-Men: Emperor Vulcan= The further adventures of the Starjammers are continued in the series: X-Men: Emperor Vulcan, this miniseries (5 issues) is written by Chris Yost and pencilled by Paco Diaz. Havok and the Starjammers attack Shi'ar space. Vulcan appears with an armada to kill them, and a new alien race gets involved. The new race's name translates to \\"Death to the Shi'ar\\", and they destroyed the Shi'ar flagship.X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1 In the aftermath of the miniseries, most of the Starjammers were captured and subsequently imprisoned by Vulcan. Lilandra, Korvus, and Rachel Summers escaped and remain free. =X-Men: Kingbreaker and War of Kings= Marvel has announced that the Starjammers will play a large role in the upcoming sequel to Emperor Vulcan called X-Men: Kingbreaker. They will also be seen prominently in the War of Kings storyline, which also features Vulcan, the Inhumans, Nova, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. = Poison X = When Chris was talking to Cyclops from the past, the Starjammers are attacked by mercenaries with symbiotes. The mercenaries wanted them so they could go to steal with the help of their navigator. The X-Men Blue team, with the help of a reluctant Venom, went to space so they could save the Starjammers. When the symbiotes bonded with the Starjammers, the X-Men went to the mercenaries' ship and Cyclops freed the team. While the symbiotes were battling amongst themselves, the Poisons arrived, consumed the mercenaries, and began attacking the X-Men since they themselves were now bonded to symbiotes. They survived and after escaping the Poisons and the X-Men gave their symbiotes to the Starjammers to return them to Klyntar.Venom X-Men Blue: Poison X. Marvel Comics. = Death of Thanos = In the aftermath of the \\"Infinity Wars\\" storyline, the Starjammers were present at Thanos' funeral. Starfox shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness in a new body before his death. The funeral is attacked by the Black Order, who steals Thanos's body and rip open a black hole in space, sending everyone into the rip. Though Silver Surfer was able to rescue the Starjammers with the cost of his own wellbeing, everyone else were still trapped.Silver Surfer Black #1. Marvel Comics.

Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In this reality, the formation of the Starjammers is essentially the same as in the main reality. They consisted of slaves that broke free during the reign of Emperor D'Ken. They included Earthman Christopher Summers, Ch'od, Hepzibah, and Raza Longknife. Early on in their time together, Chris was infected with a Brood embryo and would return to Earth leaving the Starjammers without a leader; however, the circumstances behind this would be unrevealed.Tales From the Age of Apocalypse #2 The Starjammers would eventually find someone who could lead them in the form of Deathbird, the former ruler of the Shi'ar Empire, who had been removed from the throne by her evil brother D'Ken.Gambit and the X-Ternals #2 When the X-Ternals arrived in the Shi'ar galaxy, they were saved by the Starjammers from the crystallization wave caused by the destabilized M'Kraan Crystal.

Only Deathbird would accompany the X-Ternals to the planets surface where their mission would be a success. It would also see D'Ken left in a paralyzed state, trapped within the crystal.Gambit and the X-Ternals #3 =Mutant X= In this reality, the Starjammers consist of Cyclops, Binary, Lockheed, Nova, and Silver Surfer.

History Shelter was launched on 1 December 1966, evolving out of the work on behalf of homeless people then being carried on in Notting Hill in London. The launch of Shelter hugely benefited from the coincidental screening, in November 1966, of the BBC television play Cathy Come Home ten days before Shelter's launch. The film led to a public outcry and calls for action after its transmission. It was written by Jeremy Sandford and directed by Ken Loach ‚Äì and highlighted the plight of the homeless in Britain. Shelter was set up by the Rev Bruce Kenrick after forming the Notting Hill Housing Trust in 1963.

The Indians of Canada Pavilion was a pavilion at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Pavilion, constructed as a temporary structure for public exhibition at Expo 67, contained works of Indigenous art and culture alongside historical and political commentary concerning the past and present issues facing the Indigenous Peoples in Canada. Organizers consulted with Indigenous leaders and advisors to create the narrative and content exhibited within the pavilion, content which proved unexpected provocative and controversial by both the Government of Canada and the general public. The exhibits emphasized an Indigenous view of history, which stressed the role the non-Indigenous Canadians and the Canadian Government played in the suppression of Indigenous culture and values, the assimilation of Indigenous children in government funded residential schools, and the history of colonialism and the impact of the doctrine of discovery on the lives Indigenous people from contact to the present day.  Exhibits and central theme  The Contents of the Exhibits were intended to reflect the Indigenous people‚Äôs answer to the question: \\"What do you want to tell the people of Canada and the World when they come to Expo in 1967?\\". Their answer can be found in the central theme of the pavilion, which was \\"the struggle of the Indian to accept a modern technological society with its mass culture while preserving his identity, his personal integrity, and the moral and spiritual values of his fathers\\". One of the methods by which this theme was expressed was through an ever present display of narrative text that led visitors through a variety of themed sections. Examples include \\"When the White Man Came We Welcomed Him With Love\\" and \\"The great explorers of Canada traveled in Indian canoes, wore Indian snow-shoes, ate Indian food, lived in Indian houses. They could not have lived or moved without Indian friends\\". Both messages were present in the Pavilion‚Äôs reception area. Visitors were led past examples of Indigenous art and artifacts such a very large exterior Totem Pole, birch bark canoes, rawhide snowshoes, sculpture, murals and drawings by Indigenous artists such as Alex Janvier and Norval Morriseau, and traditional clothing and beadwork, as well as images of pertinent documents such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and several crown Treaties. A section near the end of the pathway through the pavilion contained photographs of indigenous people in modern occupations such as tradesman, craftsmen and farmers, markedly more upbeat than previous exhibits. This section was designed by a branch of Indian Affairs. The final section contained a large space with a central imitation fire pit that invited visitors to sit and reflect upon the future of Indigenous people of Canada. The experience of visitors was managed by thirteen Indigenous women, hired from a selection of 220 applicants by Expo organizers, to act as hostesses to guide and interpret the exhibits for those unfamiliar with Indigenous culture. The Indigenous women represented the Siksika, Haisla, Haida, Mi‚Äôkmaq, Ojibwa, Mohawk, Innu, and Nlaka'pamux First Nations, among others.  Response and media reaction  Reactions to the exhibits present in the Pavilion from the government, the public and the press ranged from outrage and shock to acceptance and accolade. Many mainstream journalists critical of the pavilion reacted to the threat the message of the pavilion posed to Canadian Nationalism by criticizing the government for allowing itself to be humiliated. An article in the Toronto Star described the exhibits as an \\"embarrassment to the Government of Canada.\\". The Globe and Mail and other newspapers complained that \\"Ottawa footed the bill\\" to embarrass itself. An article in the Montreal Star suggest that \\"the pavilion may raise some hackles in government circles\\". Other journalists took a different tack, claiming that the Pavilion was a \\"dig at the white man\\". Positive reaction by the mainstream press was more commonplace. Some outlets considered the pavilion thought provoking, While others congratulated the Indigenous people for letting \\"the Indians to tell their own story in their own way,\\" while reflecting that the \\"bitterness with the past is justified\\". A report from the Guelph Mercury summarizes the positive response by the mainstream media well: > \\"‚Ä¶it is encouraging that the Indians themselves have used this opportunity > in this way to dramatize their condition. It is an indication of a new > spirit of determination and independence that has for too long been missing. > The Indian pavilion at Expo ought to challenge the conscience of every white > Canadian who sees it.\\" Reaction by Indigenous peoples was nuanced. One Indigenous leader thought the pavilion was a \\"True reflection of the Indian‚Äôs spirit of dignity\\". While the then director of the National Congress of American Indians was impressed with the fact that \\"Canadian Indians may be 50 to 75 years behind [American Indians] in our relations with the federal government\\".

The first Marvel comic he read was Fantastic Four #69, \\"By Ben Betrayed\\" (Dec. 1967), \\"They were a family who had super-powers and helped each other out. I wanted to be part of a family like that,\\" he says. Anderson began writing and drawing his own comics on school binder paper, creating a pantheon of his own that included \\"Radium the Robot\\" and \\"The Chameleon\\". After doing fanzine illustrations, Anderson's first professional comics work appeared in the mid-1970s in independent/underground publications such as All-Slug, Tesserae, and Venture. = Comics professional = In 1981, Ka-Zar The Savage, written by Bruce Jones, became Anderson's first regular series. The X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills graphic novel followed, as well as artwork on a number of Marvel Comics series, including the heroic space-opera Strikeforce: Morituri. During this period, Anderson was active doing artwork for independent publishers Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, including the innovative cinematic comic Somerset Holmes. In 1995, Anderson co-created with writer Kurt Busiek and cover artist Alex Ross, the award-winning Astro City. Other work included J. Michael Straczynski's Rising Stars: Untouchable spin-off series written by Fiona Avery covering the life story of special assassin Laurel Darkhaven. Work continues on a 200-plus page graphic novel, Jar of Ashes, written by Shirley Johnston.

Anderson's work is known for its focus on character. \\"My greatest joy in drawing comics comes when I've added nuance to a character with just the right expression and illustrated a scene that captures the perfect moment of mood.

Criteria Approved in March 2004 by the Secretary of the Air Force, the Air Force Meritorious Unit Award is awarded in the name of the Secretary to recognize squadrons, groups, or wings for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11 September 2001. The recommended unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Legion of Merit to an individual. Superior performance of the normal mission alone does not justify award of the MUC. Service in a combat zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat effort. The Air Force MUA is worn immediately after the Gallant Unit Citation (GUC) and before the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA). Additional awards of the MUA are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters. The Air Force MUA is not awarded to any unit or unit component that was previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (AFOEA), or unit awards from other service components for the same act, achievement, or service.

Directed by Kurt Neumann, film sees Tarzan encounter a tribe of leopard- worshippers. It was shot in the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. Its plot has nothing in common with the 1935 novel Tarzan and the Leopard Men. Plot Travelers near Zambezi are being killed, apparently by leopards. The commissioner (Dennis Hoey) asks Tarzan to look into the matter. Tarzan immediately doubts that leopards are the problem. At the same time, Tarzan, Jane, and Boy take in Kimba, a boy who claims to have become lost in the jungle. Kimba (Tommy Cook) is the brother of Queen Lea, leader of a leopard cult. She has dispatched him to spy on Tarzan. Queen Lea also conspires with Ameer Lazar (Edgar Barrier), a Western-educated doctor who resents the West's domination of the area. Kimba has a goal of his own: to take the heart of Jane (Brenda Joyce) a deed that would make him a warrior in the eyes of the cult. The Leopard Men wear leopard skins that form a cowl and cape, with iron claws attached to the back of each hand. Queen Lea (Acquanetta) wears a headband, wrist bands, ankle bands, halter top and miniskirt made of leopard skin. As \\"Variety\\" put it: \\"She displays plenty of what it takes to stir male interest and handles her acting chores adequately.\\" She works her followers into a frenzy in an underground chamber, \\"These skins are your disguise. These claws are your weapons. Go not as men, but as leopards. Go swiftly, silently.\\" They attack a caravan bringing four teachers (Iris Flores, Lillian Molieri (Miss Central America of 1945), Helen Gerald and Kay Solinas) and bring the maidens back for sacrifice. They also capture Tarzan, Jane, and Boy. Tarzan brings down the roof of the cavern, destroying the cult and rescuing his friends. The plot is summed up by these lines spoken by Tarzan (about Cheeta): :\\"If an animal can act like a man, why not a man like an animal?\\"  Cast  *Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan *Brenda Joyce as Jane *Johnny Sheffield as Boy *Acquanetta as Lea, the High Priestess *Dennis Hoey as Commissioner *Tommy Cook as Kimba *Anthony Caruso as Mongo *George J.

The medals were split among 22 countries, Romania topping the medal table, their women winning 3 golds, with the traditionally strong Germany, Great Britain and Australia picking up four medals in total. Romania's Elisabeta LipƒÉ won her fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal and fifth overall. LipƒÉ, who was part of Romania's women's eight, won her first in Los Angeles in 1984 followed by gold medals in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004, a record span of 20 years between her first and last gold medal. It was also her eighth overall, which is more than any other rower, having won a silver and a bronze in 1988 and an additional silver in 1992. In winning her medal at age 39, LipƒÉ became the oldest rower to win a gold medal and the oldest athlete in an endurance sport to win a gold medal. Team USA competes in the lightweight four rowing competition. Matthew Pinsent also won his fourth consecutive medal, this time without legendary partner Steve Redgrave. The British men's coxless four of Steve Williams, James Cracknell, Ed Coode with Pinsent at stroke narrowly saw off the challenge of the World Champion Canadian crew of Cameron Baerg, Thomas Herschmiller, Jake Wetzel and Barney Williams. It was a dramatic stretch run with the lead literally changing hands with each stroke. (In rowing, the boat will surge depending on where the rowers are during the stroke. Pinsent would later say that he thought they had won because they were in the best part of the stroke when they crossed the line). Great Britain won with a time of 6:06.98, just 8/100ths of a second faster than the Canadians. Pinsent later wept at the medal ceremony. Matching LipƒÉ's and Pinsent's feat of four consecutive gold medals was German sculler Kathrin Boron in the women's quadruple sculls. She had won the doubles event in Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000 and the quadruple sculls in Atlanta 1996. Australian James Tomkins, competing in his fifth games at the age of 39, won his third gold medal, and fourth medal overall, teaming with his longtime partner Drew Ginn in the men's pair. Tomkins and Ginn had been part of the straight four that won the gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and they had won the 1999 World Championship in the pair, but Ginn had missed the 2000 Sydney Olympics with a severe back injury, and Tompkins had finished third with a new partner Matthew Long in the pair. Tomkins was also the oldest male rower to win an Olympic gold medal, surpassing Steve Redgrave. Norway's Olaf Tufte won the men's single scull, and Germany's Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski won with women's single scull beating two-time defending Olympic Champion Ekaterina Karsten. The Romanian women's pair of Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu took gold before doubling up to help their eight take gold, giving Damian her fourth Olympic Gold medal -- having won 2 golds in Sydney in the same disciplines. The United States won the prestigious men's eight for the twelfth time overall and the first time since 1964. In the second preliminary heat, both the U.S. and Canadian crews broke the previous world best time, with the U.S. winning in 5:19.85, which stood as a world best time until the second World Cup regatta of 2012.http://www.worldrowing.com/events/2012-worldcup-2/mens- eight/heat/ The United States would go on to win the final.

Prick up Your Ears: The Biography of Joe Orton. New York: Knopf, 1978, p. 128 It was first produced in London at the New Arts Theatre on 6 May 1964 and transferred to the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 29 June 1964.Orton (1976, 64). Plot summary =Act 1= Mr Sloane is a young man looking for a place to board, who happens by the home of Kath, a middle-aged landlady whose home is on the outskirts of a rubbish dump. Kath is eager to have Mr Sloane as a tenant at her home, which she shares with her nearly blind father, Kemp. In getting to know Mr Sloane, Kath is open with Mr Sloane about a previous relationship she had, which led to her bearing a child, whom her brother insisted on her giving up for adoption as it was conceived out of wedlock. Mr Sloane reveals he is himself an orphan, though vague about his parents' death, except that they \\"passed away together\\". Kath's father has an immediate distrust of Mr Sloane, believing he is the same man who killed his employer some years earlier. After an altercation between Kemp and Sloane, resulting in Sloane being stabbed in the leg, Kath begins to make somewhat subtle advances toward the young man. When Mr Sloane attempts to reciprocate, Kath warns him facetiously not to betray his trust. Kathy's brother Ed arrives soon after to find the visitor staying with his sister, much to his dismay. Kemp has an estranged relationship with his son as he found him to be \\"committing some kind of felony in the bedroom\\" as a teenager. Despite Ed's initial opposition to Mr Sloane staying with his sister, after speaking with Sloane, Ed eventually relents and even goes so far as to offer him a job as his chauffeur. As Sloane recovers from his injury earlier in the evening, Kath returns wearing a transparent negligee and seemingly seduces Mr Sloane as the lights go down and Act One ends. =Act 2= The action resumes \\"some months later\\" and begins with Mr Sloane recounting an evening in which a young woman gave him her telephone number. Kath ambiguously hints at her jealousy, before ultimately revealing she is pregnant and concerned that her brother will strongly disapprove. Ed arrives soon after and discovers that Mr Sloane had taken his car out joyriding the night before with his friends. Upon finding out that they also had a woman with them, Ed divulges that he feels women are crude, and misleading. Ed advises Sloane to pack his things as he will be on call as his assistant at all hours. When Sloane leaves the room to pack, Kemp mildly attempts to reconcile with his son, and conveys that Kath and Sloane have been sleeping together and believes Kath is now pregnant. When confronted, Sloane confirms he has been sleeping with Kath, but claims she \\"threw herself\\" at him. A short time later, Ed departs to buy cigarettes, and Kemp returns to confront Sloane as his employer's murderer. Sloane eventually attacks Kemp, resulting in his death. =Act 3= Upon finding his dead father, Ed is initially insistent that justice be served and Sloane be turned over to the police. However, Sloane persuades Ed to fabricate a story to make the death appear an accident, in exchange for his servitude. When Kath discovers the dead body, she is apprehensive to stray from the truth especially given Sloane's intention to go and live with her brother. Sloane finds himself in a predicament: if he stays with Kath, Ed will report the murder to the authorities, and vice versa if he chooses to leave with Ed. Ultimately, a compromise is reached that will result in the pair \\"sharing\\" Mr. Sloane a few months at a time.

It was founded as a boys' school in 1877 and became coeducational in 1995. History The school was established in 1877 and in 1896 it bought out its older rival Mannamead School (founded in 1854), and was temporarily known as Plymouth and Mannamead College (hence the surviving abbreviation PMC).Chris Robinson, 'Plymouth College, The First Hundred Years', 2005, Pen & Ink. The School's motto, Dat Deus Incrementum ‚Äì God Gives The Increase, is the same as that of Westminster School, Marlborough College and Tonbridge School. In 1976, the first girls were admitted to the School's sixth form. It became fully coeducational in 1995, which also saw the end of Saturday morning lessons. In 2004, the School absorbed St Dunstan's Abbey School, an independent school for girls that had been founded by Lydia Sellon.A Sermon , Ascot Priory, retrieved 26 April 2015 The combined school is still known as Plymouth College and remains at Ford Park, near Mutley Plain, just north of the city centre. The preparatory school is a mile south-west, within the gated Millfields complex at Stonehouse. Today Plymouth College is an independent school for pupils from the ages of 3 to 18. Its headmaster is Mr Jonathan Cohen, who is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The school has a non-selective intake but admission is by way of its annual entrance examination at the age of 11, or by way of Common Entrance at 13, although applications are considered at any other times and are not unusual at the beginning of GCSE courses and the Sixth Form. The school offers A levels and the Sports Baccalaureate in the Sixth Form. The School has four houses named after past influential masters and headmasters: *Sargents (green) *Palmers (red) *Dales (yellow) * Chaytors (blue) Two other houses used to exist but were dissolved and the pupils distributed between the existing ones. This was to increase the strength of the competition. The older houses were College (black) and Thompsons (purple). Before 1953, there were four houses: College (black), Palmers (white), Sargents (blue) and Thompsons (green). In 1953, two further houses were created: Chaytors (purple) and Dales (yellow). Up to at least 1981, the colours appeared only as the background to the badge on the school cap. The houses compete against each other in a range of activities throughout the year for the Forsyth Cup. Boarders at the school were previously accommodated in two houses: College House (previously split into Colson House and Mannamead House), situated at Ford Park, and Captain's House for those in the Elite Swimming Programme, near the Preparatory School site. Captain's House was closed in 2017, with all boarders now accommodated on the Ford Park site. There has been a preparatory school on various Plymouth sites since the school's foundation; it currently accepts children aged 3 to 11. In 2005, the Prep Schools of Plymouth College and St Dunstans's Abbey combined to form Plymouth College Preparatory School, based at the St Dunstan's site. The School also has a CCF (Combined Cadet Force). Entry is voluntary and takes place at Year 10 for boys and girls. Service is for two years initially, but NCOs are chosen from those cadets who stay into the Sixth Form, as well as those who show merit and leadership in Years 10 and 11. There are three sections from which to choose: Army, Navy and RAF. Sport The school is involved with a wide range of competitive sports. The performance swimming programme won a swimming bronze at the 2008 Olympic Games, and at the 2012 Olympic Games fifteen-year-old R≈´ta Meilutytƒó won the gold medal in the 100m breaststroke for Lithuania. The number of pupils who have been selected to swim for England and Great Britain is now well into double figures and the swimming programme is offered in a partnership with the Plymouth Leander Swimming Club. The school also runs a Modern Pentathlon and Fencing Academy which regularly sees athletes compete in world, European and national competitions. The Academy has produced more than 50 national champions in fencing, biathle, biathlon, triathlon, tetrathlon and pentathlon. The diving partnership with Plymouth Diving saw Tom Daley become World Champion in 2009 and take bronze in the 2012 London Olympics. At the age of 13, Victoria Vincent was the youngest member of Team England in the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The Whiteworks Outward Bound centre on Dartmoor has a 20-bed bunkhouse and the school owns further grounds featuring rugby and cricket pitches at Delgany, Derriford, about two miles north of the Ford Park campus. Charitable status The previous Labour British Government and the Charity Commission indicated that independent schools would lose their charitable status if they could not clearly demonstrate that in addition to having high fees and exceptional facilities they also provide a measurable benefit to the local community and admit or provide places and education for the poor. Plymouth College facilities are widely used by local organisations, bursaries and scholarships are available and there is an evolving pattern of outreach and links with the city and community.  Former teachers  * Henry John Chaytor, headmaster from 1908 to 1919 Notable alumni Former pupils of Plymouth College are known as OPMs (Old Plymothians and Mannameadians).

History The party evolved out of divisions between moderate and radical liberals in the Liberal Party of Ecuador. As in many Latin American countries, Ecuador has experienced much conflict, often violent, between the Liberal and Conservative parties. Eloy Alfaro brought the Liberal Party to power during the revolution of 1895. In 1925, the Liberal Party was officially founded as the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party (PLRE). Over the next 50 years several of its members served as presidents of Ecuador. The party was in power from 1895 to 1911, from 1921 to 1952 and from 1960 to 1970. During each period of power the party was overthrown by military coups. In 2000, and after a difficult period of time when the party was almost disappearing, Julio Eduardo Ponce Arteta stepped to the challenge as National Director of the PLRE and made the Liberal Party participate in the presidential elections again with the party's candidate, Ivonne Baki. Couple of years later the party was unable to fulfill the necessary 5% of votes required to remain a valid political entity, the PLRE ceased to officially exist. Nonetheless, the PLRE retains recognition for its important role in Ecuadorian history and has reputedly inspired several other political parties. Similarly, the PLRE's founding leader, Eloy Alfaro, is still widely revered in Ecuador. In 2008, a political party with the same name was registered for the 2009 presidential elections.

The character is based on the deity Baldr from Norse mythology. Publication history Created by editor-plotter Stan Lee and penciller Jack Kirby, Balder first appears in Journey into Mystery #85 (October 1962). Fictional character biography One of the Norse Gods of Asgard, Balder is the half-brother of the Thunder God Thor, companion to the Warriors Three and a loyal follower and son of Odin, ruler of the gods. Balder has aided Thor against many of his foes, such as Skagg the Storm Giant and the fire demon Surtur when he warned Thor about them being released by Loki who planned for them to kill Odin after being told by Heimdall,Journey Into Mystery #104 (May 1964) Thor's adopted brother Loki,Journey Into Mystery #111 (Dec. 1964) the Executioner and Enchantress,Journey Into Mystery #116 (May 1965) the Enchanters Three,Thor #143-145 (Aug. - Oct. 1967) the Wrecker,Thor #148-150 (Jan. - Mar. 1968) and Mangog.Thor #154-157 (July - Oct. 1968) Balder is also briefly named ruler of Asgard during Thor's quest to find a then missing Odin.Thor #255 (Jan. 1977) Balder is beloved by most who know him. When threatened with execution for ignoring the call of battle for the sake of a fallen bird, his men begged Odin to take one of their lives instead.Journey into Mystery #107 (Aug. 1964) Like the mythological version, the Marvel version of Balder is the catalyst that will trigger Ragnar√∂k and end Asgard. To prevent this, Odin cast spells to keep Balder invulnerable. This almost happens when Loki had the blind god Hoder accidentally kill Balder with a mistletoe arrow, but is averted by the planning of Odin, who creates a shield around Balder's pyre,Thor #274-275 (Aug. - Sept. 1978) and later restores Balder to life when the Asgardians, after being slain in battle with the Celestials, were brought back to life by Thor using portions of energy donated by other Gods.Thor #301-302 (Nov. - Dec. 1980) On the second occasion, however, Balder is traumatized by the experience as he saw the souls of all those he had slain in battle and renounces killing. It is later revealed that in order to escape Hel, Balder was forced by Hela to kill all of those \\"tens of thousands\\" he had previously slain in battle again, in an epic confrontation that lasted so long Balder's hair had turned white when he finally emerged victorious.Thor #360 Volstagg of the Warriors Three takes it upon himself to become Balder's boon friend in an attempt to lift him out of his long depression. While Balder treasures the friendship, Volstagg's efforts do little to cheer him.Thor #341 (March 1984) Balder also has a love-hate relationship with Karnilla, the Queen of the Norns, who has aided both Loki and Asgard at times; on one occasion Karnilla forces Balder to renounce Odin and serve her,Thor #189-201 (June 1971 - July 1972) whilst on another she joins forces with Asgard against Surtur at Balder's request.Thor #350-351 (Dec. 1984 - Jan. 1985) Her emotions are roused during Balder's deep depression as she feels Loki has ruined a unique member of the Asgardians. Karnilla's lust for Balder inadvertently causes the death of Balder's love, Nanna - an act that Balder has never forgotten.Thor #305-306 (March - Apr. 1981) Balder later accepts the warrior part of himself and goes on to save Karnilla's people from a rogue giant's spell.Balder the Brave #1-4 (Nov. 1985 - May 1986) Balder and all other Asgardians (with the exception of Thor) eventually perish during the final Ragnarok,Thor vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)It is stated in the comic that the \\"Asgardians embraced a singular, inevitable death\\" although he is later found inhabiting the armor of the Destroyer.Thor vol. 3, #5 (Jan. 2008) Loki reveals Balder is the son of Odin and Frigga, and the half-brother of Thor, meaning he is then made a Prince of Asgard.Thor vol. 3, #10 (Sept. 2008) When Thor is forced to kill his reborn grandfather Bor, Loki coerces Balder - now a royal prince - into exiling the Thunder God. Balder then assumes the throne of Asgard.Thor #600 (Apr. 2009) When Loki has the Asgardians moved to Latveria, he is shown at a banquet held by Doctor Doom. Balder even asked that since the Asgardians are now in Latveria, why couldn't they invite Thor as well. Loki calmed Balder down to prevent Doctor Doom from reacting to the comment.Thor #601 (June 2009) Balder meets a diner owner named Bill (who fell in love with Kelda and followed her to Latveria) and gives him a cloak to keep warm.Thor #602 (Aug. 2009) Balder later witnesses Bill's assault by Loki's henchmen, upon Bill having discovered the evil nature of Loki's scheme with Doctor Doom.Thor #603 (Nov. 2009) After fending them off, Bill dies in Balder's arms having Balder tell Kelda that he loves her and telling Balder about Loki's plot.Thor Giant-Size Finale (Jan. 2010) Balder and the other Asgardians retaliate even after Doctor Doom kills Kelda. Balder and the other Asgardians are forced to fight Endrik (who has been modified with technological implants) and many other mutilated Asgardians.Thor #604 (Feb. 2010) Balder and the other Asgardians continued their fight with the mutilated Asgardians while Thor battled Doctor Doom.Thor #605 (Jan. 2010) Balder kills the mutilated Asgardians in order to get to Kelda's heart. After Loki restores Kelda to life and Thor defeats Doctor Doom's Destroyer armor, Balder leads the Asgardians back to Broxton, Oklahoma. Back in Asgard, Balder is concerned over his foolishness over allowing what transpired in Latveria to happen. Loki assures him he is a fine king.Thor #606 (Mar. 2010) During the Siege storyline, Loki warns Balder that Norman Osborn is rallying up an army to invade Asgard following the incident with Volstagg and the U-Foes at Soldier Field.Siege #1 (Mar. 2010) Balder is later informed about the situation with Volstagg by Hogun and Fandral.Thor #607 (Apr. 2010) When Captain America arrives with the New Avengers and the Secret Warriors, Balder is pleased at the fact that Thor's allies have joined the battle.Siege #3 (May 2010) Balder remains King of Asgard after the failed Siege, but is stricken with great guilt, believing his rule has led to naught but ruin, but Thor persuades him to remain monarch and accept him as his new Chief Advisor.Thor #610 (July 2010) Balder attends the Council of Godheads convened to counter the imminent universal threat of the Chaos King and his impending Chaos War, to decide which mortal paragon they would choose to combat Mikaboshi. Vali Halfling later appears to the Council and challenges them to disprove their own impotence by stopping him before he himself attained godhood, and Balder tells Anansi that Halfling was the son of Loki and banished to Midgard long ago. When the Chaos War at long last nears Earth, the Council summons Hercules, Amadeus Cho and Delphyne Gorgon before them and command them to bow before their authority; in return, the newly restored and empowered Hercules fights and easily bests most of them, including Balder himself with a single rage-fueled blow.Chaos War #1 (Dec. 2010) After the Underworld is overthrown by Mikaboshi, and Hela and Pluto are overwhelmed by his devastating forces, Balder calls for the Council to fight alongside him against the Chaos King, only for the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu to seal the throne room of the Celestial Axis, the latter claiming that if he went now, Mikaboshi would be able to trace him back to the Axis and subsequently invade all their realms, but promising that they will aid Hercules and Thor in their \\"own time\\". However, Mikaboshi breaks into the Celestial Axis after Hercules pierced the veil shielding it, and launches an assault on all of Earth's pantheons, seemingly decimating all of them with brutal ease and slaughtering many of the deities, although Balder is one of the survivors and later encounters Hercules.Chaos War #3-4 (Jan. - Feb. 2011) Powers and abilities Balder is said to be the fastest and most agile of all Asgardian warriors, with his speed being rivaled only by Hermod. Thor once notes that Balder is able to move at the \\"speed of light\\" and realizes that Balder is too fast for him to strike a blow and so must use his lightning to disarm him (and break the spell three troll witches had cast upon him).Thor #369 Balder possesses superhuman strength superior to the average Asgardian male and like all Asgardians, superhuman endurance and longevity (via the Golden Apples of Idunn). He is immune to all Earthly diseases and has some resistance to magic. Courtesy of a spell cast by his mother and Asgardian goddess Frigga to try to avert Ragnar√∂k, Balder is almost totally invulnerable while within the Asgardian dimension, unable to suffer harm from virtually any living or non- living being.Journey into Mystery #106-107 (July - Aug. 1964) Any projectile hurled at Balder which is capable of killing or injuring an Asgardian is magically deflected from its path before it can strike him; however, he can be injured or killed by weapons made of mistletoe wood, or if he wills himself to be vulnerable.Thor #305 (Mar. 1981) Balder could also die in the Asgardian dimension through means that do not involve weaponry: for example, he could starve to death or be asphyxiated; presumably he can also be harmed by the power of Odin, and possibly by spells and magical energies used by others. It is not known whether Balder also becomes vulnerable when he is in dimensions other than those of Asgard and Earth. Being the Asgardian god of light, after a period of intense training, Balder can also generate intense light and heat strong enough to melt the entire fortress of Utgard-Loki and reduce him and his fellow Frost Giants down to tiny size, an ability he has been shown to retain even on Midgard even after many months, as shown in the events of Siege, albeit possibly with the aid of his enchanted blade,Thor #609 (June 2010) can communicate with animals, and has also demonstrated minor magical talents on rare occasions, such as shielding himself from mortal eyesight while flying to Earth on Odin's steed in one instance, sensing that Thor was in danger on Earth while in Asgard,Thor #179 (Aug. 1970) or teleporting himself and Sif (without the use of the latter's enchanted sword) to Earth from Asgard in another.Thor #147 (Dec. 1967) However, though Balder can project some degree of energy, unlike most of his brethren, his ability to do so is nevertheless far lesser to that of the other gods of light in other pantheons (namely Apollo, who can control at least double the amount of energy as Balder).Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z hardcover Vol. 14 He is also a highly skilled weapons master (wielding the enchanted sword of Frey, capable of fighting of its own accord) with millennia of extensive experience and training, and is a proficient tactician and master horseman, having been entrusted with several special missions by Odin.Journey into Mystery Annual #1 (Oct. 1965) Balder becomes a member of Earth's Council of Godheads following Thor's banishment.Heroic Age: Prince of Power #1 (July 2010) Other versions =Earth X= In the alternate Earth X reality, the Asgardians were actually aliens that were manipulated by the Celestials into believing they were the Gods of Norse myth.

However, Odin foiled their plot and kept Balder alive.Earth X #X (June 2000) =Marvel Zombies= In the Marvel Zombies alternate universe, Balder is one of many heroes who attends Nick Fury's briefing on how to deal with the zombie plague.Marvel Zombies: Dead Days #1 (July 2007) =MC2= An older version of Balder existed in the MC2 universe, who died to protect Thor in his battle against Galactus.Last Planet Standing #1-5 (Aug. - Dec. 2005) =Ultimate Marvel= Balder first appears in the Ultimate Marvel Universe in the prequel limited series Ultimate Comics: Thor issue 2.Ultimate Comics: Thor #2 (Jan. 2011) Balder Odinson is one of the three sons of Odin, who helped end the war between Asgard and Jotunheim with help from his brothers Loki and Thor. Of the three, Balder was the better fighter and he was also the All-Seeing Eye of Odin. He was killed by Loki when he tried to stop his brother from stealing the Norn Stones out of Odin's Chamber. He later was resurrected in human form by Odin. As a human, Balder lives under the name of Donald Blake, and is later seen helping Thor out in the European Defense Initiative, by convincing the scientists that Thor's claims to be a God are genuine. He convinces Thor to take up the technology that simulates his godlike powers and use it to fulfil his role as a hero.Ultimate Comics: Thor #3-4 He is later killed in Ultimate Comics: Ultimates, along with most other Asgardians.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #2 In other media =Television= * Balder appears in The Mighty Thor segment of The Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Chris Wiggins. * Balder made a cameo appearance on the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"The Vengeance of Loki!\\". * Balder appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episodes \\"Thor the Mighty\\" and \\"Breakout, Part 1\\", voiced by Nolan North. * Balder appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Lo, How the Mighty Hath Abdicated\\", voiced by Travis Willingham. =Film= * Balder makes an appearance in the animated direct-to-video film Hulk vs. Thor voiced by Michael Adamthwaite. =Video games= * Balder appears in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Dave Wittenberg. =Toys= * Balder is the 153rd figurine in The Classic Marvel Figurine Collection.

He served as the 60th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and later as the 8th U.S. Ambassador to NATO, both under U.S. President Richard Nixon. He was Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board of Continental Illinois during the 1950s and 1960s. Early life Kennedy was born on July 21, 1905 in Randolph, Utah, to George and Katherine Kennedy (n√©e Johnson). His father was a rancher and served in Utah state government. His mother was ill for much of his childhood and the family grew up in Kaysville and later Ogden. His grandparents John Kennedy and Peter Johnson formed the Bank of Randolph. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Kennedy married Lenora Margaret Bingham in the church's Salt Lake Temple in November 1925. Shortly thereafter he served as a missionary for the church in Liverpool, England. His mission presidents were James E. Talmage and John A. Widtsoe. Palmer, Spencer J., The Expanding Church, (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978) p. 65 Kennedy attended public schools and received a bachelor's degree from Weber State University, graduating in 1928. His first government job was as a staff member for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Sobel, Robert. Biographical Dictionary of the United States Executive Branch, 1774-1977, (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1977) p. 199-200 During this time he built up his financial experience and later became assistant to then-Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles. Kennedy was also attending George Washington University and received master's and law degrees from there in 1935 and 1937. He completed the Stonier Graduate School of Banking program, then housed at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, in 1939. Chicago years He left the Federal Reserve and joined Continental of Illinois in 1946, starting in their bond department. By 1951, he was a bank President and later served as Chairman of the Board and CEO from 1959 to 1969. At the time of his appointment as Treasury Secretary in 1969, Continental Illinois ranked as the 15th largest bank in the world. Kennedy served as counselor to John K. Edmunds in the presidency of the LDS Church's Chicago Stake. He was also a member of the board of Nauvoo Restoration from its founding in 1962, and advised David O. McKay, Harold B. Lee and other LDS Church leaders on banking matters. It was in part due to the advice of Kennedy that McKay restructured the management of Zions First National Bank so that the church's president no longer held the title of bank president, with Orval Adams assuming that title. During these same years, Kennedy also served as chairman of Mayor Richard J. Daley's Mayor's Committee for Economic and Cultural Growth in Chicago. In 1957, Kennedy became a member of the board of trustees of the University of Chicago. While serving in this post, he was involved in fundraising. In 1966, he was asked to head a fundraising drive for Brigham Young University (BYU). He worked on this project until becoming the US Treasury Secretary. From 1961 until January 1969, Kennedy was a member of the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution. In 1963, he commissioned a house in Winnetka, Illinois. Government service Kennedy served as a special assistant on debt management to Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey. He also served on the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system from 1930 to 1946,Sobel, Robert. Biographical Dictionary of the United States Executive Branch, 1774-1977, (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1977) p. 199-200 ending up assistant to the Chairman. In October 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy (no relation) appointed him a member of a private corporation (COMSAT) to own and operate the United States' share of a global satellite communications system. He was elected to the permanent board of directors in 1964. In 1967, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Kennedy as chairman of the Commission on Budgetary Concepts, whose recommendations were adopted as standard government budgetary practice. Kennedy was nominated by Nixon to be the 60th Secretary of the Treasury. He served from 1969 until 1971. Nixon, who had little interest in economics and expected his top economic advisers to run that portfolio, fairly quickly concluded that Kennedy was not up to the task, being weak both on policy-making and as a lead economics spokesman for the administration. Nixon concluded Kennedy was a \\"cipher\\" and by April 1970 told aide John Ehrlichman that Kennedy was to be replaced. Kennedy served as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO from March 1972 to February 1973. He founded the US-Taiwan Business Council in 1976, and served as its Chairman for fourteen years, until 1990. Church service He also served as a special representative of the LDS Church's First Presidency. This assignment required him to represent the church around the world, meeting with government and ecclesiastical leaders. In 1985, the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at BYU opened and is named in his honor. Following the death of his wife, Lenora Bingham, on August 24, 1995, Kennedy died in Salt Lake City, Utah on May 1, 1996, from cardiovascular disease and the congestive heart failure, at the age of 90. He was interred in Randolph City Cemetery, near to his birthplace in Randolph, Utah. References Biography * External links *David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies *Funeral of David M.

Also, the theory involves economic relationships, it occurs when each party have goods that the other parties value. Social exchange theory suggests that these calculations occur in romantic relationships, friendships, professional relationships and ephemeral relationships as simple as exchanging words with a customer at the cash register. Social exchange theory says that if the costs of the relationship are higher than the rewards, such as a lot of effort or money put into a relationship and not reciprocated, this could lead to problems. History The most comprehensive social exchange theories are those of the American social psychologists John W. Thibaut (1917‚Äì1986) and Harold H. Kelley (1921‚Äì2003), the American sociologists George C. Homans (1910‚Äì1989), Peter M. Blau (1918‚Äì2002), Richard Marc Emerson (d. 1982), and Claude L√©vi-Strauss (1908‚Äì2009). Homans defined social exchange as the exchange of activity, tangible or intangible, and more or less rewarding or costing between at least two persons. After Homans founded the theory, other theorists continued to write about it, particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson, who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology.Karen S. Cook and Erick R. W.Rice. Department of Sociology, Stanford University, Stanford California 94305. Handbook of Sociological Theory, edited by Jonathan H. Turner. kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers, New York. Homans' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another. Although there are various modes of exchange, Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange. John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts, the dyad and small group. L√©vi-Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange. = Thibaut and Kelley = Thibaut and Kelley based their theory principally on small groups related with dyadic relationships. They used the reward-cost matrices from the Game Theory and discovered some clues of individuals‚Äô interdependence such as the power of a party over each other. Also known as the ‚Äúcorrespondence‚Äù versus ‚Äúnoncorrespondence‚Äù of outcomes. Additionally, they suggest that an individual can unilaterally affect her or his own outcomes in a relationship through chosen behaviors. They could predict the possible course of a social interaction through the analysis of aspects of power in an encounter. They also experimented on how the outcomes received in a relationship could define a person's attractions to relationships. = Homans = Homans based his theory on concepts of equilibration, expectancy and distributive justice in dyadic exchange. With this, he tries to explain the social interaction in small groups and the rewards received proportional to their costs and investments. Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation‚Äìsatiation proposition, described below. #Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action. #Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it. #Deprivation‚Äìsatiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes. = Blau = Blau's theory is very similar to Homans‚Äô. However, he uses more economics terms and it is based principally on emergent social structure in social exchange patterns in small groups. His theory analyzes the development of exchange theory in economics without emphasizing on the psychological assumptions. He contributed to the idea of distinguishing between social and economic exchanges and exchange and power. The goal of his theory was to identify complex and simple processes without ignoring emergent properties. Blau's utilitarian focus encouraged the theorist to look forward, as in what they anticipated the reward would be in regards to their next social interaction. Blau felt that if individuals focused too much on the psychological concepts within the theory, they would refrain from learning the developing aspects of social exchange. Blau emphasized technical economic analysis whereas Homans concentrated more on the psychology of instrumental behavior. = Emerson = Emerson was inspired by Homans and Blau's ideas. He focused on the interaction and relationship between individuals and parties. His view of social exchange theory emphasizes the resource availability, power, and dependence as primary dynamics. He thought that relations were organized in different manners, and they could differ depending on the type and amount of the resources exchanged. He poses the idea that power and dependence are the main aspects that define a relationship. According to Emerson, Exchange is not a theory, but a framework from which other theories can converge and be compared to structural functionalism. Emerson's perspective was similar to Blau's since they both focused on the relationship power had with the exchange process. Emerson says that social exchange theory is an approach in sociology that is described for simplicity as an economic analysis of noneconomic social situations. Exchange theory brings a quasi-economic form of analysis into those situations. = L√©vi-Strauss = Social exchange theorist in anthropology. He is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange. He based his kinship systems on Mauss's investigation. As it works in the form of indirect reciprocities, Levi-Strauss suggest the concept of generalized exchange. Self-interest and interdependence Self-interest and interdependence are central properties of social exchange. These are the basic forms of interaction when two or more actors have something of value to each other, and they have to decide whether to exchange and in what amounts. Homans uses the concepts of individualism to explain exchange processes. To him, the meaning of individual self-interest is a combination of economic and psychological needs. Fulfilling self-interest is often common within the economic realm of the social exchange theory where competition and greed can be common. In social exchange, self-interest is not a negative thing; rather, when self-interest is recognized, it will act as the guiding force of interpersonal relationships for the advancement of both parties' self-interest\\"‚ÄîMichael Roloff (1981) Thibaut and Kelley see the mutual interdependence of persons as the central problem for the study of social behavior. They developed a theoretical framework based on the interdependence of actors. They also highlighted social implications of different forms of interdependence such as reciprocal control. According to their interdependence definition, outcomes are based on a combination of parties' efforts and mutual and complementary arrangements. Basic concepts Social exchange theory views exchange as a social behavior that may result both in economic and social outcomes. Social exchange theory has been generally analyzed by comparing human interactions with the marketplace. The study of the theory from the microeconomics perspective is attributed to Blau. Under his perspective every individual is trying to maximize his wins. Blau stated that once this concept is understood, it is possible to observe social exchanges everywhere, not only in market relations, but also in other social relations like friendship. Social exchange process brings satisfaction when people receive fair returns for their expenditures. The major difference between social and economic exchange is the nature of the exchange between parties. Neoclassic economic theory views the actor as dealing not with another actor but with a market and environmental parameters, such as market price.Cook, Karen S., and Richard Marc Emerson. Social exchange theory. Beverly Hills, Calif.: SAGE Publications, 1987. Print. Unlike economic exchange, the elements of social exchange are quite varied and cannot be reduced to a single quantitative exchange rate.\\"SOCIAL EXCHANGE THEORY.\\" Encyclopedia of Public Relations. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2005. Credo Reference. 9 Feb. 2010. Web. 2 Nov. 2013. . According to Stafford, social exchanges involve a connection with another person; involve trust and not legal obligations; are more flexible; and rarely involve explicit bargaining. =Cost and rewards= Simple social exchange models assume that rewards and costs drive relationship decisions. Both parties in a social exchange take responsibility for one another and depend on each other. The elements of relational life include: Costs are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner. (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.) Rewards are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.) As with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides. : If worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability. : Homans based his theory on behaviorism to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs. The \\"satisfactory-ness\\" of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party. = Reciprocity Norm = Summarized by Gouldner, the reciprocity norm states that a benefit should be returned and the one who gives the benefit should not be harmed. This is used to stabilize relationships and to identify the egoism. This norm suggests the independence in relationships and invite the individual to consider more than one's self-interest. = The Social Penetration Theory = I. Altman and D. Taylor's: They introduce the social penetration theory, which states the nature and quality of social exchange and close bonds. It suggests once the individuals start to give more of themselves to one another, relationships progress progressively from exchanging superficial goods to others more meaningful. It progresses to the point called ‚Äúself-disclosure‚Äù, where the individuals share innermost thoughts and feelings with one another. = Equity and inequity = In this process, the individuals will compare their rewards with others‚Äô in relation to their costs. Equity can be defined as the balance between a person's inputs and outcomes on the job. Some examples of inputs can be qualifications, promotions, interest on the job and how hard one works. Some outcomes can be pay, fringe benefits, and power status. The individual will mainly expect an equitable input-outcome ratio. Inequity happens when the individual apperceives an unbalanced ratio of their outcomes and other's outcomes. This can occur in a direct exchange of the two parties, or there can be a third party involved. An individual's point of view of equity or inequity can differ depending on the individual.  Aging  The basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiating exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person's life course through the various relationships, opportunities, and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages, these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur. It also changes through the directionality of support given to and by the individual with the people within their support network. Within this model, there are different types of support (Social support) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual. Theoretical propositions Ivan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory. # Individuals choose those alternatives from which they expect the most profit. # Cost being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the greatest rewards. # Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs. # Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long- term outcomes. # Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes. # Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval). # Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy. # Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes. # Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them. # Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree. # Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one's desirability in the social marketplace.) # In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures. In his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship, A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefore act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds.Nye, F. I. (1978). Is Choice and Exchange Theory the Key?. Journal Of Marriage & Family, 40(2), 219-232. =Homans= Even though Homans took an individualistic approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange. By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized. According to Homans, social structures emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances. Homans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals' behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans's version of social exchange theory. *The first proposition: the Success Proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated. * The second proposition: the Stimulus Proposition believes that if an individual's behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior. *The third proposition: the Value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur. *The fourth proposition: the Deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish. *The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations. Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly. = Frazer = Based on economics, Frazer's theory about social exchange emphasizes the importance of power and status differentiations in social exchange. Frazer's theory had a particular interest in the cross-cousin marriage. = Malinowski = With his Kula exchange, Malinowski drew a sharp differentiation between economic exchange and social exchange. Using his Kula exchange, Malinowski states that the motives of exchange can be mainly social and psychological. = Mauss = Mauss's theory tries to identify the role played by morality and religion in the social exchange. Mauss argues the exchange found in the society is influenced by social behaviors, while morality and religion influence all aspects of life. = Bohannan = Bohannan focuses his theory on economic problems such as multicentrism, and modes of exchange. He contributed to the social exchange theory finding the role and function of markets in tribal subsistence economies, makes a distinction of economic redistribution and market exchange from social relationships. = Polanyi = He proposes three principles to create a new idea for socioeconomic change, transforming traditional economies, and political economic development. These principles are: reciprocity, redistribution and marketing. = Sahlins = He presents the idea that the economy is a category of behavior instead of just a simple category of culture. Assumptions Social exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support. All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories. The assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following: *Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments. *Humans are rational beings. *The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person. The assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following: *Relationships are interdependent. *Relational life is a process. The prisoner's dilemma is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly. All relationships involve exchanges although the balance of this exchange is not always equal. We cannot achieve our goals alone so as humans sometimes we have to become actors. In the world today we see actors as unemotional people but that is not the case once we reach our goals in the end. Comparison levels Social exchange includes \\"both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other\\". John Thibaut and Harold Kelley proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: Comparison Level and Comparison Level for Alternative. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the Comparison Level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual's comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual. The Comparison Level for Alternative (CLalt) refers to \\"the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone\\". In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange. CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay. Modes of exchange According to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in Behavioral Sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are rational. When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: \\"It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends\\". The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other's actions.Ekeh, Peter P.. Social exchange theory: the two traditions. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974. The process begins when at least one participant makes a \\"move\\", and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies. =Power dependence relations= Several definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange. However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson, who developed a theory of power-dependence relations. According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power. Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another. Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use. Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.(Stolte and Emerson, 1976) According to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner's outcomes. Behavior control is the power to cause another's behavior to change by changing one's own behavior. =Matrices= People develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power. These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix. *The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors (the specific skills each interactant possesses). *The effective matrix \\"which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange\\" *The dispositional matrix represents the way two people believe that rewards ought to be exchanged between them. There are three forms within these matrices: Reciprocity, Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity: #Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges #Reciprocity as a folk belief #Reciprocity as a moral norm A generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals. For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously. Another common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement. Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty. An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges. Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement. Critiques Katherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works *The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory. *The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn't the best option in a relationship. *The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case. *The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy. Russell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules. Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as altruism, group gain, status consistency and competition. Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry). Rosenfeld (2005) has noted significant limitations to Social Exchange Theory and its application in the selection of mates/partners. Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange moot.Rosenfeld, M. J. (2005). A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection. American Journal Of Sociology, 110(5), 1284-1325. doi:10.1086/428441 Applications The most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships. However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources. Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating: :Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum (\\"Theories Used in Research\\"). =Anthropology= Other applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of anthropology as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and norms. L√©vi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered. L√©vi‚ÄìStrauss uses a collectivist approach to explain exchanges. To L√©vi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms. This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process. L√©vi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups. =Relationships= Throughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study applied this theory to new media (online dating). The study discovers the different factors involved when an individual decides to establish an online relationship. Overall the study followed the social exchange theory's idea, \\"people are attracted to those who grant them rewards\\". Another example is Berg's study about development of friendship between roommates. The research found how social exchange processes changed during the year by measuring self disclosure. According to the study, the amount one person rewards another and the comparison levels for alternatives become the most important factors in determining liking and satisfaction. Auld, C. and Alan C. conducted a study to discover what processes occur and what is experienced during social leisure relationships. They use the concept of reciprocity to understand their findings. The study concluded that meeting new people is often given as a major reason for participation in leisure activities, and meeting new people may be conceptualized as an exercise of reciprocity. In this case, reciprocity is perceived as a starting mechanism for new social relationships because people are willing to be helped by others, expecting that the help will eventually be returned. A study conducted by Paul, G., called Exchange and access in field work tries to understand the relationships between the researchers and subjects. This study concludes that Bargaining helps to satisfy the more specific needs of the parties because greater risks are taken to obtain more information. This study also introduces the concept of trust (social sciences) to determine the duration of relationships. =Interracial marriage= Patterns of interracial marriage have been explained using social exchange theory. Kalmijn suggests that ethnic status is offset against educational or financial resources. This process has been used to explain why there are more marriages between black men and white women than between white men and black women. This asymmetry in marriage patterns has been used to support the idea of a racial hierarchy. Lewis, however, explains that the same patterns of marriage can be accounted for in terms of simple facial attractiveness patterns of the different gender by race groupings. Recent changes have seen an increase in black women marrying white men and a decrease in raw prevalence of interracial marriages when it comes to black women. There has also been a shift in the concentration of interracial marriage from mostly being between those with low education levels to those with higher levels of education. =Business= Social exchange theory has served as a theoretical foundation to explain different situations in business practices. It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships and relationship marketing. The investment model proposed by Caryl Rusbult is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer's own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost. When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they pour additional resources into the relationship to salvage their initial investment. Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange. According to the study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determine if their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve. =Work settings= A study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles. =Citizenship behavior= Social exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for organizational citizenship behavior. This study examines a model of clear leadership and relational building between head and teachers as antecedents, and organizational citizenship behavior as a consequence of teacher‚Äìschool exchange. Citizenship behavior can also be shown with employees and their employers.This is shown through organizational identification which plays an important role in organizational citizenship behavior. An employees identification with their employer plays a significant role in supporting and promoting organized citizenship behavior, serving as a mediating mechanism with citizenship behaviors, perceived organizational justice, and organizational support based on both the social exchange and social identity theory. =Online social networking and self-disclosure= Understanding interpersonal disclosure in online social networking is an ideal application of social networking theory. Researchers have leveraged SET to explain self- disclosure in a cross-cultural context of French and British working professionals. They discover that reciprocation is the primary benefit of self-disclosure, whereas risk is the foundational cost of self-disclosure. They find that positive social influence to use an online community increases online community self-disclosure; reciprocity increases self-disclosure; online community trust increases self-disclosure; and privacy risk beliefs decrease self-disclosure. Meanwhile, a tendency toward collectivism increases self-disclosure. Similar research also leveraged SET to examine privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self- disclosure technologies in the context of instant messaging. This study was also a cross-cultural study, but instead compared US and Chinese participants. Affect theory The actors in social exchange are normally viewed as unemotional beings who have information, cognitively process it, and make decisions concerning the pattern and nature of exchange with others. Affect theory of social exchange complements social exchange theory by incorporating emotion as part of the exchange process. Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks). These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship. =Assumptions= Most social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward.Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32‚Äì43. The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and affect theory: *There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange. *Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative *Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value). *Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange. *Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them. *Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity. =Theoretical propositions= Affect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims: Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses Individuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful. These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions. Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions Individuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange. The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced The mode of exchange (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between. The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups The different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual's attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange. Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between. One condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any self-serving biases and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self. Lawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. Following Weiner (1985) affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment. Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties Repeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.

This holistic Jewish code of conduct encompasses a wide swathe of rituals, worship practices, Godman and interpersonal relationships, from dietary laws to Sabbath and festival observance to marital relations, agricultural practices, and civil claims and damages. According to Jewish tradition, the Oral Torah was passed down orally in an unbroken chain from generation to generation until its contents were finally committed to writing following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, when Jewish civilization was faced with an existential threat, by virtue of the dispersion of the Jewish people.Howard Schwartz, Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism, Oxford University Press, 2004. p lv The major repositories of the Oral Torah are the Mishnah, compiled between 200‚Äì220 CE by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi, and the Gemara, a series of running commentaries and debates concerning the Mishnah, which together form the Talmud, the preeminent text of Rabbinic Judaism. In fact, two \\"versions\\" of the Talmud exist: one produced in the Galilee 300‚Äì350 CE (the Jerusalem Talmud), and a second, more extensive Talmud compiled in Babylonia 450‚Äì500 CE (the Babylonian Talmud). Belief that at least portions of the Oral Torah were transmitted orally from God to Moses on Mount Sinai during the Exodus from Egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of Orthodox Judaism, and was recognized as one of the Thirteen Principles of Faith by Maimonides. However, not all branches of Rabbinic Judaism accept the literal Sinaitic provenance of the Oral Torah, characterizing it as the product of a historical process of continuing interpretation. There have also been historical dissenters to the Oral Torah in its entirety, including the ancient Sadducees and adherents to modern Karaite Judaism, who attempt to derive their religious practice strictly from the Written Torah, using Scripture's most natural meaning to form their basis of Jewish law. Karaites often look to traditions of interpretation but, unlike Rabbinic Jews, do not ascribe to those traditions authoritative or normative parity with the Written Torah. Components of the Oral Torah The term \\"Oral Torah\\" should not be understood as a monolith. The Jewish Encyclopedia divides the Oral Torah into eight categories, ranked according to the relative level of authoritativeness, which are found within the Talmud, the Tosefta and the halakhic Midrashim. # Explanations of those laws of the written law, which are not fully intelligible without the explanations, and therefore presuppose an oral interpretation. Such explanations are connected in some way with Scripture. # Ancient halakhot which have no connection with Scripture and can not be connected with it, thus deriving their authority only from the tradition which ascribes them to Moses on Sinai. (In the case of these two groups, it is impossible to ascertain which elucidations and rules were really given to Moses on Sinai, and which were added later.) # Laws found in the prophetic books. Some of these originated at the time of the Prophets; but others are much older, perhaps having been transmitted orally, and committed to writing by the Prophets. They are called also \\"Dibre ·∏≤abbalah\\" (Words of Tradition). # Interpretations and regulations defining many written laws, as well as new laws, formulated by the early scribes, beginning with the time of Ezra. These are called also \\"Dibre Soferim\\" (Words of the Scribes). # Interpretations and regulations covering the written law, as well as new halakhot, which the Tannaim deduced from Scripture by means of hermeneutic rules or by logical conclusions. There are differences of opinion among the scholars in regard to most of these explanations and definitions; but they are of equal weight with the written law, and are called also \\"Debar Torah\\" (Regulation of the Torah). # Customs and observances (\\"ta·∏≥·∏≥anot\\") which were introduced at various times by different scholars. They are ascribed partly to Moses, partly to Joshua, but chiefly to the members of the Great Synagogue or the Soferim (\\"Scribes\\"), and are called also \\"Dibre Soferim\\" (\\"Words of the Scribes\\"). # Statutes and decisions (\\"gezerot\\") decreed by the Sanhedrin or court, and generally accepted. Such laws could be abrogated only by another court greater than the first one in numbers and scholarship. # Statutes and regulations for which the scholars had no tradition or allusion in Scripture, but which they accepted as standards after deriving them from the customs and laws of the country in which they were living. These are called \\"Hilkhot Medinah\\" (Statutes of the Country). The laws in the last three groups were not considered equal in validity to the written law (\\"De'oraita\\"), but were regarded merely as rabbinical regulations (\\"de-rabbanan\\"). Historical development =Source and transmission= According to modern scholarship, the traditions embodied in what later became known as the \\"Oral Torah\\" developed over generations among the inhabitants of Judea and were passed down through various modes of cultural transmission, including but not restricted to oral transmission. It is hypothesized that, sometime prior to the Babylonian exile of 586-530 BCE, in applying the Mosaic code to daily life and Temple worship, \\"a multitude of usages arising out of practical necessity or convenience or experience became part of the routine of observance of the code, and, in the course of time, shared the sanctity and authority which were inherent in the divinely inspired code itself.\\" Such practices experienced exponential growth from the time of Ezra to the Romans' destruction of the Second Temple due to the changing social and religious conditions experienced by inhabitants of Judea. Many of these practices were advocated by the Pharisees, a sect of largely lower- and middle-class Jews who stood in opposition to the Sadducees, the priestly caste who dominated the Temple cult. The Sadducees rejected the legitimacy of any extra-biblical law or tradition, as well as increasingly popular notions such as the immortality of the soul and divine intervention.According to Josephus, Antiquities XIII. x. 6, \\"The Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers which are not written in the law of Moses; and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject them, and say that we are to esteem those observances to be obligatory which are in the Written Word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers.\\" Danby notes the following: > It is a reasonable hypothesis that a result of this controversy‚Äîa > controversy which continued for two centuries‚Äîwas a deliberate compilation > and justification of the unwritten tradition by the Pharisean party, perhaps > unsystematic and on a small scale in the earlier stages, but stimulated and > fostered from time to time both by opposition from the Sadducees and by > internal controversy (such as, e.g., the disputes between the House of > Hillel and Shammai) within the ranks of the Pharisees, culminating in the > collections of traditional laws (Halakoth) from which the present Mishnah > draws its material. With the destruction of the Second Temple around 70 CE, the Sadducees were divested of their main source of authority, without which their theology could not survive. On the other hand, the Pharisees became the progenitor of the rabbinic class, who formalized the traditions of their predecessors. Following the fall of the Temple, it appears that the Pharisaic leader Johanan ben Zakkai (30-90 CE) settled in Yavneh, where he established a school that came to be regarded by fellow Jews as the successors of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin. Upon this Council of Jabneh fell the duty of administering and interpreting religious law, conserving tradition, and solving problems that arose by the past dependence of numerous observances on the existence of the Temple and priesthood. Thus, from 70 to 130 CE, when the Bar Kochba revolt further decimated the Jewish community, the Oral Law experienced a significant period of development and an unprecedented level of legal and religious authority among the populace. =Codification= The Mishnah The destruction of the Second Temple and the fall of Jerusalem in the 1st and early 2nd Centuries CE devastated the Jewish community. The First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War of 66‚Äì73 CE and the Bar Kokhba revolt cost hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives, the destruction of leading yeshivot, and thousands of scholars and students. At that point, it became apparent that the Hebrew community and its learning were threatened, and that publication was the only way to ensure that the law could be preserved.Tosefta Eduyot 1:1 \\"When the Sages went to Yavneh they said: The time will come that a man will seek a matter in the Torah but will not find it. He will seek a matter from the Scribes but will not find it. ‚Ä¶ They said: Let us begin [to record] with Hillel and Shammai.\\" See generally Timeline of Jewish history. Thus, around 200 CE, a redaction of the Oral Law in writing was completed. Both Rabbinic tradition and scholarship ascribe this effort to Rabbi Judah HaNasi. The product of this effort, the Mishnah, is generally considered the first work of rabbinic literature. \\"Mishnah\\" is the name given to the sixty-three tractates that HaNasi systematically codified, which in turn are divided into six \\"orders.\\" Unlike the Torah, in which, for example, laws of the Sabbath are scattered throughout the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, all the Mishnaic laws of the Sabbath are located in a single tractate called Shabbat (Hebrew for \\"Sabbath\\"). Moreover, the laws contained in the twenty-four chapters that make up that tractate are far more extensive than those contained in the Torah, reflecting the extensiveness of the Oral Law. Some authority suggests HaNasi made use of as many as 13 separate collections of Halakhot from different schools and time periods, and reassembled that material into a coherent whole, arranged it systematically, summarized discussions, and in some cases rendered his own rulings where alternative traditions existed. The Mishnah does far more than expound upon and organize the Biblical commandments. Rather, important topics covered by the Mishnah \\"rest on no scriptural foundations whatsoever,\\" such as portions of the civil law tractates of Bava Kamma, Bava Metzia and Bava Batra. In other words, \\"To perfect the [Written] Torah, the Oral tradition had to provide for a variety of transactions left without any law at all in Scripture.\\" Just as portions of the Torah reflect (according to the documentary hypothesis) the agenda of the Levite priesthood in centralizing worship in the Temple in Jerusalem and legitimizing their exclusive authority over the sacrificial cult, so too can the Mishnah be seen as reflecting the unique \\"program\\" of the Tannaim and their successors to develop an egalitarian form of Judaism with an emphasis on social justice and an applicability throughout the Jewish diaspora. As a result, the Talmud often finds the rabbis combing scripture for textual support to justify existing religious practice, rather than deriving the practice organically from the language of scripture. The Gemara HaNasi's method of codification, in which he often included minority viewpoints and citation by name to rabbis who championed different viewpoints, became a template for the Gemara, a compendium of discussions and commentaries on the Mishnah's laws by generations of leading rabbis during the next four centuries in the two centers of Jewish life, Judea and Babylonia. The Gemara with the Mishnah came to be edited together into compilations known as the Talmud. Both the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud have been transmitted in written form to the present day, although the more extensive Babylonian Talmud is widely considered to be more authoritative. The Talmud's discussions follow the order of the Mishnah, although not all tractates are discussed. Generally, a law from the Mishnah is cited, which is followed by a rabbinic deliberation on its meaning. The discussion often, but not always, results in a decision regarding the more persuasive or authoritative position based on available sources or anecdotal evidence. In Jewish tradition =Orthodox Judaism= Rabbinic Judaism holds the Oral Law to be of divine origin. The divinity and authoritativeness of the Oral Law as transmitted from God to Moses on Mount Sinai, continues to be universally accepted by Orthodox and Haredi Judaism as a fundamental precept of Judaism. The Oral Law was the basis for nearly all subsequent rabbinic literature. It is therefore intricately related to the development of Halacha. As such, despite codification, interpretation of the Oral Law is likewise required. Divine source and transmission Rabbis of the Talmudic era conceived of the Oral Torah in two distinct ways. First, Rabbinic tradition saw the Oral Torah as an unbroken chain of transmission. The distinctive feature of this view was that Oral Torah was \\"conveyed by word of mouth and memorized.\\"Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, The Orality of Rabbinic Writing, in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud, ed. Martin Jaffee, 2007. p. 39. This is attested to in numerous sources, such as Mishnah Avot 1:1. The manner of teaching and memorization is described in B. Eruvin 54b. Second, the Rabbis also viewed the Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. They saw the written Torah as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the oral tradition of interpretation, to discover those (\\"hidden\\") interpretations not revealed by Moses.In rabbinic literature this view is exemplified by the story of Rabbi Akiva who expounded heaps and heaps of laws from the scriptural crowns of the letters in the written Torah. According to traditional Judaism, the laws transmitted to Moses contained in the Written Torah (or Chumash) were written down on scrolls, but God enjoined Moses from writing down the explanation of these laws. Indeed, the Talmud relays that Moses himself would not understand all of these interpretations, nevertheless, these are also called Law given to Moses at Sinai. B Menahot 29b. See, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, op cit. Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah.See BT Temurah 14b, and, BT Gittin 60b. Also, Y Meggila 4:1 Jewish tradition identifies the unbroken historical chain of individuals who were entrusted with passing down the Oral Law from Moses to the early rabbinic period: \\"Moses received the Torah and handed it down to Joshua; Joshua to the Elders; the Elders to the prophets; and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Assembly.\\"Mishna, Avot 1:1; the remainder of chapter 1 identifies further individuals in the chain Similarly, Maimonides provides a generation by generation account of the names of all those in the direct line that transmitted this tradition, beginning with Moses up until Ravina and Rav Ashi, the rabbis who compiled the Babylonian Talmud.Introduction to Mishneh Torah The interplay of the Oral and Written Law According to traditional Judaism, the Oral Law must have been disseminated at the same time as the Written Torah because certain Torah commandments would be indecipherable without a separate explanatory codex (and, presumably, God would not demand adherence to commandments that could not be understood). Many terms used in the Torah are left undefined, such as the word totafot, usually translated as \\"frontlets,\\" which is used three times in the Pentateuch (in Exodus 13:9 and Deuteronomy 6:8 and 11:18) but only identified with tefillin in the Mishnah (see Menachot 3:7). Similarly, many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions, or assume familiarity on the part of the reader.David Charles Kraemer, The Mind of the Talmud, Oxford University Press, 1990. pp 157‚Äì159Rabbi Gil Student: Proofs for the Oral Torah For example, the discussion of shechita (kosher slaughter) in Deuteronomy 12 states \\"you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God Lord has given you, as I have commanded you,\\" without any clear indication of what had been \\"commanded\\"; only in the Oral Torah are the various requirements of ritual slaughter explicated. Similarly, Deuteronomy 24 discusses the laws of divorce in passing; these laws are set forth with great specificity in the Mishnah and Gemara. Another example: the blue string of tekhelet on the tzitzit is to be dyed with an extraction from what scholars believe to be a snail; a detail only spoken of in the oral Torah.See http://www.tekhelet.com Ptil Tekhelet For other examples and further discussion here see Kuzari 3:35. Moreover, according to the traditional view, without an Oral Law, blind adherence to the plain text of certain Torah commandments would lead to unethical acts, or would cause the practitioner to violate a commandment elsewhere in the Torah. Neither of these results could have been intended by God; and thus, a priori, a set of supplementary \\"instructions\\" must have been provided. A classic example involves the phrase \\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\\" is held in the oral tradition to imply monetary compensation ‚Äì as opposed to a literal Lex talionis.The Talmud explains this concept entails monetary compensation in tort cases. The Torah's first mention of the phrase \\"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\\" appears in . The Talmud (in Bava Kamma, 84a), based upon a critical interpretation of the original Hebrew text, explains that this biblical concept entails monetary compensation in tort cases. (Additionally, this law cannot be carried out in practice, for both practical and ethical reasons; see also parashat Emor). Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted literally; it would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Regardless, the interpretation as ‚Äúmonetary compensation‚Äù is the only one consistent with ; this relationship paralleling the logic of the preceding paragraph. Finally, and similarly, the Oral Torah is needed to explain actions of biblical actors, seemingly discordant with other verses. For example, the marriage of Boaz, a member of the tribe of Judah to Ruth, a Moabitess, as described in the Book of Ruth, appears on its face to contradict the prohibition of against marrying Moabites; however, the Oral Torah explains that this prohibition is limited to Moabite men. Similarly, the rabbinic practice for the Counting of the Omer () is at odds with the Karaite practice, which appears to accord with a more literal reading of these verses, but is in fact borne out by .Tim Hegg: \\"Counting the Omer: An Inquiry into the Divergent Methods of the 1st Century Judaisms\\". Much Talmudic analysis similarly demonstrates how the Mishnah's rulings, and / or disputes, in fact derive from - and are hence consistent with - the much earlier Biblical texts; see Gemara #Biblical exposition. Relatedly, the 1st century Targum Onkelos is largely consistent with the oral tradition as recorded in the midrash, redacted into writing only in the 3rd or 4th century.See: prof. A Segal Targum \\"Onkelos\\" to the Torah; Rabbi G. Student: Onkelos and the Oral Torah. Complementary to the above textual and internal evidence, archaeologists have uncovered various physical evidence relating to religious rituals and practices which were current prior to the codification of the Mishnah; from which it can be inferred that Judah HaNasi and his contemporaries recorded, rather than innovated, normative Judaism as practiced during the 1st century CE and prior. For example, excavations at Qumran (Cave 4) have yielded specimens of tefillin and parchment scrolls; these reflecting later Talmudic discussion.See for example, Yigal Yadin: Tefilin from Qumran. Likewise, the structure and placement of ritual baths at Masada appears to be consistent with the rabbinic requirements per the Mishnaic tractate Mikvaot, although they were constructed approximately 120 years before the Mishnah was compiled.Rabbi Yosef Back: \\"Southern mikveh on Masada\\". A clay seal discovered in Jerusalem in 2011 is consistent with the tradition recorded in tractate Shekalim chapter 5.See references under \\"Clay Seal Confirms Ancient Temple Service: Archaeologists\\" . The Elephantine papyri include a \\"Passover letter\\" (419 BCE) which already included many of the Pesach observances of today,Schiffman, Lawrence. Texts and Traditions: A Source Reader for the Study of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism. Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1998. and the first known text of a Ketubah (about 440 BCE). The Qumran Halachic Letter,Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah/ Qumran Cave 4 which records approximately a dozen disputes regarding the application of halakha, also testifies to the evolutionary process of the Oral Law. In rabbinic literature and commentary This section, discusses the Rabbinic treatment of the Written Law in light of the Oral Law, and the consequent overlap of the oral and written, and is not a general discussion of rabbinic Literature, per se. As above, the Oral Law is recorded in the Midrash and Talmud, while later rabbinic literature builds on these works. Here, it is important to note that these source, \\"oral\\", documents, are nevertheless intimately connected to the written. Thus, the midrash provides a verse by verse discussion of the entire (written) Tanakh, per the oral Torah. Similarly, the Talmud, although applying a different framework, discusses and analyses the written Torah‚Äîboth from an aggadic and halakhic perspective‚Äîdrawing from (and recording) the oral tradition; here the discussion is organized around the Mishnah, and the discussion does not proceed verse-wise as with the Midrash. A modern translation of Rashi's commentary on the Chumash, published by Artscroll The era of the Rishonim sees the Oral Law incorporated into the first formal Torah commentaries, where the biblical text is discussed and / or analysed based on the various Midrashic and Talmudic traditions. The chief of these is perhaps Rashi's commentary on Tanakh. This work clarifies the \\"simple\\" meaning of the text, by addressing questions implied by the wording or verse or paragraph structure, by drawing on the Midrashic, Talmudic and Aggadic literature. It has given rise to numerous counter- (e.g., Ramban) and super-commentaries (e.g., Mizrachi), all similarly drawing on the Oral Torah, and widely studied to this day (see Mikraot Gedolot, Yeshiva #Torah and Bible study). Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg's Haketav VeHaKabbalah deals with the relationship between the written and oral Torah In more recent times, Acharonic times, See general discussion under: Rabbi Y. Kaganoff (2016). A New Commentary for a Changed World, mishpacha.com several (Orthodox) commentaries have been produced, which, in some sense, reverse the direction of the analysis. These originated in response to the (erstwhile) challenges of haskalah and Biblical criticism, and were intended \\"to demonstrate the indivisibility of the written Torah and its counterpart, the oral Torah\\", and in so doing, \\"showing the organic relationship between the Written Law and the Oral Law\\", often in the light of the above. Given this purpose, these provide a further detailed and explicit analysis here. The main of these: * Ha'emek Davar (\\"The Depth [of the] Word\\") on Torah, and Davar Ha'emek on Nevi'im and Ketuvim, by Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, the \\"Netziv\\" * Haketav VehaKabbalah (\\"The Written [Torah] and the [Oral] Tradition\\") on Torah, by Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg * HaTorah vehaMitzva (\\"The Torah and the Commandment\\") by Me√Ør Leibush, the \\"Malbim\\", covers all of Tanakh except Kohelet and Eicha. * Uebersetzung und Erkl√§rung des Pentateuchs (\\"Translation and Commentary of the Pentateuch\\") by Samson Raphael Hirsch. * Torah Temimah (\\"The Perfect Torah\\") on Torah, by Baruch Epstein. A more recent work of this type is the Israeli Da'at Miqra (and to some extent Da'at Sofrim by Chaim Dov Rabinowitz); see also Mordechai Breuer #Literary contribution . Contemporaneous with, and complementary to these commentaries, were specific, monograph-like works discussing the Oral Torah in concept and historically. These included: * Dor Dor v'Dor'shav (\\"Each generation and its Scholars\\"), by Rabbi Isaac Hirsch Weiss, a five volume history of the Oral Law, Halakha and Aggada, from Biblical times until the composition of the Shulchan Aruch. * Mevo Hatalmud (\\"Introduction to the Talmud\\") and Torat Neviim (\\"Teachings of the Prophets\\"), by Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes. The first, a detailed history and classification of the Talmud and its underlying oral tradition, formulating the nature, extent, and authority of tradition. The second, treatises on the authority of Talmudic tradition, and on the organic structure and methodology of the Talmud. *Die Erste Mishna (The First Mishna), a historical and linguistic analysis of the Mishna by David Zvi Hoffmann, positing an early, uniform, undisputed, and therefore authoritative collection of the Oral Law. (R. Hoffmann also authored a Torah commentary addressing some of the same issues as those mentioned.) * Matteh Dan (or Kuzari Hasheini; London 1714) written by Rabbi David Nieto demonstrates the authority of the Oral Law, and defends the tradition against attacks by Karaites and skeptics. *Several works by Rabbi Immanuel Aboab, especially his Nomologia, defend the traditional law and discuss its chronology. Other well known works here, if perhaps less modern in orientation, include Maimonides' (Rambam's) Introduction to the Mishnah‚Äîdealing with the nature of the Oral Law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah‚Äîas well as Isaiah Horowitz's (\\"The Shelah\\") Introduction to the Oral Torah in part 2 of his Shenei Luchot HaBerit Finally, other major works discussing the Bible as based on the Oral Torah include the following. * El Conciliador (\\"The Conciliator\\"), by Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel, a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible by utilizing ‚Äúan astounding range of sources\\", primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries. It was written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632, primarily to strengthen the faith of the Marranos. * Weiss' Dor Dor v'Dor'shav similarly discusses apparent divergencies in the Pentateuch and the various books of the Prophets. * Me'am Lo'ez, begun by Rabbi Yaakov Culi in 1730, a detailed explanation of each chapter of the Torah, explaining it from \\"countless approaches\\", especially according to the Midrash and Talmud; also discusses the relevant Halacha as based on the Shulchan Aruch and Mishneh Torah. The work was intended as a \\"compendium\\" of the major fields of Torah study, for the Ladino-speaking community. =Dissenting viewpoints= A relief depicting the development of the Oral Law at Diaspora Museum, Tel Aviv From Pharisaic times, there has always been some level of opposition to the concept of a \\"Dual Torah\\" within the umbrella of Judaism, although today only the Karaite sect formally opposes the incorporation of any extra-biblical law into their practice. Rather, the branches of modern Judaism differ more in their views regarding the divinity and immutability of the Oral Torah than they do in their belief in the importance of an interpretive tradition as exemplified in the Talmud.For more detail from a general perspective, see Rabbi Nathan Cardozo, The Infinite Chain: Torah, Masorah, and Man (), and Rabbi Gil Student, Proofs for the Oral Torah. For a verse by verse analysis in light of the oral tradition, see the commentaries listed below. Sadducees Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic oral traditions. They based their interpretations on their own traditions emphasizing a more literal understanding of the verses. In many respects, this led to a more severe observance than that of the Pharisees especially as regards purity laws and temple practice. Most aspects of Sadduceean law and methods of interpretation are not known.Ken Koltun-Fromm, Abraham Geiger's liberal Judaism, Indiana University Press, 2006. p 53 Essenes Essenes, a monastic group of people, had a \\"monastic organization\\". Though they had non-biblical rules and customs, they rejected much of the oral traditions.Joseph A. Fitzmyer, The Impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Paulist Press, 2009. p 56 Samaritans The Samaritans, an ancient sect that has survived in small numbers to the present day, have their own rich interpretative tradition, as reflected in the Medieval Samaritan legal collection called the Hilukh, which shares etymological roots with the term Halakhah. However, the concept of a divinely ordained Oral Law having equal value with the written one is foreign to Samaritan theology. Karaites Karaite Judaism or Karaism is a Jewish denomination that began in eighth century Baghdad to form a separate sect that rejected of the Oral Torah and Talmud, and placed sole reliance on the Tanakh as scripture. Thus, for example, Karaite understood Exodus 35:3 (\\"Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day\\") as forbidding the use of any kind of fire on the Sabbath, including fires lit before the start of the Sabbath, which are permitted by the Oral Law. Karaites also do not adhere to widespread customs such as the donning of tefillin and the prohibition against eating milk and meat together on the grounds that such practices are grounded in the Oral Law. Some Karaites strive to adhere only to the peshat' (plain meaning) of the text. This is in contrast to Rabbinic Judaism, which relies on the Oral Torah and employs several interpretive methods which, at times, stray from the literal meaning. =Modern perspectives= Torat Eretz Yisrael According to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, it is important to notice that Torah sages can err, just as the Sanhedrin could (Leviticus 4:13). Reform Judaism Reform Judaism generally considers the Oral Law to reflect interpretations or perspectives on the Torah authored by groups of rabbis in Babylonia and Palestine over a period of time, which are not inherently more legitimate or authoritative than the opinions of Jewish scholars, philosophers, or religious leaders at any other time, including the present. Conservative Judaism Conservative Judaism (also known as \\"Masorti\\" outside North America) takes an intermediate perspective, claiming that the Oral tradition is entitled to authority, but regarding its rulings as flexible guidelines rather than immutable precepts, that may be viewed through the lens of modernity. Jewish scholar and philosopher Ismar Schorsch has postulated that Conservative Judaism is tied to \\"sensing divinity both in the Torah and in the Oral Law,\\" but not in a literalist manner. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered intellectual founder of Conservative Judaism, was respected by many Orthodox until writing in 1859 that the Talmudic term \\"Law given to Moses at Sinai\\" always meant ancient customs accepted as such. His opponents demanded that he issue an unequivocal statement of belief in the total divinity of Oral Law, yet he refrained from doing so. He was consequently ostracized and declared a heretic by several authorities.

Each role is a set of rights, duties, expectations, norms, and behaviors that a person has to face and fulfill. The model is based on the observation that people behave in a predictable way, and that an individual's behavior is context specific, based on social position and other factors. The theatre is a metaphor often used to describe role theory. Although the word role (or roll) has existed in European languages for centuries, as a sociological concept, the term has only been around since the 1920s and 1930s. It became more prominent in sociological discourse through the theoretical works of George Herbert Mead, Jacob L. Moreno, Talcott Parsons, and Ralph Linton, Georg Simmel. Two of Mead's concepts‚Äîthe mind and the self‚Äîare the precursors to role theory.Hindin, Michelle J. 2007. \\"Role theory.\\" Pp. 3959‚Äì62 in The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology, edited by G. Ritzer. Blackwell Publishing. The theory posits the following propositions about social behaviour: # The division of labor in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions that we call roles; # Social roles included \\"appropriate\\" and \\"permitted\\" forms of behavior, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine expectations; # Roles are occupied by individuals, or \\"actors\\"; # When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role \\"legitimate\\" and \\"constructive\\"), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms; # Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change; # The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving in a prosocial way, account for why agents conform to role requirements. In terms of differences among role theory, on one side there is a more functional perspective, which can be contrasted with the more micro-level approach of the symbolic interactionist tradition. This type of role theory dictates how closely related individuals' actions are to the society, as well as how empirically testable a particular role theory perspective may be. Depending on the general perspective of the theoretical tradition, there are many types of role theory, however it may be divided into two major types, in particular: structural functionalism role theory and dramaturgical role theory. Structural functionalism role theory is essentially defined as everyone having a place in the social structure and every place had a corresponding role, which has an equal set of expectations and behaviors. Life is more structured, and there is a specific place for everything. Contrastly, Dramaturgical Role Theory defines life as a never-ending play, in which we are all actors. The essence of this role theory is to role-play in an acceptable manner in society. A key insight of this theory is that role conflict occurs when a person is expected to simultaneously act out multiple roles that carry contradictory expectations.  Role  Substantial debate exists in the field over the meaning of the role in role theory. A role can be defined as a social position, behavior associated with a social position, or a typical behavior. Some theorists have put forward the idea that roles are essentially expectations about how an individual ought to behave in a given situation, whereas others consider it means how individuals actually behave in a given social position. Some have suggested that a role is a characteristic behavior or expected behavior, a part to be played, or a script for social conduct. In sociology, there are different categories of social roles: # cultural roles: roles given by culture (e.g. priest) # social differentiation: e.g. teacher, taxi driver # situation- specific roles: e.g. eye witness # bio-sociological roles: e.g. as human in a natural system # gender roles: as a man, woman, mother, father, etc. Role theory models behaviour as patterns of behaviours to which one can conform, with this conformity being based on the expectations of others. It has been argued that a role must in some sense being defined in relation to others. The manner and degree is debated by sociologists. Turner used the concept of an \\"other-role\\", arguing the process of defining a role is negotiating one's role with other-roles. = The construction of roles = Turner argued that the process of describing a role also modifiers the role which would otherwise be implicit referring to this process as role-making arguing that very formal roles such as those in the military are not representation of roles because the role-making process is suppressed. Situation-specific roles develop ad hoc in a given social situation. However it can be argued that the expectations and norms that defin this ad hoc role are defined by social role.  The relationship between roles and norms  Some theorists view behaviour as being enforced by social norms. Turner rather argues that there is a norm of consistency and failing to conform to a role breaks a norm because it violate consistency. = Cultural roles = Cultural roles are seen as matter of course and are mostly stable. In cultural changes new roles can develop and old roles can disappear ‚Äì these cultural changes are affected by political and social conflicts. For example, the feminist movement initiated a change in male and female roles in Western societies = Social differentiation = Social differentiation received a lot of attention due to the development of different job roles. Robert K. Merton distinguished between intrapersonal and interpersonal role conflicts. For example, a foreman has to develop his own social role facing the expectations of his team members and his supervisor ‚Äì this is an interpersonal role conflict. He also has to arrange his different social roles as father, husband, club member ‚Äì this is an intrapersonal role conflict. Ralph Dahrendorf distinguished between must-expectations, with sanctions; shall-expectations, with sanctions and rewards and can- expectations, with rewards. The foreman has to avoid corruption; he should satisfy his reference groups (e.g. team members and supervisors); and he can be sympathetic. He argues another component of role theory is that people accept their own roles in the society and it is not the society that imposes them. = Role behaviour = In their life people have to face different social roles, sometimes they have to face different roles at the same time in different social situations. There is an evolution of social roles: some disappear and some new develop. Role behaviour is influenced by: # The norms that determine a social situation. # Internal and external expectations are connected to a social role. # Social sanctions (punishment and reward) are used to influence role behaviour. These three aspects are used to evaluate one's own behaviour as well as the behaviour of other people. Heinrich Popitz defines social roles as norms of behaviour that a special social group has to follow. Norms of behaviour are a set of behaviours that have become typical among group members; in case of deviance, negative sanctions follow.  In public relations  Role theory is a perspective that considers everyday activity to be acting out socially defined categories. Split into two narrower definitions: status is one's position within a social system or group; and role is one's pattern of behavior associated with a status. Organizational role is defined as \\"recurring actions of an individual, appropriately interrelated with the repetitive activities of others so as to yield a predictable outcome.\\" (Katz & Kahn, 1978). Within an organization there are three main topologies: # Two-role typology:Dozier, David M. [1984] 2007. \\"Program evaluation and the roles of practitioners.\\" Public Relations Review 10(2):13‚Äì21. . ## Manager ## Technician # Four-role typology:Broom, G. M., and G. D. Smith. 1979. \\"Testing the practitioner's impact on clients.\\" Public Relations Review 5(3):47‚Äì59. ## Expert prescriber ## Communication facilitator ## Problem solver ## Communication technician # Five-role typology:Moss, D., A. Newman, and B. DeSanto. 2005. \\"What do communication managers do? Defining and refining the core elements of management in a public relations/corporate communication context.\\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 82(4):873‚Äì90. ## Monitor and evaluator ## Key policy and strategic advisor ## Troubleshooter/problem solver ## Issues management expert ## Communication technician Role conflict, strain or making  Despite variations in the terms used, the central component of all of the formulations is incompatibility. Role conflict is a conflict among the roles corresponding to two or more statuses, for example, teenagers who have to deal with pregnancy (statuses: teenager, mother). Role conflict is said to exist when there are important differences among the ratings given for various expectations. By comparing the extent of agreement or disagreement among the ranks, a measure of role conflict was obtained. Role strain or \\"role pressure\\" may arise when there is a conflict in the demands of roles, when an individual does not agree with the assessment of others concerning his or her performance in his or her role, or from accepting roles that are beyond an individual's capacity. Role making is defined by Graen as leader‚Äìmember exchange. At the same time, a person may have limited power to negotiate away from accepting roles that cause strain, because he or she is constrained by societal norms, or has limited social status from which to bargain. Criticism and limitations Role theorists have noted that a weakness of role theory is in describing and explaining deviant behavior. Role theory has been criticized for reinforcing commonly held prejudices about how people should behave; individualizing problems, view the individual as responsibility for fulfilling the expectations of a role rather than others responsible for creating a role that they can perform, and people have argued that role theory is insufficiently explains power relations, as in some situations an individual does not consensual fulfil a role but is forced into behaviours by power. It is also argued that that role theory does not explain individual agency in negotiating their role and that role theory artificially merges roles when in practice an individual might combine roles together. Others have argued that the concept of role takes on such a broad definition as to be meaningless.

It was previously traded as Star TV (stylised as STAR TV) until 2001, and simply as Star until 2009. Originally established by Hutchison Whampoa and later acquired by the original News Corporation, Star TV was once the prominent satellite television broadcaster in the entire Asia region. On March 20, 2019 Following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets, FNG Asia and Star India, became a part of Disney and the FNG Asia Pacific was integrated into Disney‚Äôs Direct-to-Consumer and International unit. FNG Asia Pacific's channels were available in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and it previously served South Asia and the Middle East. History =Launch= The company was originally registered to the Companies Registry of Hong Kong as Quford Limited on 31 August 1990. The company was renamed Hutchvision Channel Services Limited on 31 January 1991, before becoming Satellite Television Asian Region Limited () on 4 July 1991. It was established by Hutchison Whampoa, and was headed by Richard Li (son of Li Ka-Shing, the founder of Cheung Kong which owns Hutchison Whampoa). The company operated its television channels under the blanket brand of Star TV (). In its initial years, the channels were broadcast over AsiaSat 1 communication satellite operated by Asia Satellite Telecommunications, which was a consortium of Hutchison Whampoa, China International Trust and Investment Corporation and Cable & Wireless Worldwide. As with the satellite's footprint, the channels reached from the Far East to the Middle East. Star TV's initial line-up of advertisement-supported five free-to-air channels included: # Prime Sports (; launched on 26 August 1991): 24-hour clock multi- sport television channel broadcast in English and Chinese; joint venture with TCI in the United States which owned Prime Network. # MTV (; launched on 15 September 1991): 24-hour clock music channel broadcast in English, Hindi and Chinese, focused on pop music; regional version of the American TV channel of the same name. # Chinese Channel (; launched on 21 October 1991): 24-hour clock all full Mandarin Chinese variety entertainment channel that showcased full Chinese language content provided by TVB and ATV in Hong Kong broadcasts from Mainland China; also showed television series from other Greater China countries including China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore. # WSTV (; launched on 15 November 1991): 24-hour clock news, current affairs and information from the BBC; unlike the European counterpart, this version of BBC World Service Television did not air variety entertainment programmes, as they were shown on Star Plus. # Star Plus (; launched on 15 December 1991): 24-hour clock English language variety entertainment channel which showed dramas and variety shows from English-speaking countries including United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. On 1 October 1992, Star TV added Zee TV (which targeted Hindi-speaking audiences) from Zee Telefilms in India to its line-up. In February 1993, Julian Mounter, former director-general of Television New Zealand, was appointed as president and Chief Executive of the company.Ilott, Terry \\"Mounter: prez, Hutchvision\\" Variety 8 February 1993 In June 1993, Star TV and Wharf Cable signed a deal in which Hong Kong's new cable television provider would carry Star TV's channels.\\"Wharf pacts with HutchVision\\" Variety 7 June 1993 However, the deal was terminated in February 1994 in the carriage dispute between the two parties.\\"Star TV drops Wharf pact\\" Reuters 28 February 1994 via Variety =Sale to News Corporation= Star TV's viewership across Asia have increased over the years, and it attracted advertisers. But the business was making loss. The company has been looking for an Anglophone partner for financial investments, additional English language programming and technical assistance, especially to launch a pay- television system that would carry encrypted channels. By late April 1993, Pearson approached Star TV's owners, and was expected to pay up to GBP 100 million. Pearson (which owned minor stake in British broadcasters BSkyB and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television at the time, and have just acquired Thames Television) has been looking to expand its media business outside the UK, especially because the British laws at that time did not allow Pearson to expand more on UK television business. Pearson was looking for the 66% of the company, but the deal was reported to have required the Hong Kong side to remain active shareholders, making the deal to be turned down. The initial negotiations with Rupert Murdoch were reported to have foundered after the Australian businessman demanded a controlling stake in the Hong Kong company. But in July 1993, Murdoch's News Corporation have managed to purchase 63.6% of Star TV for US$525 million, half in cash, half in News Corporation's ordinary shares, blocking offers from Pearson. The deal came after News Corporation failed to acquire 22% of TVB because of regulatory issues.Tam, Luisa \\"News buys Star TV\\" South China Morning Post 27 July 1993 SCMP was owned by News Corporation at the time of announcement.

Next goal is pan-Asian 'information exchange.'\\" Los Angeles Times 11 April 1994 In August 1993, following News Corporation's takeover, Julian Mounter resigned as Chief Executive of the company. Sam Chisholm, who was the head of BSkyB at the time, became acting Chief Executive before he was formally appointed. With the controversial removal of BBC World Service Television from the company's satellite television offerings for Northeast Asia in 1994 (discussed below), Star TV replaced the BBC channel with three channels, International news channel CNN International, English- language film channel Star Movies and Chinese-language film channel Star Chinese Movies, Star TV and MTV ended partnership that supplied music television programming, so Star TV launched Channel V to replace the American brand. The Indian version was launched in May 1994, it was followed by four additional versions: Channel V International, Channel V Thailand, Channel V Korea, Channel V Japan, and another three versions in Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese and Cantonese. On 30 March 1996 at 7 pm Hong Kong Time, Star TV split into Star Plus and Star Chinese Channel by certain areas: * Star Plus would continue to serve viewers in South Asia and the Middle East, while East and Southeast Asian viewers would receive the newly relaunched Star World channel * Star Chinese Channel would still be available to the viewers in Taiwan, but the television watchers in Hong Kong and the Mainland China would get the new Phoenix Chinese Channel instead. On 6 May 1996, Star TV launched Viva Cinema, the 24-hour Filipino film channel, in partnership with Viva Entertainment. STAR later exited from the partnership and did not renew their contract, and the channel was relaunched as Pinoy Box Office on August 1, 2003. In October 1996, Star Sports (since renamed from Prime Sports) and ESPN Asia have agreed to combine their loss making operations in Asia. The new joint venture, later named ESPN Star Sports, would be headquartered in Singapore (where ESPN's operations in Asia were based in). In 1997, Star TV launched Star Select package of television channels targeting the Middle East. On 18 February 1998, Star TV launched Star News, a news channel targeting India, in partnership with NDTV. It switched partner to ABP Group in 2003, before Star India completely gave up and sold their share in 2012. In May 1999, Star TV migrated its services from AsiaSat 1 and 2 to AsiaSat 3S.Sullivan, Maureen \\"Star TV finds new satellite platform\\" Variety 5 May 1999 Later, Zee TV ended partnership with Star TV. The Hong Kong-based company converted Star Plus to a Hindi entertainment channel, and introduced Star World in the area as an English entertainment replacement. In February 2001, The company rebranded from Star TV to Star, reflecting the company's evolution from a television brand to a multi-service, multi-platform brand. In Chinese, the company referred itself as Xƒ´ngk≈çng Chu√°nm√©i () instead of W√®ixƒ´ng Di√†nsh√¨ from then on. It introduced a new set of logos. The logo scheme of the Star network (the name of the channel next to the Star logo icon, contained within a rectangle with two opposite corners rounded) that had been used throughout 2007. =2009 restructure, refocus on East and Southeast Asia= On 19 August 2009, News Corporation announced a restructure of Star. Star India and Star Greater China would be separated from Star's headquarters in Hong Kong, and the heads of the former two companies would report directly to James Murdoch, News Corporation's then-Chairman and Chief Executive for Europe and Asia.\\"News Corporation Restructures Broadcast Businesses in Asia\\" (press release) News Corporation 18 August 2009 Archived from the original on 27 August 2009Watkins, Mary; Li, Kenneth \\"News Corp announces Star TV shake-up\\" Financial Times 19 August 2009 * Star India took over all of Star's operations in India, as well as sales and distribution of Fox-branded channels in the region.

It also took over the representation of FIC channels from NGC Network Asia, LLC (the channels that were distributed by Star anyway). The company would continue to distribute its channels in the Middle East, and would take responsibility of the distribution of Star India and Star Greater China's channels in Asia outside their home markets. Despite the 2009 reorganisations, the company did not immediately change its legal name from Satellite Television Asian Region Limited. It only changed legal name to Fox International Channels Asia Pacific Limited () on 2 September 2014. In August 2010, it was announced that News Corporation would sell a controlling stake in its assets in mainland China to China Media Capital (CMC).Young, Doug \\"News Corp sells controlling stake in China TV channels\\" Reuters 9 August 2010Chu, Karen \\"News Corp. sells Chinese-language channels to CMC\\" Associated Press 9 August 2010 (via The Hollywood Reporter)Coonan, Clifford \\"China Media Capital buys Star China\\" Variety 9 August 2010 Xing Kong (both domestic and international versions) and Channel V Mainland China, plus Fortune Star film library were in the sale, and a joint venture named Star China Media was created in the process.

The versions of ESPN broadcast in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia were rebranded as Fox Sports on 28 January 2013, and Star Sports became Fox Sports 2 on 15 August 2014. The Fox Sports rebrand did not affect India and East Asia: In India, Star India took over ESPN Star Sports' Indian subsidiary, and kept the ESPN name until 6 November 2013, when all of Star India's sports channels were relaunched under the Star Sports brand; a version of Star Sports broadcast to mainland China and South Korea kept the brand, and instead, the version of ESPN for mainland China was renamed Star Sports 2 on 1 January 2014. In the wake of 2011 News Corporation scandals, the original News Corporation was split into 21st Century Fox and the new News Corp on 28 June 2013, with the television businesses (which FIC Asia was a part of) going to 21st Century Fox. In October 2013, 12.15% of share in Phoenix Television held by 21st Century Fox (through Star) was sold to TPG Capital for HK$1.66 billion (about US$213.73 million).\\"TPG to Acquire 21st Century Fox‚Äôs Stake in Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Limited\\" (press release) TPG Capital; 21st Century Fox Business Wire 18 October 2013Tan, Clement \\"TPG pays Murdoch unit $214 million for Chinese media company stake\\" Reuters 19 October 2013Joshua, Fellman \\"TPG China Media Buys Remaining Fox Stake in Phoenix Satellite TV\\" Bloomberg L.P. 18 October 2013Frater, Patrick \\"21st Century Fox Sells Phoenix Stake\\" Variety 22 October 2013 This and 2014 sale of Star China Media marked 21st Century Fox's exit from Mandarin entertainment television market in mainland China. By 2014, Fox International Channels Middle East took over the distribution of Star World, Star Movies, National Geographic-branded channels, Fox-branded channels, Channel V International, Baby TV and Sky News in the Middle East and North Africa from Star Select. (Now renamed Fox Networks Group Middle East, the Middle East business is, together with FNG Asia Pacific, still a part of the wider FNG Asia operations.) In January 2016, the company's parent unit, Fox International Channels, was announced to be split into three divisions, which would see the heads of newly renamed Fox Networks Group Europe, Fox Networks Group Latin America and Fox Networks Group Asia all reporting to CEO Peter Rice and COO Randy Freer at Fox Networks Group in the United States, thus abolishing Fox International Channels as a separate unit from 21st Century Fox's television business in the U.S. Accordingly, the company changed legal name to Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific Limited () on 29 February 2016. On 5 December 2017, Star India's Chairman and CEO Uday Shankar was appointed as 21st Century Fox's president for Asia, and the President of Fox Networks Group Asia would report directly to Shankar (instead of the equivalent at FNG U.S.). =Disney ownership= With the acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets by The Walt Disney Company, FNG Asia Pacific (including FNG Taiwan, and FNG's remaining businesses in mainland China), as well as Star India, became a part of Disney and FNG Asia were integrated into Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International unit. Fox Network Group Asia was split into three, as to plug into the Disney International structure with offices in Shanghai (Northern Asia), Mumbai (India) and Singapore (Southeast Asia). The reconfiguration and layoff began on 29 June 2020 with layoff focused on FNG Asia's Hung Hom, Kowloon headquarters, which dates back to the 1993 acquisition by a 21st Century Fox predecessor of PCCW.

Criticism and controversy =Removal of BBC WSTV from line-up= The BBC and Star TV originally signed a deal that the Hong Kong operator would carry the BBC channel for 10 years. But in March 1994, the BBC and Star TV reached a deal after an out of court settlement, that would gradually drop BBC World Service Television from the satellite broadcaster's offerings. BBC WSTV would be dropped from the channel line-up for the Northeast Asia by mid-April that year, but would be available in the rest of Asia until 31 March 1996.\\"Murdoch's STAR TV to drop BBC\\" UPI 22 March 1994Dawtrey, Adam \\"BBC, Star TV to split in parts of Asia\\" Variety 21 March 1994 The deal came after such demands from the government of the People's Republic of China. It is alleged that the PRC government was unhappy with BBC coverage of China, and Murdoch's September 1993 speech which declared \\"(telecommunications) have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere ... satellite broadcasting makes it possible for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled television channels\\",http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/22/chinathemedia.rupertmurdoch so the Beijing government threatened to block Star TV in the huge mainland Chinese market if the BBC was not withdrawn. The former prime minister Li Peng requested and obtained the ban of satellite dishes throughout the country. There were also reported concerns surrounding editorial control of BBC WSTV after News Corporation's acquisition of Star TV. The subsequent removal of the BBC channel, and many ensuing declaration from Murdoch, led critics to believe the businessman was striving to appease the Chinese government in order to have the ban lifted. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) gave Rupert Murdoch a mock award titled \\"P.U.-litzer Prize\\" for \\"Media Hypocrite of the Year\\" in 1994. In 2001, the BBC and CITVC signed a deal which would make BBC World available to \\"upmarket hotels, as well as guest houses and foreign apartments\\" in mainland China.

His career in the music industry has spanned over 60 years. Orlando formed the doo-wop group The Five Gents in 1959 at the age of 15, with whom he recorded demos that got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner. At the age of 17, in 1961, Orlando had his first hit with the song \\"Ding Dong\\" on the MILO record label. Kirshner hired him to write songs at 1650 Broadway, Manhattan as part New York's thriving Brill Building songwriting community, along with other songwriters Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and Tom and Jerry, who didn't make it in the office until they later changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel. Orlando was also hired to sing on songwriter demos, and singles released with Orlando as a solo artist began to hit the charts in the US and the UK beginning in 1961 with \\"Halfway to Paradise\\" and \\"Bless You\\" when he was 16. Orlando continued as a solo artist and also became a producer himself, as well as a successful music executive in the late 1960s. He was hired by Clive Davis as the general manager of Columbia Records' publishing imprint, April-Blackwood Music in 1967, and by the late 1960s had been promoted to vice-president of Columbia/CBS Music. In 1969, Orlando signed Barry Manilow to his first recording contract with Bell Records, co-writing with him and producing Manilow's earliest tracks. He also worked with other artists, such as The Yardbirds, James Taylor, Grateful Dead, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Laura Nyro. He recorded \\"Candida\\" as lead vocalist under the pseudonym \\"Dawn\\" in 1970, and when the song became an international number-one hit, he began to use his name in the group becoming \\"Dawn featuring Tony Orlando\\" and then \\"Tony Orlando and Dawn\\". The group had 19 other top 40 hits, including \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\", the top-selling hit of 1973 and one of the biggest selling singles of all time. The group also had a hit variety program, The Tony Orlando and Dawn Show on CBS from 1974 to 1976. They then broke up in 1978, after which he has performed as Tony Orlando. In 1993 he opened the Tony Orlando Yellow Ribbon Music Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He ended his act there in 2013. He has since continued to perform many live shows as a headliner, mostly in Las Vegas, Nevada.https://parade.com/693827/nancyberk/music-legend-tony-orlandos-full- circle-moments-in-vegas/ Early life and career Tony Orlando was born Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis on April 3, 1944, the son of a Greek father and a Puerto Rican mother. He spent his earliest years in Hell's Kitchen, New York. In his teenage years, the family moved to Union City, New Jersey, and later Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Orlando's musical career started with The Five Gents, a doo-wop group he formed in 1959 at age 15, with whom he recorded demo tapes. He got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner, who hired him to write songs in an office across from New York's Brill Building, along with Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and Tom and Jerry, who didn't make it in the office until they changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel. Kirshner also hired Orlando to record songwriter demos as a solo artist, and his first success came at the age of 16 when he charted in the US and UK with the hits \\"Bless You\\" and \\"Halfway To Paradise.\\" He also appeared at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater with DJ Murray the K. Orlando also had four records that \\"Bubbled Under\\" the Hot 100: \\"Chills\\" in 1962, \\"Shirley\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" in 1963, and \\"I Was A Boy (When You Needed A Man)\\" as by Billy Shields in April 1969. Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller wrote a doo-wop version of Stephen Foster's song \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" for Orlando. Released as a single in 1962, the song was picked up by the Beatles who included it in their set lists on the Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour; a recorded version was released on their 2013 album On Air ‚Äì Live at the BBC Volume 2. New Colony Six recorded an Orlando composition, \\"I'm Just Waitin' (Anticipatin' For Her To Show Up)\\", which charted locally in Chicago and \\"Bubbled Under\\" the Hot 100 in July 1967. That year, Clive Davis hired Orlando as general manager of Columbia Records publishing subsidiary April-Blackwood Music. By the late 1960s, Orlando had worked his way up to vice president of a larger publishing company, CBS Music, where he signed, co-wrote with and produced Barry Manilow (under the name \\"Featherbed\\") and worked with James Taylor, the Grateful Dead, Laura Nyro and other artists. In the summer of 1969 he recorded with the studio group Wind and had a #28 hit that year with \\"Make Believe\\" on producer Bo Gentry's Life Records. Orlando was experiencing success, primarily as a music executive, and Davis pretended not to notice when Orlando accepted a $3,000 advance and sang lead vocals on a song called \\"Candida\\" as a favor for two producer friends. If the record failed, Orlando didn't want it to affect his reputation, so he used a pseudonym: Dawn.On the 3 October 1970 edition of \\"American Top 40\\", Casey Kasem claimed that the name of the lead singer on \\"Candida\\" was \\"Frankie Spanelli\\". Tony Orlando and Dawn Orlando recorded the record \\"Candida\\", with backup singers including Toni Wine (who wrote the song) and Linda November. Concerned about a possible conflict of interest with his April- Blackwood duties, Orlando sang under the condition that his name not be associated with the project, so it was released under the simple name of \\"Dawn\\", the middle name of the daughter of Bell records executive Steve Wax. \\"Candida\\" became a worldwide hit in 1970, reaching number one in five countries, and the top ten in many others, including number 3 in the USA.https://wfgr.com/candida-by-dawn-classic-hit-or-miss/ Dawn, with Wine and November again singing backup, recorded another song, \\"Knock Three Times\\", which itself became a #1 hit. Orlando then wanted to go on tour, and asked two other session singers, Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson to join for the tour. Orlando then discovered that there were six touring groups using that name, so Dawn became \\"Dawn featuring Tony Orlando\\", which changed to Tony Orlando and Dawn in 1973. The new group recorded more hits, including \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\" (1973) and \\"He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)\\" (1975), a cover of the Jerry Butler hit, \\"He Will Break Your Heart\\". With a successful recording career, Orlando then set his sights on television. As described in The San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Tony Orlando and Dawn burst out of television sets during the Ford administration, a sunny antidote to the dark cynicism that followed Watergate. He represented simple, traditional values, a conservative return to pure entertainment. He drew a happy face in the \\"O\\" of his autograph. It was not terribly cool, but America loved him.\\" The Tony Orlando and Dawn Show on CBS became a hit, a summer replacement for the Sonny & Cher show, and ran for four seasons from 1974 to 1976. It welcomed the biggest names in show business each week as Orlando's guests, including his boyhood idols, Jackie Gleason and Jerry Lewis. At the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, Orlando danced to the tune of \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon\\" with then First Lady Betty Ford. The media stated that it was to divert attention as Nancy Reagan entered the Kemper Arena convention hall. However, in Orlando's book Halfway to Paradise, he states that Mrs. Reagan was asked what her favorite song was, which happened to be \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon\\", so it was chosen as her entrance song. Ronald Reagan unsuccessfully challenged Gerald Ford, for the presidential nomination that year but came back in 1980 to claim the presidency itself. Ray Barnhart, a Reagan co-manager from Texas, criticized Mrs. Ford for having \\"danced a jig\\" with Orlando. Barbara Staff, another Texas co-chairman, called Betty Ford's behavior \\"a low, cheap shot\\".\\"Convention Notes: No love lost between Texans, Betty Ford\\", Dallas Morning News, August 19, 1976, p. 6A On October 12, 2015, with Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson present, Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters honored Orlando with their Art Gilmore Career Achievement Award at a celebrity luncheon. Late 1970s struggles and Solo work Along with the fame, Orlando had personal battles in the 1970s. He was briefly addicted to cocaine, and battled both obesity and depression. In 1977, due to the death of his sister, and the suicide of Orlando's close friend, comedian Freddie Prinze, Orlando had a breakdown, and retired from singing. He was briefly institutionalized, but returned triumphantly to television with an NBC comeback special. From then, he continued as a solo artist, charting with two singles - the dance hit \\"Don't Let Go\\" in 1978 and \\"Sweets For My Sweet\\" in 1979. In the 1980s, he was a dominant force in Las Vegas, headlining various hotels with sold-out audiences. Orlando has continued primarily as a solo singer, performing on tour and regularly in Las Vegas and Branson, Missouri. He hosted the New York City portions of the MDA Labor Day Telethon on WWOR-TV since the 1980s but quit in 2011 in response to Jerry Lewis' firing from the Muscular Dystrophy Association. He has won the Casino Entertainer of the Year Award, the Best All Around Entertainer - Las Vegas four times, and, prior to that, three times in Atlantic City, the Jukebox Artist of the Year Award from the Amusement and Music Owners Association of New York, The Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and has also been bestowed with The Bob Hope Award for excellence in entertainment from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society in honor of his efforts on behalf of United States veterans. His work on behalf of American veterans led to his being named Honorary Chairman at the 40th Anniversary at the NAM-POW's Homecoming Celebration at the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library in 2014. Orlando serves on the Board of Directors for the Eisenhower Foundation as well as Honorary Chairman of Snowball Express, an organization that serves the children of fallen military heroes. Orlando also hosts the Congressional Medal of Honor dinner every year in Dallas, Texas. He has also served as the Master of Ceremonies at the Secretary of Defense Freedom Awards at the Pentagon in Washington, DC. Orlando has headlined around the world and entertained for five U.S. presidents. He is a recipient of three American Music Awards and two People's Choice Awards for best male entertainer. For outstanding achievements to the entertainment industry, Orlando was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Acting career Orlando's first TV appearance was in 1976 on the series Chico and the Man as \\"Tomas Garcia\\". Orlando starred in the 1981 TV movie 300 Miles For Stephanie, playing a police officer who promises to walk over 300 miles to a sanctuary in order to obtain God's help to cure Stephanie, his gravely ill daughter. Others in the cast included Edward James Olmos, Pepe Serna and Julie Carmen. In May 1981, Orlando appeared on Broadway in the title role of Barnum, replacing Jim Dale, who was on a three-week vacation. During the 1984‚Äì85 season of the Cosby Show (its first season), Orlando played Tony Castillo, who runs a community center. He had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2002 film Waking Up In Reno, in which he sang a version of \\"Knock Three Times\\". In 2003, Orlando had a recurring role in the children's animated series Oswald, in which he did the voice of \\"Sammy Starfish\\". Orlando appeared in an episode of MADtv doing a skit involving a court case, where the defense sings to persuade the jury about their side. He sang for the prosecution, thereby persuading the judge to give the defense jail for life. In another television program, Orlando was featured in \\"Larry the Cable Guy's Star Studded Christmas Extravaganza\\". He appeared in That's My Boy as Steve Spirou, a Happy Madison production starring Adam Sandler in 2012. Personal life Orlando was introduced by Jerry Lee Lewis to his future wife, Elaine, who had previously dated Buddy Holly. Tony and Elaine married in 1965, and had one child, Jon; they divorced in 1984. Five years later, Orlando was engaged to Francine Amormino, whom he married in 1991. The couple remained married as of 2014; they have one child. On February 27, 2013, his mother, Ruth Schroeder of Hollister, Missouri, died in Branson, Missouri of a diabetic stroke. In 2002, he wrote a memoir, Halfway to Paradise. Tony and Francine Orlando live in Branson, Missouri, with their daughter, Jenny Rose. Orlando's son Jon Orlando, from his first marriage, was a comedian from 1993 to 2002, and is currently the vice president of business development for MEDL Mobile in Fountain Valley, California. Orlando was interviewed on The 700 Club explaining that he was raised Catholic and was \\"brought up with the Lord as my Savior\\"; but after a self-destructive period following his professional success with Dawn, he became a born-again Christian in 1978.Tony Orlando's Brush With Death, cbn.com; date of interview not stated; accessed June 23, 2014.

By accepting the office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 10 January 2000, he formally vacated his seat. Plaid Cymru selected Simon Thomas, who had been their Director of Policy and responsible for writing their manifestos for the 1997 general election and 1999 Assembly election. Labour, who had come second in the previous general election, chose a local social worker, Maria Battle. The election campaign was dominated by the issue of European Objective 1 funding. The constituency was part of the area of Wales that was granted Objective One status in 1999, but under European rules the funding had to be matched by a minimum of 25% from other sources, including private funding and resources from central and local government. Plaid Cymru, Conservative and Liberal Democrat politicians demanded this funding be made available solely from central government in addition to the block grant already paid to the Welsh Assembly by the UK Treasury, and the chief reporter for Wales on Sunday newspaper Martin Shipton stood as a single-issue candidate demanding 'Match Funding now'. The Labour administration in the Welsh Assembly insisted that such a demand misrepresented the resourcing of Objective 1 programmes. Polling day in the by-election was 3 February. Plaid Cymru retained the seat comfortably, with the Liberal Democrats taking second in a seat they had previously held from 1974 until 1992 ‚Äì and would win again in 2005.

It was launched in December 1987, and carried the first two crew members of the third long duration expedition, Mir EO-3. These crew members, Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, would stay in space for just under 366 days, setting a new spaceflight record. The third astronaut launched by Soyuz TM-4 was Anatoli Levchenko, who returned to Earth about a week later with the remaining crew of Mir EO-2. Levchenko was a prospective pilot for the Soviet Space shuttle Buran. The purpose of his mission, named Mir LII-1, was to familiarize him with spaceflight. It was the fourth Soyuz TM spacecraft to be launched (one of which wasn't crewed), and like other Soyuz spacecraft, it was treated as a lifeboat for the station's crew while docked. In June 1988, part way through EO-3, Soyuz TM-4 was swapped for Soyuz TM-5 as the station's lifeboat. The mission which swapped the spacecraft was known as Mir EP-2, and had a three- person crew. Crew Titov and Manarov were members of the long duration mission Mir EO-3, and returned to Earth just over a full year later, in Soyuz TM-6. Levchenko, on the other hand, returned to Earth about a week later in Soyuz TM-3. In June 1988, Soyuz TM-4 landed the three-man crew of Mir EP-2, after their 9-day stay on the station; that crew included the second Bulgarian astronaut Aleksandr Panayotov Aleksandrov. = Backup crew = Mission parameters *Mass: 7070 kg *Perigee: 337 km *Apogee: 357 km *Inclination: 51.6¬∞ *Period: 91.5 minutes Mission highlights 4th crewed spaceflight to Mir.

Levchenko returned with Romanenko and Alexandrov in Soyuz TM-3. Before departing Mir, Romanenko and Alexandrov demonstrated use of EVA equipment to the Okeans. The Okeans delivered biological experiments, including the Aynur biological crystal growth apparatus, which they installed in Kvant-1. The combined crews conducted an evacuation drill, with the Mir computer simulating an emergency. Titov and Manarov conducted part of an ongoing survey of galaxies and star groups in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum using the Glazar telescope on Kvant. The survey required photography with exposure times up to 8 min. Even small cosmonaut movements could shake the complex. This produced blurring of astronomical images, so all cosmonaut movements had to be stopped during the exposures.

In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired. Trust can be attributed to relationships between people. It can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain. Some studies indicate that trust can be altered e.g. by the application of oxytocin. When it comes to the relationship between people and technology, the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute. The intentional stanceDennett, D.C. (1989) The Intentional Stance. Bradford Books. demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies. However, rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artifacts.Shneiderman, B. (2000) \\"Designing trust into online experiences\\". Communications of the ACM Volume 43, Number 12, pp. 57‚Äì59 One of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to re-think how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust. This is especially true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems.Luhmann, N. (2005) Risk: a sociological theory. AldineTransaction. In the social sciences, the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research. In sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty, fairness, or benevolence of another party. The term \\"confidence\\" is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party. A failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty. In economics, trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions. In all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule, allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning. Sociology When it comes to trust, sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems. Interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties, from the early works of Luhmann,Luhmann, N. (1979). Trust and Power. John Wiley & Sons. BarberBarber, B. (1983) The Logic and Limits of Trust. Rutgerts University Press. and GiddensGiddens, A. (1984). The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration; Polity Press, Cambridge (seeSztompka, P. (1999). Trust: A Sociological Theory. Cambridge University Press. for a more detailed overview). This growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by on-going changes in society, characterised as late modernity and post-modernity. Trust is one of several social constructs, an element of the social reality.Searle, J.R. (1995). The Construction of Social Reality. The Free Press It does not exist outside of our vision of the other. This image can be real or imaginary, but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust. Other constructs, frequently discussed together with trust, are: control, confidence, risk, meaning and power. Trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors, both individuals and groups (social systems). Because trust is a social construct, it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted (e.g.Gambetta, D. (2000). \\"Can We Trust Trust?\\" In: Gambetta, D. (ed.). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations, electronic edition, Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, chapter 13, pp. 213‚Äì237.), i.e. whether social trust operates as expected. Sviatoslav contends that society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience, and contingency of new possibilities. Without trust, all contingent possibilities should be always considered, leading to a paralysis of inaction. Trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures, the one that may deliver benefits. Once the bet is decided (i.e. trust is granted), the trustor suspends his or her disbelief, and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all. Because of it, trust acts as a reductor of social complexity, allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered (or even impossible to consider at all); specifically for cooperation. Sociology tends to focus on two distinct views: the macro view of social systems, and a micro view of individual social actors (where it borders with social psychology). Similarly, views on trust follow this dichotomy. Therefore, on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed, with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust. The behavioural approach to trust is usually assumedColeman, J. (1990). Foundations of Social Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. while actions of social actors are measurable, leading to statistical modelling of trust. This systemic approach can be contrastedCastelfranchi, C., Falcone, R. (2000). \\"Trust Is Much More than Subjective Probability: Mental Components and Sources of Trust\\". Proc. of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. Volume 6. with studies on social actors and their decision-making process, in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain (and allow to model) the emergence of trust. Sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors, and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee. Trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency, being an attractive alternative to control.Mollering, G.. \\"The Trust/Control Duality: An Integrative Perspective on Positive Expectations of Others\\". In: Int. Sociology, September 2005, Vol. 20(3): 283‚Äì305. Trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor, yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee.Baier, A. (1986). \\"Trust and antitrust\\". Ethics, vol. 96, pp. 231‚Äì260. Reprinted in: Moral Prejudices. Cambridge University Press. Modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards post-modern society, but they also challenged traditional views on trust. Empirical studiesLacoh√©e, H., Cofta, P., Phippen, A., and Furnell, S. (2008). \\"Understanding Public Perceptions: Trust and Engagement\\" in ICT Mediated Services. International Engineering Consortium. confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust. Trust is not attributable to artefacts, but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers, creators and operators of technology. Properties of technological artefacts form a message to determine trustworthiness of those agents. The discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress. However, a conceptual re- thinking of technology-mediated social groups,Willson, M.A. (2006). Technically Together: Rethinking Community within Techno-society. Peter Lang Publishing Inc. or the proposition of a unifying socio-technical view on trust,Cofta, P. (2007). Trust, Complexity and Control: Confidence in a Convergent World. John Wiley and Sons. from the perspective of social actors. =Types= Four types of social trust are recognized: *Generalized trust, or trust in strangers, is a highly important form of trust in modern society, which involves a large amount of social interactions among strangers. *Out- group trust is the trust an individual has in members of a different group. This can be members of a different ethnic group, for example. *In-group trust is that which is placed in members of one's own group, such as members of the same ethnic group or citizens of the same country. *Trust in neighbors involves those who share a residential environment. =Influence of ethnic diversity= Several dozen studies have examined the impact of ethnic diversity on social trust. A 2020 review concluded that there were three key debates on the subject: I) Why does ethnic diversity erode social trust? II) Can contact reduce the negative association between ethnic diversity and social trust? III) Is ethnic diversity a stand-in for social disadvantage? The review's meta-analysis of 87 studies showed a consistent, though modest, negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Ethnic diversity has the strongest negative impact on neighbor trust, in-group trust, and generalized trust. It did not appear to have a significant impact on out- group trust. Psychology In psychology, trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected. It starts at the family and grows to others. According to the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson development of basic trust is the first state of psychosocial development occurring, or failing, during the first two years of life. Success results in feelings of security, trust, and optimism, while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders.Fonagy, Peter (2010). Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis. Other Press Professional, A person's dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective well-being. It has been argued that trust increases subjective well-being because it enhances the quality of one's interpersonal relationships, and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships. Trust is integral to the idea of social influence: it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting. The notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others, institutions (e.g. government agencies) and objects such as machines. However, once again perception of honesty, competence and value similarity (slightly similar to benevolence) are essential. There are three different forms of trust. Trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy; trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person, and trust propensity being able to rely on people. Once trust is lost, by obvious violation of one of these three determinants, it is very hard to regain. Thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust. Hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level. Increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications: * Barbara Misztal, in her book,Barbara Misztal, Trust in Modern Societies: The Search for the Bases of Social Order, Polity Press, attempts to combine all notions of trust together. She points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people: It makes social life predictable, it creates a sense of community, and it makes it easier for people to work together. * In the context of sexual trust Riki RobbinsRiki Robbins, Betrayed!: How You Can Restore Sexual Trust and Rebuild Your Life, Adams Media Corporation, describes four stages of trust. * In the context of Information theory Ed Gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power, surveillance, and accountability.Ed Gerck, Trust Points, Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security by J. Feghhi, J. Feghhi and P. Williams, Addison-Wesley, , 1998. * From a social identity perspective, the propensity to trust in strangers (see in-group favoritism) arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership, stereotypes, or the need to maintain the group's positive distinctiveness. In addition to the social influence, in organizational settings, trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors, perceptions, and performances of a person. Trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which, in turn, promotes future perceptions of justice. One factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance. Through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a two-person sequential trust game, supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features (facial resemblance) enhanced trust in a subject's respective partner. Though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust, facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner. In a series of tests, digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short-term relationship. The results showed that within the context of a short-term relationship, which is dependent on sexual desire, similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire. Within the context of a long-term relationship, which is dependent on trust, similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual, leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships. Structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace. Working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort. By having a conveniently organized area to work on, concentration will increase as well as effort. Structure is not just a method of order. It increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable. A structured, ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level. People may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual's contribution.The Role of Trust in Organizational Settings, Kurt T. Dirks, Donald L. Ferrin, 2001 Conversely, where trust is absent, projects can fail, especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed. This is one facet of VPEC-T analysis: This thinking framework is used when studying information systems. Identifying and dealing with cases where information providers, information users, and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project. One's social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement. Individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust.Goddard, Roger. Relation Network, Social Trust, and Norms: A Social Capitol Perspective on Students' Chances of Academic Success An important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child. Failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the child's difficulty towards trusting self and others.Timmons-Mitchell, Jane. Treating Sexual Victimization: Developing Trust-based Relating in the Mother-daughter Dyad Trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriage. Children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers, partners, spouses, friends, and associates than their peers of intact families. The impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father. =Social identity approach= The social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of group-based stereotypes or in-group favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships. With regard to ingroup favoritism, people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from in-group members in comparison to out-group members. This greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an in- group rather than out-group member. It has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an in-group stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient. There is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach. Allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand group-based trust in strangers.Foddy, M., & Dawes, R. (2008). Group-based trust in social dilemmas. In A. Biel, D. Eek, T. Garling, & M. Gustafsson (Eds.), New Issues and Paradigms in Research on Social Dilemmas (pp. 57‚Äì85). New York: Springer Science and Business Media. They may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange. General social categories such as university affiliation, course majors, and even ad-hoc groups have been used to distinguish between in-group and out-group members. In unilateral studies of trust, the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an in-group or out-group member. They would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction, simulating Brewer's notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about group-based trust and hence cooperation. Participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out. In bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by Berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another.Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., & McCabe, K. (1995). \\"Trust, reciprocity, and social history\\". Games and Economic Behaviour, 10, 122‚Äì142 Any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender. Trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money. The above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties, trust is granted more readily to in-group members than out-group members. This occurred even when the in-group stereotype was comparatively less positive than an out-group's (e.g. psychology versus nursing majors), in the absence of personal identity cues, and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money (i.e. in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger). In contrast, when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes. The group with the more positive stereotype was trusted (e.g. one's university affiliation over another), even over that of the in- group (e.g. nursing over psychology majors). Another reason for in-group favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain in- group positive distinctiveness, particularly in the presence of social identity threat. Trust in out-group strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed. Philosophy Some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance. Philosophers such as Annette Baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed, whilst reliance can only be disappointed (Baier 1986, 235). Carolyn McLeod explains Baier's argument by giving the following examples: we can rely on our clock to give the time, but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks, thus, we cannot say that we trusted it; we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person, because this is in fact an expression of distrust (McLeod 2006). Thus, trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed. The definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something\\"trust.\\" Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 25 May. 2013. leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition, because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable. For example, to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years, is a confident expectation (whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals.) The trust is not about what we wish for, rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits. As a result, there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge. Economics Trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize one's utility. In economic terms, trust can provide an explanation of a difference between Nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium. Such an approach can be applied to individuals as well as societies. Trust is also seen as an economic lubricant, reducing the cost of transactions between parties, enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities; employment and prosperity. This observation Fukuyama, F. (1996) Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity, Touchstone Books. created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital. It has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development. Even though the original concept of 'high trust' and 'low trust' societies may not necessarily hold, it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy Zak, P. J., and Knack, S. (2001) \\"Trust and growth\\". Economic Journal, 111: 295‚Äì321. and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth. Theoretical economical modelling demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party. Such a level of trust leads to efficient market. Trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities, trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation. Economics is also interested in quantifying trust, usually in monetary terms. The level of correlation between increase in profit margin Resnick, P. \\"The value of reputation on eBay: a controlled experiment\\". Experimental Economics, volume 9, Issue 2, Jun 2006, pp. 79‚Äì101. or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust. Economic 'trust games' are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions. There are several games and game-like scenarios related to trust that have been tried, with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms.Keser, C. (2003) \\"Experimental games for the design of reputation management systems\\". IBM Systems J., vol. 42, no. 3. Games of trust are designed in a way that their Nash equilibrium differ from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit. The classical version of the game of trust has been described in Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., and McCabe, K. (1995) \\"Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History\\", Games and Economic Behavior 10, 122‚Äì142. Abstract. as an abstracted investment game, using the scenario of an investor and a broker. Investor can invest a fraction of his money, and broker can return only part of his gains. If both players follow their economical best interest, the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to re-pay anything. Thus the flow of money flow, its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust. The game can be played as one-off, or as a repetitive one, between the same or different sets of players, to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships. Several other variants of this game exist. Reversing rules lead to the game of distrust, pre-declarations can be used to establish intentions of players,Airiau, S., and Sen, S. (2006) \\"Learning to Commit in Repeated Games\\". In: Proc. of the Fifth Int.

Reputation-based systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness, generating significant interest in various models of reputation.Chang, E., Dillion, T., Hussain, F. K. (2006) Trust and Reputation for Service-Oriented Environments: Technologies for Building Business Intelligence and Consumer Confidence. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Management and organization science  In management and organization science, trust is studied as a factor that can be managed and influenced by organizational actors. Scholars have paid particular attention to how trust develops across individual and organizational levels of analysis. They suggest a reciprocal process where organizational structures influence individuals‚Äô trust and, at the same time, individuals‚Äô trust manifests in organizational structures. Management and organization science scholars have also paid attention to how trust is influenced by contracts and how trust interacts with formal mechanisms. Parallel to the very large interest in trust, scholars in management and related disciplines have made the case for the importance of distrust as a related but distinct construct. Since the mid-1990s, a substantial body of organizational research has fallen into one of two distinct but nonexclusive paradigms of trust research. The first paradigm distinguishes between two major dimensions of trust. Trust in another can be characterized as cognition-based trust (i.e., based on rational calculation) and affect-based trust (i.e., based on emotional attachment). For example, trust in an auto repair shop could come in the form of an assessment of the capabilities of the shop to do a good job repairing one's car (cognition-based trust) or having a longstanding relationship with the shop's owner (affect-based trust). The second paradigm distinguishes between the trustworthiness factors that give rise to trust (i.e., one‚Äôs perceived ability, benevolence, and integrity) and trust itself. Together, these paradigms are useful for predicting how different dimensions of trust form in organizations via the demonstration of various trustworthiness attributes. Systems In systems, a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on. If A trusts B, this means that a violation in those properties of B might compromise the correct operation of A. Observe that those properties of B trusted by A might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to B's actual properties. This happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account. In consequence, trust should be placed to the extent of the component's trustworthiness. The trustworthiness of a component is thus, not surprisingly, defined by how well it secures a set of functional and non-functional properties, deriving from its architecture, construction, and environment, and evaluated as appropriate.

It was launched on June 7, 1988, carrying the Mir EP-2 mission's three-person crew. This week-long stay on Mir occurred during the third long-duration Mir expedition, Mir EO-3. The crew of EP-2 returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-4, while the TM-5 spacecraft remained docked to Mir, acting as the lifeboat for the long-duration crew. On September 7, 1988, the TM-5 spacecraft undocked from Mir, and landed Mir EP-3 mission's two-person visiting crew. The de-orbit procedures for Soyuz were revised after this flight, as multiple issues almost prevented the descent module's safe de-orbit and landing. Crew Launch Soyuz TM-5 launched on 1988 June 7 and arrived at Mir on June 9 carrying the second Bulgarian in space, Alexandrov (not to be confused with the Soviet cosmonaut of the same name). He became the first Bulgarian to reach a Soviet space station (Georgi Ivanov failed to reach Salyut 6 on Soyuz 33 in 1979--Alexandrov was his backup). Their launch had been advanced by 2 weeks late in the planning stages to improve lighting conditions for the Rozhen astronomical experiment. Landing On September 5 cosmonauts Lyakhov and Mohmand undocked from Mir. They jettisoned the orbital module and made ready for deorbit burn to return to Earth. During descent, the spacecraft experienced a computer software problem combined with a sensor problem. This caused their landing to be delayed by a full day. The Descent Module, where they spent this 24-hour period, had no sanitary facilities. Consequently, they soiled themselves. They would not have been able to redock with Mir because they had discarded the docking system along with the orbital module. Reentry occurred as normal on September 7. Following this incident, the Soviets decided that on future missions, they would retain the orbital module until after deorbit burn, as they had done on the Soyuz Ferry flights.

This created a by-election in his constituency of Romsey in Hampshire, England. The Conservative Party decided to delay the polling day until 4 May, so that it would come simultaneously with local elections. They selected Tim Palmer, a farmer and Dorset County Councillor, to defend the seat. The Liberal Democrats considered this byelection their best chance of gaining a seat since 1997 and selected a local pharmacist Sandra Gidley (who had been Mayor of Romsey) as their candidate. Labour carried out minimal campaigning in a constituency in which they had come third for years. This led many observers to assume that the party was expecting, or hoping, that its vote would largely go to the Liberal Democrats in order to help defeat the Conservatives. In the event, the Labour vote collapsed while the Liberal Democrats surged, and they made this the only mainland by-election to result in a change of party control in the entire Parliament.

The episode first aired in the United States on August 13, 2004 on the Sci Fi Channel and on Sky One in the United Kingdom on November 16, 2004. It was the first episode to be written by executive producer Martin Gero, and directed by David Winning. The episode portrays Major Sheppard and his team arriving on M7G-677, a planet where the inhabitants ritually sacrifice themselves when they reach the age of twenty-five. \\"Childhood's End\\" earned a weak Nielsen rating though the episode was generally well received by critics and fans alike.  Plot  The Atlantis team suddenly loses control of their puddle jumper and crashes. Investigating the electromagnetic field that made them crash, the team discover that the planet they've landed on has no one over the age of 25. They soon learn that upon turning 25, the people of this society commit suicide because they believe it keeps the Wraith from coming back to the world. The team discover this isn't the case when they try to find out what brought their puddle jumper down. They find a device powered by a Zero Point Module (ZPM) which acts as a sort of an electromagnetic pulse device which disables all electrical devices within the radius, including those of the Wraith and the Atlantians; the Wraith have never returned because, even if they simply landed outside the field, they would subsequently lose their technological advantage. Dr. Rodney McKay believes that the ZPM will allow the Atlantis team to power the Atlantis shields and takes it upon himself to bring it back to Atlantis, but Sheppard tells him to be quick, as one of the natives he has befriended -- Keras, one of the village 'elders' -- is going to kill himself the next day. However, upon returning, he is ordered by Dr. Weir to return it; the ZPM is effectively useless to Atlantis, as it only has enough power to keep their shield running for a few hours, while it is the planet's only defense and could maintain its shield for at least several more years. McKay also deduces that the suicide pact is actually connected to the device; the shield has only a limited range, so the suicide pact was created as a means of population control to stop them expanding too far. Prior to McKay's re-activation of the emitter, a Wraith scout's radio, long deactivated due to the emitter's activity, becomes active and begins broadcasting a distress beacon. Wraith scouts are immediately dispatched, nearly resulting in a confrontation between John Sheppard's team and some of the natives who believe they are responsible for this change, but McKay reattaches the ZPM, the emitter is re-activated, and the scouts are unable to broadcast any data back to their hive ship of origin. As they depart, McKay reveals that, although the ZPM's power is limited, he has managed to work out a means of expanding the shield, allowing for population growth and rendering the suicide pact unnecessary -- at least for the next couple of generations. As he departs, Sheppard gives Keras a birthday present of a bag of chocolate, commenting that such a thing is traditional on birthdays back on their planet. Production \\"Childhood's End\\" was the first working title for an episode of Stargate Atlantis revealed to the public. The title is a reference to Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke. This is nothing new in the Stargate series; two episodes of Stargate SG-1 were named after Sir Arthur C. Clarke novels of The Space Odyssey series, namely \\"2001\\" and \\"2010\\". This is the only episode in the Stargate franchise to be directed by science fiction veteran David Winning. Courtenay J. Stevens originally played the role of Lieutenant Elliot in Stargate SG-1, appearing in the Season 5 episodes \\"Proving Ground\\", \\"Summit\\" and \\"Last Stand\\". Writer Martin Gero compared Ares in \\"Childhood's End\\" to a villain in The Incredibles. In the scene of the final confrontation with Major John Sheppard, he begins \\"monologuing,\\" which is a key feature of villains in the film. The effects team of the episode built the village and took care of all the decoration in the episode. This is the first episode of the series which doesn't deal with the overall mythological arc of the series. This is also the first episode written by Gero, as he joined the Stargate franchise writing staff earlier that year (2004). He was able to join the writing staff of Stargate Atlantis, since they were undermanned at that time.  Reception  \\"Childhood's End\\" reached a Nielsen rating of 1.9, beating the rating for that weeks episode of the sister series, Stargate SG-1. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on August 13, 2004 on the Sci Fi Channel, later it was broadcast on Sky One in the United Kingdom on November 16, 2004. The episode debuted on broadcast syndication in the United States on October 24, 2005. The episode won the Chicago International Film Festival \\"Outstanding Achievement in a Television Drama Direction\\" for David Winning. It also won a New York Film Festival award in the category \\"Outstanding Achievement in a Television Drama\\". \\"Childhood's End\\" is the only episode in the series which has been nominated and won one of these awards.

The character is depicted commonly as an adversary of Doctor Strange. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in Strange Tales #111 (August 1963). Baron Mordo is a gifted magician, especially adept in the black arts of magic, including summoning demons. Karl Mordo studied the magic arts under the Ancient One in Tibet when Dr. Stephen Strange came to study there. Strange foiled Baron Mordo's plot to kill the Ancient One, leading to Baron Mordo being cast out and Dr. Strange eventually becoming \\"Sorcerer Supreme\\". Mordo would clash with Dr. Strange on a multitude of occasions, at times with the backing of the demon Dormammu, going so far as successfully impersonating Dr. Strange for a short period of time. Outside of comics, the Baron Mordo character has appeared in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series and The Super Hero Squad Show cartoon series. He was also one of the main characters in the 2007 animated film Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange (2016) and will reprise the role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Publication history Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Baron Mordo first appeared in Strange Tales #111 (August 1963). Fictional character biography A Transylvanian nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Karl Amadeus Mordo became a student of the Tibetan sorcerer known as the Ancient One.Strange Tales vol. 1, #115 (Dec 1963) When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot. Mordo was forced to cast restraining spells to prevent Strange from warning the Ancient One. In desperation, Strange decided to accept the Ancient One's offer to take him on as his mentor in magic to have some hope of stopping Mordo. The Ancient One, however, was fully aware of Mordo's plot and of Strange's desire to warn him. Pleased at Strange's unselfish decision, the Ancient One's magical teachings immediately freed the doctor and explained the full situation. Thus informed in the face of his recent experiences, Strange agreed to become the Ancient One's apprentice despite the requirement that he abandon his former life. The Ancient One trained him to be a formidable opponent of Mordo. Eventually Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One.Strange Tales #111 Mordo's abilities were similar to those of Doctor Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at astral projection and hypnosis, as well as mesmerism. He was more than willing to use powerful black magic and invoke demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do. Mordo's use of these darker arts would sometimes backfire. The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange. He sent his astral form to hypnotize the Ancient One's servant into poisoning his food, hoping the old man would reveal his secrets of magic. However, Strange tricked him into returning to his physical body after engaging in astral contact with him, thus breaking his hold over the servant, who helped the Ancient One to recover. Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange with a drugged candle that paralyzed him, but Strange was able to use his mental powers to call a local girl to free him.Strange Tales #114 He opposed Doctor Strange's discipleship to the Ancient One.Strange Tales #115 He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One.Strange Tales #117 Mordo took Strange's body while Strange was astral projecting for a threat he sensed that Mordo had caused, and cast a barrier around it, knowing that if his astral form was out for 24 hours it would die. Strange found it in a wax museum, but was unable to enter. However, Strange took control of a wax model in the last minute, distracting Mordo and enabling Strange to return to his body.Strange Tales #121 He imprisoned the Ancient One, but was again defeated.Strange Tales #125 Mordo made a deal with his new master, the demonic Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange.Strange Tales #130 He dispatched agents, other evil magicians around the World and Spirit wraiths, to search for the incognito Strange,Strange Tales #131 and then banished him from the Earth.Strange Tales #132 He fled from Strange,Strange Tales #134 and then dispatched agents to kill Strange.Strange Tales #135-136 He engaged in personal combat with Strange.Strange Tales #139 Mordo was exiled to the Dimension of Demons by Dormammu.Strange Tales #141 He battled Doctor Strange once more at Stonehenge, but was ultimately banished from Earth.Strange Tales #159-162 Mordo would return eventually to continue to bedevil Doctor Strange.

Powers and abilities Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do. Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore. Other versions =Mutant X= Baron Mordo appears in the last issue of Mutant X, being referred to as the 'Ancient One'. He is still considered a villain, though he allies himself with other heroes and villains in order to stop the Beyonder/Goblin Queen entity. =2099= In Secret Wars, the Avengers 2099 investigate the threat of the mysterious Martin Hargood.Secret Wars 2099 #2 In the final issue, it is revealed he is Baron Mordo's descendant and, after reclaiming his ancestral title, uses Alchemax's Virtual Unreality lab to summon the Dweller in Darkness. Captain America 2099 punches Mordo out, while Roman, the son of Namor, summons a Giganto to defeat the Dweller.Secret Wars 2099 #5 In other media =Television= * Baron Mordo first appeared in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, voiced by Tony Jay. In the show, Mordo appears as Dormammu's minion, and archenemy to Doctor Strange. In his first appearance in the episode \\"Sins of the Fathers Chapter 1: Dr. Strange\\", he was ordered by Dormammu to steal the Wand of Watoomb to make a portal that would release him from his dimension. To do so, Mordo brainwashes Mary Jane Watson to become his servant. His plan almost succeeded when Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, his assistant Wong, and Mary Jane stopped him from freeing Mordo's master from his dimension. Later, in \\"Venom Returns\\" and \\"Carnage\\", Mordo was ordered by Dormammu to bring the symbiote back to Earth so that Eddie Brock could once again bond with it and become Venom. Dormammu then orders Mordo to give Brock a message. At Stark Enterprises, Mordo disguises himself as \\"Ardon Broom\\" (an anagram of his true name) to get the portal. When Spider-Man and War Machine join forces to fight Venom, Dormammu tells Mordo that there is another symbiote, which Mordo then bestows to Cletus Kasady, naming the result \\"Carnage\\". After retrieving the probe, Dormammu orders Carnage to steal the \\"life force\\" energy from humans, so he may gain enough strength to enter our world. When Carnage absorbs too much force, Mordo brings him back to his lair to drain the power into an urn. When Carnage attempts to send the urn into Dormammu's portal, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Venom interrupt him. Mordo ordered Carnage to throw the urn to unleash Dormammu, but was thwarted. Sacrificing himself, Venom pulled Carnage into the dimension following Dormammu's reversion, after which Mordo made his escape. * Baron Mordo appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Dave Boat. This version of the character is also completely insane. In the episode \\"Night in the Sanctorum\\", he was shown imprisoned in a soda can when Enchantress' magic vexes Thor to open the soda can containing Mordo. While belching out bubbles, Mordo ends up fighting Thor destroying Doctor Strange's kitchen until Doctor Strange appears and reimprisons Mordo in the soda can. In \\"Invader from the Dark Dimension\\", the soda can Mordo was imprisoned in was recycled into the Dark Dimension by Wong. When Iron Man ends up in the Dark Dimension through a portal near the statue of the Mayor of Superhero City, he encounters Mordo. Mordo manages to possess Iron Man, and uses his body to try to claim all of the Infinity Fractals. Upon turning Iron Man into the Iron Menace upon possessing him, Mordo takes over Stark Industries and uses mind control technology to take over Wolverine, Falcon, Redwing, and Abomination. Thor, Silver Surfer, and Hulk had to team up with Doctor Strange and Valkyrie to stop him even gaining some help from Doctor Doom and MODOK. Doctor Strange managed to trick Mordo back into the Dark Dimension and free Iron Man from his control. * Baron Mordo appears in Ultimate Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six, voiced by Danny Jacobs. In the episode \\"Miles from Home\\", he was enlisted by Doctor Octopus to bring the Green Goblin of Earth-1610 to their reality. Even though the plan worked, the Goblin of Earth-1610 attacked both of them and claimed the Siege Perilous. With help from Spider-Man, Doctor Strange engaged Baron Mordo in battle. After Spider-Man got Kid Arachnid to their world to help fight the Goblin of Earth-1610, Baron Mordo and Doctor Octopus worked to reclaim the Siege Perilous from the Goblin of Earth-1610 whose punches started opening holes in the fabric of reality. The Goblin of Earth-1610 punched Baron Mordo causing a hole to open on him long enough to shatter him like glass as his remains fade away. In the episode \\"Strange Halloween\\", Baron Mordo had managed to reassemble himself in the Quantum Realm where he started using his magic in order to turn every trick-or-treater into monstrous versions of their costumes. Upon tracing Baron Mordo to the Quantum Realm, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Ant-Man arrive where they face Baron Mordo and illusion versions of Doctor Octopus' nanite-powered form, Dormammu, and Ultron. Thanks to a tactic, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Ant-Man shatter the illusions and unknowingly bring Baron Mordo back to their reality. Once there, Baron Mordo unleashed the transformed trick-or-treaters on the heroes and even animated the vehicles and buildings into monsters that obey his every command. Upon knowing of the imagination part of the spell, Spider-Man imagines the Eye of Agamotto enlarging which he uses to help Doctor Strange defeat Baron Mordo and undo his spell. * Baron Mordo appears in Avengers: Secret Wars, voiced by Phil LaMarr. This version is depicted to be a magic ally of Hydra and is an African-American. In the episode \\"Eye of Agamotto\\" Pt. 1, he works on the Talisman of Kaluu after some Hydra Agents raid a warehouse filled with magical items to which Captain America and Black Panther track, finding Baron Mordo working on it. After a brief fight, Baron Mordo escapes as Captain America and Black Panther track him to an island where light and dark magic meet. With help from Shuri, Captain America and Black Panther defeat Baron Mordo who is dragged into another dimension with the portal being closed by a disguised Agamotto who destroys the Talisman of Kaluu. * Baron Mordo appears in Spider- Man: Maximum Venom, voiced by Leonard Roberts. This version is an African- American. In the episode \\"Amazing Friends\\", he collaborated with Monica Rappaccini and A.I.M. in a plot to target Groot. Once they got their hands on Groot after Baron Mordo sent Doctor Strange and Spy-D to the Unknown Realms, they fled to A.I.M. Island where Baron Mordo uses his magic and A.I.M. technology to extract Groot's DNA and create Wood Golems that obey Baron Mordo's every command. Their plans are crashed by Spider-Man, Ironheart, and Amadeus Cho's Hulk form. Once Doctor Strange and Spy-D escaped from the Unknown Realms, Spider-Man had Ironheart use a hologram of ice cream to bait the Wood Golems into the portal to the Unknown Realms as Doctor Strange defeats Baron Mordo. Baron Mordo and the A.I.M. operatives involved are locked in special cells in Avengers Tower until the Avengers return from their space mission. =Film= * Baron Mordo appears in the 2007 animated film Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. His origin is altered, yet maintains his dislike for Strange and the Ancient One. In this adaptation, he is a warrior-like sorcerer who began to think only about victory instead of what is truly important about their battles, willing to go as far as killing innocent children, which was against all the Ancient One stood for; this caused the Ancient One to reject his attempt to be Sorcerer Supreme. Believing the Ancient One has turned his back on him, Mordo sided with Dormammu and killed his former master. Doctor Strange, accepting his destiny as the new Sorcerer Supreme, managed to avenge the Ancient One and easily defeated Mordo. Angered at his failure, Dormammu eats his failed servant. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo in the 2016 film Doctor Strange * Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mordo in the 2016 film Doctor Strange. In the film, Karl Mordo is a member of the Masters of Mystic Arts who trains Strange, using the Staff of the Living Tribunal as his weapon. He helps Strange fight against Kaecilius. The Ancient One notes that Mordo's strength must be balanced by Strange since Mordo is unable to recognize the need for moral flexibility and compromise. At the end of the film, disillusioned from the teachings of the Ancient One after learning that the latter's immortality has been the result of her drawing on the energy of the Dark Dimension and Strange further breaking nature's laws, he decides to leave his fellow sorcerers. He comes to believe that all magic perverts and disrupts the natural order, thus causing him to set out to stop others from using it. In a post-credits scene, Mordo visits a fellow magician named Jonathan Pangborn and steals his energy that he uses to walk and make use of his legs, stating that the world has \\"too many sorcerers\\". *Ejiofor will return to portray the character in the sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). =Video games= * Baron Mordo appears in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance voiced by Philip Proctor. He is a member of the game's version of the Masters of Evil and one of Doctor Doom's lieutenants.

They would join the third crew member of EO-4, cosmonaut/physician Valeri Polyakov, who was on Mir for the second half of EO-3. Also launched by Soyuz TM-7 was French astronaut Jean-Loup Chr√©tien, who would take part in the 24-day French mission known as Mir Aragatz. The spacecraft Soyuz TM-7 remained docked to Mir for the duration of EO-4. At the end of EO-4 in April 1989, due to delays in the launch schedule, Mir was left uncrewed, and all three EO-4 crew members were transported back to Earth.

The spacecraft arrived at the Mir station carrying a three-man crew, including French cosmonaut Chr√©tien on his second flight into space. Titov, Manarov, and Chr√©tien returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-6. Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev, and Valeri Polyakov remained aboard Mir. On 1989 April 28, they left Mir in mothballs and returned to Earth in Soyuz-TM 7. The Soyuz-TM land landing system is effective at reducing velocity in the vertical direction. However, according to cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, winds at the landing site often impart considerable horizontal velocity. As a result, about 80 percent of all Soyuz descent modules come to rest on their sides. During the rough landing, Krikalev suffered a minor injury to his knee. Preparations for the first EVA involving a non-Soviet/non-U.S. space traveler forced the cosmonauts to cut short a TV meeting with diplomats from 47 countries on December 8. On December 9, Chr√©tien and Volkov depressurized the multiport docking adapter and clambered outside Mir. Chr√©tien was first out. He installed handrails, then attached the 15.5 kg (34 lb) √âchantillons experiment rack to the handrails by springs and hooks. He also attached electrical wires leading from the rack to Mir's power supply. √âchantillons carried five technological experiments with applications to the Hermes shuttle program. Volkov and Chr√©tien then assembled the 240 kg (530 lb) experimental deployable structure (known as ERA). They attached a mount to handrails on the frustum linking the multiport docking unit to the small-diameter portion of the work compartment. After resolving problems with cables linking ERA to a control panel inside Mir, they attached the folded ERA structure to a support arm on the platform. The structure was designed to unfold to form a flat six-sided structure 1 metre deep by 3.8 metres across. From inside Mir, Krikalev commanded the structure to unfold, but to no avail. Volkov then kicked ERA, causing it to unfold properly. According to Krikalev, taking the ERA outside helped relieve the crowding problems. The EVA lasted 5 hours and 57 minutes. The crew took with them a cassette of Pink Floyd's newly released live album Delicate Sound of Thunder (minus the cassette box, for weight reasons) and played it in orbit; this was claimed by David Gilmour to have been the first rock music recording in space. The tape was left on Mir when the mission crew returned to Earth.

Sam Bonham, at the time running a machine shop, discovered a way to create what he called a \\"tougher than steel\\" epoxy. In 1968, Sam's future wife Mary persuaded him to sell his invention and he founded the J-B Weld Company. Sam died suddenly in 1989. He had commented before his death, \\"My life's dream is for J-B Weld to be all the way around the world, and for me to see an 18-wheeler load out of here with nothing but J-B Weld.\\" Within a year of his death, Mary had opened a European hub in London, internationalizing the J-B Weld Company and the distribution of the product.

It also resists shock, vibration, and extreme temperature fluctuations. J-B Weld can withstand a constant temperature of , and the maximum temperature threshold is approximately for 10 minutes.\\"Frequently Asked Questions\\", JBWELD.net, 2004, JBWELD-faq. J-B Weld can also be used inside a microwave oven, exposed to microwave radiation instead of infrared radiation (heat). The product is contained in 2 separate tubes: the \\"steel\\" (black tube of resin) and the \\"hardener\\" (red tube). Equal amounts are squeezed from both tubes and mixed. For the best bond, surfaces should be roughened (or scratched) with fine or coarse sandpaper. When first mixed, J-B Weld is subject to sagging or running (slow dripping), more so at warmer temperatures. After about 20 minutes the mixture begins to thicken into a putty that can be shaped (with a putty knife or wooden spatula). The mixture will set enough for the glued parts to be handled within 4‚Äì6 hours, but requires up to 15 hours (at cool temperatures) to fully cure and harden. Temperatures above shorten all these times. After the initial setting period of a few hours, a heat (e.g. from a heat lamp or incandescent light bulb placed near the bond) will speed the curing time. Before the initial setting period additional heat will induce a decrease in viscosity, which could result in sag or drip. J-B Weld can be used as an adhesive, laminate, plug, filler, sealant, or electrical insulator. When fully cured, J-B Weld can be drilled, formed, ground, tapped, machined, sanded, and painted.

One of Trask's contributions to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement was her founding of Na Koa Ikaika o Ka LƒÅhui Hawaii, a native Hawaiian non-governmental organization. Outside of Hawaii, Trask has worked with the United Nations to aid indigenous people from around the world seeking independence. She was a member of the Indigenous Initiative for Peace, helped author the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and was elected vice chair of the General Assembly of Nations of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. For seven years, she worked and studied under the guidance of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. She is the younger sister of activist and writer, Professor Haunani-Kay Trask.  Family  Mililani Trask was born on the island of Oahu in Honolulu, Hawaii and she has four siblings. Mililani's mother, Huanani Cooper was a school teacher and Huanani's mother, Iwalani Haia, worked for the Benevolent Societies on Maui while also engaging in efforts to raise awareness around the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani. Mililani's father, Bernard Trask was a lawyer. Mililani's grandfather, David Trask, was the first sheriff in Honolulu and was affiliated with the Territorial Legislature for 26 years. Her uncle, David Trask Jr. was a senator, a state representative and a leader of the Hawaii Government Employees Association. He was credited for bringing the power of collective bargaining to the union. Her other uncle, Arthur Trask, was a layer and political figure for the Democratic Party who was well known for his abilities as an orator and storyteller.  Office of Hawaiian Affairs  Mililani Trask worked for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs from 1998 to 2000 as a Trustee at Large. After the passage of the Rice Decision in 2000 gave non-Hawaiians voting access in OHA elections, Mililani lost her bid for reelection despite the fact that she won the 1998 election by a previously unprecedented number of votes cast by Hawaiians since the formation of OHA in 1978. In 2016 she ran for the Big Island OHA Trustee position on the grounds that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs needed to be more accountable to its beneficiaries. In press interviews and meetings on the topic, she has addressed the need for reform and a change in leadership. Although she did not win the 2016 election, she urged Native Hawaiians to vote. Mililani Trask has stated that, because the decisions made by OHA impact all of Hawaii, there needs to be more accountability and a focus on the most critical needs of Hawaiians in terms of education, housing, healthcare, incarceration, poverty and jobs instead of political campaigns. Mililani Trask also holds eighteen years of experience with ceded Hawaiian land trusts and affordable housing.

Feminist geography emerged in the 1970s, when members of the women's movement called on academia to include women as both producers and subjects of academic work. Feminist geographers aim to incorporate positions of race, class, ability, and sexuality into the study of geography. The discipline has been subject to several controversies. The geography of women The geography of women examines the effects geography has on gender inequality and is theoretically influenced by welfare geography and liberal feminism. Feminist geographers emphasize the various gendered constraints put in place by distance and spatial separation (for instance, spatial considerations can play a role in confining women to certain locations or social spheres). In their book Companion to Feminist Geography, Seager and Johnson argue that gender is only a narrow-minded approach to understanding the oppression of women throughout the decades of colonial history. As such, understanding the geography of women requires a critical approach to questions of the dimensions of age, class, ethnicity, orientation and other socio-economic factors.Seager, J., & Nelson, L. (Eds.). (2004). Companion to Feminist Geography. Williston, VT, USA: Blackwell Publishing. An early objection to the concept of geography of women, however, claimed that gender roles were mainly explained through gender inequality. However, Foord and Gregson argue that the idea of gender roles emerges from a static social theory that narrows the focus to women and portrays women as victims, which gives a narrow reading of distance. Instead, they claim that the concept of the geography of women is able to display how spatial constraint and separation enter into the construction of women's positions. In 2004, theorist Edward Said critiqued the idea of geographical spaces in such a context where actions on gendered practices of representation are fabricated through dominant ideological beliefs.Gregory, D. (2004). The colonial present. (pp. 18-19). Victoria: Blackwell Publishing. In response, feminist geographers argue that misrepresentations of gender roles and taken-for-granted feminist movements reveal that the challenges of the colonial present lie within the confinement of women to limited spatial opportunities. Therefore, feminist geographies are built on the principle that gender should be applied and developed in terms of space. Socialist feminist geography Socialist feminist geography, theoretically influenced by Marxism and Socialist feminism, seeks to explain inequality, the relationship between capitalism and patriarchy, and the interdependence of geography, gender relations, and economic development under capitalism. Socialist feminist geography revolves around questions of how to reduce the gender inequality caused by patriarchy and capitalism, and focuses predominantly on spatial separation, gender place, and locality. Uncertainty regarding appropriate articulation of gender and class analysis fuels a key theoretical debate within the field of socialist feminist geography. For example, when analyzing married mainland Chinese immigrant women living in New York City, women remain the primary object of analysis, and gender remains the primary social relation. However, socialist feminist geographers also recognize that many other factors, such as class, affect women's post-migration experiences and circumstances. Socialist feminist geographers first worked primarily at the urban scale: Anglo-American feminist geographers focused on the social and spatial separation of suburban homes from paid employment. This was seen as vital to the day-to-day and generational development and maintenance of traditional gender relations in capitalist societies. Socialist feminist geographers also analyze the ways in which the effects of geographical differences on gender relations not only reflect, but also partly determine local economic changes. Judith Butler's concept of \\"citationality\\" explores the lack of agency surrounding the facilitation of the presence of women within the discipline of geography. Subsequently, feminist geographers conclude that whenever performative measures are taken to diminish women's rights in geographical space, surrounding conventions adapt to make it seem as the norm.McKenzie, J. (2001). Perform or Else : From Discipline to Performance. London, GBR: Routledge. Feminist geographies of difference Feminist geographies of difference is an approach to feminist geography that concentrates on the construction of gendered identities and differences among women. It examines gender and constructions of nature through cultural, post-structural, postcolonial and psychoanalytic theories, as well as writings by women of color, lesbian women, gay men, and women from third world countries. In this approach, feminist geographers emphasize the study of micro-geographies of body, mobile identities, distance, separation and place, imagined geographies, colonialism and post-colonialism, and environment or nature. Since the late 1980s, many feminist geographers have moved on to three new research areas: categories of gender between men and women, the formation of gender relations and identities, and the differences between relativism and situational knowledge. Firstly, feminist geographers have contested and expanded the categories of genders between men and women. Through this, they have also begun to investigate differences in the constructions of gender relations across race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexuality and nationality, paying particular attention to women who are positioned along multiple axes of difference. Secondly, to gain a better understanding of how gender relations and identities are formed and assumed, feminist geographers have drawn upon a broader extent of social theory and culture. Building upon this theoretical platform, feminist geographers are more able to discuss and debate the influence that post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories have on multiple identifications. Lastly, the difference between relativism and situated knowledge is a key area of discussion. Through these discussions, feminist geographers have discovered ways to reconcile partial perspectives with a commitment to political action and social change. Critical human geography Critical human geography is defined as ‚Äúa diverse and rapidly changing set of ideas and practices within human geography linked by a shared commitment to emancipatory politics within and beyond the discipline, to the promotion of progressive social change and to the development of a broad range of critical theories and their application in geographical research and political practice.‚Äù Critical human geography emerged from the field of Anglophonic geography in the mid-1990s, and it presents a broad alliance of progressive approaches to the discipline. Critical human geographers focus on key publications that mark different eras of critical human geography, drawing upon anarchism, anti-colonialism, critical race theory, environmentalism, feminism, Marxism, nonrepresentational theory, post-Marxism, post-colonialism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, queer theory, situationism, and socialism. Critical human geography is understood as being multiple, dynamic, and contested. Rather than a specific sub-discipline of geography, feminist geography is often considered part of a broader, postmodern, critical theory approach, that draws upon the theories of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler, and many post-colonial theorists. Feminist geographers often focus on the lived experiences of individuals and groups in the geographies of their own localities, rather than theoretical development without empirical work. Many feminist geographers study the same subjects as other geographers, but focus specifically on gender divisions.McDowell, Linda (1993) \\"Space, place and gender relations\\" in Progress in Human Geography 17(2) This has developed into concerns with wider issues of gender, family, sexuality, race, and class. Examples of areas of focus include: * Geographic differences in gender relations and gender equality * The geography of women (e.g. spatial constraints and welfare geography) * The construction of gender identity through the use and nature of spaces and places * Geographies of sexuality (queer theory) * Children's geographies Feminist geographers are also deeply impacted by and respondent to contemporary globalization and neoliberal discourses that are manifested transnationally and translocally. Feminist geography also critiques human geography and other academic disciplines, arguing that academic structures have been traditionally characterized by a patriarchal perspective and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the masculine bias of academic study.Moss, Pamela, 2007 Feminisms in Geography: Rethinking Space, Place, and Knowledges Rowman & Littlefield Publishers British geographer Gillian Rose's Feminism and Geography is one such sustained criticism that claims that the approach to human geography in Britain is historically masculinist. This geographic masculinization includes traditions of writing landscapes as feminine spaces‚Äîand thus as subordinate to male geographers‚Äîand subsequent assumptions of a separation between mind and body. Johnston & Sidaway describe such separation as \\"Cartesian dualism\\" and further explain its influence on geography:Johnston, R.J. & J. D. Sidaway. (2004). Geography and Geographers. London: Arnold, p. 312. Other feminist geographers have interrogated how the discipline of geography itself represents and reproduces the heterosexual male gaze. Feminist geographers such as Katherine McKittrick have asserted that how we see and understand space are fundamentally bound up in how we understand the hegemonic presence of the white male subject in history, geography and in the materiality of everyday space. Building off of Sylvia Wynter's theories of the racialized production of public and private space, McKittrick challenges ‚Äúsocial landscapes that presume subaltern populations have no relationship to the production of space‚Äù McKittrick, Katherine. Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2006. p. 92 and writes to document black female geographies in order to \\"allow us to engage with a narrative that locates and draws on black histories and black subjects in order to make visible social lives which are often displaced, rendered ungeographic.‚ÄùMcKittrick, x. McKittrick stakes claim in the co-articulation of race and gender as they articulate space, writing: ‚ÄúI am emphasizing here that racism and sexism are not simply bodily or identity-based; racism and sexism are also spatial acts and illustrate black women's geographic experiences and knowledges as they are made possible through domination.‚ÄùMcKittrick, xviii Moreover, many feminist geographers have critiqued human geography for centering masculine knowledge emphasizing ‚Äúobjective‚Äù knowledge, arguing instead for the use of situated knowledge which understands both observation and analysis as being rooted in partial objectivity. Challenges of feminist geography Linda McDowell and Joanne P. Sharp, both foundational feminist geographers and scholars, describe the struggle of gaining recognition in academia, saying that ‚Äú[it has been] a long struggle to gain recognition within geography as a discipline that gender relations are a central organizing feature both of the material and symbolic worlds and of the theoretical basis of the discipline.‚Äô‚Äô Feminist geographers struggle in academia in a variety of ways. Firstly, ideas that originate from feminist discourse are often seen as commonsense once the wider field accepts them, thereby rendering geography that is explicitly feminist invisible. Furthermore, feminist geography is understood to be the only subfield of geography where gender is explicitly addressed, permitting the wider discipline to disengage from feminist challenges. Finally, within the field, some geographers believe that feminist practice has been fully integrated into the academy, making feminist geography obsolete. Challenges of feminist geography are also embedded in the subfield itself. The epistemology of feminist geography argues that the positionalities and lived experiences of the geographers are as central to scholarship as what is being researched. In this way, feminist geographers must maintain diverse identities to fully engage with the discipline. Linda Peake and Gill Valentine point out that, while feminist geography has addressed gender issues in more than twenty-five countries across the world, scholarship in the field of feminist geography is primarily conducted by white female scholars from institutions in the Global North. In this way, feminist geography faces not only barriers rooted in the academy but a lack of diversity in its own field. Feminist geographers draw upon a broad range of social and cultural theory, including psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, to develop a fuller understanding of how gender relations and identities are shaped and assumed. This has led to the fundamental rethinking of gender and the contradictions and possibilities presented by the seeming instability and insistent repetitions of gender norms in practice. The focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories has allowed feminist geographers to enter into dialogue with other strands of critical geography. This open dialogue, however, has also allowed tensions to build between geographers in the United States and geographers in Great Britain. Theoretical differences among feminist geographers are more obvious than in the past, but since 1994, the national differences between America and British geographers have begun to diminish as both parties pursue new directions. Controversies surrounding feminist geography In 2018, a leading journal in feminist geography entitled Gender, Place and Culture, was subject to a scholarly publishing hoax. Several authors disingenuously submitted a paper titled \\"Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity in Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon.\\" The paper proposed that dog parks are ‚Äúrape-condoning spaces‚Äù, and a place of rampant canine rape culture and systemic oppression against ‚Äúthe oppressed dog‚Äù through which human attitudes to both problems can be measured and analysed by applying black feminist criminology. The paper suggested that this could provide insight into training men out of the sexual violence and bigotry. The paper has since been retracted. The hoax has been criticized as unethical and mean-spirited, as well as race-baiting and misogynist, and critics of the hoax have suggested that the hoaxers misrepresented the process of peer review.

They were the successor of the Reber which was made from 1902 to 1903 by Reber Manufacturing. History In June 1903 James C Reber acquired the old Acme Machine Company's bicycle factory on the corner of Eighth and Elm Streets, Reading for US$47,000 at a receivership auction of the American Bicycle Company. Reber owned Reber Manufacturing, an automobile manufacturer, and stated that he was going to use the factory to manufacture automobiles. With the purchase of this site Reber also announced that Reber Manufacturing was changing its name to the Acme Motor Car Company. The company's directors were James C Reber, George D Horst, Jacob Noble, and John D Horst. The company had $200,000 capital. Acme exhibited its cars at the Chicago Automobile Shows from 1904 to 1907. The company was one of the founding members of the American Motor Car Manufacturers Association. =Frank Devlin= In November 1905 the company was taken over by Frank A Devlin of Devlin and Co, Chicago. Devlin owned Carson, Pirie, Scott, and Co one of America's largest jobbing houses. The purchase price was rumored to have been $250,000. The new owners intended to specialize in tourist cars (a touring car, limousine, and landaulettte) and delivery wagons. In October 1908 Devlin was killed in an automobile accident. =James C Reber= James C Reber went to work for the Keystone Wagon Works in February 1907 as General Manager on a 10-year contract, but they went into receivership in November sparking a lawsuit from Reber which he won. Reber went into poultry farming from that period until 1911, when he began a wholesale tobacco business. Reber died after a period of illness in 1933 aged 65. Demise =Receivership (1906)= The firm went into receivership in July 1906 with Daniell J Driscoll appointed receiver by the Court. The plant was kept in operation by the receiver to ensure a reasonable return to its debtors. The business was sold in February 1907 by the receiver to Herbert M Sternbergh for $65,881.12. Sternbergh held interests in the Duryea Power Company. The registered capital was reduced to $5,000. =Herbert Sternbergh era= Acme introduced its first 6-cylinder car, a touring car called the Sextuplet, at the New York motor show in September 1907. Acme also increased its involvement in motor racing through 1908. In 1909 it introduced a 10-year guarantee on its 6-cylinder models. In May 1909 an ocean to ocean endurance race, from New York to Seattle was proposed. Sternbergh strongly supported the idea, especially as it would draw attention to the poor condition of transcontinental roading. He hoped it would lead to significant improvements. =James Hervey Sternbergh= Acme sold its site and plant to J H Sternbergh for $72,100 in May 1911. Sternbergh in turn sold the Acme Motor Car Company and leased it plant to a New York consortium. The company's name was changed to SGV Sternbergh died in March 1913. Production When the company commenced production at the Elm Street plant it initially planned to make 4 to 6 vehicles per week, with the aim of increasing output 500 machines per annum. Leon Schermerhorn was appointed sales manager. By 1905 the company was employing 170 men. The plant in Elm Street was sold to F A Devlin of Chicago in June. In 1907 the company began to test vanadium steel alloy for use in its car parts. They were also using sprags, a bar inserted between the spokes of the wheels as an additional safety mechanism to hold the car in position if it was parked on a slope. By September 1907 Acme is thought to have made 520 cars since production began at its Elm Street plant. From April 1908 Krupp nickel- steel was used in construction of its transmissions. At that time they also used Eisemann high tension magnetos, Exide batteries, Prestolite gas tanks, and Neverout lamps. The company's output was quite low with only between 125-150 cars planned in 1909. Acme Models Types I, II, III are possibly Reber's. =Type IV Model A= Marketed as the Reber, the 1903 Acme was a tonneau powered by a 12 hp vertical-twin engine fitted to a three speed transmission and double chain drive.

All Acme automobiles came with a year's \\"absolute binding guarantee.\\" SGV (1910) Acme acquired parts from Lancia and made cars under the SGV badge. The model was similar in style to the Lancia Beta Torpedo. Newspapers of the time described the SGV as lightweight and mechanically efficient. The Lancia engine was used and a four speed transmission. The steering radius was noted being small, making the car maneuverable in city traffic. Motor Racing Acme entered a car in motor races in Atlanta City on the 26 to 30 April 1906. It was described as a new model that had just been tested. In a 1907 race at Reading the Acme car driven by Edward Lange was beaten by a Pullman driven be Robert Morton. In 1908 Acme created a new 6 cylinder 45 hp runabout capable of 76 mph, the Type XXI. The company entered the car in the 360 mile long race at Savannah on 18‚Äì19 March with Malcolm Newstetter replacing Ed L'Engle as its driver. It also announced that they intended to enter their cars in hill climbing and endurance races, but not races where chance plays a large part. The Acme car came third in a time of 6:47:05. It was beaten by an Italian Isotta Fraschini (6:21:20) and an Apperson (6:44:37). Acme cars competed in the Land's End Economy Run of the Long Island Automobile Club in early 1908. Following its good placing in the Savannah race, Acme entered a car in the 1908 Vanderbilt Cup race and began negotiations with Lewis Strang for its driver. The car was to be specially constructed for the race with a larger bore engine than normal. The same car was entered in the Grand Prix of the Automobile Club of America at Savannah with Leonard Zengle as its driver. A Type XIX won a hill climb at Wilkes-Barre and three events at the New York-based Jamaica speed trials in May or June 1908. A private owner J H Tyson entered a Type XXI driven by professional Strang in the 1908 Brighton Beach 24 hour race. Acme entered a Type XXV. The car was to be driven by Cyrus Patchke and was also entered in the Fairmount Park 200 mile race on 10 October. A Acme Type XXI came second in the race.

Recurring themes include abuse, mental illness, violence, revenge, betrayal, and conspiracy. In most of his novels, the protagonists do not win. His most popular works include I Am the Cheese, After the First Death, We All Fall Down, and The Chocolate War, all of which have won awards. The Chocolate War was challenged in multiple libraries.  Early life and education  Robert Cormier was born in 1925 in Leominster, Massachusetts, in the French-Canadian section of the town called French Hill. He was the second of eight children. His family moved frequently to afford rent, but never left his hometown. Even when he was much older and owned a summer home, it was only away from Leominster. In a few of his books, Cormier's hometown of Leominster became the fictional town of Monument, and its village of French Hill became Frenchtown. The nearby city of Fitchburg became Wickburg. Cormier attended St. Cecilia's Parochial School, a private Catholic school. He began writing when he was in the first grade and was praised at school for his poetry. He first realized his aspiration to become a writer in 7th grade, when he was encouraged by a nun to write a poem. He attended Leominster High School, graduating as the president of his class. As a freshman at Fitchburg State College, he had his first short story published when a college professor, Florence Conlon, without his knowledge, sent one of his stories to a national Catholic magazine The Sign for $75. Career Cormier began his professional writing career scripting radio commercials. He eventually became an award-winning journalist. Even though he became widely known, he never stopped writing for his local newspaper, the Fitchburg Sentinel. Cormier became a full-time writer after the success of his first adult novel for teenagers, Now and at the Hour (1960); others followed, such as The Chocolate War and After the First Death. He was concerned with the problems facing young people in modern society, which was reflected in his novels. He soon established a reputation as a brilliant and uncompromising writer. His awards include the Margaret A. Edwards Award of the Young Adult Services Division of the American Library Association, a lifetime award that recognizes a particular body of work that provides young adults with a window through which they can view the world, and which will help them to grow and understand themselves and their role in society. Cormier won the annual award in 1991, citing The Chocolate War; I Am the Cheese; and After the First Death. The Chocolate War has been challenged in various libraries and schools for its language and its depictions of sexual activity, secret societies, and anarchic students. Between 1990 and 2000 it was the fourth most frequently challenged book in the US, according to the American Library Association.  Awards  I Am the Cheese (1977), which was named to several contemporary book lists, won the 1997 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. That is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity. By that time Cormier had won the 1991 Edwards Award citing I Am the Cheese as one of three 1974 to 1979 books \\"taken to heart by young adults over a period of years.‚Äù The American Library Association determined that \\"Cormier's brilliantly crafted and troubling novels have achieved the status of classics in young adult literature.\\" Death  Cormier died On November 2, 2000 due to complications from a blood clot.

Post- nominal letters indicate that the individual holds a position, educational degree, accreditation, office, or honor (e.g. \\"PhD\\", \\"CCNA\\", \\"OBE\\"). Other examples include generational designations like \\"Sr.\\" and \\"Jr.\\" and \\"I\\", \\"II\\", \\"III\\", etc. Another used is S√±r (Spanish for Mr).  Post-nominal letters  = Academic = Academic suffixes indicate the degree earned at a college or university. These include bachelor's degrees (AB, BA, BA (Hons), BS, BE, BFA, BTech, LLB, BSc, etc.), master's degrees (MA, MS, MFA, LLM, MLA, MBA, MSc., MEng etc.), professional doctorates (JD, MD, DO, PharmD, DMin., etc.), and academic doctorates (PhD., EdD., DPhil, DBA., LLD, EngD, etc.) In the case of doctorates, normally either the prefix (e.g. \\"Dr\\" or \\"Atty\\") or the suffix (see examples above) is used, but not both. In the United States, the suffix is the preferred format (thus allowing differentiation between types of doctorate) in written documentation. = Honorary = Such titles may be given by: * a monarch (for example, K.B.E., a suffix granted to Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire); * a university (as in a LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) given in recognition of a person's life achievements rather than their academic standing); * a church or seminary, who may offer an honorary Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) to outstanding ministers or teachers.  Esquire  The style Esq. or Esquire was once used to distinguish a man who was an apprentice to a knight and is used for a man of socially high ranking. In the United States, Esq. is used as a professional styling for a licensed attorney. In the United Kingdom, it is largely obsolete but occasionally used by untitled males in social and business contexts. = Professional = Professional titles include Esq., often used for an attorney (but not necessarily) in the United States who has passed a state bar examination, and CSA (casting) and ASCAP, which indicate membership in professional societies. The suffix CA is used for individuals who have completed the requirements to become a Chartered Accountant. The suffix CPA is also used for individuals who have completed the requirements to become a Certified Public Accountant. Similarly, Chartered Financial Analysts use the suffix CFA. Sommeliers (restaurant wine professionals) who have passed the Master Sommelier exam use the MS suffix. Engineers that are certified as a Professional Engineer in his or her state will use the suffix P.E. (P.Eng in Canada), Certified Professional Geologists use P.G., Certified Professional Logisticians use CPL, and Chartered Engineers use CEng. Likewise, Registered Architects sometimes use the suffix R.A., or more often a suffix such as AIA or RIBA that refers to their professional society. Examination Office personnel within the United Kingdom who are registered with the Examination Officers' Association use MEOA. In the United States, professional archaeologists registered with the Register of Professional Archaeologists use the suffix RPA. Project managers that have obtained certification as Project Management Professionals from the Project Management Institute may use the suffix PMP after their name. Similarly, individuals who hold certifications in the field of information security - e.g. CISA, CISSP, and/or CISM - may use them as suffixes. The suffix PT is used by Physical Therapists to denote their state certification, but not to be confused with DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) which is a qualifying degree. UK physiotherapists prefer to use MCSP or SRP to denote membership to professional bodies. RN is used by qualified nurses as a suffix. Officers and enlisted in the United States Military will add an abbreviation of the service frequently to disambiguate seniority, and reserve status. For example, Captain Smith, USN (O-6), outranks Captain Jones, USMC (O-3). Red Seal certified trades people in Canada can use the Red Seal Endorsement (RSE) acronym. = Religious orders = Members of religious institutes commonly use their institute's initials as a suffix. For example, a Franciscan friar uses the post-nominal initials \\"O.F.M.\\", derived from the Order's name in Latin, \\"Ordo Fratrum Minorum\\" (Order of Friars Minor). Equally, a Viatorian priest uses the suffix \\"C.S.V.\\" from the name of his religious institute, \\"Clerici Santi Viatori\\", the (Clerics of Saint Viator). These initials are not considered by members of religious institutes as an equivalent to academic or honorary post- nominial initials, but rather as a sign of membership in a particular religious lineage, similar to the use of \\"Senior\\" or \\"Junior\\". = Ordering = In some English-speaking countries, the arrangement of post-nominal letters is governed by rules of precedence, and this list is sometimes called the \\"Order of Wear\\" (for the wearing of medals).  Generational titles  Generational suffixes are used to distinguish persons who share the same name within a family. A generational suffix can be used informally (for disambiguation purposes, or as nicknames) and is often incorporated in legal documents. = United States = In the United States the most common name suffixes are senior and junior, which are written with a capital first letter (Sr. and Jr.) with or without an interceding comma. In Britain these are rarer, but when they are used the abbreviations are Snr and Jnr, respectively. The terms Jr. and II can both be correctly used if a child's first, middle, and last names are identical to his or her parent's (current) names. When the suffixes are spelled out in full, they are always written with the first letter in lower case. Social name suffixes are far more frequently applied to men than to women (due to the common practice of women taking their husbands' surnames).Men's Names and Titles The Emily Post Institute, Inc. Retrieved 12 April 2015. Sons with a different middle name or initial may also be informally known as Jr. (e.g. Francis Wayne Sinatra, son of Francis Albert \\"Frank\\" Sinatra). Jr. or II can be used when being named after the father, however they are both pronounced differently; Jr. is pronounced as junior and II is pronounced as the second. Roman numeral suffixes can be used to name after other family members like an uncle, cousin, or ancestor (including grandfather or great-grandfather). For example, Quentin Roosevelt II was named for his late uncle, Quentin I. Similarly, a grandson of Henry Ford was named Henry II. (The name again skipped a generation with the birth of Henry II's grandson, Henry Ford III.) Historically, when child mortality was high, a child could be named for its deceased sibling (a necronym),https://www.genealogy.com/articles/research/35_donna.html with or without a suffix (such was the case of Salvador Dali). There is at least one known case of multiple siblings having the same name in modern times ‚Äì that of George Foreman's five sons, including eldest George Jr. and youngest George VI. The suffix III is used after either Jr. or II and, like subsequent numeric suffixes, does not need to be restricted to one family line. For example, if Randall and Patrick Dudley are brothers and if Randall has a son before Patrick, he may call his son Patrick II. If Patrick now has a son, his son is Patrick Jr. (or Patrick III; alternatively, Patrick II if Randall didn't have a son named Patrick II). As time passes, the III suffix goes to the son of either Patrick Jr. or Patrick II, whoever is first to have a son named Patrick. This is one way it is possible and correct for a Junior to father a IV. Another example involves President Ulysses S. Grant and his sons Frederick, Ulysses Jr., and Jesse. When Frederick's son Ulysses was born in 1881, Ulysses Jr. did not yet have a son named after himself. Therefore, Frederick's son was Ulysses III. Ulysses Jr.'s son, born afterwards in 1893, was Ulysses IV. Jesse's son Chapman was the father of Ulysses V, as neither Ulysses III nor Ulysses IV had sons named for themselves. There is no hard- and-fast rule over what happens to suffixes when the most senior of the name dies. Etiquette expert and humorist Judith Martin, for example, believes they should all move up, but most agree that this is up to the individual families.Emily Post Best Question Archive (For the week of 12 March 2007). Emily Post Institute. Although there are instances of daughters being named after their mothers and also using the suffix Jr. (such as Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Jr., Winifred Sackville Stoner Jr., and Carolina Herrera Jr.), or after their grandmothers or aunts with the suffix II, this is not common. Usually, the namesake is given a different middle name and so would not need a suffix for differentiation. Furthermore, once the woman marries, she would most commonly take the surname of her husband and thus do away with the generational suffix. The title Jr. is sometimes used in legal documents, particularly those pertaining to wills and estates, to distinguish among female family members of the same name. A wife who uses the title Mrs. would also use her husband's full name, including the suffix. In less formal situations, the suffix may be omitted: Mrs. Lon Chaney Jr. on a wedding invitation, but Mrs. L. Chaney or simply Shannon Chaney for a friendly note. Widows are entitled to retain their late husband's full names and suffixes, but divorc√©es may not continue to style themselves with a former husband's full name and suffix, even if they retain the surname. Juniors sometimes go by their first initials and \\"J\\" for Jr., regardless of middle initial. Examples include American football players Terrell Ray Ward Jr. (who goes by T.J. Ward) and Erick R. Manuel Jr., who is better known as E.J. Manuel. Common nicknames for a junior or II include \\"Chip\\" (as in \\"chip off the old block\\"); e.g., President James Earl \\"Jimmy\\" Carter Jr.'s second son James Earl Carter III goes by \\"Chip\\". Another is \\"Bud\\" (predominantly in the American South). Common nicknames for a III are \\"Trip(p)\\", \\"Trace\\", and \\"Trey\\" which denote that the name carrier is the third person to carry the name. Notable examples include Green Day drummer Frank Edwin \\"Tr√© Cool\\" Wright III, South Park co-creator Randolph Severn \\"Trey\\" Parker III, and Willard Carroll \\"Trey\\" Smith III, elder son of actor Willard Carroll \\"Will\\" Smith Jr. Another convention is for the elder member of a family to go by their first name, and the younger one to go by their middle name. Examples include George Virl Osmond and Olive Osmond, who went by George and Olive while their eponymous son and daughter go by the names Virl and Marie. Another example, although father and son had different middle names, is the case of Cuban evangelist Rafael Cruz, whose son, also with the given name Rafael, is a U.S. Senator who is known by a variant of his middle name, Edward \\"Ted\\" Cruz. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, the suffixes \\"Snr.\\" and \\"Jnr.\\" are rare, and not usually considered part of a person's name as such. Ordinal suffixes such as \\"III\\" are generally reserved for monarchs; however, the General Register Office has stated that, whereas it would normally reject a string of symbols or letters that \\"has no intrinsic sense of being a name\\" when registering a child, a suffix such as \\"III\\" would be accepted. Those who inherit a title of nobility do not use ordinal suffixes, but are distinguished from any ancestors with the same name by their position in the order of succession; for example Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington is thus distinguished from his father, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. = Other European countries = In French, the designations for a father and son with the same name are p√®re (father) and fils (son). In Portuguese, common designations are J√∫nior (junior), Filho (son), Neto (grandson), and Sobrinho (nephew). In many other nations, it is considered highly unusual or even inauspicious to give a son the same first name(s) as his father, removing the need for such suffixes. In Dutch, \\"sr.\\" and \\"jr.\\" are used socially rather than legally, but the system is not extended to \\"III\\" and beyond. Instead, Piet de Vries jr. will become Piet de Vries sr. upon the death of his father, if there is a grandson also named Piet to take on the junior title. Otherwise the suffix falls away.

The reign of Tiberius (until the removal of his minister Sejanus) was fraught with misfortune for the Jews. When the cult of Isis was driven out of Rome (19 CE.) the Jews also were expelled, because a Roman lady who inclined toward Judaism had been deceived by Jewish swindlers. The synagogues were closed, the vessels burned, and 4,000 Jewish youths were sent upon military service to Sardinia.

With the increase of the Jewish population of Rome, the Jews intensified their efforts to make converts among the Romans. Although the activity of Jewish missionaries in Roman society caused Tiberius to expel them from that city in 19 CE, they soon returned, and Jewish religious propaganda was resumed and maintained even after the destruction of the Temple.

While the historicity of the gospel accounts is questioned to some extent by some critical scholars and non-Christians, the traditional view states the following chronology for his ministry: Temptation, Sermon on the Mount, Appointment of the Twelve, Miracles, Temple Money Changers, Last Supper, Arrest, Trial, Passion, Crucifixion on Nisan 14th (, , Gospel of Peter) or Nisan 15th (Synoptic Gospels), entombment by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, Resurrection by God and Resurrection appearances of Jesus to Mary Magdalene and other women (, ), Simon Peter (), and others, (), Great Commission, Ascension, Second Coming Prophecy to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment, and establishment of the Kingdom of God and the Messianic Age. Apostolic Age Shortly after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Nisan 14 or 15), the Jerusalem church is founded as the first Christian church with about 120 Jews and Jewish Proselytes (), followed by Pentecost (Sivan 6), the Ananias and Sapphira incident, Pharisee Gamaliel's defense of the Apostles (), the stoning of Saint Stephen (see also Persecution of Christians) and the subsequent dispersion of the Apostles (, also ) which leads to the baptism of Simon Magus in Samaria (), and also an Ethiopian eunuch ().

Until then -- if one accepts Sejanus' heyday and the trouble caused by the census after Archelaus' banishment -- there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ...

Jackson made a significant contribution to the development of art in Canada, and was successful in bringing together the artists of Montreal and Toronto. He exhibited with the Group of Seven from 1920. In addition to his work with the Group of Seven, his long career included serving as a War Artist during World War I (1917‚Äì19) and teaching at the Banff School of Fine Arts, from 1943 to 1949. In his later years he was artist-in-residence at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario.  Early life and training  Jackson was born in Montreal, the son of Eliza Georgina (Young) and Henry Allen Jackson. As a young boy, Jackson worked as an office boy for a lithograph company, after his father abandoned his family of six children. It was at this company that Jackson began his art training. In the evenings, he took classes at Montreal's Monument-National. In 1905, Jackson worked his way to Europe on a cattle boat, returning by the same means and travelling on to Chicago. In Chicago, he joined a commercial art firm and took courses at the Art Institute of Chicago. He saved his earnings and, by 1907, was able to visit France to study Impressionism. In France, Jackson decided to become a professional painter, studying at Paris' Acad√©mie Julian under J. P. Laurens. Some of his most important artistic development was at the √âtaples art colony, which he first visited in 1908 with his New Zealand friend Eric Spencer Macky (1880‚Äì1958). Jackson painted his Paysage Embrum√© then and, to his surprise, it was accepted by the Paris Salon. Returning in 1912, he stayed with the Australian Arthur Baker-Clack (1877‚Äì1955). From this period date the Neo-Impressionist Sand dunes at Cucqhttp://visipix.dynalias.com/newsgroups/newsgroups/view_pic.php?ng=fine_arts&start;=40&keywords;=dune‚ü®=&pic;_size=standard&group;=0&searchmethod;=fulltext and Autumn in Picardy, which was bought by the National Gallery of Canada the following year.  Professional career  Red Maple (1914), by A. Y. Jackson When Jackson returned to Canada, he settled in Sweetsburg, Quebec, where he began painting works such as the Neo-Impressionist Edge of the Maple Wood. He held his first single artist exhibition at the Montreal Art Gallery with Randolph Hewton in 1913. Unable to make ends meet and discouraged by the Canadian art scene, he considered moving to the United States. However, he received a letter from J. E. H. MacDonald which changed his mind. MacDonald inquired about the Edge of the Maple Wood, which he had seen at a Toronto art show, informing Jackson that Toronto artist Lawren Harris wanted to purchase the painting if he still owned it. After the purchase, Jackson struck up a correspondence with the two Toronto artists, often debating on topics related to Canadian art. Jackson soon began visiting Toronto. Dr. James MacCallum convinced Jackson to relocate to Toronto by offering to buy enough of his paintings for one year to guarantee him a living income. He moved into the Studio Building which was financed by Lawren Harris, heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune, and Dr. James MacCallum. Harris, overseeing construction of the building, was too busy to concentrate on his own artistic endeavours and loaned his own studio space, over the Commerce Bank branch at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor streets, to the newly arrived Montrealer, A. Y. Jackson. The spot is now occupied by the 34-storey 2 Bloor West. Jackson was a welcome addition to the Toronto art scene, having traveled in Europe and bringing with him a respected ‚Äì though as yet not particularly successful ‚Äì talent. The canvas taking shape while he waited to move into the Studio Building, Terre Sauvage, became one of his most famous. In January 1914 the Studio Building was ready for occupation. Tom Thomson was another of the first residents of the building and shared a studio with Jackson for a year.Studio Building (Toronto) Like the other Group of Seven painters, Jackson embraced landscape themes and sought to develop a bold style. An avid outdoorsman, Jackson became good friends with Tom Thomson, and the duo often fished and sketched together, beginning with a trip to Algonquin Park in fall 1914. Inspired by Thomson, Jackson and the other painters who would one day be known as the Group of Seven undertook trips to Algonquin Park, Georgian Bay, Algoma and the North Shore. With the outbreak of World War I, Jackson enlisted in the Canadian Army's 60th battalion in 1915. Soon after he reached the front he was wounded at the Battle of Sanctuary Wood in June 1916 and found himself once more at √âtaples in the hospital there. While recovering from his injuries, he came to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook. He was then transferred to the Canadian War Records branch as an artist. Here, Jackson would create important pictures of events connected with the war.Gallatin, Albert. (1919). He later worked for the Canadian War Memorials as an official war artist from 1917 to 1919. On his return from WWI, Jackson again took up residence at the Studio Building. He removed Tom Thomson's easel, made by Thomson's own hand, from his studio and used it for all the subsequent pictures he produced in the Studio Building. Shortly after he returned from wintering on Georgian Bay, he learned that in his absence he had been included in an informal group of Studio Building artists, exhibiting for the first time, called the Group of Seven. The Beaver Hall Group was formed in Montreal in May 1920 with A. Y. Jackson as president. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel \\"with utter disregard for what has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. \\"Schools and 'isms' do not trouble us\\", he maintained, \\"individual expression is our chief concern\\". He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits, painting with artists such as Albert H. Robinson and others at various scenic locations, and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. It is through this kind of contact that he made lifelong friends of Beaver Hall artists Anne Savage, Sarah Robertson and Kathleen Morris. In 1938, Jackson visited the mine-site of the isolated Radium mine at Port Radium, Northwest Territories, in 1938. Jackson was a friend of prospector Gilbert LaBine, then the mine manager, and flew to the site with him, where he painted Radium Mine. Jackson left the Studio Building in 1955 with Lawren Harris mourning, in a letter from Vancouver, \\"Your moving from the Studio Building marks the end of an era, the one era of creative art that has the greatest significance for Canada... You were the real force and inspiration that led all of us into a modern conception that suited this country, and the last to leave the home base of operations.\\"  Group of Seven  Group of seven artists: Frederick Varley, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Fairley, Frank Johnston (artist), Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald In 1919, Jackson and six painter colleagues formed the Group of Seven. These artists were considered to be bold, because the Canadian wilderness had previously been considered too rugged and wild to be painted. Although his name is conventionally associated with this group, he would also remain something of a loner throughout his life. In 1925, he taught at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto; this was the only year that he missed his annual spring trip to Quebec. In 1933, Jackson, along with Harris, was a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters. Several members of the Group of Seven became members of this group, including A. J. Casson, Arthur Lismer and Franklin Carmichael. Like the other members of the Group of Seven many of his works began as tiny en plein air sketches in oil on hardboard.  Later years  In 1954 he was one of eighteen Canadian artists commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway to paint a mural for the interior of one of the new Park cars entering service on the new Canadian transcontinental train. Each the murals depicted a different national or provincial park; Jackson's was Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. Jackson moved to the Ottawa region in 1955, settling in Manotick. In his later years, he was often accompanied on his painting trips into the Ottawa Valley region, the Gatineau Hills, the Lievre River Valley and Ripond by friend, painter and former student Ralph Wallace Burton, and fellow painters Maurice Haycock and Stuart D. Helmsley. One such venture almost ended in disaster: \\"[I]n the 1950s, when Ralph and A.Y. were painting on the banks of the Ottawa River at Deux Rivieres, a bullet ricocheted off a rock where Jackson was sitting.\\" In 1958, he published A Painter's Country, an autobiography dedicated to the memory of Group of Seven member J. E. H. MacDonald, who \\"visualized a Canadian school of painting and devoted his life to the realization of it\\".Jackson, A. Y., A Painter's Country, Clarke, Irwin & Company, 1958, Frontispiece In 1964, Jackson submitted his own design during the Great Flag Debate. It was similar in design to the Pearson Pennant. In 1965, Jackson had a serious stroke that put an end to his painting career. He recuperated at the home of friend and painter Ralph Wallace Burton, and later moved to the McMichael Conservation Estate in Kleinburg, Ontario. Jackson died in 1974, over the Easter holiday in a nursing home in Toronto. He is buried on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection.Jackson, A.Y., 'A Painter's Country,' Clarke Irwin, 1976, Foreword by Naomi Jackson Groves His niece Naomi Jackson Groves published several books about his life and work including Two Jacksons (2000), an account of a shared trip through France and Germany in 1936.

Arthur Henry Adams had founded the Igranic Works in Bedford in 1899 to make electrical equipment. American-born Edward R. Hewitt had helped Sir Hiram Maxim to build a large steam plane in 1894. He later designed a \\"gas buggy\\" along the lines of an Oldsmobile and following agreement with Adams production of the car started in 1905 as the Adams-Hewitt. The Adams-Hewitt had a supposedly foolproof two, later three, speed-epicyclic transmission with a 1724 cc 10 hp single-cylinder engine located horizontally in the middle of the chassis driving the rear wheels by chain. Indeed, \\"Pedals to push, that's all\\" was used as the marque's slogan. Hewitt eventually returned to the United States to manufacture similar cars under his own name and his name was dropped from the British produced cars. 1907 Adams In 1906 a range of more conventional cars was introduced with shaft-drive and vertical engines and from 1907 sliding mesh gearboxes. One of these was supplied to the Emperor of Abyssinia. Models offered included two- and four-cylinder ones and one of the first British V-8s; this last had a 7270 cc 35/40 hp engine based on the French Antoinette model (an aero engine for which Adams were agents). The V-8 seems to have been plagued by crankshaft breakages. The last single-cylinder cars were made in 1909. In 1910, the company produced an advanced 16 hp four- cylinder model with front-wheel brakes; it came with compressed-air starting, tire-inflating, and jacking equipment. The \\"pedals-to-push\\" gear was still offered, as was a conventional four-speed transmission and an unusual planetary gearchange (three-speed), which was operated by a pedal that moved in a gate. A. H. Adams was lost on the Lusitania in 1915. The company stopped making cars in 1914 but the factory became Brookhirst-Igranic which eventually became part of Metal Industries, Limited.

In the Evening Standard Awards for 1955, Salad Days was given the Award for Most Enjoyable Show (although The Pajama Game won as Best Musical). The musical was produced by Denis Carey, with dances arranged by Elizabeth West, and with a cast that featured Dorothy Reynolds in a variety of roles, John Warner as Timothy and Eleanor Drew as Jane. Slade played one of the two pianos. The reviewer in The Guardian wrote: \\"There is no pointed satire, only a passable line of wit, but the effect is one of genuine high spirits and those who liked it on Thursday were ready to call it the gayest piece of entertainment since The Mikado. Others were heard to compare it to a children's party, meaning that they found the fun jejune, 'undergraduate,' and limited.\\"Hope-Wallace, Philip. \\"Another Present From Bristol \\"Salad Days\\" The Guardian, reprint in web.me.com, The Christine Finn Webshrine, 31 July 1954 It played to over 1.25 million people and grossed over $1.8 million.

History The present hall was built in 1825-30 to the designs of Robert Smirke for Sir Robert Sheffield (1786-1862). The Sheffield family had lived on the site since 1539 and the family's titles include Dukes of Buckingham and Normanby and Sheffield baronets. It replaced a previous 17th century building. John Sheffield became Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703. He built a fine mansion in London called Buckingham House. His son, the second Duke sold the house to George III and it is now known as Buckingham Palace. The house was extended and altered to designs by Walter Brierley between 1906 and 1908. The Sheffield family moved out of Normanby Hall in 1963. The hall is now in the care of the North Lincolnshire Council. The former 350 acre (1.4 km¬≤) estate around the hall is now a country park. Within it, there are a restored working Victorian walled garden, a farming museum, duck ponds, a deer sanctuary, a fishing lake, a miniature railway and a stableyard with the life-size Horse and Rider sculpture by Harold Gosney. Samantha Cameron, wife of the former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron and elder daughter of the eighth Baronet, grew up on the estate. Normanby Hall is also home to Party in the Park Festival, which takes place over the weekend of 19 and 20 July 2019, and features bands such as Toploader, tribute acts covering Little Mix and Gary Barlow, and local bands such as The Dirty Pitchers who cover Britpop hits.

He first appeared in 1978's Marvel Team-Up (vol. 1) #65, the creation of writer Chris Claremont and writer/artist John Byrne. The character is a combination of an evil genius and a hitman who carries out his assassinations via various elaborate traps, often referred to as Murderworld. Arcade's first intended victims were Spider-Man and Captain Britain but since Arcade's Murderworld games always leave the outcome up to chance the duo defeated Arcade and escaped with their lives. Over the years Arcade has targeted a multitude of Marvel heroes, often focusing on the X-Men and associated members of X-Factor, X-Force and Excalibur. In what is considered the \\"game changer\\" for Arcade, Avenger Arena, he managed to kidnap 16 super powered teens and forced them to fight each other for survival in his latest version of Murderworld; unlike most Murderworld schemes, this endeavor yielded several casualties. Arcade has appeared in a number of other Marvel properties outside of comic books, in X-Men: Evolution voiced by Gabe Khouth, and in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series voiced by Eric Bauza. He has also appeared as one of the main villains in a number of video games, including X-Men: Madness in Murderworld, Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Spider-Man: Edge of Time and Marvel: Avengers Alliance Publication history Arcade's first full appearance in Marvel Team-Up #66. Arcade was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Arcade first appeared in Marvel Team-Up, vol. 1, issue #65. The same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic Marvel UK title Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain #248).Marvel Team-Up #65 bears a cover date of January 1978. During this period, comic books published by Marvel Comics U.S.A. carried a cover date three months in advance of the actual date of publication. This means the actual publication date of Marvel Team-Up #65 was October 1977. The first issue of Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain to feature the Arcade storyline was published in England on November 8, 1977. Arcade has regularly been a guest villain in the majority of Marvel comics appearances he has made throughout the years since his introduction. His earliest encounter with the X-Men team occurred in the pages of Uncanny X-Men #122-124. Some time later he would encounter the team again, this time partnered with Dr. Doom in issues #145-147. Fictional character biography Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of murder, an underground funhouse of colorful deathtraps, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an amusement park, which he has dubbed \\"Murderworld\\". Arcade's back-story, up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to the present. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived much of his early life, depending on the telling, on a ranch in Texas, or in a mansion in Beverly Hills.All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update #1 At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, his allowance was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast estate. Arcade became a freelance assassin, traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as an amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named Miss Locke and Mr. Chambers, he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million, he would tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his targets and then watch as they are killed by a variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility. However, one of his \\"gimmicks\\" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him \\"If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!\\" Arcade laughs and replied, \\"Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance.\\"Uncanny X-Men #124 This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use deathtraps; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it. X-Men #122 (June 1979). Art by John Byrne and Terry Austin. Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of Spider-Man and Captain Britain,Marvel Team-Up #65-66. Marvel Comics. Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the X-Men, X-Factor, X-Force and Excalibur as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs.

She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the Crazy Gang) and discovers a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (though she is soon killed by an unrelated villain after her escape).Excalibur #4-5. Marvel Comics. In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tunes parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.Marvel Comics Presents #31-38. Marvel Comics. At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, Adam X and Shatterstar, who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.X-Force vol. 1 #29-30. Marvel Comics. The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival; his Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, which he discovers is infested with demonic beings, destroying all the obstacles in his sight and killing what he can. He then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned. Prior to a confrontation with Wolverine and Gambit, he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in a fit of rage. During the struggle, she wounded him with a carving knife and scarred much of his face. Over time, Arcade recovered from the physical trauma (presumably through facial surgery, though that has never been confirmed or even addressed in future stories) and even built a series of Miss Locke androids, virtually identical to her in every way, to replace his now-dead companion. In the three-part miniseries called \\"Claws\\", Arcade secretly creates a Kraven the Hunter robot, with the \\"assistance\\" of White Rabbit, in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and Black Cat. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the Savage Land.Wolverine/Black Cat: Claws #1-2. Marvel Comics. He is responsible for the destruction of Mutant Town, as part of a botched plan to kidnap X-Factor's Rictor.X-Factor vol. 2 #29-31. Marvel Comics.

In a shift from his usual modus operandi, Arcade is responsible for the \\"Avengers Arena.\\" He and a new associate named Miss Coriander abduct 16 teenage superheroes (several with ties to the Avengers, including several members of Avengers Academy) and strand them on a deserted island, re-modified as an elaborate Murderworld location, forcing them to fight to the death.Avengers Arena #1-18. Marvel Comics. The heroes Mettle, Red Raven Kid Briton, Juston Seyfert, Apex, and Nara do not survive this Murderworld encounter. (Nico Minoru of the Runaways is also killed, but the powers of her Staff of One resurrect her before the series' end) Months later, in the pages of Avengers Undercover, Arcade has cashed in on the success of Avengers Arena in the villainous underground nation of Bagalia. Several Murderworld survivors reunite and are convinced by fellow hero Cullen Bloodstone to kill Arcade at the Massacre Casino in revenge for his actions.Avengers Undercover #2. Marvel Comics. After a chaotic battle, Hazmat finally kills Arcade by destroying him with a concentrated radiation burst.Avengers Undercover #3. Marvel Comics. However, it was later revealed that Arcade was actually alive the entire time, imprisoned in a Masters of Evil cell (by Baron Zemo, with assistance from his now former comrade Ms. Coriander) and that Hazmat had in reality killed a clone made by members of the Masters of Evil; all revealed as an effort to coerce the heroes to turn against the Avengers and to join them.Avengers Undercover #7. Marvel Comics. After the Masters of Evil get away on a hijacked Helicarrier, it was shown that they had strapped Arcade to the front of it.Avengers Undercover #10. Marvel Comics.

Marvel Comics. In the prelude to the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Arcade and his company Arcade Industries assisted Kraven the Hunter in preparation for his upcoming hunt in Central Park. He started by having King Cobra, Rhino, Scorpion, Stegron, Tarantula, and Vulture be branded the Savage Six after they were apprehended for Kraven the Hunter by Taskmaster and Black Ant.Amazing Spider- Man Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics. When Arcade offered to test an automaton called the Hunter-Bot which contains Kraven the Hunter's physical characteristics, a Great Hunt participant named Bob used the VR Goggles to help test it out on Iguana. As Iguana attacked the Hunter-Bot, Bob channeled his anger from life failures and controlled the Hunter-Bot into using a special club which tore into Iguana's hide. When Arcade's Hunter-Bots are unleashed on the animal- themed superhumans, they managed to kill Bison, Gazelle of the Salem's Seven, and Mad Dog.The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.

Arcade's other impacts One of his old facilities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team X-Force.X-Force (Vol. 1) #40 They planned to use it as a base for crimefighting and even attended a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base remotely; X-Force barely escapes with their lives.X-Men Prime. Marvel Comics.

Madripoor Island-ruler Viper had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities and used it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons.Uncanny X-Men #448-449. Marvel Comics. On one occasion, Arcade experimented with what he called \\"Video Murder Machines\\", using a laser-like beam to abduct targets into a virtual environment where the victims would engage in deadly video game type scenarios. He intended to abduct the X-Men but accidentally captured the Micronauts with whom he was unfamiliar. The Micronauts (Arcturus Rann, Devil, Microtron, Nanotron) were able to eventually escape the virtual environments through Microtron's hacking into the system. The premise is inspired by the then recent 1982 Disney film Tron.Micronauts #45 (1982) Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Arcade has no superhuman powers but has absolute genius-level knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually when he appears to be captured, it turns out to be a robot. It is implied that he is an expert in conventional assassination, including ranged weapons, poison, and sabotage, all of which became elements in Murderworld. In Agent X #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medical skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.Agent X #5. Marvel Comics. In the Avengers Arena series, Arcade easily held back a cadre of 16 high- powered teenage superheroes seemingly without having to resort to mechanical or technological devices of any sort. He displayed the ability to create force fields, proved to be nearly invulnerable to energy blasts without the force field, controlled the motor functions of his 16 captives all at the same time, employed telekinesis, caused nearby matter to form into a throne for him to sit on, and effortlessly blew apart an almost invulnerable mutant with a simple gesture. These abilities though, are the result of technology provided by his henchwoman, Miss Coriander and can only be manifested within the confines of the Antarctica Murderworld. Associates * Miss Locke - Arcade's bodyguard and chief enforcer, is an expert in martial arts and gun combat. According to a flashback sequence in \\"Avengers Arena\\" #7 (2013), he murdered her in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade's mind, had tried to get \\"too close\\" to him by having an emotional and physical relationship. * Mr. Chambers - Arcade's henchman who has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld's system operations and maintenance. In several appearances he is the driver of a vehicle (disguised as a garbage truck) that would often capture Arcade's victims for transport back to Murderworld. * Miss Coriander - Arcade's latest henchwoman, she claims to be responsible for the vast array of powers that Arcade currently employs in his underground base seen in the \\"Avengers Arena\\" storyline. She appears to far surpass even Arcade in terms of knowledge about superhuman powers and how to counter them, and has gifted Arcade with a vastly powerful set of abilities that she has purloined from cutting-edge technology, exotic energy sources, and magical power. She later betrays Arcade after his supposed death and joined up with Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Arcade is a member of the Marauders, a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for Apocalypse, alongside Red, Dirigible, and the Owl.

Thanks to the determined leadership of the unbeaten Reyes, the Ghost Racers would eventually break free of their captivity and kill Arcade.Ghost Racers #1-4. Marvel Comics. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter gaming prodigy who invented a literal first- person shooter (which is called Murderworld).

This version is reimagined as Webber Torque, a high school gamer who calls himself Arcade and is tricked by Risty Wilde into believing the X-Mansion's security system computer console is an elaborate video game, which he uses to attack the X-Men which he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, he is not evil and apologizes for having played the \\"video game\\" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of the X-Men to be his schoolmates. * Arcade appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Eric Bauza. This version is an Asian mutant who can communicate with any type of technology, and is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Murderworld (referred to as Madland) for his own childish amusement, regardless of his action's possible consequences.

When escaping to the next level upon evading the LMDs of Red Hulk, Arcade unleashes a Sentinel and other robots. After Spider- Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots, Arcade gets angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine only. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Spider- Man, Captain America and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to cancel the codes. Arcade is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. =Video games= * Arcade was one of the main villains in X-Men: Madness in Murderworld. * Arcade appeared as the main villain in the 1992 video game Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge. * Arcade appears as a boss in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Quinton Flynn. This version is a member of Doctor Doom's Masters of Evil. Here, Arcade and Baron Mordo divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men Nightcrawler and Jean Grey. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt Doctor Strange's Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, the player can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides using the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also hires Shocker and Rhino to fight for him, uses mind control on Jean Grey to force her to attack the heroes, captures Blade and Senator Robert Kelly inside traps who are eventually freed by the heroes, and finally fights the heroes himself in a giant robot called his Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler and has taken him to Mephisto's Realm. His fate is unknown after his defeat. Arcade was also the villain on Deadpool's simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this is probably Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, but his borderline insanity makes this uncertain) and forces him to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in Black Panther's disc, where Arcade uses Murderworld to threaten him into giving him the secret codes to Wakanda's vibranium facility and having him face Dark Captain America. Storm's disc where she fights Hussar and the versus Mysterio simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against Bulldozer. Arcade has special dialogue with Mister Fantastic (at the Pinball Machine), and Sabretooth (in via Xbox 360 DLC and Gold Edition), Elektra (at the Disco Drop), Luke Cage (before the fight), Captain America (after the fight), and Deadpool (in his simulation disk). He also has a special dialogue with Magneto at the Disco Drop in Murderworld's Funhouse, which was never used in gameplay. * A Marvel 2099 version of Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the Nintendo DS version of Spider-Man: Edge of Time, voiced by Jim Cummings. He controls a cyber-arena game in the year 2099 called Murder Galaxy, to hunt down and destroy heroes in front of a live-audience. He seeks to challenge Spider-Man (who is stranded in the year 2099), but is defeated. * Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance. He is featured in the 15th Spec-Ops that is loosely based on Avengers Arena.

It was designed by Reginald Barton Adamson at the premises of the family haulage contract business. History The first car of 1912 was a small two-seater bullnosed cyclecar and had a 1,099 cc twin-cylinder or 1,074 cc four-cylinder engine made by Alpha of Coventry driving the rear wheels via a three-speed-and-reverse gearbox and a countershaft from which two V-belts went to the rear wheels. The engine could be started from the driving seat using a mechanical linkage. The channel section steel chassis was placed under the axles with suspension by semi-elliptic leaf springs. This arrangement allowed the car to have a low, sporting appearance. In 1914 the option of a larger four-cylinder version was added. A new model was announced in 1916 with 1330 cc four-cylinder engine, but few if any reached the public before car production ceased later that year. After the war a new company, R. Barton Adamson and Co, was formed and the 1916 four-cylinder car was resurrected with a Coventry-Simplex engine. In 1920 it cost ¬£375, falling to ¬£210 in 1924, but to put the price into perspective, in 1923 the Austin 7 was launched at ¬£165. Twin Car The final cars from 1923 were the \\"Twin-Cars\\" that were effectively two sidecars side-by-side with the driver in the off-side and powered by a choice of air- or water-cooled 9-horsepower 1078 cc V twin- cylinder Anzani engines with chain drive mounted between the two passenger units. Production numbers are not known.

The series sees newly divorced psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) leave behind his old life in Boston and relocate to his hometown of Seattle, Washington. He begins a new career as the host of his own radio call-in show, where he is assisted by his sassy, somewhat promiscuous producer, Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin). Frasier quickly learns from his anal retentive younger brother Niles (David Hyde-Pierce) that their disabled father Martin (John Mahoney) is no longer able to live alone, and Frasier reluctantly agrees to take him in (along with Martin's favorite recliner and his dog, Eddie (Moose). In order to help Martin with his physical therapy, he and Frasier ultimately hire a live- in housekeeper and therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a quirky British woman who believes she is psychic. The five quickly form a strange family unit, and Frasier comes to realize that even though his new life may not be what he planned, that does not mean that it is bad. Frasier was broadcast on NBC for eleven seasons, from September 16, 1993 to May 13, 2004. It has been in syndication since 1997. Although the actual episode titles were rarely formally displayed on-screen, each episode had two or three 'title cards', flashed up on a black backdrop during an episode (usually at the start of one of the three parts of the original US broadcast). These pertained to the particular sequences of the episodes themselves, often in ways which were not immediately obvious. Many referred to classical literature and cultural subjects, while a small percentage were also the overall titles of the episodes. 264 episodes of Frasier were broadcast. Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS DVD has released all 11 seasons on Region 1, Region 2 and Region 4 DVD. In addition, the series was made available for streaming through services such as Netflix and Amazon Video.

The family name, from the type genus Dipterocarpus, is derived from Greek (di = two, pteron = wing and karpos = fruit) and refers to the two-winged fruit. The largest genera are Shorea (196 species), Hopea (104 species), Dipterocarpus (70 species), and Vatica (65 species).Ashton, P.S. Dipterocarpaceae. In Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak, Volume 5, 2004. Soepadmo, E., Saw, L. G. and Chung, R. C. K. eds. Government of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Many are large forest-emergent species, typically reaching heights of 40‚Äì70 m, some even over 80 m (in the genera Dryobalanops, Hopea and Shorea), with the tallest known living specimen (Shorea faguetiana) 93.0 m tall. The species of this family are of major importance in the timber trade. Their distribution is pantropical, from northern South America to Africa, the Seychelles, India, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia.Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. The greatest diversity of Dipterocarpaceae occurs in Borneo.Ashton, P.S. Dipterocarpaceae. Flora Malesiana, 1982 Series I, 92: 237-552 Some species are now endangered as a result of overcutting, extensive illegal logging, and habitat conversion. They provide valuable woods, aromatic essential oils, balsam, and resins, and are a source for plywood. Classification The dipterocarp family is generally divided into two subfamilies: * Dipterocarpoideae: the largest of the subfamilies, it contains 13 genera and about 475 species. Distribution includes the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, India, Southeast Asia to New Guinea, and a large distribution in Borneo, where they form the dominant species in the lowland forests. North Borneo (Brunei, Sabah, and Sarawak) is the richest area in the world for dipterocarp species. The Dipterocarpoideae can be divided morphologically into two groups,Maury-Lechon, G. and Curtet, L. Biogeography and Evolutionary Systematics of Dipterocarpaceae. In A Review of Dipterocarps: Taxonomy, ecology and silviculture, 1998. Appanah, S. and Turnbull, J. M. eds. Center for International Forestry Research, Bogor, Indonesia. and the tribe names Shoreae and Dipterocarpeae are sometimes used, but genetic evidence so far does not support this division: **Valvate - Dipterocarpeae group (Anisoptera, Cotylelobium, Dipterocarpus, Stemonoporus, Upuna, Vateria, Vateriopsis, Vatica). The genera of this group have valvate sepals in fruit, solitary vessels, scattered resin canals, and basic chromosome number x = 11. ** Imbricate - Shoreae group (Balanocarpus, Hopea, Parashorea, Shorea). The genera of this group have imbricate sepals in fruit, grouped vessels, resin canals in tangential bands, and basic chromosome number x = 7. A recent molecular study suggests that the genus Hopea forms a clade with Shorea sections Anthoshorea and Doona, and should be merged into Shorea. * Monotoideae: three genera, 30 species. Marquesia is native to Africa. Monotes has 26 species, distributed across Africa and Madagascar. Pseudomonotes is native to the Colombian Amazon. A recent genetic study found that the Asian dipterocarps share a common ancestor with the Sarcolaenaceae, a tree family endemic to Madagascar.M. Ducousso, G. B√©na, C. Bourgeois, B. Buyck, G. Eyssartier, M. Vincelette, R. Rabevohitra, L. Randrihasipara, B. Dreyfus, Y. Prin. The last common ancestor of Sarcolaenaceae and Asian dipterocarp trees was ectomycorrhizal before the India-Madagascar separation, about 88 million years ago. Molecular Ecology 13: 231 January 2004. This suggests that ancestor of the dipterocarps originated in the southern supercontinent of Gondwana, and that the common ancestor of the Asian dipterocarps and the Sarcolaenaceae was found in the India-Madagascar-Seychelles land mass millions of years ago, and were carried northward by India, which later collided with Asia and allowed the dipterocarps to spread across Southeast Asia and Malaysia. The first dipterocarp pollen has been found in Myanmar (which at that time was part of the Indian plate) and it dates from the upper Oligocene.Morley, R.J. 2000. Origin and Evolution of Tropical Rain Forests. Wiley-Blackwell, NY. The sample appears to slowly increase in terms of diversity and abundance across the region into the mid-Miocene Chemical traces of dipterocarp resins have been found dating back to the Eocene of India. Subfamily Pakaraimoideae formerly placed here and native to the Guaianan highlands of South America, is now found to be more closely related the Cistaceae and is placed there in the APG IV (2016) Fossilized arthropods Some 52-million-year-old amber found in the Gujarat province, India, containing a large amount of fossilized arthropods, was identified as sap from the family Dipterocarpaceae.Sample, Ian. \\"Prehistoric creatures discovered in huge Indian amber haul\\" The Guardian, 25 October 2010.

Hypericin is believed to act as an antibiotic, antiviral and non-specific kinase inhibitor. Hypericin may inhibit the action of the enzyme dopamine Œ≤-hydroxylase, leading to increased dopamine levels, although thus possibly decreasing norepinephrine and epinephrine. It was initially believed that the anti-depressant pharmacological activity of hypericin was due to inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzyme. The crude extract of Hypericum is a weak inhibitor of MAO-A and MAO-B. Isolated hypericin does not display this activity, but does have some affinity for NMDA receptors. This points in the direction that other constituents are responsible for the MAOI effect. The current belief is that the mechanism of antidepressant activity is due to the inhibition of re-uptake of certain neurotransmitters. The large chromophore system in the molecule means that it can cause photosensitivity when ingested beyond threshold amounts. Photosensitivity is often seen in animals that have been allowed to graze on St. John's Wort. Because hypericin accumulates preferentially in cancerous tissues, it is also used as an indicator of cancerous cells. In addition, hypericin is under research as an agent in photodynamic therapy, whereby a biochemical is absorbed by an organism to be later activated with spectrum-specific light from specialized lamps or laser sources, for therapeutic purposes. The antibacterial and antiviral effects of hypericin are also believed to arise from its ability for photo-oxidation of cells and viral particles. Hypericin derives from cyclisation of polyketides. The biosynthesis of hypericins is through the polyketide pathway where an octaketide chain goes through successive cyclizations and decarboxylations to form emodin anthrone which is believed to be the precursor of hypericin. Oxidization reactions yield protoforms which then are converted into hypericin and pseudohypericin. These reactions are photosensitive and take place under exposure to light and using the enzyme Hyp-1.
