The Security Council was convinced of the need for a temporary measure to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people until the Iraqi government fulfilled the provisions of Resolution 687 (1991) and had distributed aid throughout the country equally. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the Oil-for-Food Programme for 180 days beginning at 00:01 EST on 1 December 2001. It reaffirmed the obligation of all countries of the arms embargo on Iraq and other resources unauthorised by the Council. It also stressed the need for Iraq to co-operate with previous Security Council resolutions and the need for a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the resolutions. The resolution also appealed for all countries to co-operate in the submission of applications and issue of export licences so that humanitarian aid could reach the Iraqi population as soon as possible. Additionally under Resolution 1382, the Council adopted a proposed Goods Review List (contained in Annex I of the resolution) for implementation from 30 May 2002. Items on the list would be subject to procedures contained in Annex II of the resolution and approval from the Sanctions Committee and United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission after an assessment had been made that such goods would not be used for military purposes.

Description and history The Wylie School is located in a rural setting, at the northern corner of Ekonk Hill Road (Connecticut Route 49) and Sandhill Road. It is a small single-story wood frame structure with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade has two matching entrances, framed by simple molding and topped by a cornice. The interior has two vestibules with closets between them, leading into a single large schoolroom with a raised section at the back. The building's utilitarian appearance, which is largely devoid of period stylistic embellishments, was probably more typical of Connecticut's 19th-century district schools. The interior has been furnished to give the appearance it might have had in the 19th century, although the fixtures are not original. The property includes a period privy. The school was built around 1855, on land given for the purpose by Henry Wylie, a local farmer. The school served the northern part of Voluntown until its closure at the end of the school year in 1939. From 1909, its teacher was Margaret Tanner, a teacher who served forty years in the school system, teaching several generations of children.

Claims had been made by Jewish survivors of the Holocaust that some of the pieces in the collection were Nazi plunder and should be returned to their rightful owners.  Biography  Leopold was born on 1 March 1925 in Vienna, and said in interviews that he had escaped conscription by the Nazis by hiding in a small village in a remote part of Austria. He earned his medical degree from the Medical University of Vienna. He started actively collecting art in the mid-1950s, with a major early focus being pieces by Egon Schiele, whose works were available inexpensively at the time. Other Austrian artists who he collected included Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka. The wonder he felt from seeing the art during a 1947 visit to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, a day he called \\"one of the most important days in my life\\", led Leopold to start a collection of his own. His first acquisition was a work by Friedrich Gauermann in 1947, which he paid for in exchange for tutoring.Staff. \\"Kunstsammler und Museumsdirektor Rudolf Leopold gestorben\\", Der Standard, 29 June 2010.

He was especially noted for bringing public attention and appreciation to the work of Schiele, whose nude drawings had been considered pornographic at times. Leopold wrote the 1973 illustrated book Egon Schiele, which was published by Phaidon Press and included 228 of the artist's work along with selected poems.Broyard, Anatole. \\"The Body-Brooding on Itself; Books of The Times Pensive as Much as Carnal Variety and Vitality\\", The New York Times, October 8, 1973.

The museum opened to the public in 2001. Egon Schiele: The Leopold Collection, a 1997 exhibit of pieces he had collected that was shown in New York City at the Museum of Modern Art drew attention because of the questioned provenance of two pieces included in the exhibit.

Dobrzynski's article led the Bondi family to write to MoMA requesting that it be held in New York. Dead City III was claimed by the heirs of Fritz Gr√ºnbaum, an artist who had been killed in 1941 at the Dachau concentration camp. Portrait of Wally, a painting of Valerie Neuzil, was claimed by the family of Lea Bondi Jaray, a Jewish art dealer from Austria who had been forced to flee to London to escape the Nazis. In January 1998, Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau served a subpoena on the Museum of Modern Art, demanding that the museum hold on to the two artworks in question and not return them to the Leopold Museum, a move that left many in the art world \\"shocked\\".Dobrzynski, Judith H. \\"Already, Schiele Case Is Reining In Art World\\", The New York Times, January 10, 1998. Accessed June 30, 2010. Leopold insisted that he had not dealt in looted art, saying \\"I'm not a Nazi and I'm not a Nazi profiteer\\". While Dead City III was ultimately returned to the Leopold Museum, Portrait of Wally has been the subject of a protracted court battle in U.S. federal and state courts with heirs alleging that Leopold knew that the painting had been Nazi loot when he purchased it. A 2008 study of the works in the Leopold Museum, commissioned by a group of Austrian Jews, found that at least 11 pieces of art there had belonged to victims of the Nazis and that Leopold had reason to believe that the pieces had been Nazi loot. He lived in the Vienna suburb of Grinzing in a modest home that he and his wife had lived in together for decades, which housed the many works of art that he continued to amass, even after the bulk of his collection had been purchased by the state. Leopold died at age 85 on 29 June 2010 in Vienna due to multiple organ failure. He was survived by his wife Elisabeth, as well as by a daughter, two sons and four grandchildren. Leopold was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1997.

Built in 1872, it is a good local example of Second Empire architecture, seeing a variety of civic and commercial uses. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1993. Description and history The Wheeler Block is located in the village center of Colchester, facing north across Norwich Avenue to the town green, near the junction with Hayward Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure in the Second Empire style, with a mansard roof, bracketed cornice, and gable-roof dormers with paired round-arch windows. A single-story porch extends across the front, with turned balusters and bracketed square posts supporting a low-pitch hip roof. An ell extends to the left of the main block. The interior is mainly the product of alterations made in the 1930s, when it was converted for use as town hall. The block was built in 1872 by Joshua Wheeler, a local merchant and Mason. The building originally housed commercial businesses in the ground floor and the local Masonic lodge above. The lodge, founded in 1781, was the first in the state east of the Connecticut River, and was a major social organization in the town, remaining an active force in civic events and occupying the building's upper floor until 1970. In 1910 Wheeler's daughter, Emeline Ransom, gave the building to the town, which used it as a schoolhouse until 1936, and as town hall until 1991.

Lego Sensors Dexter Industries produces a flexible motion sensor, a pressure sensor, a temperature sensors, a solar sensor, a GPS sensor, a XBee radio sensor, and others. =Flexible Sensor= The dFlex is the flexible sensor available from Dexter Industries. This sensor measures the bend of the sensor and records mechanical motion. dFlex is the newest product from Dexter Industries and is reviewed on several robotics blogs.http://lego-x.blogspot.com/2010/06/dflex- ready-for-action.html =Temperature Sensors= For the temperature sensors, there are two versions: an open version and a protected version. The sensors come with a two meter long cord.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2010/05/temperature-sensor-review- dexter.html The temperature sensors are thermistor-based; they are read as an analog sensor by the NXT. =Pressure Sensor= The dPressure sensor is made specifically for the Lego NXT Mindstorms system. It is capable of measuring up to 250 kPa (30 psi) and 500 kPa (70 psi) of pressure and gauge vacuum. =Solar Sensor= For the dSolar sensor, there are two 9V versions with different wattages: a 2W and a 4W model, both of which can power the NXT system or a user's robot. Dexter Industries also produces three additional adapters that relate to the solar sensor. The first is an optional capacitor bank that serves as a mini-battery; it provides continuous power for NXT projects if the system runs under a shadow or cloud. Second, there is an adapter that allows three solar panels to be plugged in simultaneously; this can provide up to 750 mA at 10 volts. The third adapter is a battery pack that can recharge the NXT battery pack utilizing solar power.https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/19/dsolar-panels-for-mindstorms-bring- green-power-to-your-lego-crea/https://gizmodo.com/5666024/inexpensive-solar- power-comes-to-lego-mindstorms-nxt =Global Positioning System (GPS) Sensor= The dGPS sensor provides GPS coordinate information to the user's robot and calculates navigation information. The sensor provides latitude, longitude, time, speed and heading to the user's project or robot. The sensor can also navigate to target coordinates. Since the LEGO NXT has limited computing capability and can't interface directly with a GPS module, the sensor includes a micro-controller and software that translates and checks the signal from the GPS, and also performs additional calculations and functions to aid navigation. The sensor can be used to build things like autonomous vehicles and mapping vehicles. Compatibility with Google Maps The dGPS output data is compatible with Google Maps.http://www.robotc.net/blog/?p=874http://www.rjmcnamara.com/2010/11/24/nxt- gps-sensor/ A miniature version of the Google Street View Car, which roams the streets to photograph them for Google Maps, was built by Mark Crosbie. He created his Street View car using Dexter Industries‚Äô dGPS sensor to record coordinates and a small camera to take pictures as the vehicle drives down a street. The pictures from the camera can then be uploaded into Google Earth along with the coordinates. Using a KML format file, the Lego NXT can upload saved pictures, coordinates and data into a personal computer. Crosbie's miniature Google Street Car can show the path that the car drove, and also shows pictures taken along the way in Google Earth. Educational Applications An educational workbook for the dGPS, entitled \\"Beginning GPS with NXT Robots\\" was written and published by James Floyd Kelly in June 2011.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2011/06/beginning-gps-for-nxt- robots.htmlhttp://www.pr.com/press-release/330911 This book includes instructional projects with questions and descriptions that teach students about mapping, robotics, programming and navigational terms.http://www.americasurf.info/index.php?qq=uggc%3A%2F%2Fgurakgfgrc.oybtfcbg.pbz%2F2010%2F11%2Fqtcf.ugzy \\"Beginning GPS with NXT Robots\\" is an introduction to the basics of GPS, including hands-on activities and tutorials on how to use the features of the dGPS sensor in NXT robotic projects. Geocaching According to Geocaching.com, \\"geocaching is a high-tech treasure hunting game played throughout the world by adventure seekers equipped with GPS devices. The basic idea is to locate hidden containers, called geocaches, outdoors and then share your experiences online.\\"http://www.geocaching.com/ By using the NXT and the dGPS sensor, the user is able to create a hand held GPS. The accompanying dGPS geocaching software takes GPS coordinates of a target in decimal-degrees, references them against the coordinates of the NXT's current position, and then calculates the distance the NXT is from its destination as well as the compass angle. By turning the NXT hand held GPS in the correct direction according to the embedded compass, the user can reach the geocache. The software also allows the user to record the latitude and longitude to plot the user's journey in Google Maps.http://dexterindustries.com/blog/2010/11/24/geocaching-for-einstein/ =NXTBee= These NXTBee is a high-speed long-distance wireless communication sensor which allows a Lego NXT to communicate with any other device with an XBee radio. The NXTBee sensor makes the Digi XBee radio compatible with the Lego Mindstorms NXT system. The XBee 802.15 communication protocol is the wireless communication standard used by many robots and for inter-device communication. There are two types of NXTBees; the basic NXTBee can send information up to 300 feet away, and the NXTBee PRO can transmit or receive information from up to 1.2 km away. The NXTBee utilizes a high speed RS-485 line for high speed communication. The NXTBee uses the XBee protocol which can utilize both point-to-point protocol (PPP) networking and mesh networking.http://dexterindustries.com/NXTBee1.html Users can design a remote controlled car using the NXTBee.https://www.engadget.com/2011/02/14/nxtbee- enables-long-distance-wireless-for-mindstorms-nxt-funny/ Swarm Robotics Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs Robotics Academy developed a multi- robot swarm robotics project using the NXTBee and the Lego Mindstorms system. Swarm robotics is a popular topic in robotics because it coordinates numerous small robots to accomplish larger tasks. Swarm robotics using the NXT and NXTBee might be capable of performing complex tasks such as PID auto- straightening, thermal imaging and even line tracking.http://www.azorobotics.com/News.aspx?newsID=1794 CMU's Robotics Academy also teaches how to use the NXTBee at its advanced program training courses.http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/content/lego/teacher_training/sub_pages/on_site_courses/sub_pages/sub_0_adv_tx.htm =Thermal Infrared Sensor= The Thermal Infrared Sensor reads the surface temperatures of objects. It is a non-contact thermometer and does not need to be in contact with an object to measure its temperature. The sensor can read object temperatures between -90 ¬∞F and 700 ¬∞F (-70 ¬∞C and +380 ¬∞C). The sensor can read temperatures more than double the amounts other NXT thermometers measure.https://dimastero.wordpress.com/tag/dexter-industries/ The sensor has a high accuracy of 0.5 ¬∞C and a resolution of 0.02 ¬∞C. The Thermal Infrared sensor reads both the ambient temperature and the surface temperature of the object that the sensor is pointed towards. The sensor uses I2C protocol to communicate with the Mindstorms NXT.http://dexterindustries.com/manual/thermal-infrared-sensor/ The sensor can detect a flame at a range of 2 meters.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2011/06/dexter-industries-thermal- infrared.html =dWIFI= Dexter Industries released the WiFi sensor called the dWIFI in November 2011.http://botbench.com/blog/2011/11/04/released- dexter-industries-wifi-sensor/ The dWifi release was accompanied by a week- long instructional blogging campaign aimed at walking novices through the process.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2011/11/wifi-week-dexter- industries.html The dWifi enables the NXT to transmit and receive information wirelessly between a computer and itself.http://botbench.com/blog/2011/04/14/wifi-because-we-can/ The sensor operates with standard 802.11 b/g/n access and can be configured to run on the vast majority of home networks. The Dexter Industries dWIFIs sensor connects to the NXT via the high speed communications Port 4 and is powered by an external 9V battery. The sensor comes with security options and is able to connect with WPA2-PSK, WPA, and WEP security networks.http://dexterindustries.com/manual/wifi/ Users of the dWifi can \\"tweet\\" information from the Mindstorms NXT to Twitter.http://blog.makezine.com/2011/11/15/add-wifi-to-a-mindstorms-robot/ In February 2012, a dWiFi user released instructions on how to expand the range of the dWifi by using a High Gain Ariel.http://www.rjmcnamara.com/2012/02/extending-nxt-wifi-sensors-range/ =Inertial Motion Unit= The Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) sensor combines an accelerometer and a gyroscope in one sensor. The sensor has six degrees of freedom, measuring x,y, and z axes for both the gyroscope and the accelerometer.http://dexterindustries.com/manual/imu-sensor/ IMU users can create a \\"Segway\\" NXT, which enables a robot to stand on its tires and move in 360 degrees around its axis.http://mattallen37.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/dimu- nxt-segway/ In conjunction with Lego Mindstorms' NXT Ultrasonic Sensor, the robot can be trained to simultaneously sense and avoid obstacles.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2011/10/segway-balancing-with-dexter- industries.html =dCompass= The dCompass is a compass sensor for Mindstorms NXT.http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-compass-sensor-from-dexter.html This compact sensor detects magnetic fields for navigation and works on all three axis.http://botbench.com/blog/2012/02/20/dexter-industries-dcompass/ Using a magnetic sensor, the sensor is able to measure the earth's magnetic field and returns a magnetic heading, telling you which way your robot is heading.http://dexterindustries.com/dCompass.html The device can be used without calibration or, if needed, can be calibrated with software to account for magnetic fields to deliver a highly accurate compass heading.http://nxttime.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/things-to-do-with-the- dcompass/ The sensor is supported in NXT-G, Labview, and ROBOTC. The sensor communicates with the NXT via I2C and can be placed on any port. Switches The dSwitch is designed to control household appliances.

She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2019. Background Bred in Kentucky by J. R. Betterworth, My Juliet was a bay mare who stood . She was out of the mare My Bupers, who never won a race. My Bupers later became famous as the dam of Snaafi Dancer, by Northern Dancer, who was sold for a then world record of $10.2 million. Her sire was Gallant Romeo, the multiple stakes winning son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Gallant Man. Gallant Romeo also sired Gallant Bob who earned 1975 Champion Sprint Horse honors. My Juliet was purchased as a yearling for just $7,500, then was privately purchased at age two by George Weasel, Jr. for $40,000. My Juliet was initially trained by Steve A. Long, Leland G. Ripley then again by Long. Both raced her from a base at Keystone Racetrack (now known as Philadelphia Park Racetrack). Eugene Euster took over during her three-year-old season.  Two-year-old season  She began her career in racing as a two-year-old in 1974, scoring four wins in five starts. She made her debut at Fonner Park in Grand Island, Nebraska, finishing second. She won the remaining four starts, including her first important win at Churchill Downs in the Pocahontas Stakes.  Three-year-old season  In the spring of 1975, My Juliet suffered the only three-race losing streak in her career when she finished second in the Ashland, third in the La Troienne and tenth in the Kentucky Oaks. On May 16, My Juliet's connections decided to run her in the what was then the de facto second jewel of the filly triple crown, the Grade II $65,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. That day in Baltimore, Maryland My Juliet beat a strong field of six stakes winners including favorite Gala Lil and Funalon. She completed the one and one sixteenth mile race on dirt in 1:44.00 under jockey Alan Hill. Just 13 days later, Long dropped her back in distance to six furlongs in the Miss Woodford Stakes. My Juliet ran the first quarter-mile in \\"an of unheard of\\" 20 seconds, and completed the half-mile in an \\"astounding\\" 43 seconds. Although she tired in the final furlong to finish fifth (beaten by just four lengths), she earned the respect of sportswriter Steve Haskin, who called her something special. My Juliet spent the rest of the year travelling between racetracks large and small from the East Coast to Nebraska. One of her biggest wins was the then Grade II Cotillion Handicap at Keystone. She also won the Dogwood Stakes at Churchill Downs, the Ak-Sar-Ben Princess at Ak-sar-ben, the Test Stakes at Saratoga, the Fair Haven Handicap at Monmouth Park, the Anne Arundel Handicap at Monmouth and the Next Move Handicap at Aqueduct. She ended the year winning nine of fifteen starts and established herself as one of the top sprinters of either sex racing in the United States.Bloodhorse.com - May 20, 2004 article titled Phlashback: A Phew Philly Phenoms My Juliet was rated at 123 pounds by the Daily Racing Form in their Free Handicap for three-year-old fillies, second to the great Ruffian.  Four-year-old season  My Juliet began her four-year-old campaign in California, finishing third in the Malibu Stakes on January 10, 1976.

She then won the Vagrancy Handicap for fillies and mares at Belmont Park but fractured a foreleg while doing so. Out of racing for more than five months, she came back to beat Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Bold Forbes and other males in winning the Vosburgh Stakes, also at Belmont Park.New York Times - October 31, 1976 article on the Vosburgh Stakes titled \\"My Juliet Beats Colts\\" At a time when there was only one Eclipse Award for horses of either sex in the Sprint category, My Juliet was voted the American Champion Sprint Horse of 1976. My Juliet returned to race at age five. She began her campaign on January 1 in California with a win against a field of females in the Las Flores Handicap at Santa Anita Park.Los Angeles Times - January 2, 1977 She went on to win the 1977 Endine Stakes at Delaware Park, again against a field of females, plus defeated males in winning both the Neshaminy Handicap at Keystone Racetrack and in the Michigan Mile And One-Eighth Handicap at Detroit Race Course. In the Neshaminy Handicap, she broke the track record by four-fifths of a second with a time of 1:14 for furlongs. Retirement My Juliet retired a winner of twenty-four races, of which seventeen were stakes. She won at 14 different racetracks in 10 states: Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Nebraska, Delaware and Michigan. As a broodmare in Kentucky, she produced ten named foals of which eight were winners. Her most notable foals were both by Alydar: * Tis Juliet (b. 1986) - won the Shuvee Handicap * Stella Madrid (b. 1987) - won the Frizette, Spinaway, Matron and Acorn Stakes. also a stakes-producing broodmare My Juliet died at age twenty-nine in November 2001.Philadelphia Inquirer - November 16, 2001 She raced for most of her career from a base at Philadelphia Park Racetrack (formerly known as Keystone Racetrack). In 1979, the track created the My Juliet Stakes and built the My Juliet Caf√© in the Picnic Grove in her honor. She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2019.

He studied theology at the Ruprecht-Karls- Universit√§t Heidelberg and law at the University of Berlin. In 1882, having passed the staatsexamen, he gained a government post in Kwidzyn. He was promoted to the office of district administrator of Tuchel in 1885 and became President of the city council of Danzig in 1891. From 1896 to 1902, he was mayor of Danzig and sat in the Prussian House of Lords. He was Oberpr√§sident of West Prussia from 1902 to 1905. In 1909, von Delbr√ºck joined the national government as Secretary of the Interior and Vice-Chancellor.

The site of the temple today The Temple of Artemis or Artemision (; ), also known less precisely as the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis (associated with Diana, a Roman goddess). It was located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Sel√ßuk in present-day Turkey). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.John Freely, The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts 2004, p. 148; Clive Foss, Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city, Cambridge University Press, 1979, pp. 86‚Äì89 & footnote 83. Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site. The earliest version of the temple (a temenos) antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, and dates to the Bronze Age. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed it to the Amazons. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under Chersiphron, the Cretan architect, and his son Metagenes. The project was funded by Croesus of Lydia, and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by Herostratus in an act of arson. The next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in Antipater of Sidon's list of the world's Seven Wonders: > I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for > chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, > and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and > the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted > to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \\"Lo, > apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\\".Antipater, Greek > Anthology IX.58. Location and history The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the Renaissance, as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck. The Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about south from the modern port city of ƒ∞zmir, in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of Sel√ßuk. The sacred site (temenos) at Ephesus was far older than the Artemision itself. Pausanias was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at Didyma.Pausanias, Description of Greece 7.7‚Äì8. He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians. Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis attributed the earliest temenos at Ephesus to the Amazons, whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (bretas) of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that Pindar believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. Tacitus also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons. Modern archaeology cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded. Before World War I, site excavations by David George Hogarth identified three successive temple buildings.D.G. Hogarth, editor, 1908. Excavations at Ephesus. Re- excavations in 1987‚Äì88 confirmed that the site was occupied as early as the Bronze Age, with a sequence of pottery finds that extend forward to Middle Geometric times, when a peripteral temple with a floor of hard-packed clay was constructed in the second half of the 8th century BC. noted some still earlier placements of stones, Mycenaean pottery and crude clay animal figurines, but warned \\"it is still to early to come to conclusions about a cult sequence.\\" The peripteral temple at Ephesus offers the earliest example of a peripteral type on the coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps the earliest Greek temple surrounded by colonnades anywhere. In the 7th century BC, a floodThe flood is dated by fragmentary ceramics: . destroyed the temple, depositing over half a meter of sand and flotsam over the original clay floor. Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a griffin and the Tree of Life, apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (xoanon) of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two metres between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4 m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \\"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\\".. Heraclitus deposited his book \\"On Nature\\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple. Second phase The new temple was sponsored at least in part by Croesus,see Kevin Leloux, \\"The Campaign Of Croesus Against Ephesus: Historical & Archaeological Considerations\\", in Polemos 21-2, 2018, p. 47-63 . who founded Lydia's empire and was overlord of Ephesus,Herodotus' statement to this effect is confirmed by the conjectural reading of a fragmentary dedicatory inscription, conserved in the British Museum (A Guide to the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum 84). and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes. It was 115 m (377 ft) long and 46 m (151 ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its peripteral columns stood some 13 m (40 ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the cella that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood cult statue was sculpted by Endoios,Pliny's Natural History, 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman Mucianus, who thought that the cult image by an \\"Endoios\\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and Pausanias notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image . and a naiskos to house it was erected east of the open-air altar. =Foundation deposit= The earliest known inscribed coinage, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: electrum coin of Phanes from Ephesus, 625-600 BC. Obverse: Stag grazing right, Œ¶ŒëŒùŒïŒ©Œ£ (retrograde). Reverse: Two incuse punches, each with raised intersecting lines. A rich foundation deposit from this era, also called the \\"Artemision deposit\\", yielded more than a thousand items, including what may be the earliest coins made from the silver-gold alloy electrum. The deposit contains some of the earliest inscribed coins, those of Phanes, dated to 625-600 BC from Ephesus, with the legend Œ¶ŒëŒùŒïŒüŒ£ ŒïŒúŒô Œ£ŒóŒúŒë (or similar) (‚ÄúI am the badge of Phanes‚Äù), or just bearing the name Œ¶ŒëŒùŒïŒüŒ£ (‚Äúof Phanes‚Äù). Fragments of bas-relief on the lowest drums of the temple, preserved in the British Museum, show that the enriched columns of the later temple, of which a few survive (illustration below) were versions of this earlier feature. Pliny the Elder, seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes. The temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of jewelry and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess's protection from punishment, firstly by Dionysus and later, by Heracles. =Destruction= In 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, Herostratus, who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term herostratic fame.Valerius Maximus, Memorable deeds and sayings, 8. 14. 5: \\"A man was found to plan the burning of the temple of Ephesian Diana so that through the destruction of this most beautiful building his name might be spread through the whole world.\\"Valerius Maximus, VIII.14.ext.5 For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and forbade anyone from mentioning his name; but Theopompus later noted it. In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of Alexander the Great (around 20/21 July 356 BC). Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple.Plutarch, Life of Alexander. Third phase Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding; the Ephesians tactfully refused, saying \\"it would be improper for one god to build a temple to another\\",https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D22 and eventually rebuilt it after his death, at their own expense. Work started in 323 BC and continued for many years. The third temple was larger than the second; 137 m (450 ft) long by 69 m (225 ft) wide and 18 m (60 ft) high, with more than 127 columns. Athenagoras of Athens names Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus, as sculptor of Artemis' main cult image.Pausanias, 10.38.6, trans Jones and Ormerod, 1918, from perseus.org. For Artemis Protothronia as a separate aspect of Ephesian cult to Artemis, see Strelan, R., Paul, Artemis, and the Jews in Ephesus, de Gruyter, 1996, p. 157. A drum from the base of a column from the 4th-century rebuilding, now in the British Museum Pausanias (c. 2nd century AD) reports another image and altar in the temple, dedicated to Artemis Protothronia (Artemis \\"of the first seat\\") and a gallery of images above this altar, including an ancient figure of Nyx (the primordial goddess of Night) by the sculptor Rhoecus (6th century BC). Pliny describes images of Amazons, the legendary founders of Ephesus and Ephesian Artemis' original prot√©g√©s, carved by Scopas. Literary sources describe the temple's adornment by paintings, columns gilded with gold and silver, and religious works of renowned Greek sculptors Polyclitus, Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon. This reconstruction survived for 600 years, and appears multiple times in early Christian accounts of Ephesus. According to the New Testament, the appearance of the first Christian missionary in Ephesus caused locals to fear for the temple's dishonor. The 2nd-century Acts of John includes an apocryphal tale of the temple's destruction: the apostle John prayed publicly in the Temple of Artemis, exorcising its demons and \\"of a sudden the altar of Artemis split in many pieces... and half the temple fell down,\\" instantly converting the Ephesians, who wept, prayed or took flight.Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D. 100-400 1984, p 26. Against this, a Roman edict of 162 AD acknowledges the importance of Artemesion, the annual Ephesian festival to Artemis, and officially extends it from a few holy days over March‚ÄìApril to a whole month, \\"one of the largest and most magnificent religious festivals in Ephesus' liturgical calendar\\".Rick Strelan, Paul, Artemis, and the Jews in Ephesus, 1996, 57‚Äì58 and footnote 83. The edict was made as a form of official apology and compensation; a senior Roman official had unwittingly offended the goddess by conducting business during one or more of her holy days. The political, economic and religious importance of Ephesian Artemis was undiminished, more than one hundred years after Paul's visit. In 268 AD, the temple was destroyed or damaged in a raid by the Goths, an East Germanic tribe;268: Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., History of the Goths (1979) 1988 p.52f, correlating multiple sources, corrects the date of the Gothic advance into the Aegean against the Origo Gothica, which scrambles the events of several years, giving 267 for this event. in the time of emperor Gallienus: \\"Respa, Veduc and Thuruar,Respa, Veduco, Thurar: these names are otherwise unknown (Wolfram 1988, p.52 and note 84). leaders of the Goths, took ship and sailed across the strait of the Hellespont to Asia. There they laid waste many populous cities and set fire to the renowned temple of Diana at Ephesus,\\" reported Jordanes in Getica.Jordanes, Getica xx.107. It is, however, unknown to what extent the temple was damaged. Whatever the extent of the injuries to the building, it appears to have been rebuilt or repaired, as the temple is noted to have been in use for worship during the rise of Christianity, and closed as a consequence of the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. However, the history of the temple between 268 and its closure by the Christian persecutions is not well known, and it is unconfirmed how big the damage of 268 was, and exactly which year it was closed by the Christians. Ammonius of Alexandria comments on the closure of the temple in his commentary of the Acts of the Apostles in the mid 5th century, in which he gives the impression that the closure of the temple had occurred in his living memory. The closure of the Temple of Artemis is assumed to have occurred sometime during the course of the early to mid 5th century, with the year of 407 as an early date. The closure of the temple was followed by the erasing of the name of Artemis from inscriptions around the city of Ephesus. =Final destruction= It is unknown how long the building stood after the closure of the temple by the Christians. At least some of the stones from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings.Clive Foss, Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city, Cambridge University Press, 1979, pp. 86‚Äì87 & footnote 83. A late medieval legend claims that some of the columns in the Hagia Sophia were taken from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, but there is no truth to this story. The main primary sources for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus are Pliny the Elder's Natural History,XXXVI.xxi.95 Pomponius Mela i:17, and Plutarch's Life of Alexander III.5 (referencing the burning of the Artemiseum). Cyril of Alexandria credited Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom with destroying the temple, referring to him as \\"the destroyer of the demons and overthrower of the temple of Diana\\". A later Archbishop of Constantinople, Proclus, noted the achievements of John, saying \\"In Ephesus, he despoiled the art of Midas\\". Although there is little evidence to support this claim. Rediscovery of the temple Reconstructive plan of Temple of Artemis at Ephesus according to John Turtle Wood (1877) After six years of searching, the site of the temple was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. These excavations continued until 1874. A few further fragments of sculpture were found during the 1904‚Äì1906 excavations directed by David George Hogarth. The recovered sculptured fragments of the 4th-century rebuilding and a few from the earlier temple, which had been used in the rubble fill for the rebuilding, were assembled and displayed in the \\"Ephesus Room\\" of the British Museum.The sculptures were published in the British Museum Catalogue of Sculpture, vol. II, part VI. In addition, the museum has part of possibly the oldest pot-hoard of coins in the world (600 BC) that had been buried in the foundations of the Archaic temple. Today the site of the temple, which lies just outside Sel√ßuk, is marked by a single column constructed of dissociated fragments discovered on the site. Cult and influence The archaic temeton beneath the later temples clearly housed some form of \\"Great Goddess\\" but nothing is known of her cult. The literary accounts that describe it as \\"Amazonian\\" refer to the later founder-myths of Greek emigres who developed the cult and temple of Artemis Ephesia. The wealth and splendor of temple and city were taken as evidence of Artemis Ephesia's power, and were the basis for her local and international prestige: despite the successive traumas of Temple destruction, each rebuilding ‚Äì a gift and honor to the goddess ‚Äì brought further prosperity. For an exposition of the mechanisms involved in these social, religious and economic advantages, see Stevenson, 2001, pp. 70‚Äì80 ff. Large numbers of people came to Ephesus in March and in the beginning of May to attend the main Artemis Procession. Artemis' shrines, temples and festivals (Artemisia) could be found throughout the Greek world, but Ephesian Artemis was unique. The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord Croesus, the Ephesians played down his contribution to the temple's restoration. On the whole, the Persians dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to Sardis and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.. When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.The intended offering might have included a divine statue of Alexander himself, or simply an inscription commemorating his subsidy as a gift to the Goddess, with himself as her particular protege. The Ephesians protested with great diplomacy, it being \\"inappropriate for a god to dedicate offerings to a god\\". See Strabo, Geography, 14.1.22, variously interpreted in Strelan, p. 80, and Gregory Stevenson, Power and place: Temple and identity in the Book of Revelation, de Gruyter, 2001, p. 79. Ephesian Artemis lent her city's diplomacy a powerful religious edge. Under Hellenic rule, and later, under Roman rule, the Ephesian Artemisia festival was increasingly promoted as a key element in the pan-Hellenic festival circuit. It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and Pliny describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of Apelles' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 35‚Äì93. In the Roman Imperial era, the emperor Commodus lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them., citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian Artemesia. Ephesian Artemis From the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess Artemis. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of Apollo, a virgin huntress who supplanted the Titan Selene as goddess of the Moon. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic cult imageThe iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien EPRO 35 (Leiden: Brill) 1973. that was carved of wood (a xoanon) and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like term, from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a mural crown (like a city's walls), an attribute of Cybele as a protector of cities (see polos). Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of Diana Efesina, Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italy The traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as Diana Efesia Multimammia and other related descriptions. This interpretation was rooted in Minucius Felix and Jerome's Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditional interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \\"breasts\\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors. Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls accepted in the 1980s by Walter Burkert and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies. The \\"breasts\\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on amber gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987‚Äì1988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th-century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the Geometric Period.. On the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined serpents or of a stack of ouroboroi, the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \\"Megabyzoi\\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the Galli. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls (korai).Strabo, Geographica, 14.1.23; sometimes the existence of a college is disputed and rather, a succession of priests given the title of \\"Megabyzos\\" is preferred. They may have been few in number; their existence in any form is also disputed; see Roller, Lynn E., In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele, University of California Press, 1999, p. 253, note 52 Xenophon, Anabasis, 5.3.7 A votive inscription mentioned by Florence Mary Bennett,Florence Mary Bennett, Religious Cults Associated with the Amazons (1912): Chapter III: Ephesian Artemis (on-line text). which dates probably from about the 3rd century BC, associates Ephesian Artemis with Crete: \\"To the Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has set up in votive offering [a statue of] the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the Light-Bearer.\\" The Greek habits of syncretism assimilated all foreign gods under some form of the Olympian pantheon familiar to them‚Äîin interpretatio graeca‚Äîand it is clear that at Ephesus, the identification with Artemis that the Ionian settlers made of the \\"Lady of Ephesus\\" was slender. Nevertheless, later Greeks and Romans identified her with both Artemis and Diana, and there was a tradition in ancient Rome that identified her with the goddess Isis as well.Nielsen, M. (2009). Diana Efesia Multimammia: The metamorphosis of a pagan goddess from the Renaissance to the age of Neo- Classicism. In Tobias Fischer-Hansen & Birte Poulsen, eds. From Artemis to Diana: The Goddess of Man and Beast. Museum Tusculanum Press. , 9788763507882. The Christian approach was at variance with the syncretistic approach of pagans to gods who were not theirs. A Christian inscription at EphesusQuoted in Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire AD 100‚Äì400 1984, ch. III \\"Christianity as presented\\" p. 18. suggests why so little remains at the site: > Destroying the delusive image of the demon Artemis, Demeas has erected this > symbol of Truth, the God that drives away idols, and the Cross of priests, > deathless and victorious sign of Christ. The assertion that the Ephesians thought that their cult image had fallen from the sky, though it was a familiar origin-myth at other sites, is only known at Ephesus from Acts 19:35: > What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a > worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down > from Jupiter? Lynn LiDonnici observes that modern scholars are likely to be more concerned with origins of the Lady of Ephesus and her iconology than her adherents were at any point in time, and are prone to creating a synthetic account of the Lady of Ephesus by drawing together documentation that ranges over more than a millennium in its origins, creating a falsified, unitary picture, as of an unchanging icon..

He was the lead singer and songwriter with the Scottish band Y'all is Fantasy Island as well as a short film maker and solo artist. Stafford was born in Sunderland, England. In the late 1980s, his family moved to Falkirk, where he still resides. Music Having released music as Y'all is Fantasy Island since 2005 as a solo project, Stafford added various members to augment his alternative folk sound. After independently releasing four albums ‚Äì In Faceless Towns Forever (2006), Rescue Weekend, No Ceremony and Infanticidal Genuflector (all in 2008) ‚Äì the group announced that they would be splitting up in March 2010. Stafford has released a number of solo albums including Awnings (2009), Miniature Porcelain Horse Emporium (2010) and mini album Music in the Mirabel (2010) which is a collection of covers and re-workings with tracks ranging from Daniel Johnston to Austrian Poet Georg Trakl. On these releases, Stafford experiments with vocal looping and textural soundscapes. He was quoted as saying \\"I'd been experimenting with looping and layering vocals before ‚Äì inspired, primarily, by Steve Reich's vocal arrangements on Music For 18 Musicians and Edinburgh artist Wounded Knee\\". In August 2011, Stafford issued the album, Build a Harbour Immediately which was produced by Paul Savage in Chem19 Studios in Hamilton. The LP was released to great acclaim in Scotland and made many end-of-year polls within the online blogging community. The album blended what Stafford had been experimenting with thus far: atmospheric acoustic folk and a capela experimentalism with an unusual sway for melodic, hook-laden pop choruses. In April 2012, Stafford issued a split 7\\" single with Phantom Band singer Rick Redbeard entitled \\"Now We're Dancing\\" / \\"Vanishing Tanks\\" on Gerry Loves Records and, in August, he produced (as well as contributing to) an EP cassette with the Falkirk outfit, Sweethearts of The Prison Rodeo, entitled \\"Welcome\\" / \\"Vessels Shifted\\". Stafford's side consisted of four minimal guitar instrumentals written for film. In 2013, Stafford announced that he was releasing his new LP Imaginary Walls Collapse via Song, by Toad Records and Kingfisher Bluez in North America. The LP was released on 20 July 2013 on 12‚Ä≥ vinyl and download. The set included contributions from Stafford regular (engineer and co-producer) Robbie Lesiuk, Siobhan Wilson, Anna Miles (Maple Leaves), Matt Brennan (Zoey Van Goey) and Ben Hillman (Over The Wall) and displayed a more propulsive, electric sound reflective of Stafford's intense live performances. The album featured heavily on many end-of-year lists in the UK music press/blogs in 2013 (Stafford was listed as number 51 in The List magazine's Hot 100 top cultural practitioners in Scotland). In March 2014, Imaginary Walls Collapse was long-listed for a Scottish Album of The Year Award, hosted by the Scottish Music Industry Association. Stafford also composed and performed original music for Alan Bissett's one-man show, What The Falkirk, which was commissioned by Falkirk Community Trust as part of their Creative Place Awards grant. The show took a humorous and bitter-sweet look at Falkirk history and life and toured the Greater Falkirk area in June 2015. The shows received positive reviews from the press, with Joyce McMillan in a review for The Scotsman, noting that Stafford's music was \\"Powerful\\". In March 2016, Edinburgh record label Song, by Toad issued Stafford's sixth solo album, Taser Revelations, on CD, white 12\\" vinyl and download. The album was recorded in the label's newly acquired warehouse space, The Happiness Hotel in Leith, Edinburgh, over four days in July 2014 and two days in October 2014. It was produced and engineered by regular collaborator Robbie Lesiuk, who used the warehouse's natural reverb in the large room, and also played a plethora of instruments including steel drums, bass, organ and mellotron. Other collaborators included Greggor Douglas who improvised synthesizer parts on a vintage Roland Juno and Omnichord and Anna Miles who provided vocal harmonies on three tracks. The album was completed at the end of 2014 but was postponed during the following year due to commitments with family and other projects. The album was released to almost unanimous acclaim from the online and print music press. Clash magazine commented, \\"(Stafford is) A songwriter of real depth, rich in understanding, in melodic virtuosity, his work has gradually built up into an imposing, heroic catalogue\\". Gigsoup wrote in their 4.5/5 review, \\"Scotland's gifted musician and lyrical genius does well to keep you engaged throughout the entire album. Each song is so distinct, all with the classic Stafford strong loops that demand your attention without overpowering the song itself\\". While Alan Morrison writing for The National noted, \\"Yet again, Adam Stafford has created one of the best albums of the year\\". In 2017, Stafford issued a collection of photography as a dual photobook and album entitled Reverse Drift. The photobook was a selection of mainly landscape and abstract photos that Stafford had been taking since 1999. The musical element was a download of a single 40-minute track improvised in one single take that incorporated a capela ambience, sampled drums and clarinet and synthesizers. In October 2017, Stafford and Lesiuk began work on another musical project that was to become the album Fire Behind the Curtain. Released on 4 May 2018 via Song by Toad Records, the largely instrumental, classically-leaning set was met with perhaps the greatest acclaim of Stafford's career. Working with The Pumpkinseeds and Modern Studies cellist and arranger Pete Harvey and a nine-piece choir, the album referenced Stafford's struggles with depression that had plagued him since youth. The record was issued on double-disc 12\\" gatefold vinyl and received ecstatic reviews from critics: in a 9/10 review, God is in The TV said the LP \\"may stand as perhaps the most stunning piece of art to have been released so far on Song by Toad‚Äù; a 5/5 review The Skinny magazine called the album ‚Äúa rich and haunting record of intelligence, beauty, depth and darkness ‚Äì it‚Äôs a monumental piece of work‚Äù. Elsewhere The Scotsman 's 4/5 review noted that \\"it's worth surrendering to its shifting soundscapes\\" and BBC Radio 6 Music's Nemone on Electric Ladyland stated FBTC was ‚ÄúAn absolute triumph of an album‚Äù. Film In 2009, Stafford directed the short film The Shutdown written by Scottish author and playwright Alan Bissett and produced by Peter Gerard. The film is the autobiographical story of Bissett's father who was badly injured during an industrial accident at the Petrochemical plant in Falkirk and about the effect that the incident had on his family. The film also explores Bissett's relationship with his hometown and the industry that surrounds it. Stafford shot the film in thirteen hours during one evening for around fifty pounds and used the local Petrochemical Plant's eerie and cinematic landscape for the film's striking visual aesthetic. The film went on to win the \\"Best Short Documentary\\" award at the San Francisco International Film Festival, \\"Best Short Documentary\\" at Palm Springs Film Festival, along with both the Jury and Audience prizes for Scottish Short Film at the Jim Poole Awards. At the end of 2010 the film also won \\"Best International Short Documentary\\" at The Belo Horizonte Film Festival in Brazil and Grand Jury prize for \\"Best European Short\\" at Festival Premier Plans in France in January 2011. The Shutdown was nominated for a BAFTA Scotland \\"New Talent Award\\" in the Factual category for 2010, and was nominated for the \\"Scottish Short Documentary Award\\" at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Stafford also composed the music for The Shutdown. The 23-minute track entitled \\"Hammer Eats Hoover\\" can also be found as the finale on Y'all is Fantasy Island's fourth album Infanticidal Genuflector (2008). The film has been selected in competition in excess of 30 International film festivals since 2009 and is the most successful British short film in terms of awards won, festivals attended and initial budget/return in the last decade. In 2010, Stafford directed the promotional video for fellow Scottish act The Twilight Sad's single \\"Seven Years of Letters\\" from their second album Forget the Night Ahead. The video won Video of the Year 2011 at The Scottish New Music Awards In 2013, Stafford completed his second short film, No Hope For Men Below, a poetic reinterpretation of The Redding Pit Disaster of Falkirk 1923, written in Broad Scots by local poet and author Janet Paisley. The film was mainly shot in a disused mine in Fife and on location in Wanlockhead and Falkirk. In February 2014, the film had its world premier at Glasgow Short Film Festival and was given a Special Mention by the Festival Jury, who stated: ‚ÄòNo Hope For Men Below uses extraordinary sound design, stark imagery, and poetry to create a unique cinematic experience. This lyrical, expressionist retelling of the Redding Pit disaster of 1923 not only captures the poignancy of the literal event, but explores a multitude of wounds deep within the national psyche.' It went on to be selected for Encounters Short Film Festival in Bristol and Indie Cork Film Festival in Ireland at the end of 2014.

The Japan foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2010 occurred in Miyazaki Prefecture, affecting cattle, swine, sheep and goats. A similar outbreak had occurred ten years earlier, in 2000. Located on the eastern coast of Japan's Ky≈´sh≈´ island, Miyazaki Prefecture plays a significant role in supplying top-quality Wagy≈´ cattle for the production of Wagy≈´ beef throughout Japan including Matsuzaka and ≈åmi.  History of the outbreak = 2000 outbreak = The first FMD case in Miyazaki in 93 years was identified on March 25, 2000. The following day, the infected cattle were slaughtered. The Miyazaki FMD Control Department announced on March 29 that the virus had been identified as serotype O. A further announcement on April 2 revealed that nine more cattle were infected, and that the first case could have been contracted from straw imported from China, but this was never confirmed. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) confirmed on April 3 that the first case was serotype O ME-SA PanAsia. On April 9, samples from 16 animals, showing no clinical signs of infection, underwent ELISA antibody testing; five days later, the test results were revealed to be positive, and the cattle were slaughtered. The MAFF announced a budget of 10 billion yen for affected farmers on April 27, and on May 10 Miyazaki Prefecture declared the disease eradicated. Overall, approximately 700 cattle were slaughtered in this outbreak. = 2006 = In December 2006, Hisashi Makizaki, an ex-trainee at Livestock Raising Examination Facility in Miyazaki Prefecture, stole approximately 40 straw type vials which contained cryo-preserved sperm from YASUHIRA, one of Japan's top stud bulls and a legend in Miyazaki. It was later reported that he had three accomplices (two stockbreeders, one office worker) involved in selling specimens both within and outside of Miyazaki Prefecture including Hokkaido, northernmost of the four main islands of Japan. They were charged with not only stealing 40 vials of 0.5 cc frozen bull semen in December 2006, but also stealing about 100 vials again in January 2007. Specimens were sold illegally for ¬•100,000 to ¬•150,000 per container without a Wagyu certificate, or ¬•200,000 with a certificate. The legal price with a certificate is normally ¬•5,000.

February  Agura Farm accepted a Korean trainee who was from Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do Zhou. The owner of this farm was reported to have committed suicide later.  March  A farmer in Tsuno town, Miyazaki, notified a veterinarian that one of his water buffalos had diarrhea. The water buffalos produced the milk used to make mozzarella cheese, one of the farm's main products. [Nishinippon Shimbun], and other newspapers reported on March 31 that the veterinarian requested the [Miyazaki Livestock Hygiene Service Center] for diagnosisÂÆÆÂ¥éÂÆ∂Áïú‰øùÂÅ•Ë°õÁîüÊâÄÊ§úÊüªË™≤„Å†„Åë„ÅåÂÆÆÂ¥éÁúå„ÅÆÂÆ∂Áïú„ÅÆÁóÖÊÄßÈëëÂÆö„Å®Ë®∫Êñ≠„Çí„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ„Åù„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´„ÅØÂπ¥Èñì2500È†≠„ÅÆÊ≠ª‰∫°Áâõ„ÅÆBSEÊ§úÊüª„ÇÑÈ≥•„Ç§„É≥„Éï„É´„Ç®„É≥„Ç∂„ÄÅÁÇ≠ÁñΩ„Å™„Å©„ÅÆÊ§úÊüª„ÇÇÂê´„Åæ„Çå„Çã but foot-and-mouth disease symptoms were not evident and no bacterium nor virus that might have caused the diarrhea were found. The diarrhea stopped without any causative agent being found. No diagnosis of FMD was made. The sample taken from the water buffalo on 31 March was later found to be FMD positive on 23 April after a DNA test conducted on 22 April (case 6). A source says four cases had been found infected by this time. The data on FMD released by Miyazaki prefecture and Japanese government show that samples of three animals had been collected by this point. It is said that because the symptoms were different from the one in 2000, it created a delay to confirm  April  Agura Farm was reported to have had more than 100 cattle with FMD at the beginning of the month, but this was not disclosed until later. On April 9, one cow was confirmed with having oral inflammation in Tsuno town. Junichi Aoki, a private veterinarian, asked Miyazaki Livestock Hygiene Service Center for authentication of symptoms. When a veterinarian and health officials from the Infectious Disease Prevention Department examined the animals, only one cow had symptoms. For a fast-spreading infectious disease such as FMD, this was insufficient evidence to confirm the disease. Consequently, this case was treated as a \\"wait-and-see\\" case. No public report was made. Details on what diagnosis was made are unknown. In this case, the cattle had slight dribbling saliva, an ulcerous scab, and fever. Poor appetite and fever were present only for a day. In addition, four days had already passed since the recovery from one-day fever. FMD cattle usually have blisters or heavy saliva dribbling. The incubation period for FMD is about 1 week in cattle. The veterinarian checked the farm daily until April 12, but no cattle with symptoms were reported. On April 16, another case was reported on the same farm. On April 17, after inspecting the farm, 2 more cases with the same symptoms were found. Authentication was started. According to the Prevention of Epidemics Guideline, Miyazaki Livestock Hygiene Service Center must be notified immediately when more than 2 cases are present. For that reason, Metro medias criticized the farm's delay for neglect. Some reports say four cattle were showing symptoms by May 31, but this has never been confirmed. On April 19, after the elimination of a possible diagnosis for Ibaraki disease and other diseases, the samples were sent to the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Epidemiological Research Team in Kodaira City, Tokyo for confirmation of FMD. It is possible the MAFF was notified at this point. April 20 (Day 0) the first case of FMD in Miyazaki Pref. was confirmed 10 years after the outbreak of the year 2000. The export of all Japanese Beef was banned. Miyazaki Prefectural government confirmed three suspicious cases in Tsuno Town and the AFF set up an FMD control and prevention department in Kasumigaseki, Tokyo. The Minister of AFF Hirotaka Akamatsu was nominated chief officer. He received a report about a huge shortage of Virkon-S, disinfecting solution, from Itsuki Toyama, (DPJ, Miyazaki Pref.) Miyazaki Pref. started to disinfect the area by setting up with transportation restrictions and locations for sterilization. No orders or directions by the Minister of AFF Akamatsu were given. On April 21, local government was confused because the Japanese government gave no instructions. There was not enough of the disinfectant prepared by a local agricultural union to be distributed to all the farmers. Miyazaki Livestock Improvement Association stopped producing the sperm straws which make up the major part of Japan's production (15,000 a year). The amount of stock in distribution would last for two months; remaining stocks for about one year. On April 22, the Vice-Minister of AFF, Yamada (DPJ), said at Congress, \\"I have heard about the Miyazaki situation just now.\\" The House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was held and the Minister Akamatsu granted emergency budget. No details were given. Promises to prevent economic damage from the disease were given. Ideguchi, a chief contact officer of Miyazaki Veterinary Medical Association observed the development of the clinical condition of the first case of FMD and analyzed how delay had been caused because the development was so different from textbook conditions.ÂÆÆÂ¥éÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ëæ≤Â≠¶ÈÉ®Áç£ÂåªË°õÁîüÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÂÆ§Web„Éö„Éº„Ç∏ Miyazaki JA's Economic Agriculture Union Association received sodium carbonate for stock buildings or surroundings. Also disinfectant to sanitize vehicles and shoes became available. Distribution to all JA in Miyazaki started. On April 23, the first case of FMD at Tsuno-town was diagnosed as FMD (type O). The Minister of AFF, Akamatsu, announced that the Government would compensate for the costs of spraying disinfectants. On April 25, it was confirmed that 4 more cattle were infected. 1,108 cattle would be slaughtered. The number became the worst in Japanese FMD history in the past 100 years (cf. in the UK, at least 10 million animals were slaughtered in 2001). Miyazaki Pref. temporarily shut down a portion (1.5 km) of Route 307 where many farms were suspected of being contaminated. On April 27, 5 pigs at Kawaminami town in Koyu county next to Tsuno town were reported to be highly contaminated. The Governor Hideo Higashikokubaru, Kohichi Nakamura (a Chairperson of prefecture committee), and Masaharu Haneda (Chairperson of JA Miyazaki Central Committee) requested that the Minister of AFF Akamatsu to take a further step for an emergency budget. In order to prevent further spread, an investigation into the cause of FMD was requested as well. Ebino-city was confirmed with infection. Since the city is located next to the border of Kagoshima and Kumamoto, this brought more alarm to the area. The final case in Ebino city was found May 13. No further cases were found. Governor Higashikokubaru requested the support of the Minister of AFF Akamatsu and the Secretary-General of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Sadakazu Tanigaki. The Minister Akamatsu did not respond to this. On April 28, the Secretary-General of LDP Tanigaki visited Kawaminami town in Miyazaki Pref. Tanigaki works as a chief of the FMD Control and Prevention Department of the LDP. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that having 3 FMD cases in 4 months was very serious in the light of recent outbreaks in Japan and Korea. In the report, the FAO referred to the possibility of FMD spreading onwards from Japan and Korea - as had happened in South Africa, England, and Europe in 2001. The economic damage would be in millions of dollars and international surveillance was to be heightened. (reference: May 21, May 25) The government held its second meeting of the ruling DPJ-led FMD Control and Prevention Department headed by the Minister of AFF Akamatsu. It was made clear that the cost of disinfection spray at all the borders to other prefectures would be compensated by funds from the national reserve. An increase in the number of workers such as veterinarians who assist with slaughter for further prevention was also announced. (Note: There existed two different FMD departments at this point. The opposition LDP had set up one owing to the central government's [DPJ government] slow progress in controlling the outbreak.) A cow confirmed infected in Ebino-city in Miyazaki was the 9th case and was located 70 km away from the first case. Based on the guidelines for prevention of livestock epidemics, the farmers were forced to obey restrictions for travel and transport. The contaminated farm was said to be associated with epidemiological research and this raised suspicions that the farm could have been contaminated by the virus as a result. The 10th infected case in Miyazaki Pref. was confirmed. The 1st FMD infected pig was found and confirmed. On April 29, the Vice-Minister of AFF Yamada (DPJ) travelled to Miyazaki Prefecture; he did not visit any farms nor did he meet with any producers. On April 30, 42 requests on the subject of FMD were made to the government from the headquarters of the FMD Control and Prevention Department. Yasue Funayama (the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) and the Vice-Chief Cabinet Secretary Takaharu Matsui cancelled the meeting on the day it was planned. In the evening, the Minister of AFF Akamatsu left on a trip to South America, and did not return until May 8. Seiichi Hamada (LDP Chief Deputy Chairman of Diet Affairs Committee) suggested to Minister Akamatsu that he should take domestic issues such as FMD seriously and cancel foreign travel. (article found on May 19) During Akamatsu's absence, Mizuho Fukushima (Consumer Administration/Chairman of Research Commission on Declining Birthrate Issues) was appointed to work on the outbreak as the State Minister in Charge of the AFF Ministry. The LDP requested that a committee should convene on June 7 to discuss FMD, but the government refused. Continuing infection was reported, 12 cases, 4,369 to be slaughtered. The government expanded the area for transportation restriction to 4 prefectures (Miyazaki, Kagoshima, Ohita, and Kumamoto). The DPJ revitalized the budget for the central livestock committee for the compensation of FMD affected farmers. Metro Media made it sound as if the government had sent provision for disinfectants to Miyazaki Prefecture, but none had been sent from the government at this time.  May = May 1 to 11 = Miyazaki Prefecture asked the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to send a disaster relief delegation to the prefecture.Âè£ËπÑÁñ´„ÅßËá™Ë°õÈöäÊ¥æÈÅ£Ë¶ÅË´ã=ÂÆÆÂ¥éÁúåÔºàÊôÇ‰∫ãÈÄö‰ø°Ôºâ Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama participated in a memorial service for Minamata disease (a poisoning caused by industrial mercury pollution) in Kumamoto Pref which is located adjacent to Miyazaki Prefecture.

On May 3, the 17th infected animal was confirmed. 9,000 cattle were due to be slaughtered. Bayer, Japan Ltd., provided 1,500 doses of Virkon disinfectant, but it was reported that 500 were seized by Ichiro Ozawa (DPJ's Chief Secretary) and the Foreign Affairs Minister Katsuya Okada. They gave the 500 doses of Virkon to the Chinese and Korean Governments. Mr. Ozawa appeared to have given another 500 doses of Virkon-S to the farmers in his home town, Iwate Pref, and only 500 were sent to Kyushu, where Miyazaki is located. During this turmoil, Korea imported 15,000 doses of Virkon from Germany via an Air Force plane. Iwate Nippou reported extra shipment of VirkonS to Ozawa's hometown. On May 4, the 19th suspected case was confirmed as being infected with FMD. 27,000 cattle were due to be slaughtered. Prime Minister Hatoyama visited Okinawa for Futenma on an issue concerning U.S. military bases. No visit to Miyazaki was made. Yasue Funayama, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries left to visit Denmark. Her return to Japan was on May 9. MAFF confirmed that the cases of 1,2,3,4,5,7,8 of the FMD in Miyazaki were similar to those widely spread in Korea, and also within Asia (O/JPN/2010). The 2nd case in Ebino city was found, 320 swine were killed at 3:45pm after the visual test result.

It was disclosed that he would again listen to what the Chief Secretary Ozawa had heard earlier in Miyazaki and would not visit the infected areas. The Yomiuri Shimbun (morning edition) issued an article on the outbreak in Miyazaki, which was the first written by the national media on the FMD in Miyazaki Pref. On May 10, the Ministry of AFF announced that they started taking necessary steps to export pork to Hong Kong with permission issued by HK authorities. Pork produced outside of unloading and unmovable restricted areas would only be exported. The Minister Akamatsu visited Miyazaki for the first time and had a meeting with the Governor Higashikokubaru, chief of local agricultural group, and chief of local government.

He carefully opposed the idea suggested by Mr. Hideo Higashikokubaru, Governor of Miyazaki Prefecture of the preventive killing of all livestock including healthy animals in the specific area in case of worse epidemic, saying \\"I'm afraid it's unacceptable to kill healthy livestock. We have to think carefully about infringing someone's personal property.\\" \\"When will it end?\\" - more than 80,000 killed in FMD epidemic As of today, 86 farms had FMD cases and the total number of cattle and pigs to be killed reached as many as 80,275. Mr. Akamatsu, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries who visited Miyazaki on 10 May 2010, emphasized that the national government will fully cover the loss of livestock, but farmers and people involved remain quite apprehensive about a spate of FMD cases. \\"We have no hope. We can't go on any longer.\\" The representative of agricultural groups tearfully complained to Mr. Akamatsu about the plight of livestock farmers. Mr. Hideo Higashikokubaru, Governor of Miyazaki Prefecture repeatedly explained that the financial situation of livestock farmers dropped drastically compared with the situation 10 years ago, and requested an all-round support from the Japanese Government. There is no comparison between the epidemic we face today and the outbreak 10 years ago where [a significantly smaller number of animals were slaughtered]. \\"One of the causes of this widespread damage is that the outbreak occurred in an area with overcrowding livestock farms,\\" the official of the prefecture pointed out. According to the source, more than a half of pigs in Kawaminami town which has the highest incidence of FMD cases has been decided to be destroyed, and the number of cattle to be destroyed will also reach a half of the town's herd. Japanese Self Defense Force is helping burying carcasses, but only about a half of the total cases finished burial. On May 14, the House of Representatives Committee on AFF was held (video available). The Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance proposed to ban import of livestock products from Japan (press-released on 17 May 2010). Regarding Miyazaki governor Higashikokubaru's remark on the possibility of slaughtering all livestock including the uninfected in a certain area, Hirotaka Akamatsu, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for Japan, said, \\"I am not sure about killing healthy animals. We need to consider property rights infringement carefully\\" and showed his disagreement.

The Democratic Party of Japan launched discussion of economic recovery payment for the livestock farmers who would lose all animals by slaughtering; 59,000 yen per cow and 12,000 yen per swine.

Chairman of Policy Bureau Shigeru Ishiba and Yasukazu Hamada, Deputy Chairman of LDP Diet Affairs Committee in the House of Councillors, criticized him. At the House of Representatives Financial Administration Committee, the Lower House member Toshiko Abe also criticized Akamatsu for his having left Japan ignoring the LDP's suggestion to stay and work on the disaster. The AFF Minister said he felt annoyed for being recognized as though he had walked off his job and said that the travel was not personal. Yasumasa Shigeno, Secretary General of the Social Democratic Party (the DPJ's coalition) expressed that Akamatsu was the first to be blamed for the outbreak and the Minister of State for Special Missions Mizuho Fukushima the second, and if their initial actions on the virus were inadequate, they must take the consequences.

Founded in 1852, it was bought by the Bibby Group in 1969 and then by Haverhill Meat Products (a J Sainsbury and Canada Packers joint venture) before becoming part of the Northern Foods Chilled Foods division in 1991. Palethorpes is now part of Pork Farms. History Eat Palethorpes Pork Pies Palethorpes Sausages Henry Palethorpe was born in 1829 in the Black Country. Setting up business as a butcher in Birmingham in the 1850s, he realised that the United States was flooding the United Kingdom market with cheap bacon and pork. Palethorpe decided to move into value-added meat processing products, specialising in sausages, with which he had success. The company moved to Tipton in 1896, claiming at the time to be the world's largest sausage producer. The company expanded during World War I, supplying canned meat products to the British Army. However, it lost market share during and after World War II, with restrictions on meat sales due to the amount of meat that was being imported; this gave an advantage to fishmongers such as Mac Fisheries, who boomed during the war. By the 1960s, with the development of supermarkets in the United Kingdom, the company was experiencing additional pressure. In 1967 Palethorpe's constructed a purpose built factory employing 400 people in Market Drayton, at a cost of ¬£650,000. This resulted in the closure of the Tipton factory in 1968, after which it was demolished and redeveloped as low- rise council flats. The high cost of building the new factory saw Palethorpes suffer financial difficulties and in 1969 the business was bought by the Bibby Agricultural Group. In 1980 the business again changed hands being bought by Haverhill Meat Products, a joint venture company owned equally by J Sainsbury and Canada Packers. In 1985 J Sainsbury produced the world's first Mycoprotein (later to become Quorn) product, a Savoury Pie produced at its Palethorpes factory https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/food-technology- magazine/issues/2001/july/features/developing-food-market The Company ceased manufacturing and selling Palethorpes branded products in 1986 in order to concentrate on its own label business. The Palethorpes brand name was reborn briefly in the mid-1990s as a value brand for Sainsbury's pies and pasties, although it is no longer used. Palethorpes became a part of Northern Foods, at that time the UK‚Äôs largest manufacturer of meat and savoury products, in 1991. It became part of the Chilled Foods division known as Premium Savoury Products. In January 2007 Northern Foods sold most of its Savoury Pastry business to Vision Capital; this included Pork Farms, Bowyers and Palethorpes. Now rebranded by Vision Capital as Addo Food Group, the Market Drayton plant presently employs 700 people. The company supplies foods to leading retailers to be sold under their own brand names. Customer companies include Asda and Sainsbury's.

Church Street in Jensen Beach, Florida. Built in the Gothic Revival style between 1910 and 1912 of site manufactured concrete blocks cast to look like stones, it was designed to serve the needs of local Protestants. Its pulpit and pews, which are still in use, were donated by Henry Morrison Flagler, the developer of the Florida East Coast Railway, whose mainline still runs through Jensen Beach less than a block west of the church.Thurlow, Sandra Henderson, Historic Jensen and Eden on Florida's Indian River, 2004, Stuart, Florida: Sewall's Point Company, pp. 167-168, Hutchinson, Janet, compiler, and Paige, Emeline K., editor, History of Martin County, 1975, pp. 263-267, reprinted 1987, Port Salerno, Florida: Florida Classics Library On June 7, 2010, the Jensen Beach Christian Church was added to the Martin County Historic Register by the Martin County Historic Preservation Board.Jensen Beach church to be nominated for Martin County historic register, by Zaimarie De Guzman, Treasure Coast Newspapers, May 28, 2010 updated June 5, 2010Martin County Historic Register and the Martin County Historic Preservation Board History In 1894 an interdenominational Protestant Sunday School was organized in what was then called Jensen. It met first at the Al Fresco Hotel, then the town hall and later the school. By 1898, the Episcopalians had left to form All Saints Episcopal Church at Waveland. In 1905 the Florida Baptist Board of Missions sent the Rev. E.E. Woodson to preach on the fourth Sunday of each month. Until he left for New Smyrna, the Rev. Harry H. Jones of the Union Congregational Church in nearby Eden also came down to preach on some Sundays and Wednesdays. In 1906 local pioneers, Ranson Ren Tilton and Gertrude Tilton, his wife, offered the land on Church Street for a church to be built. A Ladies Aid Society was formed in 1906 to raise money for the building. In 1910 the Tiltons deeded the property to the Ladies Aid Society and construction began. The Jensen Union Church opened in 1912. The Baptists later left to form First Baptist Church. The Rev. Mr. Jones returned in the 1920s to serve as pastor of the church until 1950. In 1932 the congregation became the Jensen Community Church, but it was not until 1938 that the land was deeded to it by the Ladies Aid Society. In 1962 the congregation by then known as the Jensen Beach Community Church moved to a new building on Skyline Drive. The Church Street building was sold to a new congregation, the Jensen Beach Christian Church.Thurlow, Sandra Henderson, Historic Jensen and Eden on Florida's Indian River, 2004, Stuart, Florida: Sewall's Point Company, pp. 167-168, Hutchinson, Janet, compiler, and Paige, Emeline K., editor, History of Martin County, 1975, pp. 263-267, reprinted 1987, Port Salerno, Florida: Florida Classics LibraryHistory of Jensen Beach Community ChurchJensen Beach church to be nominated for Martin County historic register, by Zaimarie De Guzman, Treasure Coast Newspapers, May 28, 2010 updated June 5, 2010 The exterior concrete blocks were originally not painted but were later painted white.

The hospital was founded in 1894 with three patient beds. Today, the hospital has 526 beds and is a designated Level II trauma center. The hospital places a large emphasis on innovation, and is the second-largest employer in the St. Joseph County, Indiana area. History Memorial Hospital was founded in a converted home in 1894 as Epworth Hospital and Training School. The hospital quickly outgrew this residence, and a four-story, 50-bed facility opened in 1901. Epworth Hospital continued to expand, and in 1945 it was renamed Memorial Hospital of South Bend. The hospital currently operates under a parent company, Memorial Health System, Inc., which includes Memorial Hospital, Memorial Health Foundation, Memorial Home Care, and Memorial Medical Group. All of these organizations are certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, except for Memorial Home Care, which is a for-profit home health organization. In March 2011, it was announced that Memorial Hospital was partnering with Elkhart General Hospital to merge the two healthcare systems. In 2012, it was announced that the new name of the combined healthcare system will be [./Https://www.beaconhealthsystem.org/ Beacon Health System]. Services Memorial Hospital is a designated Level II trauma center. Clinical services include inpatient and outpatient surgery, heart and vascular, newborn intensive care, pediatrics, childbirth, children's therapy, cancer, rehabilitation, sleep disorders, sports medicine, radiology, bariatrics, occupational health and clinical research. The hospital also provides patient and family support services, community outreach, and imaging services. In March 2011, Memorial Hospital purchased the inpatient assets of Madison Center, a local mental health facility, adding approximately 90 beds and starting an inpatient psychiatry program for both Adult and Pediatric patients in the new Memorial Epworth Center. Innovation Memorial Hospital places a large significance on innovation. According to the Journal of Healthcare Management, \\"...hospitals are experiencing many of the same competitive problems that plague other industries, such as the lack of differentiated services, a shrinking operating margin, and shortage of talent.\\" Memorial established a dedicated research and development center to address this. The organization partnered with numerous businesses outside of healthcare including 3M, Dupont, IDEO, Land's End, Motorola, Steelcase, Walmart and Whirlpool to develop standards for managing an in-house innovation program. Results of the organization's efforts include an innovation teaching lab and retail medicine clinics. Economic impact Memorial Health System employs around 3,800 people. This number makes it the second largest employer in the St. Joseph County, Indiana region. According to an economic impact study done by Quantech Research Associates, Memorial employees \\"...paid more than $5 million in state and local income taxes, in addition to more than $50 million in federal income taxes.\\" The hospital generated $368.5 million in revenues in 2008.

In May 1899 the town became a treaty port,Arthur Judson Brown, The Mastery of the Far East (C. Scribner's Sons, 1919), p. 143. and the Russian navy tried to buy land for its use, only to discover that the Japanese had already acquired some of the parcels they needed. The following November, there was an ugly confrontation between Russian and Japanese seamen, and by February 1900 there was a rumor that the Russians were demanding a lease of land for military-naval use: \\"A large Russian squadron including the battleships Rossiya, Donskoi, and Rurik sailed from Port Arthur and weighed anchor at Masampo threateningly.\\" The Japanese cabinet insisted that Russia not acquire any site that commanded the harbors of Koje Island, and Japan placed its fleet on a war footing. The tension was lessened by a secret agreement between Russia and Japan later that year, and the war scare was finally ended with the coming of the Boxer disturbances in June.Nish, The Origins of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 62.

His book on these techniques Grand Feu Ceramics was published in 1905 and helped spread his discoveries internationally. His influence is apparent in the types of glazes and approaches used in studio pottery in the twentieth century. Doat worked at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres from 1877 to 1905, and was one of the artists who introduced the Art Nouveau style. Starting in 1895, Doat began working in a house at 47 rue Brancas in the village of S√®vres. These studio ceramics were different from the pieces he produced at the S√®vres factory, which often had small heads or figures in a Renaissance style, placed on fields relying on glaze effects for interest.Plate, 1905, Metropolitan Museum of Art He now replaced the typical classical subjects: garlands, gods, and drapery with new forms derived from the Japonisme that influenced French art pottery in the 1890s. He also began producing organic forms based on gourds, and employing new, grand feu glazes he invented. Jason Jacques gallery Dish with cameo head, porcelain and stoneware, 1890 In 1909, Doat was one of the three international leaders of ceramics hired as a professor, along with Frederick Hurten Rhead and Adela√Øde Alsop Robineau, at the Art Academy and Porcelain Works, founded in a St. Louis suburb, University City, Missouri. Doat brought with him a collection of 172 examples of his work, which by this time was mostly in his vegetal style. He continued to work in this style in Missouri, making a limited number of shapes in molds, rather than being hand- thrown, with the examples differing greatly in terms of their individual glazing.Frelinghuysen, 288 However, he also taught his old p√¢te-sur-p√¢te style there, and some fine examples were produced by his students.Frelinghuysen, 290 He had a considerable influence on American art pottery.

It was usually called a \\"province\\" in Spanish sources, and its internal social organization is unclear. Spanish missionary sources put its location as roughly the northeastern quarter of Honduras, bounding on the Wanks River, the interior jurisdiction of Olancho, and the coast as far as Trujillo as well as the Bay Islands of Honduras. It appeared on the Dutch map of Montanus in 1671 with an alternate spelling of \\"Tiguzigalpa.\\"Cuddy (2007), p. 43 It was frequently confused in nineteenth- century travel literature with Tegucigalpa, the present capital of Honduras, and it is possible that both words share the same root. However, a study of the location information of the two places in the original sixteenth- and seventeenth- century sources shows that they are not in the same place, and are both mentioned, in different areas in the same texts. In his classic study of indigenous names in Honduras, Alberto Membre√±o wrote, \\"For a long time it was believed that Tegucigalpa was a corruption of Taguzgalpa and that it meant 'mountain of silver.' Tegucigalpa did not form a part of Taguzgalpa, and when this province was conquered, Tegucigalpa already existed. Don Pedro de Alvarado wrote Teguycegalpa in the repartimiento of 1536.\\"Membre√±o (1901) p. 101 Membre√±o gives the etymology of Taguzgalpa as \\"tlalli, 'earth', cuztic, 'yellow', calli, 'house', and pan, 'in'. This province is so called because there is a great deal of gold on its surface and in the sands of its rivers; and it refers to the tradition that the Mexicans went to Taguzgalpa to take that metal to Moctezuma.\\"Membre√±o (1901), p. 97 Early history The primary inhabitants of the region were the Pech, formerly known as Paya. Archaeological research, beginning in 1933, located evidence of social complexity in the Early Selin Period (300‚Äì600 CE). It was archaeologically connected to the Late Cocol phase at the time the Spanish arrived.Cuddy (2007), p. 52‚Äì74 At that time and from considerably earlier periods, the region was involved in a fairly extensive inter-regional trade by sea, reaching as far as Yucat√°n. Early accounts by Columbus, who passed the region during his fourth voyage (not mentioning Taguzgalpa by name) suggest a number of chiefdoms along the coast.Cuddy(2007), p. 44 The earliest accounts of the region suggest that a more hierarchically organized political structure may not have existed in the early sixteenth century, and that a larger, more hierarchically organized polity emerged in the late sixteenth century, possibly in response to the European threat. In his account of Honduras of 1544, Bishop Crist√≥bal de Pedraza mentioned that \\"Tagiusgualpa\\" was the location of a large and allegedly gold-rich city, in which the inhabitants ate on plates of gold.Cristobal de Peraza, \\"Relacion de Onduras i Igueras\\" in Collecion de documentos ineditos relativo al descumbrimiento... 2nd series (Madrid, 1898) vol. 11, pp. 407‚Äì408 This became the root of the legend of the \\"White City\\" (La Ciudad Blanca), a lost city in the jungle. Subsequent references to the province, however, suggest a semi-nomadic population with a fairly egalitarian social organization, and not a unified polity. Relations with the Spanish Taguzgalpa successfully resisted several attempts by the Spanish to conquer it in the sixteenth century. Plans and royal permission to conquer and settle Taguzgalpa were issued in 1545, 1562, 1577 and 1594, though none was successful. As a result of their failure to conquer the region, and the increasing competition with English traders, privateers and other interlopers in the region, Spain attempted, quite unsuccessfully, to convert the people in an effort to win their loyalty. In 1604 Franciscans began their attempt to \\"reduce\\" the area, including resettlement of people into larger missionary-supervised villages. These efforts, reinforced by those of other missionary orders, continued sporadically throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While they achieved some success, and at times used armed force, only a relatively small number of people were affected. The coastal regions of Taguzgalpa were lost to Spanish settlers at Trujillo, and then in the seventeenth century to raiding Miskito from today's Nicaragua.

As Android uses the Linux kernel, rooting an Android device gives similar access to administrative (superuser) permissions as on Linux or any other Unix-like operating system such as FreeBSD or macOS. Rooting is often performed with the goal of overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices. Thus, rooting gives the ability (or permission) to alter or replace system applications and settings, run specialized applications (\\"apps\\") that require administrator-level permissions, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user. On Android, rooting can also facilitate the complete removal and replacement of the device's operating system, usually with a more recent release of its current operating system. Root access is sometimes compared to jailbreaking devices running the Apple iOS operating system. However, these are different concepts: Jailbreaking is the bypass of several types of Apple prohibitions for the end user, including modifying the operating system (enforced by a \\"locked bootloader\\"), installing non-officially approved (not available on the App Store) applications via sideloading, and granting the user elevated administration-level privileges (rooting). Many vendors such as HTC, Sony, LG, Asus and Google explicitly provide the ability to unlock devices, and even replace the operating system entirely. Similarly, the ability to sideload applications is typically permissible on Android devices without root permissions. Thus, it is primarily the third aspect of iOS jailbreaking (giving users administrative privileges) that most directly correlates to Android rooting. Rooting is distinct from SIM unlocking and bootloader unlocking. The former allows removing the SIM lock on a phone, while the latter allows rewriting the phone's boot partition (for example, to install or replace the operating system).  Overview  Rooting lets all user-installed applications run privileged commands typically unavailable to the devices in the stock configuration. Rooting is required for more advanced and potentially dangerous operations including modifying or deleting system files, removing pre-installed applications, and low-level access to the hardware itself (rebooting, controlling status lights, or recalibrating touch inputs.) A typical rooting installation also installs the Superuser application, which supervises applications that are granted root or superuser rights by requesting approval from the user before granting said permissions. A secondary operation, unlocking the device's bootloader verification, is required to remove or replace the installed operating system. In contrast to iOS jailbreaking, rooting is not needed to run applications distributed outside of the Google Play Store, sometimes called sideloading. The Android OS supports this feature natively in two ways: through the \\"Unknown sources\\" option in the Settings menu and through the Android Debug Bridge. However, some US carriers, including AT&T;, prevented the installation of applications not on the Play Store in firmware, although several devices are not subject to this rule, including the Samsung Infuse 4G; AT&T; lifted the restriction on most devices by the middle of 2011. , the Amazon Kindle Fire defaults to the Amazon Appstore instead of Google Play, though like most other Android devices, Kindle Fire allows sideloading of applications from unknown sources, and the \\"easy installer\\" application on the Amazon Appstore makes this easy. Other vendors of Android devices may look to other sources in the future. Access to alternate apps may require rooting but rooting is not always necessary. Rooting an Android phone lets the owner add, edit or delete system files, which in turn lets them perform various tweaks and use apps that require root access. = Advantages = Advantages of rooting include the possibility for complete control over the look and feel of the device. As a superuser has access to the device's system files, all aspects of the operating system can be customized with the only real limitation being the level of coding expertise. Immediately expectable advantages of rooted devices include the following: * Support for themes, allowing everything to be visually changed from the color of the battery icon, to the boot animation that appears while the device is booting, and more. * Full control of the kernel, which, for example, allows overclocking and underclocking the CPU and GPU. * Full application control, including the ability to fully backup, restore, or batch-edit applications, or to remove bloatware that comes pre- installed on some phones. * Custom automated system-level processes through the use of third-party applications. * Ability to install a custom firmware (also known as a custom ROM) or software (such as Xposed, Magisk, BusyBox, etc.) that allows additional levels of control on a rooted device. = Related Concepts = Rooting allows the user to obtain privileged access to a phone. It does not allow a user to install a new OS or recovery image, and it doesn't allow a phone that locked to a certain carrier to be used on another one. Related operations allow these.  Bootloader Unlock  Bootloader unlocking is sometimes a first step used to root the phone; however, it is not the same as rooting the phone. Most devices come with a locked bootloader, which prevents users from installing a new bootloader. The bootloader run on device start-up and is in charge of loading the operating system on the phone. It is generally in charge of verifying that phone system information hasn't been tampered with and is genuine. Nonetheless, people still perform this operation, as unlocking the bootloader allows users to install custom ROMs. The first step to do this is to generally to set up OEM unlocking, and then to follow manufacturer specific instructions. Not all phones can be bootloader unlocked.  SIM Unlock  SIM unlocking allows a phone that is locked to a certain carrier to be used on a different carrier. The instructions vary per device and carrier, but this might be done by first requesting the carrier to unlock the phone or purchasing an unlock code online. = Methods = Some rooting methods involve the use of a command prompt and a development interface called the Android Debug Bridge (also known as ADB), while other methods may use existing vulnerabilities in devices. Due to similarly modeled devices often having a multitude of changes; rooting methods for one device when used for a different variant can result in bricking the device. \\"Systemless root\\" is a variant of rooting in which the underlying device filesystem is not modified. Systemless root uses various techniques to gain root access without modifying the system partition of a device. Some root applications may include a \\"hiding\\" function, which makes attempts to mask the effects and results of rooting, often by whitelisting certain applications for root, or blocking access to affected files. The distinction between \\"soft rooting\\" through a security vulnerability and \\"hard-rooting\\" by flashing a \`su\` binary executable varies from exploit to exploit, and manufacturer to manufacturer. Soft-rooting requires that a device be vulnerable to privilege escalation, or replacing executable binaries. Hard-rooting is supported by the manufacturer, and it generally only exposed for devices the manufacturer allows. If a phone can be soft-rooted, it is also inherently vulnerable to malware.  Rooting through exploits  The process of rooting varies widely by device, but usually includes exploiting one or more security bugs in the firmware of (i.e., in the version of the Android OS installed on) the device. Once an exploit is discovered, a custom recovery image that will skip the digital signature check of firmware updates can be flashed. Then a modified firmware update that typically includes the utilities needed to run apps as root can be installed. For example, the \`su\` binary (such as an open-source one paired with the Superuser or SuperSU application) can be copied to a location in the current process' PATH (e.g., \`/system/xbin/\`) and granted executable permissions with the \`chmod\` command. A third-party supervisor application, like Superuser or SuperSU, can then regulate and log elevated permission requests from other applications. Many guides, tutorials, and automatic processes exist for popular Android devices facilitating a fast and easy rooting process. The process of rooting a device may be simple or complex, and it even may depend upon serendipity. For example, shortly after the release of the HTC Dream (HTC G1), it was discovered that anything typed using the keyboard was being interpreted as a command in a privileged (root) shell. Although Google quickly released a patch to fix this, a signed image of the old firmware leaked, which gave users the ability to downgrade and use the original exploit to gain root access.  Rooting through manufacturer  Some manufacturers, including LG, HTC, and Motorola, provide official support for unlocking the bootloader, allowing for rooting without exploiting a vulnerability. However, the support may be limited only to certain phones ‚Äì for example, LG released its bootloader unlock tool only for certain models of its phones. The Google Nexus line of devices can have their bootloader unlocked by simply connecting the device to a computer while in bootloader mode and running the Fastboot protocol with the command \`fastboot oem unlock\`. After a warning is accepted, the bootloader is unlocked, so a new system image can be written directly to flash without the need for an exploit. = Difficulties = In the past, many manufacturers have tried to make non- rootable phones with more elaborate protections (like the Droid X), but exploits are usually still found eventually. There may be no root exploit available for new, or outdated phones.  Industry reaction  Until 2010, tablet and smartphone manufacturers, as well as mobile carriers, were mainly unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers had expressed concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and related support costs. Moreover, firmware such as OmniROM and CyanogenMod sometimes offer features for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium, such as tethering. Due to that, technical obstacles such as locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions have commonly been introduced in many devices. For example, in late December 2011, Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com, Inc. began pushing automatic, over-the-air firmware updates, 1.4.1 to Nook Tablets and 6.2.1 to Kindle Fires, that removed one method to gain root access to the devices. The Nook Tablet 1.4.1 update also removed users' ability to sideload apps from sources other than the official Barnes & Noble app store (without modding). However, as community-developed software began to grow popular in the late 2009 to early 2010, and following a statement by the Copyright Office and Librarian of Congress (US) allowing the use of \\"jailbroken\\" mobile devices, manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding CyanogenMod and other unofficial firmware distributions. Some manufacturers, including HTC, Samsung, Motorola and Sony Mobile Communications, actively provide support and encourage development. In 2011, the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware lessened as an increasing number of devices shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar to the Nexus series of phones. Device manufacturer HTC has announced that it will support aftermarket software developers by making the bootloaders of all new devices unlockable. However, carriers, such as Verizon Wireless and more recently AT&T;, have continuously blocked OEMs from releasing retail devices with unlocked bootloaders, opting instead for \\"developer edition\\" devices that are only sold unsubsidized and off-contract. These are similar in practice to Nexus devices, but for a premium and with no contract discounts. In 2014, Samsung released a security service called Knox, which is a tool that prevents all modifying of system and boot files, and any attempts set an e-fuse to 0x1, permanently voiding the warranty.  Legality  International treaties have influenced the development of laws affecting rooting. The 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty requires nations party to the treaties to enact laws against digital rights management (DRM) circumvention. The American implementation is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which includes a process for establishing exemptions for non-copyright-infringing purposes such as rooting. The 2001 European Copyright Directive implemented the treaty in Europe, requiring member states of the European Union to implement legal protections for technological protection measures. The Copyright Directive includes exceptions to allow breaking those measures for non-copyright- infringing purposes, such as to run alternative software, but member states vary on the implementation of the directive. = Australia = In 2010, Electronic Frontiers Australia said that it is unclear whether rooting is legal in Australia, and that anti-circumvention laws may apply. These laws were strengthened by the Copyright Amendment Act 2006. = Canada = In November 2012, Canada amended its Copyright Act with new provisions prohibiting tampering with digital locks, with exceptions including software interoperability. Rooting a device to run alternative software is a form of circumventing digital locks for the purpose of software interoperability. There had been several efforts from 2008 to 2011 to amend the Copyright Act (Bill C-60, Bill C-61, and Bill C-32) to prohibit tampering with digital locks, along with initial proposals for C-11 that were more restrictive, but those bills were set aside. In 2011, Michael Geist, a Canadian copyright scholar, cited iPhone jailbreaking as a non-copyright-related activity that overly broad Copyright Act amendments could prohibit. = European Union = The Free Software Foundation Europe argues that it is legal to root or flash any device. According to the European Directive 1999/44/EC, replacing the original operating system with another does not void the statutory warranty that covers the hardware of the device for two years unless the seller can prove that the modification caused the defect.  United Kingdom  The law Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 makes circumventing DRM protection measures legal for the purpose of interoperability but not copyright infringement. Rooting may be a form of circumvention covered by that law, but this has not been tested in court. Competition laws may also be relevant. = India = India's copyright law permits circumventing DRM for non-copyright-infringing purposes. Indian Parliament introduced a bill including this DRM provision in 2010 and passed it in 2012 as Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2012. India is not a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty that requires laws against DRM circumvention, but being listed on the US Special 301 Report \\"Priority Watch List\\" applied pressure to develop stricter copyright laws in line with the WIPO treaty. = New Zealand = New Zealand's copyright law allows the circumvention of technological protection measure (TPM) as long as the use is for legal, non-copyright-infringing purposes. This law was added to the Copyright Act 1994 as part of the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act 2008. = Singapore = Rooting might be legal in Singapore if done to provide interoperability and not circumvent copyright, but that has not been tested in court. = United States = The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act guarantees that consumers can unlock or let others unlock their phones. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) rooting was illegal in the United States except by exemption. The U.S. Copyright Office granted an exemption to this law \\"at least through 2015\\". In 2010, in response to a request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the U.S. Copyright Office explicitly recognized an exemption to the DMCA to permit rooting. In their ruling, the Library of Congress affirmed on July 26, 2010, that rooting is exempt from DMCA rules with respect to circumventing digital locks. DMCA exemptions must be reviewed and renewed every three years or else they expire. On October 28, 2012, the US Copyright Office updated their exemption policies. The rooting of smartphones continues to be legal \\"where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of [lawfully obtained software] applications with computer programs on the telephone handset\\". However, the U.S. Copyright office refused to extend this exemption to tablets, arguing that the term \\"tablets\\" is broad and ill-defined, and an exemption to this class of devices could have unintended side effects. The Copyright Office also renewed the 2010 exemption for unofficially unlocking phones to use them on unapproved carriers, but restricted this exemption to phones purchased before January 26, 2013. Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, argued in 2007 that jailbreaking is \\"legal, ethical, and just plain fun\\". Wu cited an explicit exemption issued by the Library of Congress in 2006 for personal unlocking, which notes that locks \\"are used by wireless carriers to limit the ability of subscribers to switch to other carriers, a business decision that has nothing whatsoever to do with the interests protected by copyright\\" and thus do not implicate the DMCA. Wu did not claim that this exemption applies to those who help others unlock a device or \\"traffic\\" in software to do so. In 2010 and 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office approved exemptions to the DMCA that allow users to root their devices legally. It is still possible to employ technical countermeasures to prevent rooting or prevent rooted phones from functioning. It is also unclear whether it is legal to traffic in the tools used to make rooting easy.

The company was acquired by Northern Foods in 1985, and passed through two other owners until the Trowbridge factory was closed in 2007. The brand is used by Addo Food Group for ranges of sausage rolls, pork pies and quiches.  History  In 1805, Abraham Bowyer established a grocers shop in Trowbridge. He became known for his meat products, in particular for his sausages, and eventually specialised in meat products. Merged with Wiltshire Bacon in Chippenham and Calne, and Harris in Calne, Bowyers became part of the Marsh Bodiner Group. This allowed a capital injection which resulted in the company's move into Innox Mill, Trowbridge in 1954. Acquired by Northern Foods in 1985, it was merged in 1990 with Palethorpes of Market Drayton into new company Pork Farms Bowyers. In 2001, the Bowyers and Palethorpes pork sausage business and brands were sold to Kerry Group, to allow the company to concentrate on baked meat products. The company was bought by private equity firm Vision Capital in 2007, as part of a ¬£160 million divestment by Northern Foods. With European Union laws requiring Melton Mowbray pork pies to be produced within a defined distance of Melton Mowbray, the company chose to close the Trowbridge plant with the loss of 400 jobs, and invest ¬£12 million into the Nottingham plant to increase Melton Mowbray pie production. Some employees were subsequently offered jobs in the Pork Farms plant at Shaftesbury. In 2015, Vision Capital combined Bowyers with other chilled savoury pastry brands under Addo Food Group. In 2017, Addo was sold to Lloyds Development Capital, another private equity firm.  Sites  The site at Innox Mill, Trowbridge was bought by the Morrisons supermarket chain and cleared for redevelopment, except for the Grade II listed three-storey factory building of c. 1875. However, the site was sold again in 2016. There was also a Bowyers factory on Alexander Road, Mutley, Plymouth. It had a large chimney with the name Bowyer running down it which was very well known in the city. The factory was formerly the Bedford Brewery premises which became the Beechwood factory in 1921, producing Devonshire bacons and hams. In 1959, it came under Unigate Dairies ownership when they took over Cow & Gate. The plant was subsequently sold to Bowyer's, who opened a new factory on the Newnham Industrial Estate in 1979 and the old factory was demolished; the chimney was taken down in May 1980.

The 135th Ohio Infantry mustered out of service at Camp Chase on September 1, 1864. Ohio National Guard Over 35,000 Ohio National Guardsmen were federalized and organized into regiments for 100 days service in May 1864. Shipped to the Eastern Theater, they were designed to be placed in \\"safe\\" rear areas to protect railroads and supply points, thereby freeing regular troops for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs push on the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. As events transpired, many units found themselves in combat, stationed in the path of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early‚Äôs veteran Army of the Valley during its famed Valley Campaigns of 1864. Ohio Guard units met the battle-tested foe head on and helped blunt the Confederate offensive thereby saving Washington, D.C. from capture. Ohio National Guard units participated in the battles of Monacacy, Fort Stevens, Harpers Ferry, and in the siege of Petersburg. Casualties The regiment lost 73 men during service; 7 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 66 enlisted men due to disease.

After the First Battle of Solskjell, Solve Klove, son of King Huntiof, King of Nordm√∏re set himself up as a pirate and spent that winter raiding and plundering King Harald's men and possessions on the M√∏re coast. King Harald himself had left to spend the winter in Trondheim. Solve had also spent time at the court of King Arnvid of Sunnm√∏re and they had gathered together a large group of people who had been dispossessed by Harald's conquest.

On hearing news of Harald's intentions' Solve traveled to King Audbjorn in Fjordane and convinced him to join forces against Harald. The force sailed north to meet Harald by Solskjell. Here both kings Arnvid and Audbjorn fell, but Solve again escaped. Heimskringla tells that Harald's men, Asgaut and Asbjorn as well as Grjotgard and Herlaug, the sons of earl H√•kon Grjotgardsson, were all killed in battle.
