Roosevelt's Department of Justice from 1938 to 1943. He later served as an Associate Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Before coming to Washington in 1938, Arnold was the mayor of Laramie, Wyoming, and then a professor at Yale Law School, where he took part in the legal realism movement, and published two books: The Symbols of Government (1935) and The Folklore of Capitalism (1937). A few years later, he published The Bottlenecks of Business (1940). Early life and education Thurman was born in the frontier ranch town of Laramie, Wyoming, which grew to be a small city and location of the University of Wyoming. He was the son of Annie (Brockway) and Constantine Peter Arnold. He began his university studies at Wabash College, but transferred to Princeton University, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1911. He earned his Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School in 1914. Career Thurman Arnold Building in Washington, D.C.. Arnold served in World War I, rising to the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army (Field Artillery) and worked briefly in Chicago, Illinois before returning to Laramie, where he was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives in 1921 and then mayor from 1923 to 1924. He developed a reputation as a maverick lawyer. He was a Lecturer at the University of Wyoming from 1921 to 1926. He was Dean of the at West Virginia University College of Law from 1927 to 1930. He was a visiting professor at Yale University from 1930 to 1931, and then professor of law at the same institution from 1931 to 1938. He was a special assistant to the general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933. He was an Assistant Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice from 1938 to 1943. As chief competition lawyer for the United States Government, Arnold launched numerous studies to support the antitrust efforts in the late 1930s. He targeted the American Medical Association in their anti-competitive efforts against health plans. The Roosevelt administration later de-emphasized antitrust enforcement, for the stated purpose of allowing corporations to concentrate on contributing to victory in World War II. Federal judicial service Arnold was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 11, 1943, to an Associate Justice seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) vacated by Associate Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge. He was \\"kicked upstairs\\" by President Roosevelt to the Court of Appeals in order to get him out of the Antitrust Division. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 9, 1943, and received his commission on March 11, 1943. His service terminated on July 9, 1945, due to his resignation. =Court of Appeals tenure= Although the District of Columbia Court of Appeals had some responsibility for review of decisions by federal administrative agencies, during Arnold's tenure the court's primary role was reviewing decisions of local trial courts involving routine civil and criminal matters arising in Washington, D.C. Arnold was never happy during his time on the court, resigning after only two years on the bench. As an explanation of his decision, he told observers he \\"would rather be speaking to damn fools than listening to damn fools.\\" Arnold & Porter Arnold returned to private practice in Washington, D.C. where, along with Paul A. Porter and Abe Fortas, he co-founded the law firm known today as Arnold & Porter.  Personal and death  Thurman married his lifelong partner Frances Longan Arnold on September 4, 1917. They had two children, Thurman Jr. and George, both of whom enjoyed successful careers in the law. Nebraskan \\"Hugh Cox, famous as Thurman Arnold's chief deputy\\" and also as an early partner at Root Clark & Bird (later Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine; later Dewey Ballantine, later Dewey & LeBouef) was attorney for Donald Hiss, brother of Alger Hiss. Both Cox and Hiss were partners at Covington & Burling, where he was called the \\"perfect advocate\\") during the Hiss-Chambers Case.\\" Arnold died on November 7, 1969. Thurman Arnold Jr. established a law firm in Palm Springs, California in 1953. Thurman Arnold Jr.'s son, Thurman Arnold III, joined his father's law firm in 1982 and is currently practicing law with an emphasis on Family Law in Palm Springs, California.

In 1957, an entrepreneur requested a picture of his buildings, which stood at three of the corners of a street-crossing, and he wanted to show the group of buildings in one single photo, which would have to cover 360¬∞. Using a Rolleiflex with a panoramic head, ten negatives were taken that, enlarged and mounted, resulted in a 360¬∞ photo. Leme then addressed the challenge of taking a 360¬∞ photo in a single negative. The demonstration of his eventual solution consisted of a lens mounted in a small, empty tomato pur√©e can, an internal device which is the principle of the invention, and a piece of film fixed inside the can. He tested it in front of the Senai building by rotating the lens by hand. The film, when developed, precariously confirmed that it was possible to take 360¬∞ photos. The first prototype was entirely mechanical. Three prototypes were made, and they were improved over one year. In the meantime, sure of having found a solution to the problem of taking 360¬∞ photos, Leme applied for a patent registration, a process that went on for some years. On April 23, 1962 the patent was awarded under No. 61.472. About 20 years after the patent was awarded, a similar system appeared in the United States, but without the internal device mentioned above. The camera remained out of use for 15 years. At the end of 1997, it was taken up again, improved, and put to use once more.

The Andantes provided back-up singing on Motown singles starting in 1962.

The Andantes were used as vocal substitutes for Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong on many of the Supremes' recordings done in 1968 and 1969, but Wilson and Birdsong continued to sing on recordings as well. They were also called upon to overdub and smooth out the Marvelettes' background vocals records beginning in 1965.

The observance commemorates Lucia of Syracuse, an early-4th-century virgin martyr under the Diocletianic Persecution, who according to legend brought food and aid to Christians hiding in the Roman catacombs, wearing a candlelit wreath on her head to light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible.Barnhill, Carla. \\"St. Lucy's Day\\", Christian History, issue 103 Her feast day, which coincided with the shortest day of the year prior to calendar reforms, is widely celebrated as a festival of light. Falling within the Advent season, Saint Lucy's Day is viewed as a precursor of Christmastide, pointing to the arrival of the Light of Christ in the calendar on Christmas Day. Saint Lucy's Day is celebrated most widely in Scandinavia and in Italy, with each emphasising a different aspect of her story. In Scandinavia, where Lucy is called Santa Lucia in Norwegian and Danish and Sankta Lucia in Swedish, she is represented as a lady in a white dress symbolizing a baptismal robe and a red sash symbolizing the blood of her martyrdom, with a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Norway, Sweden and Swedish-speaking regions of Finland, as songs are sung, girls dressed as Saint Lucy carry cookies and saffron buns in procession, which symbolizes bringing the Light of Christ into the world's darkness. In both Protestant and Catholic churches, boys participate in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmastide, such as that of Saint Stephen. The celebration of Saint Lucy's Day is said to help one live the winter days with enough light. A special devotion to Saint Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, in the north of the country, and Sicily, in the south, as well as in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. In Hungary and Croatia, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy's Day involves planting wheat grains that grow to be several centimetres tall by Christmas Day, representing the Nativity of Jesus.  Origins  An inscription in Syracuse dedicated to Euskia mentioning St Lucy's Day as a local feast dates back to the 4th century A.D., which states \\"Euskia, the irreproachable, lived a good and pure life for about 25 years, died on my Saint Lucy's feast day, she for whom I cannot find appropriate words of praise: she was a Christian, faithful, perfection itself, full of thankfulness and gratitude\\". The Feast of Saint Lucy became a universal feast of the Church in the 6th century, commemorating the Christian martyr's death on 13 December 304 A.D. St. Lucy's Day appears in the sacramentary of Gregory, as well as that of Bede, and Christian churches were dedicated to Saint Lucy in Italy as well as in England. Later, Christian missionaries arrived in Scandinavia to evangelize the local population, carrying the commemoration of Saint Lucy with them, and this \\"story of a young girl bringing light in the midst of darkness no doubt held great meaning for people who, in the midst of a North Sea December, were longing for the relief of warmth and light\\". Saint Lucy is one of the few saints celebrated by the overwhelmingly Lutheran Nordic people Danes; Swedes; Finns and Norwegians but also in the United States and Canada and Italy. It is speculated that the St. Lucy's Day celebrations in Scandinavia alone may retain a few indigenous Germanic pagan, pre-Christian midwinter elements. Some of the practices associated with the Feast of Saint Lucy may predate the adoption of Christianity in that region, and like much of Scandinavian folklore and even religiosity, is centered on the annual struggle between light and darkness. The Nordic observation of St. Lucy is first attested in the Middle Ages, and continued after the Protestant Reformation in the 1520s and 1530s, although the modern celebration is only about 200 years old. It is likely that tradition owes its popularity in the Nordic countries to the extreme change in daylight hours between the seasons in this region. The pre- Christian holiday of Yule, or j√≥l, was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Originally the observance of the winter solstice, and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the Advent and Christmas celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. =13 December= A Saint Lucy procession in Sweden, 2007 In Scandinavia (as late as until the mid 18th century) this date was the longest night of the year, coinciding with Winter Solstice, due to the Julian Calendar being employed at that time. The same can be seen in the poem \\"A Nocturnal upon S. Lucy's Day, Being the Shortest Day\\" by the English poet John Donne. While this does not hold for our current Gregorian calendar, a discrepancy of 8 days would have been the case in the Julian calendar during the 14th century, resulting in Winter solstice falling on 13 December. With the original adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century the discrepancy was 10 days and had increased to 11 days in the 18th century when Scandinavia adopted the new calendar, with Winter solstice falling on 9 December. The Winter solstice is not visibly shorter than the several days leading up to and following it and although the actual Julian date of Winter solstice would have been on 15 or 14 December at the time when Christianity was introduced to Scandinavia, 13 December could well have lodged in peoples mind as being the shortest day. The choice of 13 December as Saint Lucy's day, however, predates the eight-day error of the 14th century Julian calendar. This date is attested in the pre-Tridentic Monastic calendar, probably going back to the earliest attestations of her life in the 6th and 7th centuries, and it is the date used throughout Europe. So, while the world changed from a Julian to a Gregorian calendar system‚Äîand hence acquired a new date for the Winter Solstice‚ÄîSt Lucy's Day was kept at 13 December, and not moved to the 21. In the Roman Empire, 25 December (in the Julian Calendar) date was celebrated as being the day when the Sun was born, the birthday of Sol Invictus, as can be seen in the Chronography of 354. This date corresponding to the date of the Winter solstice.Christmas (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica) Early Christians considered this a likely date for their saviour's nativity, as it was commonly held that the world was created on Spring equinox (thought to fall on 25 March at the time), and that Christ had been conceived on that date, being born 9 months later on Winter solstice. A Swedish source states that the date of (Winter Solstice, St. Lucia, Lucinatta, Lucia-day, Lussi-mass ...) i.e. 13 December, predates the Gregorian which implies that \\"Lucia's Day\\" was 13 Dec in the Julian Calendar, which is equal to 21 December in the Gregorian, i.e. now. Same source states use of the name \\"Little Yule\\" for the day, that it was among the most important days of the year, that it marked the start of Christmas month, and that with the move to the Gregorian calendar (in Sweden 1753) the date (not the celebration) \\"completely lost its appropriateness/significance\\". = Lussi = Lussinatta, the Lussi Night, was marked in Sweden 13 December. Then Lussi, a female being with evil traits, like a female demon or witch, was said to ride through the air with her followers, called Lussiferda. This itself might be an echo of the myth of the Wild Hunt, called Oskoreia in Scandinavia, found across Northern, Western and Central Europe.Lucia och lussebrud i V√§rmland, ur Svenska kulturbilder Ny f√∂ljd, h√§fte 5, Hilding Celander, 1936 Between Lussi Night and Yule, trolls and evil spirits, in some accounts also the spirits of the dead, were thought to be active outside. It was believed to be particularly dangerous to be out during Lussi Night. According to tradition, children who had done mischief had to take special care, since Lussi could come down through the chimney and take them away, and certain tasks of work in the preparation for Yule had to be finished, or else the Lussi would come to punish the household. The tradition of Lussevaka ‚Äì to stay awake through the Lussinatt to guard oneself and the household against evil, has found a modern form through throwing parties until daybreak. Another company of spirits was said to come riding through the night around Yule itself, journeying through the air, over land and water.Lussi, Tomas og Tollak: tre kalendariske julefigurar, Brynjulf Alver, 1976 There is little evidence that the legend itself derives from the folklore of northern Europe, but the similarities in the names (\\"Lussi\\" and \\"Lucia\\"), and the date of her festival, 13 December, suggest that two separate traditions may have been brought together in the modern-day celebrations in Scandinavia. Saint Lucy is often depicted in art with a palm as the symbol of martyrdom.Hassett, Maurice. \\"Palm in Christian Symbolism.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 1 December 2017 = Saint Lucy = Lucy by Cosimo Rosselli, Florence, c. 1470, tempera on panel According to the traditional story, Lucy was born of rich and noble parents about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Although no sources for her life-story exist other than in hagiographies, St. Lucy, whose name Lucia refers to \\"light\\" (Lux, lucis), is known to have been a Sicilian saint who suffered a sad death in Siracusa, Sicily, around AD 310.Hamer, Richard. 2006. Guilte Legende. Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society. Volume 1, p 25. A devout Christian who had taken a vow of virginity, her mother betrothed her to a pagan. She was seeking help for her mother's long- term illness at the shrine of Saint Agatha when the saint appeared to her in a dream beside the shrine. Saint Agatha told Lucy that the illness would be cured through faith, and Lucy was able to convince her mother to cancel the wedding and donate the dowry to the poor. Enraged, her suitor then reported her to the governor for being a Christian. According to the legend, she was threatened to be taken to a brothel if she did not renounce her Christian beliefs, but they were unable to move her, even with a thousand men and fifty oxen pulling. Instead they stacked materials for a fire around her and set light to it, but she would not stop speaking, insisting that her death would lessen the fear of it for other Christians and bring grief to non-believers. One of the soldiers stuck a spear through her throat to stop these denouncements, but to no effect. Another gouged out her eyes in an attempt to force her into complacency, but her eyes were miraculously restored. Saint Lucy was able to die only when she was given the Christian Last Rites.Hamer, Richard. 2006. Volume 1, pp 22‚Äì25. In one story, Saint Lucy was working to help Christians hiding in the catacombs during the terror under the Roman Emperor Diocletian, and in order to bring with her as many supplies as possible, she needed to have both hands free. She solved this problem by attaching candles to a wreath on her head.Pantano, Kayla. \\"Happy Saint Lucy's Day in Italy!\\", iItaly, 2 December 2018  Celebration  Albert Szent- Gy√∂rgyi, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937, here at that year's Saint Lucy celebration in Stockholm = Italy = Catholic celebrations take place on 13 December and in May. Saint Lucy or Lucia, whose name comes from the Latin word \\"lux\\" meaning light, links with this element and with the days growing longer after the Winter solstice.Alio, Jacqueline. \\"Saint Lucy ‚Äì Sicily's Most Famous Woman\\", Best of Sicily Magazine, 2009 St. Lucy is the patron saint of the city of Siracusa (Sicily). On 13 December a silver statue of St. Lucy containing her relics is paraded through the streets before returning to the Cathedral of Syracuse.Saints In Rome and Beyond, by Daniel Thelen, pages 129‚Äì130 Sicilians recall a legend that holds that a famine ended on her feast day when ships loaded with grain entered the harbor. Here, it is traditional to eat whole grains instead of bread on 13 December. This usually takes the form of cuccia, a dish of boiled wheat berries often mixed with ricotta and honey, or sometimes served as a savory soup with beans.\\"Lussekatter and Cuccia for St. Lucy‚Äôs Day\\", Smithsonian Magazine, 10 December 2010 St. Lucy is also popular among children in some regions of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto, (Verona), parts of Emilia-Romagna, (Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia and Bologna), and all of Friuli, where she is said to bring gifts to good children and coal to bad ones the night between 12 and 13 December. According to tradition, she arrives in the company of a donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them. = Croatia and Hungary = In Croatia, Hungary and some their neighbouring countries, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy's Day involves planting wheat grains; nowadays this serves as symbol of the new life born in Bethlehem, with a candle sometimes placed in the middle of the new plant as a symbol of the Light of Christ that Saint Lucia brings. Wheat grains are planted in a round dish or plate of soil, then watered. If the planter is kept moist, the seeds germinate and the shoots are ideally several inches high by Christmas. The new green shoots, reminding us of the new life born in Bethlehem, may be tied with a ribbon and put near or under the Christmas tree. It is in actuality one of the many pagan traditions found in Croatia and other Slavic nations, that once served as part of rituals to appease their many deities and fairies, which were mostly forgotten after their Christianization. Traditions such as this one stubbornly live on to this day, the deities and original meanings long forgotten, their meanings simply replaced with ones more in accordance with Christianity. The real reason wheat was and is planted a this time, or on the Day of Saint Barbara, is because the density, color and richness of the shoots will foretell how the upcoming yield will be, as well as increase the chances of it being a good one. = Malta = Santa Luƒãija is the patron saint of the villages of Mtarfa (Malta) and Santa Luƒãija, Gozo. On 13 December Malta also celebrates Republic Day. = In the Nordic countries = Lucias singing In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, Lucy (called Lucia) is venerated on 13 December in a ceremony where a girl is elected to portray Lucia. Wearing a white gown with a red sash and a crown of candles on her head, she walks at the head of a procession of women, each holding a candle. The candles symbolize the fire that refused to take St. Lucy's life when she was sentenced to be burned. The women sing a Lucia song while entering the room, to the melody of the traditional Neapolitan song Santa Lucia; the Italian lyrics describe the view from Santa Lucia in Naples, the various Scandinavian lyrics are fashioned for the occasion, describing the light with which Lucia overcomes the darkness. Each Scandinavian country has lyrics in their native tongues. After finishing this song, the procession sings Christmas carols or more songs about Lucia.

There is also a modern version with simpler lyrics for children: Ute √§r m√∂rkt och kallt (Outside, it's dark and cold). Although St. Lucy's Day is not an official holiday in Sweden, it is a popular occasion in Sweden. At many universities, students hold big formal dinner parties since this is the last chance to celebrate together before most students go home to their families for Christmas. The modern tradition of having public processions in the Swedish cities started in 1927 when a newspaper in Stockholm elected an official Lucy for Stockholm that year. The initiative was then followed around the country through the local press. Today most cities in Sweden appoint a Lucy every year. Schools elect a Lucy and her maids among the students and a national Lucy is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucies will visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out gingernut cookies (pepparkakor). Guinness World Records has noted the Lucy procession in Ericsson Globe in Stockholm as the largest in the world, with 1200 participants from Adolf Fredrik's Music School, Stockholms Musikgymnasium and Stockholml√§ns Bl√•sarsymfoniker. Boys take part in the procession, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called stj√§rngossar (star boys); some may be dressed up as \\"tomtenissar\\" (Santa's elves), carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as gingerbread men. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually Staffan Stalledr√§ng, which tells the story about Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, caring for his five horses. Some trace the \\"re-birth\\" of the Lucy celebrations in Sweden to the tradition in German Protestant families of having girls dressed as angelic Christ children, handing out Christmas presents. The Swedish variant of this white-dressed Kindchen Jesus, or Christkind, was called Kinken Jes, and started to appear in upper-class families in the 18th century on Christmas Eve with a candle-wreath in her hair, handing out candy and cakes to the children. Another theory claims that the Lucy celebration evolved from old Swedish traditions of ‚Äústar boys‚Äù and white-dressed angels singing Christmas carols at different events during Advent and Christmas. In either case, the current tradition of having a white-dressed woman with candles in her hair appearing on the morning of the Lucy Day started in the area around V√§nern in the late 18th century and spread slowly to other parts of the country during the 19th century.

They observe \\"Luciadagen\\" a week before the Winter Solstice. St Lucy is celebrated as a \\"beacon of brightness\\" in the darkest time of year. The first records of St. Lucy celebrations in Finland are from 1898, and the first large celebrations came in 1930, a couple of years after the popularization of the celebrations in Sweden. The St. Lucy of Finland has been elected since 1949 and she is crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral. Local St. Lucies are elected in almost every place where there is a Swedish populace in Finland. The Finnish-speaking population has also lately begun to embrace the celebrations.Folkh√§lsan: Lucia ‚Äì legend och historia.  Denmark  Danish girls in the Lucia procession at a Helsing√∏r public school, 2001 In Denmark, the Day of Lucy (Luciadag) was first celebrated on 13 December 1944. The tradition was directly imported from Sweden by initiative of Franz Wend, secretary of F√∂reningen Norden, as an attempt \\"to bring light in a time of darkness\\". Implicitly it was meant as a passive protest against German occupation during the Second World War but it has been a tradition ever since. Although the tradition is imported from Sweden, it differs somewhat in that the church celebration has always been strongly centered on Christianity and it is a yearly local event in most churches in conjunction with Christmas. Schools and kindergartens also use the occasion to mark the event as a special day for children on one of the final days before the Christmas holidays, but it does not have much impact anywhere else in society. There are also a number of additional historical traditions connected with the celebration, which are not widely observed. The night before candles are lit and all electrical lights are turned off, and on the Sunday closest to 13 December Danes traditionally attend church. The traditional Danish version of the Neapolitan song is not especially Christian in nature, the only Christian concept being \\"Sankta Lucia\\". Excerpt: \\"Nu b√¶res lyset frem | stolt p√• din krone. | Rundt om i hus og hjem | sangen skal tone.\\" (\\"The light's carried forward | proudly on your crown. | Around in house and home | The song shall sound now.\\") The Christian version used in churches is Sankta Lucia from 1982, by priest Holger Lissner. Saint Lucy's Day is celebrated also in the Faroe Islands.  Norway  Lucia buns, made with saffron. Historically Norwegians considered what they called Lussinatten the longest night of the year and no work was to be done. From that night until Christmas, spirits, gnomes and trolls roamed the earth. Lussi, a feared enchantress, punished anyone who dared work. Legend also has it that farm animals talked to each other on Lussinatten, and that they were given additional feed on this longest night of the year.Steves, Rick. \\"Norwegian Christmas\\", Rick Steves' Europe The Lussinatt, the night of 13 December, was largely forgotten in Norway at the beginning of the 20th century, though still remembered as an ominous night, and also celebrated in some areas, especially in Mid, Central and Eastern inland. It was not until after World War II that the modern celebration of Lucia in Norway became adopted on a larger scale. It is now again observed all over the country. Like the Swedish tradition, and unlike the Danish, Lucy is largely a secular event in Norway, and is observed in kindergartens and schools (often through secondary level). However, it has in recent years also been incorporated in the Advent liturgy in the Church of Norway. The boys are often incorporated in the procession, staging as magi with tall hats and star-staffs. Occasionally, anthems of Saint Stephen are taken in on behalf of the boys. For the traditional observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways of the school building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their child should be chosen to be Lucia, it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes. The traditional Norwegian version of the Neapolitan song is, just like the Danish, not especially Christian in nature, the only Christian concept being \\"Sankta Lucia\\". Excerpt: \\"Svart senker natten seg / i stall og stue. / Solen har g√•tt sin vei / skyggene truer.\\" (\\"Darkly the night descends / in stable and cottage. / The sun has gone away / the shadows loom.\\") = Estonia = In Estonia Saint Lucia Day (Luutsinap√§ev in Estonian) was traditionally celebrated by the local Estonian Swedes. It is also celebrated annually in the Gustav Adolf Grammar School, which was founded by Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus in 1631, making it one of the oldest extant secondary schools in Europe. =Saint Lucia (Caribbean)= In Saint Lucia, a small island nation in the Caribbean named after its patron saint, St. Lucy, 13 December is celebrated as National Day. The National Festival of Lights and Renewal is held the night before the holiday, in honour of St. Lucy of Syracuse the saint of light. In this celebration, decorative lights (mostly bearing a Christmas theme) are lit in the capital city of Castries; artisans present decorated lanterns for competition; and the official activities end with a fireworks display.National Day ‚Äì Festival of Lights and Renewal In the past, a jour ouvert celebration has continued into the sunrise of 13 December. = United States = Birgit Ridderstedt dressed to perform as St. Lucy in Chicago in 1951. Saint Lucy procession inside a Swedish-American Lutheran church in Rochester, Minnesota. The celebration of St. Lucia Day is popular among Scandinavian Americans, and is practiced in many different contexts, including (but not limited to) parties, at home, in churches, and through organizations across the country. Continuing to uphold this ritual helps people keep ties with the Scandinavian countries. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), which is the successor denomination to hundreds of Scandinavian and German Lutheran congregations, St. Lucy is treated as a commemoration on 13 December, in which red vestments are worn. Usually, the Sunday in Advent closest to 13 December is set aside for St. Lucy, in which the traditional Scandinavian procession is observed. The public St. Lucia celebration in Lindsborg, Kansas is a way to display the town‚Äôs Swedish heritage, and serves as a rallying point for the community. It also brings visitors to the town, which benefits the town financially. Since 1979, Hutto, Texas, has held a St. Lucia celebration for their town at the Lutheran church. Every year a Lucia is picked from the congregation. The procession then walks around the church, sings the traditional St. Lucia song, and serves the traditional saffron buns and ginger cookies. Gustavus Adolphus College , as a school founded by Swedish immigrants, has celebrated the Festival of Saint Lucia annually since 1941. Six sophomore women are chosen to be a part of the Court of St. Lucia. The women are chosen by their peers honoring the qualities of the legendary Lucia. In an effort to keep the tradition relevant to today, the selection process changed in 2011 to be more based upon qualities of the legendary Lucia that can be universally celebrated. The selection of the court and Lucia is a two step process. First, the campus community is invited to submit nominations of any sophomore woman who exemplifies the qualities of courageous leadership, service to others, strength of character, and compassion and therefore is a light to others. These women do not have to have a Swedish connection or the ability to sing (since the court goes caroling in the early morning). Sophomore women then vote who should be on the court. The highest three nominees are included. Then the Guild of St. Lucia, a senior honors society, reviews the remaining nominations and selects up to three more women to serve on the court with the goal of having the court be representative of the sophomore class. =Venezuela= The town of Mucuch√≠es in M√©rida state, Venezuela, has chosen as their patron saints St. Lucy and St. Benedict the Moor. Patron saint festivities are held during the month of December. NotesReferences * Eriksson, Stig A. (2002).

Peter Tatchell stood as the candidate for the Labour Party, and Simon Hughes stood for the Liberal Party. Following a bitter campaign, the Liberals made huge gains and took the seat, with a majority of votes cast. Labour's vote fell from 63.6 per cent in May 1979 to 26.1 per cent as Tatchell came a distant second, while the Conservative candidate, Robert Hughes, managed only fourth place. With a swing of 44.2%, the 1983 Bermondsey by-election remains the largest by-election swing in British political history. Preliminaries Bob Mellish had represented the constituency and its predecessors in the House of Commons since 1946. He was the Labour Chief Whip from 1969 until 1976, but had become disenchanted with the left-wing drift of the Labour Party, and resigned from both the Party and his Parliamentary seat in 1982. He was recruited by the Conservative government to the board of the London Docklands Development Corporation; as he did not wish to be disqualified, the post was made non- salaried until such time as Mellish chose to accept payment. This meant that Mellish had a paid job to go to as soon as he wanted. On 7 November 1981, Bermondsey Labour Party selected Peter Tatchell, its Secretary, as prospective Parliamentary candidate. Tatchell was a leading member of the left-wing faction that had taken control of the local party the previous year. He was also a contributor to London Labour Briefing, a magazine that circulated among the London left, and had written an article suggesting the use of extra- Parliamentary direct action by the Labour Party, saying: \\"We must look to new, more militant forms of extra-parliamentary opposition which involve mass popular participation and challenge the government's right to rule\\". This call to civil disobedience was considered a call to violent action by some, and was used \\"as a stick to beat [Tatchell] with\\" by political opponents. For example, the article came to the attention of James Wellbeloved, a former London Labour MP who had defected to the Social Democratic Party; Wellbeloved then referred to it in a Parliamentary Question to Margaret Thatcher on 3 December.Oral Answers to Questions ‚Äî Prime Minister House of Commons debates, 3 December 1981 TheyWorkForYou.com. Quoted in Thomas-Symonds, 2005. Labour Party leader Michael Foot responded to Wellbeloved by denouncing Tatchell's article and declared \\"the individual concerned is not an endorsed member of the Labour Party and as far as I'm concerned never will be\\". Tony Benn wrote in his diary that many people, including himself, thought that Foot had confused Peter Tatchell with Peter Taaffe, then the leader of the Trotskyist Militant tendency, and Michael Crick in his book on Militant agrees that the fact that Tatchell and Taaffe have similar names contributed to public confusion between the two, despite the fact that Militant opposed Tatchell's candidacy due to anti-gay feeling and political differences between the old left (Militant) and new left (Tatchell) of the party. As to whether Tatchell was a member of the Labour Party itself, Foot later clarified that he meant to say \\"endorsed candidate\\" instead of \\"endorsed member\\" in his response to Wellbeloved.\\"It must be clear from the context that what I wished to say was 'not an endorsed candidate' ...\\". House of Commons Debates, 6th ser., vol. 14, col. 389, 3 May 1981. Quoted in Thomas-Symonds, 2005. At the next meeting of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, Tatchell was narrowly rejected as a candidate. Mellish was not reassured about the future direction of the Labour Party and resigned from it on 2 August 1982, a clear preliminary to resigning his seat, which he did by taking the Chiltern Hundreds on 1 November that year. The left wing of the Labour Party agreed Tatchell would be eligible for selection, and Tatchell was duly selected again in January 1983. Tabloid newspapers had begun researching his background when Foot denounced him, in particular Tatchell's activities with the Gay Liberation Front in the early 1970s. Several stories were published which made it clear that he was gay. Other candidates Simon Hughes, on a Bermondsey election leaflet in 1983 At the 1981 Greater London Council election, the Liberal Party had come second in Bermondsey. They chose their GLC candidate Simon Hughes, a barrister who had moved to the constituency earlier that year, to fight the by-election. The Conservatives chose Robert Hughes (no relation), who was a Greater London Council (GLC) Councillor in Croydon. He later became the MP for Harrow West. Among those who applied for the Conservative nomination but were not chosen was Sara Keays, then having an as yet unrevealed affair with Cecil Parkinson. The right-wing former Labour leader of Southwark Borough Council, John O'Grady, who had been a target for the left-wing faction locally, also decided to stand under the banner 'Real Bermondsey Labour' with Bob Mellish's support and encouragement. His campaign was dominated by personal opposition to Tatchell and defence of his leadership of the Council. Twelve other candidates stood, including Screaming Lord Sutch, appearing for the first time under the Official Monster Raving Loony Party label, and the Dowager Lady Birdwood. Start of the campaign The Labour campaign started disastrously when it was discovered that the first leaflets had been printed at Cambridge Heath Press, owned by the Militant tendency (then practising entryism in the Labour Party; a group whose five key members were expelled two days before polling day). The leaflets were all pulped and reprinted, but the cost of the first printing still counted against the limit for election spending. Attacks on Tatchell There was much controversy over Tatchell's homosexuality. The Labour Party persuaded Tatchell to keep quiet about his sexual orientation, although he had previously declared himself 'out'. Various campaigners for opposition candidates, as well as many within the Labour Party, made homophobic comments about Tatchell. Widespread graffiti throughout the constituency referred to him in derogatory terms, while some of those putting up posters in his support found their windows attacked. Tatchell received hate mail, including a live cartridge, and was attacked when out in the street. Some of the other by- election candidates joined in: John O'Grady (Southwark Council leader, who was promoted as the 'Real Bermondsey' Labour candidacy by the previous MP, Bob Mellish) was filmed touring the constituency on the back of a horse and cart, singing a song which referred to Tatchell \\"wearing his trousers back to front\\". On the last weekend of the campaign, an anonymous leaflet was sent round the constituency headed \\"Which Queen will you vote for?\\", contrasting the republican Tatchell, who was pictured looking very effeminate, with Queen Elizabeth II. The leaflet gave Tatchell's home address and telephone number. An alternative analysis of Tatchell's eventual defeat was given by David Sutch, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate, in his 1991 autobiography. When being interviewed on TV at the by-election count, Sutch related to Tatchell how horrified he was at the treatment Tatchell had received, but added that \\"what I did not tell him was that he had been so bad a candidate that he had largely brought it on himself\\". Sutch criticised Tatchell's preference for press conferences and press releases rather than traditional meeting-and-greeting, which was generally regarded as the best way to win hearts and minds at a by-election. In a later interview, when the subject of Bermondsey came up, Sutch said that Tatchell \\"seemed to think all he needed to do to become the MP was turn up at the count.\\" =Homophobia and the Liberal campaign= During the by-election, members of the Liberal Party were accused of having joined in homophobic attacks on Tatchell. Male Liberal canvassers were seen wearing badges reading \\"I've been kissed by Peter Tatchell\\". This was criticised by Roy Hattersley at a Labour news conference. In an interview with Simon Edge of The Independent published on 17 December 1996, the former Liberal Party Chief Executive, Andy Ellis, was asked whether he approved of the activity undertaken by the Liberal Gay Action Group, and replied \\"Nothing went on in Bermondsey that we were unhappy with\\". During leadership of the Liberal Democrats in January 2006, Hughes said he \\"had both homosexual and heterosexual relationships in the past\\" and apologised for the actions of Liberals in the Bermondsey campaign, saying that while a lot of the blame for homophobic abuse laid on the press, \\"I take responsibility\\" for the actions of his organisers, adding: \\"I have never been comfortable about the whole of that campaign, as Peter knows, and I said that to him in the past.... Where there were things that were inappropriate or wrong, I apologise for that.\\" Tatchell, by then a member of the Green Party, said that he had forgiven Hughes, saying \\"Simon benefited from these dirty tricks, but that was 23 years ago‚ÄîI don't hold a grudge. It's time to forgive and move on\\", adding that Hughes should be judged on his 23-year record as an MP. Opinion polls Bermondsey was one of the first by-elections to be extensively polled. The polls showed, at first, that the Labour vote was substantially down on the 1979 election figures, but that none of the rival candidates were particularly close. As the campaign went on, the Liberal candidate began to move into a clear second position and the other candidates faded. Later in the campaign, there were rumours which claimed that the right-wing of the Labour Party nationally wished to lose the seat, as it would prove that left-wing Labour candidates were unelectable. By the eve of poll, it was clear that large numbers of previously Labour voters were defecting to other parties, and that non-Labour voters were lining up in support of the Liberal candidate as the one most likely to beat Labour. Results The Liberals made huge gains and took the seat, with a majority of votes cast. Labour's vote fell from 63.6 per cent in May 1979 to 26.1 per cent as Tatchell came a distant second, while O'Grady took third. The Conservatives managed only fourth place, for the first time since the 1974 Newham South by-election, and the last in Britain until the 1991 Liverpool Walton by-election. All candidates other than Liberal and Labour lost their deposits. Hughes would go on to remain a Bermondsey MP for the next 32 years, making him one of very few examples of MPs who took a formerly safe seat from another party and managed to hold it for a long period of time.

Recorded after guitarist Rikk Agnew and drummer Casey Royer joined the band, it features several songs written for their prior group, the Detours, including \\"Kids of the Black Hole\\" and \\"Amoeba\\", which became two of the Adolescents' most well-known songs. Adolescents was one of the first hardcore punk albums to be widely distributed throughout the United States, and became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums of its time. The band never toured in support of it, and broke up four months after its release. The Blue Album lineup of Agnew, Royer, guitarist Frank Agnew, bassist Steve Soto and singer Tony Brandenburg reunited several times in subsequent years, but only for brief periods. Background and recording The Adolescents formed in Fullerton, California in January 1980. The original lineup consisted of singer Tony Brandenburg (who used the stage name Tony Cadena), bassist Steve Soto, guitarists Frank Agnew and John O'Donovan, and a drummer who went by the stage name Peter Pan. They began performing locally and recorded their first demo tape that March. A second demo tape, recorded that May, included the songs \\"I Hate Children\\", \\"No Friends\\", \\"Who Is Who\\" and \\"Wrecking Crew\\". \\"I Hate Children\\" was inspired by a conversation Brandenburg overheard while riding a bus: \\"It was a snapshot of a man saying to his wife ‚Äî with his children there crying ‚Äî that he hated children, can't stand them\\", he said in 2011. \\"And this was the same message that my father had given me. When I expressed that, people didn't understand where that was coming from. I wasn't saying this was me. I'm mirroring something that I'm seeing right now. This is what is going on in my life.\\" O'Donovan and Pan both left the band in June 1980. Frank Agnew's older brother, Rikk Agnew, joined the group, initially on drums, but soon switched to guitar and brought in drummer Casey Royer. Royer and Rikk Agnew brought with them several songs written for their previous band, the Detours, including \\"Amoeba\\", \\"No Way\\", \\"Creatures\\", \\"Rip It Up\\", and \\"Kids of the Black Hole\\". \\"Kids of the Black Hole\\" describes Social Distortion frontman Mike Ness' Fullerton apartment, a graffiti-covered drug den that was a hangout for punks and a site for parties, sex, and violence. \\"To me, it is one of the greatest punk rock songs of all time\\", said Soto in 2014, \\"and of course 'Amoeba' was catchy as fuck, and everybody wants to hear it, but to me, 'Kids of the Black Hole' was like Quadrophenia for us.\\" Said his brother Frank, \\"Rikk's songwriting was really adventurous for punk rock. He was writing stuff that was punk but had a Beatles-esque quality with the guitar harmonies.\\" He recalled, \\"With the addition of Rikk and Casey, we'd moved to the next level\\". They were older and more experienced, so we improved quickly.\\" KROQ-FM disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer played the band's second demo tape on his \\"Rodney on the ROQ\\" program showcasing local punk acts, giving them the encouragement to record another.Spitz and Mullen, p. 260. They recorded a third demo that July with Chaz Ramirez and Eddie Joseph of local band Eddie and the Subtitles as audio engineers. This demo included \\"Creatures\\", \\"Amoeba\\" and \\"Self Destruct\\". Joseph became the band's manager and began shopping their demo to local record labels. \\"He even got us an advance check that he promptly cashed and left town...Thanks Eddie\\", Soto later recalled. The Adolescents continued performing locally and gained in popularity. Bingenheimer approached the band to record a track for his Rodney on the ROQ compilation album (Posh Boy Records, November 1980), which featured other Los Angeles and Orange County bands including Agent Orange, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. The Adolescents provided a recording of \\"Amoeba\\", which became a hit on KROQ that December and drew the attention of Frontier Records founder Lisa Fancher, who signed the band in January 1981. Amoeba' by the Adolescents is the song\\", she later said. \\"Definitely was a phenomenon. 'Amoeba' is a masterpiece of a single from any era of rock music.\\" In March 1981, the Adolescents entered Perspective Sound studios in Sun Valley, Los Angeles to record their debut album. Engineered and mixed by Thom Wilson and produced by Middle Class bassist Mike Patton (not to be confused for the Faith No More vocalist), it was recorded, mixed and mastered in only four days and featured most of the band's oeuvre at the time, including songs from their demos and Royer and Rikk Agnew's Detours songs. \\"L.A. Girl\\", a new song, was written by Brandenburg in response to being rejected by a new classmate who had come to Magnolia High School from Los Angeles after her parents divorced. \\"She made it very clear that I didn't breathe the same atmosphere as her\\", he recalled 26 years later. \\"I was trying to tell her we were on the same page, that I was her only ally. But like pretty much all the girls then, she just thought I was a dork, an insect.\\" He wrote the song in response to the slight, later calling it an answer to the Doors' \\"L.A. Woman\\". The song's music, written by Frank Agnew, incorporates jarring shifts in tempo between fast, brash punk rock and slower heavy metal, which influenced later California bands. \\"No one was doing that,\\" Brandenburg recalled, \\"and the only reason we did is that we were trying to be middle- class punk, but half the band also wanted to be Black Sabbath. Through the years, it seemed to really echo with people. People like NOFX, the Offspring, Rancid, the drummer in No Doubt (Adrian Young) ‚Äî they have said how much it meant to them.\\" Album cover For the album cover, Brandenburg asked Fancher to have someone design a typeface logo similar to Cheap Trick's. Diane Zincavage designed the cover, and its simple composition‚Äîa blue field with \\"Adolescents\\" in red type‚Äîled to it being referred to as The Blue Album. Release and reception Adolescents was released in April 1981. One of the first hardcore punk records to be widely distributed throughout the United States, it became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums behind the Dead Kennedys' Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980), selling over 10,000 copies. In a retrospective review, Jack Rabid of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and remarked that \\"the debut from these five Orange County kids established the mid-tempo, punk-pop 'Southern Cal sound', led by the long, great, pummeling, Johnny Thunders-derived solos of the two Agnew brothers, Rikk and Frank.... they're super-catchy, heavy-riffing rock & roll, proving again that punk was the true heir to the likes of Chuck Berry, Larry Williams, Bo Diddley, and Eddie Cochran.\\" Legacy Though Rikk Agnew had contributed heavily to the album, tensions between him and the other band members led to him quitting the band just a few months after its release. He was replaced by Pat Smear, formerly of the Germs, and the band planned their first tour to support the album, intending for it to begin in late summer 1981 and last into the fall:. Smear did not want to tour, however, and left the band that June after only three months. He was replaced by Royer's roommate, Steve Roberts, and the new lineup recorded the three-song Welcome to Reality EP in July, but broke up the following month, two months before the EP was released. \\"Oddly enough, we'd never even made it out of California\\", Frank Agnew later said. Greg Graffin, whose band Bad Religion became friends with the Adolescents and played shows with them in 1980‚Äì81, became disillusioned with the violence surrounding the Los Angeles punk rock scene of the time and found reassurance in Brandenburg's lyrics to \\"Rip It Up\\", which spoke out against fans who used the aggressive music to justify fighting: \\"Have you had enough violence? / Just to kill boredom, makes no sense / We're not the background for your stupid fights / Get out of the darkness, it's time to unite / Do you think you're tough when you rip it up?\\" The Adolescents' Blue Album lineup reunited several times in subsequent years. The first was a reunion show in April 1986 at Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach, California which led to the band re-forming. They played more shows and began working on material for a new album, but Frank Agnew and Royer left after a few months. With further lineup changes, the Adolescents released two more albums over the next two years, Brats in Battalions (1987) and Balboa Fun*Zone (1988), then broke up again in April 1989. The Blue Album lineup reunited again for a show in December 1989 at the Reseda Country Club, which was recorded and released eight years later as the live album Return to the Black Hole (Amsterdamned Records, 1997). They reunited again in 2001 for more live performances, but Royer soon left, and Rikk Agnew left as well in 2003. Frank Agnew left after the band's reunion album, OC Confidential (2005), and Brandenburg and Soto later continued as the Adolescents with other lineups. Material from Adolescents dominates the band's live albums, accounting for 13 of 21 tracks on Live 1981 & 1986 (1989), 10 of 17 on Return to the Black Hole (1997), and 12 of 19 on Live at the House of Blues (2004). Writing for the Los Angeles Times in 1998, Mike Boehm included Adolescents first in a list of \\"Essential Albums, '78‚Äì'98\\" giving an overview of Orange County punk and alternative rock, calling it \\"an underground classic. The 13 songs defined the O.C. punk experience, back when punk was a beleaguered subculture. 'Amoeba', with lyrics by Royer, is a metaphoric account of a single-celled creature, read punk youth culture, growing in size and self-awareness under the scornful, dismissive eye of adult authority. 'Kids of the Black Hole' was Rikk Agnew's epic tribute to the hedonistic, comradely denizens of a Fullerton crash pad that cradled the fertile North County punk scene during 1979‚Äì80. The two songs introduced a massed, harmonized 'octave guitar' blitz‚Äîan Orange County rock signature.\\" Covers In the decades since its release, several artists have recorded cover versions of songs from Adolescents. In 2005, NOFX covered \\"No Way\\" for their 7\\" of the Month Club while the Dropkick Murphys covered \\"Who Is Who\\" for the soundtrack to the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. In 2009, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182 covered \\"Amoeba\\" for the soundtrack to the film Endless Bummer, while Pulley covered \\"Wrecking Crew\\" and the Briefs covered \\"Who Is Who\\" for Let Them Know: The Story of Youth Brigade and BYO Records. In popular culture The song \\"Amoeba\\" was featured in the video games Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (2001) and Grand Theft Auto V (2013). The second collected volume of the comic book series Deadly Class was titled \\"Kids of the Black Hole\\", a reference to the song of the same name. The title was used again for the 9th episode of the series' TV adaptation. Track listing Writing credits adapted from the album's liner notes. Personnel Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.

Its flora is inherited from the ancient supercontinent of Laurasia. However, parts of the floristic kingdom (and most of its Circumboreal Region) were glaciated during the Pleistocene and as a consequence have a very young flora. Cenozoic relicts found refuge in the southern and mountainous parts of the kingdom, especially in the Eastern Asiatic Region and southern North American Atlantic Region. Good noted that many plant species of temperate North America and Eurasia were very closely related, despite their separation by the Atlantic Ocean and the Bering Strait. Millions of years ago, before the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, North America and Eurasia were joined as a single continent, Laurasia. After the opening of the Atlantic, the continents were connected to one another periodically via land bridges linking Alaska and Siberia. Until a few million years ago, the global climate was warmer than at present, especially at higher latitudes, and many temperate climate species were distributed across North America and Eurasia via Alaska and Siberia. The sharply cooler climate of the past few million years eliminated a temperate- zone connection between North America and Eurasia, but common Laurasian origins and a long history of temperate-climate land bridges account for the botanical similarities between the temperate floras on the two continents. A floristic kingdom is the botanical analogue to an biogeographic realm, which takes into account the distribution of animal as well as plant species. Many biogeographers distinguish the Boreal Kingdom as comprising two realms, the Nearctic (North America) and Palearctic (North Africa and Eurasia). Others, based on the distribution of related plant and animal families, include the Palearctic and Nearctic in a single Holarctic realm, which corresponds to Good's Boreal Kingdom. your bitcoinFlora According to Takhtajan (1978), the following families are endemic to this kingdom: Ginkgoaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Glaucidiaceae, Hydrastidaceae (Hydrastis), Trochodendraceae, Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Euptelaceae (Euptelea), Platanaceae, Eucommiaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Leitneriaceae, Paeoniaceae, Crossosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, Fouquieriaceae, Diapensiaceae, Simmondsiaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Penthoraceae, Bretschneideraceae, Limnanthaceae, Davidiaceae (Davidia), Toricelliaceae, Helwingiaceae, Theligonaceae, Dipentodontaceae, Cynomoriaceae, Adoxaceae, Trapellaceae (Trapella), Butomaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Aphyllanthaceae.–¢–∞—Ö—Ç–∞–¥–∂—è–Ω –ê. –õ. –§–ª–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ó–µ–º–ª–∏ / –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞—É–∫ –°–°–°–†. –ë–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –∏–º. –í. –õ. –ö–æ–º–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞. ‚Äî –õ.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, 1978. ‚Äî 247 —Å. ‚Äî 4000 —ç–∫–∑.

Features  DSSI is sometimes described as Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) for instruments. LADSPA is an audio effects plugin architecture for filters, reverbs and other sound processing software tools, whereas DSSI was designed specifically for instrument plugins that generate sound from note events. DSSI extends LADSPA by adding note event delivery, but it also adds predefined program selections and a method for plugins to provide their own user interfaces, both of which may also be used by effects plugins. This is partly because DSSI was intended to be a lightweight addition to LADSPA that would require little extra effort from authors of LADSPA hosts and plugins to support, and partly to avoid distracting too much developer effort from the Generalized Music Plug-in Interface (GMPI) plug-in initiative (which has since stalled). Perhaps as a partial consequence of this early offhand approach to publicity, the number of DSSI plugins available remains small. A successor which reunites the two standards LADSPA and DSSI is LV2.

Walker to explain patterns of behavior in an abusive relationship. The phrase is also used more generally to describe any set of conditions which perpetuate abusive and dysfunctional relationships, such as in poor child rearing practices which tend to get passed down. Walker used the term more narrowly, to describe the cycling patterns of calm, violence, and reconciliation within an abusive relationship. Critics suggest the theory was based on inadequate research criteria, and cannot therefore be generalized upon. Overview Lenore E. Walker interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to domestic violence and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the \\"cycle of abuse\\".Bonnie S. Fisher; Steven P. Lab. Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention. SAGE Publications; 2 February 2010. . p. 257. Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling patriarchal behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. She used the term terms \\"the battering cycle\\" and \\"battered woman syndrome\\". Terms like \\"cycle of abuse\\" have been used instead for different reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn't always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, \\"The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women.\\" The cycle of abuse concept is widely used in domestic violence programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.Dutton, Donald G. and Susan Golant. 1997. The Batterer: A Psychological Profile. Phases The cycle usually goes in the following order, and will repeat until the conflict is stopped, usually by the survivor entirely abandoning the relationshipBancroft, Lundy. Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men Berkley Publishing Group 2002 or some form of intervention.Willis C. Newman; Esmeralda Newman. Domestic Violence: Causes and Cures and Anger Management. Willis Newman; 12 May 2010. . p. 9. The cycle can occur hundreds of times in an abusive relationship, the total cycle taking anywhere from a few hours to a year or more to complete. However, the length of the cycle usually diminishes over time so that the \\"reconciliation\\" and \\"calm\\" stages may disappear, violence becomes more intense and the cycles become more frequent. =1: Tension building= Stress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war. During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, although it may last as long as several months.Scott Allen Johnson. Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. . p. 31. To prevent violence, the victim may try to reduce the tension by becoming compliant and nurturing. Alternatively, the victim may provoke the abuser to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury. However, the abuser is never justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior. =2: Acute violence= During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate their victim. Outbursts of violence and abuse occur which may include verbal abuse and psychological abuse. In intimate partner violence, children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence, and the partner's relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim \\"had it coming\\" to them. =3: Reconciliation/honeymoon= The perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible. Characterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually shower the survivor with love and affection. The abuser may use self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.Brewster, Susan Helping her get free Seal Press 2006 =4: Calm= During this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceful. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counselling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex. Over time, the abuser's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention. However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase. The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed. Critiques Walker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence, which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the \\"escalation\\" or tension building stage. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.Scott Allen Johnson. Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. . p. 33‚Äì35. Donald Dutton and Susan Golant agree that Walker's cycle of abuse accurately describes all cyclically abusive relationships they studied. Nonetheless, they also note that her initial research was based almost entirely on anecdotal data from a rather small set of women who were in violent relationships. Walker herself wrote, \\"These women were not randomly selected and they cannot be considered a legitimate data base from which to make specific generalizations.\\"Walker, Lenore E.

The title is still held today, by his direct male descendant. Origins He was the son of Miles (Milo) de Courtenay, Seigneur (lord of the manor) of Courtenay, in the Kingdom of France, today in the Loiret department in north-central France, by his wife Ermengard de Nevers. Career Renaud succeeded his father as Seigneur of Courtenay. He fought in the Second Crusade, with King Louis VII of France. He quarrelled with King Louis VII, who seized Renaud's French possessions and gave them along with Renaud's daughter Elizabeth to his youngest brother, Pierre (Peter) of France, who thenceforth became known as Peter I of Courtenay (died 1183)).

It is in the key of G minor. It started out in 1872 as an art song for voice and piano with a French text by the poet Henri Cazalis, which is based on an old French superstition.Boyd, Malcolm. \\"Dance of death\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 6 October 2015. In 1874, the composer expanded and reworked the piece into a tone poem, replacing the vocal line with a solo violin part. Analysis According to legend, Death appears at midnight every year on Halloween. Death calls forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle (here represented by a solo violin). His skeletons dance for him until the rooster crows at dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year. The piece opens with a harp playing a single note, D, twelve times (the twelve strokes of midnight) which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section. The solo violin enters playing the tritone, which was known as the diabolus in musica (\\"the Devil in music\\") during the Medieval and Baroque eras, consisting of an A and an E‚Äîin an example of scordatura tuning, the violinist's E string has actually been tuned down to an E to create the dissonant tritone. The first theme is heard on a solo flute,[IMSLP full score, page 3] followed by the second theme, a descending scale on the solo violin which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section.[full score, page 4, 4th bar] The first and second themes, or fragments of them, are then heard throughout the various sections of the orchestra. The piece becomes more energetic and at its midpoint, right after a contrapuntal section based on the second theme,[full score, page 13, rehearsal letter C] there is a direct quote[full score, page 16, rehearsal letter D] played by the woodwinds of Dies irae, a Gregorian chant from the Requiem that is melodically related to the work's second theme. The Dies irae is presented unusually in a major key. After this section the piece returns to the first and second themes and climaxes with the full orchestra playing very strong dynamics. Then there is an abrupt break in the texture[full score, page 50, 6th bar] and the coda represents the dawn breaking (a cockerel's crow, played by the oboe) and the skeletons returning to their graves. The piece makes particular use of the xylophone to imitate the sounds of rattling bones. Saint-Sa√´ns uses a similar motif in the Fossils movement of The Carnival of the Animals The progression and melody of the minor waltz are similar to the jibes (e.g. \\"their sweethearts all are dead\\") of the Sailors' Chorus in \\"Helmsman/Steersman, Leave Your Watch,\\" which begins the third act of Wagner's earlier opera, \\"The Flying Dutchman\\". Instrumentation Danse macabre is scored for an obbligato violin and an orchestra consisting of one piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons; four horns in G and D, two trumpets in D, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, xylophone, bass drum, cymbals and triangle; one harp and strings. Reception When Danse macabre was first performed it was not well received and caused widespread feelings of anxiety. The 21st century scholar, Roger Nichols, mentions adverse reaction to \\"the deformed Dies irae plainsong\\", the \\"horrible screeching from solo violin\\", the use of a xylophone, and \\"the hypnotic repetitions\\", in which Nichols hears a pre-echo of Ravel's Bol√©ro.Nichols, Roger (2012), Notes to Chandos CD CHSA 5104, OCLC 794163802 Today, it is considered one of Saint-Sa√´ns' masterpieces, widely regarded and reproduced in both high and popular culture. Transcriptions Shortly after the premiere, the piece was transcribed into a piano arrangement by Franz Liszt (S.555), a good friend of Saint-Sa√´ns.

It was first planned in 1838, completed and published in 1849, and revised in 1853 and 1859.  Obsession with death  The Dance of Death (Totentanz) from Liber Chronicarum [Nuremberg Chronicle], 1493, attr. to Michael Wolgemut Some of the titles of Liszt‚Äôs pieces, such as Totentanz, Fun√©railles, La lugubre gondola and Pens√©e des morts, show the composer's fascination with death. In the young Liszt we can already observe manifestations of his obsession with death, with religion, and with heaven and hell. According to Alan Walker, Liszt frequented Parisian \\"hospitals, gambling casinos and asylums\\" in the early 1830s, and he even went down into prison dungeons in order to see those condemned to die.  Sources of inspiration  The Triumph of Death, c. 1355 In the Romantic age, due to a fascination with everything Medieval, the aspect of fantastic or grotesquely macabre irony often replaced the original moral intent. A musical example of such irony can be found in the last movement of the Symphonie fantastique by Hector Berlioz which quotes the medieval (Gregorian) Dies Irae (Day of Judgment) melody in a shockingly modernistic manner. In 1830 Liszt attended the first performance of the symphony and was struck by its powerful originality. Liszt's Totentanz (Dance of Death), a set of variations for piano and orchestra, also paraphrases the Dies Irae plainsong. Another source of inspiration for the young Liszt was the famous fresco \\"Triumph of Death\\" by Francesco Traini (at Liszt's time attributed to Andrea Orcagna and today also to Buonamico Buffalmacco) in the Campo Santo, Pisa. Liszt had eloped to Italy with his mistress, the Countess d‚ÄôAgoult, and in 1838 he visited Pisa. Only ten years later, Liszt's first sketches materialized into a complete version of his Totentanz. Revisions followed in 1853 and 1859, and its final form was first performed at The Hague on 15 April 1865 by Liszt's student Hans von B√ºlow, to whom the work is dedicated.  Stylistic innovations  opening measures Since it is based on Gregorian material, Liszt's Totentanz contains Medieval sounding passages with canonic counterpoint, but by far the most innovative aspect of the scoring is the shockingly modernistic, even percussive, nature of the piano part. The opening comes surprisingly close to the introduction in Bart√≥k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, a work composed almost a hundred years later. This may be no coincidence since Bart√≥k frequently performed Liszt's Totentanz. Other modernistic features are the toccata like sections where the pianist's repeated notes beat with diabolic intensity and special sound effects in the orchestra‚Äîfor example, the col legno in the strings sound like shuddering or clanking bones. Richard Pohl (an early biographer) notes, \\"Every variation discloses some new character‚Äîthe earnest man, the flighty youth, the scornful doubter, the prayerful monk, the daring soldier, the tender maiden, the playful child.\\"  Extant versions  Like most Liszt pieces, a number of versions exist. Next to Liszt's first version of the Totentanz a second De Profundis version was prepared from Liszt's manuscript sources by Ferruccio Busoni (1919). The standard version is the final and third version of the piece (1859). Liszt also wrote versions for two pianos (S.652) and solo piano (S.525). Edited by Emil von Sauer, the original edition for two pianos, however, merely incorporated the solo part of Liszt's rendering for piano and orchestra, with a transcription of the orchestral accompaniment in the second piano. Dr. Andrey Kasparov has since re-imagined this setting as a work for piano duo. It shows to great effect the breadth of the Totentanz, when distributed evenly between two performers.  Notable performers  Besides the performances by Hans von B√ºlow, B√©la Bart√≥k, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Ferruccio Busoni, performances of historic significance include those of the Liszt student Jos√© Vianna da Motta (1945 ‚Äì Port Nat S IPL 108), as well as Gy√∂rgy Cziffra (EMI 74012 2), Claudio Arrau, Jorge Bolet (Decca), Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli (1961 ‚Äì Arkadia HP 507.1; 1962 ‚Äì Memoria 999-001), Michel B√©roff (EMI Classics), Byron Janis (RCA), Martha Argerich, Krystian Zimerman (Deutsche Grammophon), Arnaldo Cohen (Naxos and BIS), Raymond Lewenthal, and Enrico Pace at the Second International Franz Liszt Piano Competition in 1989.

It reached its peak popularity during the 1950s and 1960s, launching the careers of a number of artists, including: Delores Washington, Albertina Walker, Bessie Griffin, Cassietta George, Dorothy Norwood, Inez Andrews, Shirley Caesar, Josephine Howard, Rev. James Cleveland, and more. The group underwent numerous personnel changes between 1951 and 1961. 1962 to 1966 provided the Caravans with its most stable group member lineup, consisting of Washington, Walker, Caesar, George, James Herndon and Josephine Howard. The group also made frequent TV appearances during this time on shows such as TV's Gospel Time and Jubilee Showcase. Founding The Caravans were founded in 1947 under the name Robert Anderson and his Gospel Caravan by Robert Anderson in Chicago, Illinois to serve as Anderson's backing vocalists. The group consisted of Ora Lee Hopkins, Elyse Yancey, Irma Gwynn, Edward Robinson, the pianist, and Louise Overall Weaver as their organist. Their recordings between 1949 and 1951 were made under the names of Robert Anderson and Choir, Anderson Singers with Robert Anderson, Anderson Singers, and Robert Anderson and his Gospel Caravan. In 1952, Gwynn left the group, a slight change of the group's name to Robert Anderson and The Caravans was made, and Nellie Grace Daniels and Albertina Walker joined the group. The group featuring Walker and Daniels under their new name made their first and only recording on April 18, 1952. During this recording session, a sequence of events happened, resulting in Robert Anderson parting ways with his background singers. Walker, Hopkins, Yancey, and Daniels and Lelia M.Davidson of New Jersey came into the group recorded the remainder of their tracks, and adopted the group name of The Caravans simply by dropping Robert Anderson's name from the group name. Walker was the featured singer on the records that the first version of the newly emancipated Caravans made, which had the measured style typical of artists influenced by Roberta Martin. That changed, however, as other singers joined the group, which retained the close harmonies and precise rhythms of the original group, but now allowed each member the opportunity to solo on alternating leads. At their height in the late 1950s the Caravans combined the energetic, agile alto of Shirley Caesar on songs such as \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" with the powerful contralto of Inez Andrews on \\"Mary Don't You Weep, the dramatic soprano of Delores Washington, and the frenetic piano style from Eddie Williams, a friend of Washington.\\" Bessie Griffin joined the group in 1953, but left after a year. Cassietta George also joined in 1953 and stayed for two years, but returned in 1960 to stay for another year before rejoining in 1962 and staying for another four years. Norwood joined in 1955 and left in 1957, forming her own group, the Norwood Singers. Inez Andrews joined, at the suggestion of James Cleveland, the pianist and arranger for the group, in 1957 and left in 1962 to form her own group, the Andrewettes (aka: The Gospel Challengers of Jamaica, New York). Andrews returned in 1966, only to depart again and go solo in 1967. Shirley Caesar joined the Caravans in 1958 and left to pursue a solo career in 1966. 1966-2000 By 1966 the group's popularity began to dim when Shirley Caesar and Cassietta George left to pursue solo careers. In 1967, longtime members Josephine Howard, James Herndon, and Delores Washington all left the group to pursue solo careers and form their own groups, with exception to Albertina Walker, who released a solo album in 1966 without leaving the group. During this time, former members, some of which had not recorded with the group since the mid-1950s, returned for recording sessions including Inez Andrews in 1966, and Rev. James Cleveland, and Dorothy Norwood during a session in 1967. Loleatta Holloway and Julia Mae Price were also added to the group during the same 1967 recording session featuring Rev. Cleveland and Norwood. By 1968, the transition was complete, and an all new set of Caravans consisting of Walker, Loleatta Holloway, Willie James McPhatter, Julia Mae Price, Doris Willingham, and Gwen Morgan began to record for HOB records until c. 1971. In the early 1970s, The Caravans recorded some songs composed by Donny Hathaway for the small, Chicago based Caritas record label. The songs were released on a 45 rpm album. Despite this release, by 1972, the group was disbanded. In 1976, Caravans members Albertina Walker, Cassietta George, Josephine Howard, and Delores Washington reunited to record an album for the Birthright Records label with all new material titled \\"Share\\", featuring special guest Isaiah Jones, Jr. on piano. After 1976, the group members still did reunion concerts occasionally. Notable reunion concerts include a 1988 Stellar Awards performance with Albertina Walker, Inez Andrews, Shirley Caesar, Delores Washington and Rev. James Cleveland, a 1994 reunion on a Dorothy Norwood album with Albertina Walker, Dorothy Norwood, Delores Washington, and Cassietta George, and a 2004 reunion for the Malaco Records \\"Gospel Legends\\" DVD with Albertina Walker, Dorothy Norwood, Inez Andrews, Shirley Caesar, and Delores Washington. As of 2008, the group was touring with Walker, Norwood, Washington, Caesar, and Andrews. Later years Albertina Walker recently recorded a reunion album with her group The Caravans entitled \\"Paved The Way\\", which was released by Malaco Records on September 5, 2006. This was the group's first new recording since 1976. The group consisted of Walker, Norwood, Andrews, Washington, and special guest Evelyn Turrentine- Agee. The album was dubbed by Billboard Magazine as one of the most memorable releases of 2006 (Deborah Evans Price, December 9, 2006) and entered the Billboard charts in the top ten and has remained in the top forty for sixteen weeks. \\"Paved the Way\\" was recently nominated for a Grammy, Dove, & Soul Train Music Award. Albertina Walker died from respiratory failure on 8 October 2010.

It was republished on February 23, 2010 with an additional new essay entitled \\"What's Scary\\". Danse Macabre examines the various influences on King's own writing, and important genre texts of the 19th and 20th centuries. Danse Macabre explores the history of the genre as far back as the Victorian era, but primarily focuses on the 1950s to the 1970s (roughly the era covering King's own life at the time of publication). King peppers his book with informal academic insight, discussing archetypes, important authors, common narrative devices, \\"the psychology of terror\\", and his key theory of \\"Dionysian horror\\". King's novel The Stand was published in Spanish as La danza de la muerte 'The Dance of Death', which caused some confusion between the two books (A later Spanish edition of this novel was titled Apocalipsis 'Apocalypse'). The same happened in Brazil and Portugal with both countries translating The Stand as \\"A Dan√ßa da Morte\\", meaning also \\"The Dance of Death\\". Similarly, his 1978 collection of short stories Night Shift was released in France as Danse macabre in 1980. To avoid confusion, the actual \\"Danse Macabre\\" essay was given the title \\"Anatomie de l'horreur\\" (\\"An Anatomy of Horror\\") when it was released in France 14 years later, in 1995.\\"Anatomie de l'horreur\\" on French wikipedia (French). Background In the introduction, King credits Bill Thompson, the editor of his first five published novels, and later editor at Doubleday, as being the inspiration for its creation. Thompson ultimately convinced King that if he wrote such a genre survey, he would no longer have to answer tedious, repetitive interview questions on the topic. Editions Danse Macabre was originally published in hardcover by Everest House on April 20, 1981 (). Along with the trade hardcover, Everest House also published a limited edition of the book, signed by King, limited to 250 numbered copies and 15 lettered copies. The limited edition did not have a dust jacket, and instead was housed in a slipcase. Later, Berkley Books published a mass market paperback edition of the book on December 1, 1983 (). A new introduction was added to this edition, entitled \\"Forenote to the Paperback Edition\\". Among other things, King discusses the fact that he asked Dennis Etchison \\"to comb the errors\\" in the original edition, and thus the 1983 paperback edition contains the corrected text of Danse Macabre. In the book's original Forenote, readers were also asked to send in any errors to be corrected, and those were incorporated as well. On February 23, 2010, Gallery Books published a new edition of Danse Macabre (), a trade paperback with the corrected 1983 text, including both the original and the 1983 introductions, as well as a newly written piece \\"What's Scary?\\", which serves as a forenote to this 2010 edition. Synopsis The backbone of the text is King's teaching notes from several college courses he taught in the 1970s. However, Danse Macabre has a casual, non-linear writing style and expresses a desire to avoid \\"academic bullshit\\". In the introduction, titled \\"October 4, 1957, and an Invitation to Dance\\", King begins by explaining why he wrote the book, and then describes the event itself: the launching of the Soviet satellite Sputnik which inspired profound fear in him, intended as his personal introduction to what he calls \\"real horror\\". This is followed by the chapter \\"Tales of the Hook\\", specifically \\"The Hook\\"; an urban legend about young lovers parked in a car, who narrowly avoid an attack by an escaped prisoner with a hook for a hand. King uses this legend to illustrate his contention that horror in general \\"offers no characterization, no theme, no particular artifice; it does not aspire to symbolic beauty\\". In the following chapter, he creates a template for descriptions of his macabre subject. Entitled \\"Tales of the Tarot\\", the chapter has nothing to do with the familiar tarot card deck. Rather, King borrows the term to describe his observations about major archetypal characters of the horror genre, which he posits come from two British novels and one Irish: the vampire (from Dracula), the werewolf (from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), and the \\"Thing Without a Name\\" (from Frankenstein). In light of the sexually repressed Victorian Era publication of Dracula, King sees a strong sexual undercurrent to the story. Frankenstein is reviewed as \\"a Shakespearean tragedy\\", and he argues that \\"its classical unity is broken only by the author's uncertainty as to where the fatal flaw lies‚Äîis it in Victor's hubris (usurping a power that belongs only to God) or in his failure to take responsibility for his creation after endowing it with the life-spark?\\" King does not mistake Mr. Hyde for a \\"traditional\\" werewolf, but rather sees the character as the origin of the modern archetype that was later defined by werewolves. The evil-werewolf archetype, argues King, stems from the base and violent side of humanity. These major archetypes are then reviewed in their historical context, ranging from their original appearances to their modern- day equivalents, up to and including cartoon breakfast cereal characters such as Frankenberry and Count Chocula. The chapter \\"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause\\" begins with King's explanation for why he included the section: \\"I cannot divorce myself from a field in which I am mortally involved.\\" He then offers a brief family history, discussing his abandonment by his father at the age of two, his childhood in rural eastern Maine, and then explains his childhood fixation with the imagery of terror and horror, making an interesting comparison of his uncle successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. While browsing through an attic with his elder brother, King uncovered a paperback version of the H.P. Lovecraft collection The Lurker in the Shadows,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic7JnF4vStA 5:46 into the video. which had belonged to his long-since-departed father. The cover art, an illustration of a monster hiding within the recesses of a hell-like cavern beneath a tombstone, was, he writes, the moment in his life which \\"that interior dowsing rod responded to\\". King then resumes his discussion of the horror genre by making detailed commentary of horror in all forms of media, beginning with radio, then proceeding to a highly critical review of television horror, two separate chapters on horror in the motion pictures, and finally concluding with an examination of horror fiction. His critique on the radio examines such American programs as Suspense, Inner Sanctum, and Boris Karloff, and praises Arch Oboler's Lights Out. King ultimately concludes that, as a medium for horror, radio is superior to television and films, since radio's nature requires a more active use of imagination. King then turns to two separate chapters of horror in the motion pictures. In \\"The Modern American Horror Movie‚ÄîText and Subtext,\\" the \\"subtext\\" he refers to consists of unspoken social commentary he sees in the films. The 1951 film The Thing from Another World implies commentary on the threat of communism, \\"the quick, no-nonsense destruction of their favorite geopolitical villain, the dastardly Russians,\\" King writes. The popular 1973 film The Exorcist was aptly suited in the wake of the youth upheavals of the late 1960s and early '70s. 1975's The Stepford Wives, King says, \\"has some witty things to say about Women's Liberation ... and the American male's response to it\\". In The Amityville Horror, King sees \\"economic unease\\" and maintains that the film's 1979 release during an extended economic slump \\"could not have come along at a more opportune moment\\". He also calls The China Syndrome, released the same year and usually categorized as a disaster-suspense film, a horror movie that \\"synthesizes technological fears ... fears of the machinery gone out of control, run wild\\". In the following chapter, \\"The Horror Movie as Junk Food\\" King begins by making the statement: \\"I am no apologist for bad filmmaking, but once you've spent twenty years or so going to horror movies, searching for diamonds in the dreck of the B-pics ... you begin to seek the patterns and appreciate them when you find them, you begin to get a taste for really shitty movies.\\" He makes the point that his agent Kirby McCauley had selected the obscure 1977 film Rituals as his favorite, while King himself chose 1979's Tourist Trap as one that \\"wields an eerie spooky power. Wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort.\\" He continues a reviews of such films as Prophecy (1979), I Married a Monster from Outer Space (1958), The Horror of Party Beach (1964), and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), among others; concluding: \\"Bad films may sometimes be amusing, sometimes even successful, but their only real usefulness is to form that basis of comparison: to define positive values in terms of their own negative charm. They show us what to look for because it is missing in themselves.\\" King then turns his most weighty criticism toward television, borrowing Harlan Ellison's description of television as \\"the glass teat\\", and subtitling the chapter, \\"This Monster Is Brought to You by Gainesburgers\\". He reviews horror anthology programs such as Thriller, The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, Dark Shadows, and Night Gallery, ultimately concluding that television is severely limited in its ability to illustrate horror because it is enslaved to the demands of network Standards and Practices censorship and the appeasement of advertising executives that provide the financial means necessary for television to continue its free access. In the \\"Horror Fiction\\" chapter, King describes and reviews a number of horror novels written within a few decades of Danse Macabre. He discusses Peter Straub's Ghost Story, Anne Rivers Siddons's The House Next Door, Richard Matheson's The Shrinking Man, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes, Harlan Ellison's Strange Wine, Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby, The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney, Ramsey Campbell's The Doll Who Ate His Mother, and James Herbert's The Fog. His primary context is defining what impact they have had on the horror genre, and how significantly they have contributed to the popular culture. Specifically pointing out allegories in his review, King notes: The final chapter, \\"The Last Waltz\\", is a brief analysis of how the medium or horror fiction in all its forms has inspired real-life acts of violence. He describes an incident in which a woman was brutally murdered by youths who confessed to imitating a scene from a TV movie, then objectively includes an example of violence perpetrated by a woman who had been reading his novel The Stand at the time she committed the crime. \\"If it had not been shown\\", he writes, \\"stupidity and lack of imagination might well have reduced them to murdering ... in some more mundane way.\\" In an analysis of why people read and watch horror, he concludes, \\"Perhaps we go to the forbidden door or window willingly because we understand that a time comes when we must go whether we want to or not.\\" = Classification = Additionally, King classifies the genre into three well-defined, descending levels‚Äîterror, horror, and revulsion. * He describes terror as \\"the finest element\\" of the three, and the one he strives hardest to maintain in his own writing. Citing many examples, he defines \\"terror\\" as the suspenseful moment in horror before the actual monster is revealed. * Horror, King writes, is that moment at which one sees the creature/aberration that causes the terror or suspense, a \\"shock value\\". * King finally compares revulsion with the gag- reflex: a bottom-level, cheap gimmick which he admits he often resorts to in his own fiction if necessary, confessing: See also * Supernatural Horror in Literature by H.

It is the sequel to the 1992 video game Flashback. The game was released for MS-DOS and PlayStation. A version for the Dreamcast was released in 2018 by JoshProd, rebranded as Fade to Black: Flashback 2. Gameplay The game is displayed in full Gouraud shaded 3D for DOS and fully textured 3D for the PlayStation. It features an over-the-shoulder viewpoint, with almost no platform sequences. The style of the game is action-adventure. Plot The main protagonist is Conrad Hart who, in Flashback, destroyed the planet of hostile aliens called the Morphs and went into suspended animation in a spaceship that floats aimlessly through outer space. In the year 2190 (50 years later), he is found by the Morphs and imprisoned in the Lunar prison of New Alcatraz. There, he is rescued by a man who introduces himself as John O'Conner, who tells him that the Morphs beat him to Conrad's ship, and leaves Conrad a few items \\"of interest\\" (a PDA and a handgun), before destroying the camera. On the PDA is a message from John, who tells Conrad to sneak around the base. Mandragore agents left a radar-scrambler there. Conrad soon makes it to John's ship. As they blast off, Morph ships start attacking them. They teleport to Mandragore base Shadow just as the ship is destroyed. They meet Sarah Smith, the leader of the Mandragore resistance. Later, in a meeting with Mandragore commander Hank, she tells Conrad that while he was in suspended animation the Morphs attacked Earth with superior forces, which made the governments surrender. The Mandragore has far fewer people, but they refuse to give up. Agents then call Sarah and tell her that they have found the location of Professor Bergstein: Morph asteroid base D321. Sarah sends Conrad and John there to rescue him. Conrad eventually finds Bergstein, who tells him that the base must be destroyed because it contains the Morph's new mind-manipulating weapon. He gives him a datacube (similar to the holocube that is in Flashback), which he explains contains a virus that he programmed in. The virus will blow up the base when the datacube is connected to the core. They connect the virus to the core and escape the base with John as it blows up, along with the asteroid itself. Conrad is then sent to a mining facility on Mars and gets the coordinates to a Morph base, where he rescues and meets Ageer. He tells Ageer about his previous adventures. Ageer tells Conrad that he and his people, an ancient alien race referred to as the \\"Ancients\\", want to join the Mandragore and can lead them to victory. Soon, Ageer tells Conrad that he must find the oracle in Pluto, the homeland of the Ancients. Conrad travels to Pluto with Ageer, who then tells Conrad that the oracle will lead him to the pyramid. As he travels, he finds a glass eyeball that he gives to a hand creature that then gives him the oracle. The oracle does lead Conrad to the pyramid, which Ageer uses to give the history of the Ancients to Conrad: \\"The Ancients live in peace until the Morphs arrive. The Ancients think that they come in peace and they welcome them. However, the Morphs attack the ancients. The Ancients put their souls in the pyramid, which is then captured by the Morphs.\\" The Morphs stole the pyramid and a new and apparently invincible creature, the Super Morph, arrives to kill Conrad. After avoiding him, he is teleported by Ageer to a Morph base in which he makes through looking for the stolen pyramid. In the meantime, he sees John telling Master Brain that their plan has become a success; with his identity, he has managed to infiltrate Shadow and put in an active detonation device. Master Brain tells John that someone is spying on them. John looks back, sees Conrad, and then transforms into his true identity: the Super Morph. After avoiding him, Conrad quickly takes the pyramid with a Morph ship and returns to Shadow, which is then attacked by the Morphs. Conrad fights his way through the Morphs as agents get killed. Conrad gets a key from a rescued soldier, which gives him access to the command room, where Conrad meets Hank. He tells Conrad that Sarah can give him the code to disable the detonation device, but she has been taken hostage by a Morph. Conrad gets to the floor and saves Sarah, who then gives him the code and teleports away. After Conrad disables the device, Ageer and Hank enter the command room as Sarah explains their new plan. The Ancients have given the Mandragore the ability to know where the central Master Brain is on Easter Island in planet Earth. She and Conrad will teleport there and destroy it. As they arrive, they separate. Conrad eventually teleports to the central Master Brain and throws the oracle in front of it. As he then teleports away, the oracle disappears and leaves behind the pyramid, which now contains the souls of the Ancients. The Ancients then fight the central Master Brain. The Ancients sacrifice themselves in order to destroy the central Master Brain. As Conrad flees Easter Island, it starts exploding, and the Super Morph gives chase. From here there are two endings: * If Conrad reunites with Sarah and goes to the ship, they enter it and Sarah begins starting its engines. The Super Morph attempts to attack, but Sarah pulls down on a control stick, directing the jet blast of one of the engines upon the Super Morph, killing it. Sarah then skillfully pilots the ship off Easter Island just as it explodes. As the ship rendezvous with a fleet of other vessels, Hank, on behalf of the Mandragore, transmits his congratulations and appreciation to Conrad on his efforts in destroying the Morphs. As Sarah pilots the ship into hyperdrive back to Shadow headquarters, a voice-over of Conrad is heard explaining that he was no longer alone. He speaks of the ships behind him, consisting of people on their way to Earth in a homecoming upon the defeat of the Morph menace after many decades of trying exile. Conrad, confidently declaring that no one would ever be alone again, anxiously rejoins his comrades of the Mandragore at Shadow headquarters. * If Conrad gets to the ship alone, then he does the exact things that Sarah does in the other ending, including killing the Super Morph. However, he must fly off of Easter Island on his own. He successfully does just as Easter Island explodes. Hank seems unaware of Sarah's death as he does not mention it when he transmits his congratulations to Conrad. Although ships are converging on Earth and the Morphs have been destroyed, Conrad's future relationship with the Mandragore is left unknown. Development The idea of doing a 3D sequel to Flashback started in 1993. The game was originally announced under the title \\"Crossfire\\". Conrad's animations were created using motion capture. Reception The PlayStation version was a bestseller in the UK,Gallup UK Playstation sales chart, September 1996, published in the Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 10 and sold enough copies to go Platinum. Fade to Black received a moderately positive critical response.Fade to Black at GameRankings Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PlayStation version their \\"Game of the Month\\" award. Reviewers generally criticized the game's steep difficulty and blocky polygon models, but praised the background graphics and animations, and generally concluded that the game's close blend of action and puzzling in a 3D environment was a success. Fade to Black was named the 29th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The editors called it \\"an adrenaline-pumping polygon adventure\\" and \\"an intriguing game\\". Cancelled sequel Flashback Legend was an unfinished second sequel of Flashback. It was in co-development by Delphine Software International and Adeline Software International for a planned release in 2003. As opposed to Fade to Black, it was going to be a 2D side-scroller game, like Flashback, but without non- scrolling areas. It was targeted exclusively for the Game Boy Advance.Flashback Legends at Unseen64 The game was cancelled when Delphine went bankrupt and ceased operations in the end of 2002. However, a prototype ROM, dated 21 June 2002, was leaked and spread over the Internet at some point. It features all 16 levels with minor glitches and one music track, which is a compressed tune from Fade to Black. Despite multi-language options the beta can only be played in French with an English pause menu, but can be played in English via a fan-made patch.

He was known for his speed, fluid moves, grace, and jumping ability. A consistent big-play threat throughout his career, his 20.1 average yards per reception is the highest in NFL history among players with at least 300 receptions. As a star halfback in college for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team, Warfield was twice named to the All-Big Ten Conference team. He was drafted in the first round of the 1964 NFL Draft by the Browns and converted into a wide receiver. After three Pro Bowl appearances with the Browns, he was traded to the Dolphins, with whom he made another five Pro Bowl appearances. He then spent one season in the WFL with the Southmen before returning to the Browns for his final two seasons of play. Warfield played in seven championship games in his professional career‚Äîfour NFL Championship Games with the Browns and three Super Bowls with the Dolphins‚Äîand earned victories in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, Super Bowl VII, and Super Bowl VIII. After his playing career, he served as a scout and adviser for the Browns for several years. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983, and is a member of the Cleveland Browns Ring of Honor and the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll. Early years and college Paul Dryden Warfield was born in Warren, Ohio. His father, Dryden Warfield, was a deacon in a Baptist church. Warfield attended Warren G. Harding High School in Warren, where he was a star running back and defensive back for the Panthers. He scored 92 points as a junior in 1958, a campaign highlighted by a 6‚Äì0 victory over powerhouse Massillon Washington High School. The following season, as a senior he scored 93 points, including all three of his team's touchdowns in the final game of the season. As a basketball player he was noted for his speed, often leading fast breaks. He also ran track and field at Warren G. Harding, and was the Ohio High School Athletic Association Class AA broad jump champion in 1958.https://ohsaa.org/sports/tf/pastresults/TF_1958.pdf During the 1960 season he set a Class AA state record while winning the 180-yard hurdles.https://ohsaa.org/sports/tf/pastresults/TF_1960.pdf Warfield then attended Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team under coach Woody Hayes. As he did in high school, he continued to star as both a running back and defensive back. As the secondary ball- carrier behind fullback Bob Ferguson during Ohio State's national championship season in 1961, Warfield carried 77 times for 420 yards and five touchdowns. He was a third-team All-Big Ten Conference selection by the conference's coaches. In 1962 he rushed for 367 yards and two touchdowns, and his 6.4 yards-per-carry average led the Big Ten. As a senior in 1963 he rushed for 260 yards and a touchdown and caught 22 passes for 266 yards and three touchdowns. He was voted by the Big Ten's coaches as the first-team halfback on both the 1962 and 1963 All-Big Ten teams. A two-time letterman in track and field at Ohio State, Warfield competed as a broad jumper, hurdler, and sprinter. He excelled as a broad jumper, recording a personal best of 26 feet 2 inches, and was an Olympic prospect before he decided to play professional football. Professional career=Cleveland Browns= The Cleveland Browns selected Warfield with the 11th pick of the 1964 NFL Draft. There was some thought for Warfield to play as a defensive back. But during workouts prior to the season, his play as a wide receiver impressed head coach Blanton Collier, and he was converted to the position. In his rookie season, he caught 52 passes for 920 yards and nine touchdowns. He averaged 17.8 yards per reception, and his speed served to complement the power of star running back Jim Brown. The Browns finished the season atop the East Division with a 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, and defeated the Baltimore Colts 27‚Äì0 in the 1964 NFL Championship Game. Warfield was invited to his first Pro Bowl and was named a first-team All-Pro by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). In the 1965 Chicago College All-Star Game, which annually pitted the reigning NFL champion against star college players, Warfield shattered his collarbone and missed the majority of the 1965 season as a result. He returned for the penultimate game of the season and caught three passes for 30 yards before bruising his collarbone, causing him to miss the final game of the regular season. The Browns returned to the NFL Championship Game in 1965, in which Warfield caught two passes for 30 yards in a 23‚Äì12 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Warfield returned to form in 1966, catching 36 passes for 741 yards and five touchdowns, and in 1967 recorded 32 receptions for 702 yards and eight touchdowns. In 1968, Warfield caught 50 passes and for the only time in his career eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards, finishing with 1,067. His career-high 12 receiving touchdowns led the league that year. The Browns again reached the NFL Championship Game, where they were shutout by the Baltimore Colts, 34‚Äì0. Warfield earned first-team All-Pro honors from the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), Pro Football Weekly, and NEA, and made another Pro Bowl appearance. After another NFL championship game appearance for the Browns and Pro Bowl season for Warfield in 1969, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins for the third pick in the 1970 draft. The trade came as a shock to Warfield, who had established himself as one of the Browns' most popular players. \\"I have to admit going to Miami was not a place I desired to go,\\" said Warfield 30 years later.Grossi 2004, p. 46. The Browns used the pick acquired in the trade on Purdue University quarterback Mike Phipps. The trade is considered one of the most lopsided in NFL history, as Phipps had only limited success for the Browns, while Warfield was a major factor in the Dolphins' championships in the early 1970s. =Miami Dolphins= In need of a deep-play receiver, Dolphins head coach Don Shula stated he \\"jumped at the chance\\" to acquire Warfield, saying he had always admired him and called him \\"a real thoroughbred, equal to the best in the game.\\" In his first season with Miami, Warfield caught only 28 passes but recorded 703 yards, an average of 25.1 yards per catch. He was invited to his first Pro Bowl with the Dolphins and was named a second-team All-Pro by the NEA. The Dolphins finished with a 10‚Äì4 record and lost to the Oakland Raiders in the divisional round of the 1970 playoffs. In 1971, Warfield caught 43 passes for 996 yards and again led the league in receiving touchdowns, with 11. He earned first-team All-Pro honors from the AP and UPI, among other selectors, and made his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl appearance. Through the Dolphins' first two games of the 1971 playoffs, against the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Colts, Warfield caught nine passes for 265 yards and a touchdown. Shortly before Super Bowl VI between the Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys, President Richard Nixon famously telephoned Dolphins coach Don Shula to suggest that they run a particular pass play to Warfield. The play, a down- and-in pattern, was tried and resulted in an incomplete pass. Covered by star defensive back Mel Renfro, Warfield was limited to four receptions for 39 yards as the Dolphins were defeated 24‚Äì3. Warfield missed two games in the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season due to an injured foot but still led the team with 606 receiving yards. Through Miami's three postseason games of 1972, Warfield caught seven passes for 149 yards and carried the ball twice for 41 yards. The Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII to earn their first Super Bowl title. Although Warfield caught only 29 passes during the 1973 season, 11 of those receptions were touchdowns, with four coming in the first half of the regular season finale over the Detroit Lions. In the Dolphins' three playoff games that year, Warfield caught seven passes for 155 yards and a touchdown. The Dolphins reached the Super Bowl for the third consecutive year, and won it for the second straight time by defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII. In 1974, Warfield caught 27 passes for 536 yards and two touchdowns, and was invited to the last of seven consecutive Pro Bowls. The Dolphins again reached the playoffs, this time losing to the Raiders in the divisional round. Through five seasons with the Dolphins, Warfield compiled 156 receptions for 3,355 yards and 33 touchdowns. In 11 playoff games, he caught 34 passes for 717 yards and four touchdowns. =Memphis Southmen= In March 1974, he was selected by the Toronto Northmen in the second round (23rd overall) of the WFL Pro Draft. Prior to the start of the 1974 season, Warfield and teammates Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick made what were then surprising decisions. They left the Dolphins at the conclusion of the season for what appeared to be more lucrative pastures with the Northmen of World Football League (WFL). The Northmen then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, without playing a game in Toronto, and became the Memphis Southmen. Warfield played the 1975 season with the Memphis Southmen, catching 25 passes for 422 yards and three touchdowns. =Return to Browns and retirement= After the dissolution of the WFL following the 1975 season, Warfield told reporters he would be interested in rejoining the Browns if the Southmen were not admitted into the NFL. The Southmen were refused admittance, and Warfield was ultimately persuaded to rejoin by Browns owner Art Modell, who felt Warfield would be a valuable asset as both a receiver and in public relations. Warfield played his final two pro football seasons in Cleveland, catching 38 passes for 613 yards and six touchdowns in 1976 and 18 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns in 1977. In his eight years with the Browns, he caught 271 passes for 5,210 yards and 52 touchdowns. In his 13 NFL seasons Warfield caught 427 passes for 8,565 yards for 20.1 yards per catch and scored 85 touchdowns. He added another 204 yards on 22 rushing attempts. In 18 playoff games, he caught 58 passes for 1,121 yards and five touchdowns. His 85 career receiving touchdowns is tied for 15th most in NFL history, and his 20.1 average yards per reception is tied for the fourth highest among players with at least 200 career receptions and the highest among players with at least 300 receptions.  Honors and later life  Warfield was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983, his first year of eligibility, one of only five Dolphins to accomplish this feat (Jim Langer, Jason Taylor, Don Shula and Dan Marino). He is a member of the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team as one of the best players of the decade. In 1999, he was ranked 60th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. He is on the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll, and was an inaugural inductee into the Cleveland Browns Ring of Honor in 2010. Warfield participated in the opening coin flip for the Ohio State‚ÄìMichigan game in 2006 between the No. 1-ranked Buckeyes and No. 2-ranked Wolverines. In 2013, Warren G. Harding High School erected a life-size statue of Warfield near the school's stadium. In 1977, Warfield earned a master's degree in telecommunications from Kent State University. During his time as a student, Warfield was a sportscaster for the morning drive program on the university's radio station, WKSU-FM, and presided over the station's first pledge drive in April 1974 following its conversion to a public radio outlet. He worked for WKYC in Cleveland as a sportscaster from 1977 to 1980. He also later served as president of a management consultant firm in Moraine, Ohio. From 1981 to 1987, he worked as director of player relations for the Browns, and from 2004 to 2010 was senior adviser to the general manager for the team. Warfield is retired and resides in Rancho Mirage, California.

Known for his quickness and strength despite his small stature, Willis was one of the dominant defensive football players of the 1940s and early 1950s. He was named an All-Pro in every season of his career and reached the NFL's Pro Bowl in three of the four seasons he played in the league. His techniques and style of play were emulated by other teams, and his versatility as a pass-rusher and coverage man influenced the development of the modern-day linebacker position. When he retired, Cleveland coach Paul Brown called him \\"one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football\\". Willis was one of the first two African Americans to play professional football in the modern era, signing with the Browns and playing a game in September 1946 along with Marion Motley, a contest which took place months before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers.Gary Webster, The League That Didn't Exist: A History of the All-America Football Conference. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2019; pp. 1-2. Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis attended Ohio State University, where he joined the track and football teams. He was part of a Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State coach, Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950. Willis retired in 1954 to focus on helping troubled youth, first as Cleveland's assistant recreation commissioner and later as the chairman of the Ohio Youth Commission. He remained in that position until his death in 2007. Willis was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame in the 1970s. He married Odessa Porter and had three sons, William, Jr., Clement and Dan. Early life William Karnet Willis was born in Georgia on October 5, 1921, the son of Clement and Williana \\"Anna\\" Willis.1930 Federal Census, 1940 Federal Census The family moved to Columbus, Ohio about 1922. His father died of pneumonia on April 10, 1923,Ohio Death Certificate for Clem Willis, Union Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio records and he was raised by his grandfather and mother amid the financial hardships of the Great Depression. He ran dashes and threw the shot put on the track team and played on the football team at Columbus East High School. Worried about being compared to his older brother Claude, who had been an All-State fullback at the same school a few years earlier, Willis eschewed the backfield to play tackle and end. He had a successful three years on the high school team, winning Honorable Mention All-State honors as a senior. After graduating from high school, Willis took a year off and worked. Willis's high school coach wrote to Paul Brown, the Ohio State University football coach, saying the school should recruit him because he matched the type of player Brown liked: large, but more importantly, quick. He enrolled at Ohio State in 1941. College career Willis, c. 1943 Willis was small for a lineman at 202 pounds, and despite signing up to play for Brown he was initially expected to focus on track and the 60-yard and 100-yard dashes. Brown, however, brought him onto the football team as a sophomore in 1942. Willis played middle guard, a defensive position opposite the center. That year, the Buckeyes posted a 9‚Äì1 record and won the Big Ten Conference. The team was voted national champion by the Associated Press, a first for the school. Before the following season, scores of Ohio State players left the school to join the military as American involvement in World War II intensified. Willis volunteered for the U.S. Army, but was classified as 4-F, or only available for service in case of a national emergency, due to varicose veins. With many stars gone, however, Brown fielded a team composed mostly of 17-year-olds who were not yet eligible for military service. The \\"Baby Bucks\\", as they were called, fell to 3‚Äì6, although Willis was named a first-team All Conference selection in the Big Ten. By the 1944 season, Brown had joined the military and was coaching a team at Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago. Under his substitute, coach Carroll Widdoes, the Buckeyes completed an undefeated season. Willis was named to the United Press International and Look magazine All-America teams. He played in the 1944 College All-Star Game at Chicago, and was named the game's outstanding player. Professional career A professional football career was unlikely for Willis when he graduated from Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis took a job as the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort. Willis, however, still wanted to play football. \\"My heart was not really in coaching\\", he later said. He read that Paul Brown was coaching a team in the newly formed All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and he gave Brown a call. Brown said he would get back to Willis on a possible tryout. In the meantime, Willis was recruited by the Montreal Alouettes, a team in the Canadian Football League. Not hearing back from Brown, he planned to go play in Canada. Willis was about to leave for Montreal when Paul Hornung, a sportswriter for the Columbus Dispatch, called with a message from Brown. Hornung told Willis to go for a tryout in Bowling Green, Ohio, where the new team, the Cleveland Browns, was holding its training camp. Willis went to the camp and impressed Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. \\"He was quick\\", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. \\"I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything you would want to see.\\" Marion Motley and Willis (right) were two of the first African-American professional football players in the modern era. Willis made the team, and 10 days later the Browns signed a second African-American player, fullback Marion Motley. Willis played middle guard for the Browns, lining up opposite the center but often dropping back into coverage to defend the pass. He had a playing style and physique similar to that of the modern-day linebacker. For Brown, signing Willis and Motley was nothing unusual. Brown had black players on his teams from the time he coached at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio. The coach did not care about race one way or the other; he wanted to field the best team he could. \\"I never considered football players black or white, nor did I keep or cut a player just because of his color\\", Brown wrote in his autobiography. In joining the Browns in 1946, Willis and Motley were two of four professional football players who broke the color barrier in 1946, a year before Jackie Robinson became Major League Baseball's first black player in the modern era. Brown later added other black players to the team, including Horace Gillom and Len Ford. With the Browns, Willis became an anchor on defense as the team dominated the AAFC. The team won each of the league's four championship games before the AAFC folded and the Browns, along with two other teams, were absorbed by the National Football League (NFL) following the 1949 season. Willis was named to all-AAFC teams in every year of its existence. While the team was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field incidents also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to a game against the Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where the team was staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all- star game in Houston, Texas. The Browns' success continued when the team entered the NFL in 1950. In a playoff game that year against the New York Giants, Willis caught up with running back Gene \\"Choo-Choo\\" Roberts on a breakaway reception in the fourth quarter to prevent the touchdown and ensure a Browns victory. \\"I knew it meant the ball game\\", he said. \\"I just had to catch him.\\" The Browns beat the Giants 8‚Äì3 and went on to win the NFL championship in 1950. Willis was one of seven Browns players chosen for the first-ever Pro Bowl that year. The 1951 and 1952 seasons were equally successful for Willis, although the Browns lost in the NFL championship to the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions. He was an all-pro selection and was named to the Pro Bowl in both years. In 1953, when the Browns lost a third championship game in a row, Willis was named an all-pro but did not make the Pro Bowl. Both Willis and Motley retired after the 1953 season. Willis was 32 years old and had played eight seasons for the Browns, earning all-pro honors every year he played. He was the best player on a strong defense that was crucial to Cleveland's success in the AAFC and NFL. He was also the embodiment of what Brown looked for in his players: speed and intelligence instead of size. At around 210 pounds, he was small for a lineman, even in his era. Willis's play as a powerful but quick middle guard influenced the development of the modern linebacker position. \\"In my opinion Bill ranks as one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football\\", Brown said when he retired. \\"He certainly was the fastest and many coaches use his technique as a model in teaching line play.\\" Later career and death Willis retired because he wanted to concentrate on other activities; he had become a popular figure in Ohio and worked with youth in Cleveland and Columbus. He accepted a $6,570-a-year job as Cleveland's assistant recreation commissioner. \\"This is the type of work I want to do, working with kids\\", he said. By the late 1970s, he was the chairman of the Ohio Youth Commission, a state agency created to combat criminality among young people. He died in 2007. He was married to Odessa Porter until her death in 2002. The couple had three sons, William, Jr., Clement and Dan. Honors and legacy Willis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. In 1977, he was inducted as a charter member of the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame. He was elected the same year to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Ohio State University honored Willis on November 3, 2007 by retiring his #99 jersey. Willis was named as a finalist for the NFL 100 All-Time Team at the defensive lineman position.

It is the last of the Macintosh II family of Macintosh computers. The IIvx was introduced at the same time as the Macintosh IIvi, Performa 600 and Performa 600CD, with all four models using the same new metal case design. Like the Performa 600CD, the IIvx could be equipped with an internal double-speed CD-ROM drive. While the IIvx shares the model designation of other Macintosh II computers, Apple considers the IIvx to be the first computer in the Macintosh Centris line. According to Apple, their lawyers were unable to complete the trademark check on the \\"Centris\\" name in time for the IIvx's release. Machines bearing the Centris name were introduced a few months later. The IIvx was described in a MacWorld magazine review as having \\"the best price-to-performance ratio of any computer Apple has ever built.\\" The list price for a machine with an hard drive, main memory, and of video memory was US$2,949. Adding the CD-ROM and upgrading to of main memory and video memory increased the price to US$3,219, which Macworld deemed to be \\"the best CD-ROM drive bargain ever offered\\". The much more powerful Macintosh Centris 650 was released four months after the IIvx for $250 less, immediately rendering the IIvx obsolete. The IIvx's base price was slashed by more than a third. Because of increasing competition from Dell and other PC manufacturers, prices of the IIvx continued to fall quickly; by the end of June 1993, the price of the 5/80 + CD-ROM configuration had dropped to $1,799, about half its original price. For a while afterwards, people who bought an expensive Mac that quickly became outdated were said to have been \\"IIvx-ed\\". Overview The Mac IIvx began its life in development as a proof-of-concept to see how an internal CD-ROM drive could be added to a Mac. But after Apple CEO John Sculley gave a speech at MacWorld Tokyo promising a Mac with a CD-ROM drive, the IIvx was rushed into production. Several shortcuts were taken in its design; most notably, its 32 MHz processor was crippled by a 16 MHz bus, making it slightly slower than the popular but aging Macintosh IIci. Its serial port was limited to 57.6 kbit/s, which could cause problems with serial connections and MIDI hardware. The Macintosh IIvi (a slower version of the IIvx with a 16 MHz processor) was introduced at the same time in some markets (though not the United States) but discontinued four months later. Representing the high end of the original Performa lineup, the Performa 600 was also based on the same architecture. The IIvx was one of the only Macintosh II models with a 32K L2 cache, following the IIfx's onboard 32K cache and the IIci's optional 32K cache card; neither the IIvi nor the Performa 600 supported an L2 cache, despite their similarities to the IIvx. Hardware The IIvx was sold with hard drives ranging in capacity from 40 to , three NuBus slots, and a Processor Direct Slot. The Macintosh IIvx uses the same case as the Macintosh Performa 600, which was itself reused for the Centris 650 (later known as the Quadra 650). It can be upgraded to this machine by swapping the logic board. The IIvx case was also used for the Power Macintosh 7100.

Matilda supported Stephen in his struggle for the English throne against her cousin Empress Matilda. Queen Matilda played an unusually active role for a woman of the period when her husband was captured, and proved herself an effective general who managed to force the Empress to release Stephen. Under the agreement that settled the civil war, the Queen's children did not inherit the English throne. However, her three surviving children ruled Boulogne in turn as Eustace IV, William I, and Marie I. Life She was born in Boulogne, France, the daughter of Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, and his wife Mary, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Through her maternal grandmother, Matilda was descended from the pre-Conquest English kings. =Countess of Boulogne= In 1125, Matilda married Stephen of Blois, Count of Mortain, who possessed a large honour in England. When Matilda's father abdicated and retired to a monastery the same year, this was joined with Boulogne and the similarly large English honour Matilda inherited. On Eustace III's death, Matilda and her husband became joint rulers of Boulogne. Two children, a son and a daughter, were born to the countess and count of Boulogne during the reign of King Henry I, who had granted them a residence in London.Agnes Strickland, Elisabeth Strickland: Lives of the Queens of England The son was named Baldwin, after Matilda's uncle, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. The daughter was named Matilda. Baldwin died in early childhood and the young Matilda is thought to have died during childhood too, although she lived long enough to be espoused to Waleran de Meulan, Earl of Worcester. = Queenship = On the death of Henry I of England in 1135, Stephen rushed to England, taking advantage of Boulogne's control of the closest seaports, and was crowned king, beating his rival, the Empress Matilda. Matilda of Boulogne was heavily pregnant at that time and crossed the Channel after giving birth to a son, William, who would one day succeed as count of Boulogne. Matilda was crowned queen at Easter, on 22 March 1136. Matilda was a supporter of the Knights Templar. She founded Cressing Temple in Essex in 1137 and Temple Cowley in Oxford in 1139. Like her predecessor, Matilda of Scotland, she had a close relationship with the Holy Trinity Priory at Aldgate. She took the prior as her confessor and two of her children were buried there. In the civil war that followed, known as the Anarchy, Matilda proved to be her husband's strongest supporter. When England was invaded in 1138, she called troops from Boulogne and its ally Flanders, and besieged Dover Castle with success and then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with David I of Scotland in 1139. After Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, she rallied the king's partisans, and raised an army with the help of William of Ypres. While the Empress Matilda waited in London to prepare her coronation, Matilda and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois had her chased out of the city. The Empress Matilda went on to besiege Henry of Blois at Winchester. Matilda of Boulogne then commanded her army to attack the besiegers. There was a rout in which the Empress's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, was captured. The two Matildas then agreed to exchange prisoners and Stephen ruled as king again. Matilda died of a fever at Hedingham Castle, Essex, England, and is buried at Faversham Abbey, which she and her husband founded.

He is known for having scouted and developed what became known as the Chisholm Trail, later used to drive cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the post-Civil War period. He had originally used this trail to supply his various trading posts among the Native American tribes in Indian Territory, what is now western Oklahoma. He worked with Black Beaver, a Lenape guide, to develop the trail. Chisholm died before the peak period of the cattle drives from Texas to Kansas; but he was important to numerous events in Texas and Oklahoma history. He served as an interpreter for both the Republic of Texas and the United States government in treaty-making with Native American tribes. Early life and education Chisholm's father, Ignatius, was of Scottish descent and probably also a trader, and his mother Martha (n√©e Rogers) was a Cherokee from the region of Great Hiwassee. As the Cherokee had matrilineal kinship, Jesse was considered to belong to his mother's people. He moved with his mother to Indian Territory during the early period when some Cherokee migrated there voluntarily from the Southeast, and grew up in Cherokee culture. Career In 1826, Chisholm became involved in working for a gold-seeking party, who blazed a trail and explored the region to present-day Wichita, Kansas. In 1830, he helped blaze a trail from Fort Gibson to Fort Towson. In 1834, he was a member of the Dodge- Leavenworth Expedition, who made the first contact with the southern Plains Indians on behalf of the United States federal government. In 1836, Chisholm married Eliza Edwards. They resided in the area of her father's trading post on the Little River near its confluence with the Canadian River in Indian Territory. Chisholm worked as a trader. Monument to Jesse Chisholm in Bandera, Texas Fluent in several languages, Chisholm served as an interpreter and general aid in several treaties between the Republic of Texas and local Indian tribes, as well as between the United States federal government and various tribes after Texas joined the United States. This diplomatic work spanned 20 years, between 1838 and 1858. During this period, he also continued in the Indian trade, trading manufactured goods for peltry and for cattle. During the Civil War, he mostly remained neutral. Many residents of Indian Territory feared they might be massacred, either intentionally or as an accident of war if either side attempted to contend for control of the territory. Chisholm led a band of refugees to the western part of the territory. For some time, they suffered privation, as the trade had dried up during the war, as well. At the end of the war, he settled permanently near present-day Wichita, Kansas, and again began to trade into Indian Territory. He built up what had been a military and Indian trail into a road capable of carrying heavy wagons for his goods. This road later became known as Chisholm's Trail. When the Texas-to- Kansas cattle drives started, the users of the trail renamed it the Chisholm Trail. Death and legacy Chisholm died on March 4, 1868, at his last camp near Left Hand Spring (now Oklahoma), due to food poisoning. He was buried there. In 1974 Chisholm was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners.https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/hall-of-great-westerners/ His grave site in Blaine County is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is named after the East Anglian town of Cromer in England where interglacial deposits that accumulated during part of this stage were first discovered. The stratotype for this interglacial is the Cromer Forest Bed situated at the bottom of the coastal cliff near West Runton. The Cromerian stage preceded the Anglian and Elsterian glacials and show an absence of glacial deposits in western Europe, which led to the historical terms Cromerian interglacial and the Cromerian warm period (). It is now known that the Cromerian consisted of multiple glacial and interglacial periods.B√∂se et al. (2012), Quaternary Glaciations of Northern Europe, Quaternary Science Reviews 44, 1-25.  Chronology  The core of the Cromerian is the first half of the Middle Pleistocene stage (Ionian) approximately 800-500 ka ago, just before the Anglian glaciation. In terms of Marine isotope stages (MIS) this corresponds to MIS 19 to MIS 13. Some authors instead put the start at MIS 22, corresponding to a start 900 ka ago, which includes the last 100 ka of the Calabrian stage, after the Beestonian Stage.Lee et al. (2011), The Glacial History of the British Isles during the early and Middle Pleistocene: Implications for the long-term development of the British Ice Sheet, Quaternary Glaciations-Extent and Chronology, pages 59-74, Elsevier. Some sources today correlate the Elster glaciation to MIS 10 instead of MIS 12, while keeping the Cromerian running up to the start of the Elsterian. The result is an end to the Cromerian stage in continental Europe at the end of MIS 11 (400 ka ago), and that the continental Cromerian continues beyond its end in Britain and Ireland and runs in parallel to the Anglian and Hoxnian Stages (MIS 12-11). In the Alpine region the corresponding stage is called G√ºnz. The Cromerian had been equated to the Aftonian in North America. However, the Aftonian, along with the Yarmouthian (Yarmouth), Kansan, and Nebraskan, have been abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian.Hallberg, G.R., 1986, Pre-Wisconsin glacial stratigraphy of the Central Plains region in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, Quaternary Science Reviews. vol. 5, pp. 11-15.Richmond, G.M. and D.S. Fullerton, 1986, Summation of Quaternary glaciations in the United States of America, Quaternary Science Reviews. vol. 5, pp. 183-196. At this time, the Cromerian is correlated with the period of time, which includes the Pre- Illinoian C, Pre-Illinoian D, and Pre-Illinoian E glaciations of North America.Walker, M., 2005, Quaternary Dating Methods, John Wiley & Son, Chichester, United Kingdom. Proposals for structuring the Cromerian complex have become quite confusing. Great potential for a full breakdown has been provided by the extensive, continental series at Gorleben.Thomas Litt, Karl- Ernst Behre, Klaus-Dieter Meyer, Hans-J√ºrgen Stephan und Stefan Wansa: Stratigraphische Begriffe f√ºr das Quart√§r des norddeutschen Vereisungsgebietes. Eiszeitalter und Gegenwart (Quaternary Science Journal), 56(1/2), 2007, pp. 22-23  Glacial cycles  Based on a lack of glacial evidence in Western Europe for the Middle Pleistocene (Ionian) before the Anglian glaciation, the Cromerian was originally thought to be a period without major glaciations. However, there is evidence for ice-rafting of material across the North Sea from this period. Investigations in the 1950s of oxygene isotopes in deep sea core samples revealed five glacial cycles during MIS 22 - MIS 13. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition to the 100,000 year glacial cycle became established during the Cromerian. Four of the glaciations (MIS 22, MIS 20, MIS 18, MIS 14) were moderate, probably involving low-land glaciation in Scandinavia, but not spreading to England and northern Germany. One of the glaciations, Marine Isotope Stage 16 (MIS 16), is globally as strong as the most recent glaciations, MIS 6 (main Saale) and MIS 2 (Weichel/Devensian). There is plenty of evidence in Russia for a major glaciation during this stage, which is called the Don Glaciation and believed to correspond to MIS 16. It is not clear why western Europe seems so unaffected by this major glacial.Cambridge Quaternary Palaeoenvironments Group: Don Glaciation  Fossils  In 1990 the West Runton Mammoth skeleton was found, the best example of the species Mammuthus trogontherii to be unearthed so far. A significant fossil site, with animal remains dating about 600,000 years ago, is the Mosbach Sands, named after an abandoned village near Wiesbaden, Germany.Ernst Probst: Deutschland in der Urzeit.

From the age of 15 years she played bass guitar in her older sister, Rebecca Boucher Burns (Becca)'s band Eat the Menu (later named The Mercy Bell), which issued a debut album, Whoosh, in 1996. Since mid-2000 Boucher has lived in Nashville, United States, and has released four solo albums, Flutterby (October 2003), Scary Fragile (June 2009), a self-titled album (April 2012), and a 10th-anniversary celebration of Flutterby called Happy Birthday Flutterby (23 August 2014). Since 2008, Boucher has recorded material for Ten Out of Tenn, a Nashville-based music collective. Boucher is also a member of the pop rock trio Elle Macho. Biography Butterfly Giselle Grace Boucher was born on 2 June 1979 in Adelaide, the fourth of seven daughters. Her first name, Butterfly, was a suggestion from a friend of the family. Her parents are Vivienne, a ballet dancer, and Rodney \\"Rod\\" Boucher. Rod had a career as a professional singer/musician during the 1970s and 1980s specialising in Christian and rock music. Boucher's sisters are Danielle Boucher (later a film director, actor, production designer), Rebecca Boucher Burns (now in band Belle of the Ball), Sunshine Boucher March (a ceramicist), Eden (born ca. 1981, member of Lovers Electric, and known for clothing design as 'Eden honeydew'), Angelle (a former model), and Harmony (singer of Vuvuvultures and a Models 1 model). Her family travelled outback Australia during Boucher's early years. Her parents are French Quebecers. From the age of 15 years, Boucher played bass guitar for Eat the Menu (later renamed The Mercy Bell), which was formed in Brisbane in 1992 by her sister Becca on lead vocals, and Josh Thomson on guitars and backing vocals. In June 1996, Eat the Menu issued an album, Whoosh, with a line-up of Boucher, Becca, Thomson on acoustic guitar, and Dale Rankine on drums. Whoosh was re-released a year later under the band's new name, The Mercy Bell. In 1998, The Mercy Bell relocated to the United States ‚Äì Nashville and Los Angeles ‚Äì for six months and then the United Kingdom. They had signed with Polydor, but Boucher became disillusioned working with the major label, \\"I don't think they did any promotion for that first record. There weren't even posters. It was like suddenly we were signed, but it didn't change anything\\". Plans for a second album were shelved amid wrangles with the label. While The Mercy Bell was in hiatus, Boucher was working on her solo material, initially in Stockton, UK. By mid-2000, she had returned to live in Nashville. Thomson returned to Australia and Becca remained in the UK, where she later married Benjamin Burns and by 2011 performed a travelling \\"lo-fi pop event\\", Burns Bistro. On 7 October 2003, Boucher released her debut solo album, Flutterby, on Universal and A&M; Records. She co-produced and co-engineered it with Robin Eaton, Ron Fair, and Brad Jones at Alex the Great Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. AllMusic's Robert L. Doerschuk described Flutterby as \\"[a] low-key tour de force, [it] reflects an uncommon maturity and breadth of talent, particularly for a debut effort. Boucher commands all the essential instruments; more than that, she layers her parts with an ear toward sounding like a solid backup band, as opposed to showing off. Her lyrics, which adhere to the confessional/heartache model, can revolve around unanswered questions\\". The album peaked in the top 40 of Billboards Top Heatseekers. In the next month Boucher issued her first single off the album, \\"I Can't Make Me\\", and followed with \\"Another White Dash\\". The latter track had been written by Boucher, Becca and Thomson of The Mercy Bell, which appeared on Billboards Adult Top 40. During 2004 Boucher toured the US and Europe, opening for Barenaked Ladies, and then for Sarah McLachlan on the latter's Afterglow Tour. Boucher started work on a second album, Scary Fragile, in 2005 and it was delivered to the A&M; label in January 2006. In February 2007 the track, \\"A Bitter Song\\", from the album, featured on an episode of the TV series, Grey's Anatomy, it was available on iTunes for digital download on 27 February. After various delays due to producer, label and legal concerns Scary Fragile was released independently on 2 June 2009. Boucher reflected on her problems with major labels, \\"[t]hat's what was so frustrating. I had been there before and I managed to do it again ... I wasted those three years and lost my love of music in the process, trying to figure out what other people wanted\\". To promote the album's appearance Boucher issued a single, \\"Gun for a Tongue\\", in May and toured the US from May to July that year. In 2008 different Boucher family members contributed to the film, The Burial: Butterfly Boucher and Becca co-wrote two tracks which were performed by The Mercy Bell; Rod had the role as 'The Priest'; Vivi was a catering manager; Danielle co-directed, co-designed, acted as \\"The Mother' and co-wrote; Sunshine, Angelle and Harmony were catering assistants; and Eden co-designed production, acted as 'Nurse' and designed costumers. Boucher is part of the musical collective, Ten Out of Tenn, which formed in Nashville in 2005; since 2008 Boucher appeared on various compilation or Christmas albums including, Ten Out of Tenn Compilation (Vol. 2), Ten Out of Tenn Christmas (both 2008), Any Day Now (2009), We Are all in This Together (2010) and Ten Out of Tenn Compilation (Vol. 4) (2011). In July and August 2010, McLachlan invited Boucher to perform on the renewed Lilith Fair tour, where Boucher met fellow Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, the pair share songwriting for a number of tracks including, \\"Unashamed Desire\\". In 2011, Boucher and Brad Jones, co-produced Higgins' album, The Ol' Razzle Dazzle (June 2012), at Alex the Great Studios, Nashville. Both Boucher and Higgins recorded their own version of \\"Unashamed Desire\\": Boucher's appeared on her self-titled album which was released 13 April 2012, Higgins' version was issued as a single and appeared on The Ol' Razzle Dazzle. In 2011 Boucher toured with McLachlan, playing bass guitar and singing vocals. She also performs and records bass guitar and vocals as part of Elle Macho, a Nashville-based trio she formed with guitarist David Mead and drummer Lindsay Jamieson. Elle Macho will release their debut album on 5 February 2013. In August 2012, Boucher supported Higgins on an Australian tour that was followed, in September, by a tour of the US with Katie Herzig (fellow Ten out of Tenn member) added to the bill. In September 2013, she announced that for the 10th anniversary of her first album, Flutterby, she re-recorded its songs. This new release will be called \\"Happy Birthday Flutterby\\".  In media  Butterfly Boucher recorded a duet with David Bowie singing his song \\"Changes\\", on the Shrek 2: Motion Picture Soundtrack, released in May 2004, for the film of the same name. Boucher's own songs have been featured on various TV programs. In July to August 2004, the short-lived ABC series, The Days used \\"Life is Short\\" as its opening theme. TV drama series Grey's Anatomy featured both \\"Never Leave Your Heart Alone\\" and \\"Life is Short\\" in its first season (2005), and debuted \\"A Bitter Song\\" from her then-unreleased album Scary Fragile in the third-season episode \\"Drowning on Dry Land\\" (2007). In addition, the title song \\"Scary Fragile\\" also featured in the pilot for the ABC Family show, Switched at Birth. The song \\"Gun for a Tongue\\" served as the theme song for The Lying Game. Flutterby was the source of songs on the fantasy television series Charmed. \\"Life is Short\\" was used in the episode \\"Spin City\\", and the episode \\"Show Ghouls\\" features a version of the track \\"I Can't Make Me\\" remixed by Chris Lord-Alge, which is later included in soundtrack album, Charmed: The Book of Shadows. The single \\"It Pulls Me Under\\" was featured in the film Where We're Meant to Be (2016) as well as the short film Break Free (2014) by Ruby Rose. Boucher later recorded and co-wrote an original song for the 2017 film Wonder entitled \\"Break the Rules\\". Boucher co- wrote several songs and appears on Dawson Wells' debut album Re: No Subject, for which she played instruments, including drums, guitar, piano and keyboards, tambourine and bass. She provided lead and backup vocals on most of the songs, including a duet with Dawson called \\"Gracey and Henry Martin's First Summer\\". Compositions she penned with Wells on that album are \\"Say Anything\\", \\"Silly One\\", \\"Being in Love\\". Her 2009 song, \\"A Bitter Song\\", was sampled by New Orleans rap duo Suicideboys in their song, \\"Kill Yourself III\\"  Discography  According to AllMusic, Butterfly Boucher is credited with: guitars (lead, bass, seven-string electric, acoustic, baritone), piano, violin, vocals (lead, backing), drums, animal sounds, keyboards, organ, percussion, programming, arranger, art direction, artwork, layout design, package design, composer, engineer, mixer, producer, and video director. =Albums= * Flutterby (7 October 2003) * Scary Fragile (2 June 2009) * Butterfly Boucher (13 April 2012) * Happy Birthday Flutterby (November 2013 ‚Äì a re-recording of Flutterby) =Singles and EPs= * \\"I Can't Make Me\\" (2003) * \\"Another White Dash\\" (2004) * \\"A Bitter Song\\" (2007) * \\"Gun for a Tongue\\" (2009) * \\"5678!\\" (2012) * \\"It Pulls Me Under\\" (Single) 24 July 2014 =Collaborations and guest performances= * \\"I'm Different\\" (on For the Kids Too!) 19 October 2004 * ¬°Es Potencial!

It was an interglacial which preceded the Wolstonian Stage and followed the Anglian Stage. It is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 11(MIS 11). Marine Isotope Stage 11 started 424,000 years ago and ended 374,000 years ago.Lisiecki, L. E. (2005). Ages of MIS boundaries.LR04 Benthic Stack Boston University, Boston, MA The Hoxnian is divided into sub-stages Ho I to Ho IV.  History  The Hoxnian Stage is named after Hoxne in the English county of Suffolk where some of the deposits created were first found. It was identified and dated with palynology or pollen evidence in the biostratigraphy and later updated with aminostratigraphic techniques. Based on stratigraphic information the Hoxnian happened after the Anglian glacial as Anglian soil is frequently found underneath Hoxnian deposits. = Similarly timed interglacials = The Hoxnian stage has often been correlated to the Holstein Interglacial of northern Continental Europe and the Mindel-Riss Interglacial of the Alps. However, there is ambiguity regarding the correlation of these two interglacials to either MIS 11 or MIS 9, which is related to the MIS 12 / MIS 10 ambiguity described in more detail in the article 'Elster glaciation'.B√∂se et al. (2012), Quaternary Glaciations of Northern Europe, Quaternary Science Reviews 44, page 17-22. The Hoxnian stage has also been equated to the Yarmouthian (Yarmouth) Stage in North America. However, the Yarmouthian Stage, along with the Kansan, Nebraskan, and Aftonian stages, have been abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian Stage. At this time, the Hoxnian and Holstein stages are correlated with a brief part of the Pre-Illinoian Stage lying between the Pre-Illinoian A and Pre-Illinoian B glaciations of North America. = Humans = During the Hoxnian human activity was constrained by the dense forests so humans traveled along rivers and created settlements in valleys. Settlements were selected based on location, resources, and vegetation. The Beeches Pit site revealed humans possibly selected sites rich with flint for toolmaking.  Environment  The Hoxnian is an interglacial phase meaning the warm periods in between glacial periods. Interglacial phases are heavily vegetated with woodlands interspersed with open areas. Site deposits are often found over Anglian soil which dates to MIS 12. Most sites have been found in valleys with signs of river deposits.During the interglacial the valleys would have been surrounded by dense forests. = Hoxnian sites = Beeches Pit, West Stow, Suffolk is a site dated to MIS 11 and under 40km from other sites for the Lower Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic. Beeches Pit is considered a site of special interest because not only were shells and plant remains found but animal bones that were burnt. The sites around Hitchin, Hertfordshire are associated with lakes caused by the melting of glaciers that settled in holes.When archaeologist dug up the sites they found dense soil full of gravel. The gravel is hypothesized to come from the creation of hand axes. At Marks Tey, Essex the lake soil was rich with pollen spanning all of the Hoxnian and remnants of gravel and artifacts.

Wendt and academics such as Nicholas Onuf, Peter J. Katzenstein, Emanuel Adler, Michael Barnett, Kathryn Sikkink, John Ruggie, Martha Finnemore, and others have, within a relatively short period, established constructivism as one of the major schools of thought in the field. A 2006 survey of US and Canadian International Relations scholars ranks Wendt as first among scholars who have \\"been doing the most interesting work in international relations in recent years.Susan Peterson et al. College of William and Mary, Williamsburg. February 2007. A 2011 survey of international relations scholars worldwide ranked Wendt first in terms of having \\"produced the best work in the field of IR in the past 20 years\\".  Biography  Alexander Wendt was born in 1958 in Mainz in West Germany, attended high school in St. Paul, Minnesota and studied political science and philosophy at Macalester College before receiving his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1989, studying under Raymond \\"Bud\\" Duvall. Wendt taught at Yale University from 1989 to 1997, at Dartmouth College from 1997 to 1999, at the University of Chicago from 1999 to 2004, and is currently the Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at the Ohio State University.  Social Theory of International Politics  Wendt's most widely cited work to date is Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge University Press, 1999), which builds on and goes beyond his 1992 article \\"Anarchy is What States Make of It\\". Social Theory of International Politics places itself as a response to Kenneth Waltz's 1979 work, Theory of International Politics, the canonical text of the neorealist school. Quantum Mind and Social Science Wendt's 2015 book Quantum Mind and Social Science (Cambridge University Press, 2015) examines the crossroads between quantum physics and social science. He advocates for panpsychism and quantum consciousness from a non-specialist perspective. The book is provocative in nature and has received varied reviews. Mathias Albert in International Affairs explains the book as weakest in its attempts to link quantum physics to social science and behind the times in addressing the agent-structure problem, in addition to only marginally relating to international relations.

It is best known as the company that won the December 19, 2004 auction for a 76.79% share in Yuganskneftegaz, formerly the core production subsidiary of Yukos Oil Company. Baikalfinansgrup won the auction with a bid of 261 billion rubles (US$9.3 bn), which was somewhere between 37% and 49% of Yuganskneftegaz‚Äô market value at the time, according to an appraisal made by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and JPMorgan Chase & Co.. Profile Baikalfinansgrup was created on December 6, 2004, just two weeks before the Yuganskneftegaz auction, with a share capital of 10,000 rubles (US$358). Its original registered address was in the north-western Russian city of Tver in a building that houses a vodka bar, a mobile-phone shop, a tour operator agency and the offices of several small local companies, but no office of Baikalfinansgrup. Baikalfinansgrup later moved its legal address to the head office of Rosneft Oil Company, which is situated on Sofiyskaya Embankment directly opposite the Kremlin. Despite its obscurity, Baikalfinansgrup was able to secure a credit of US$1.7 bn from the state-owned Sberbank savings bank as a down-payment for participating in the auction. On December 21, 2004, Russian president Vladimir Putin admitted that he knew the owners of Baikalfinansgrup. Putin did not disclose their names, but noted that they were individuals with \\"many years of experience in the energy business\\". Yuganskneftegaz auction Yuganskneftegaz was the core production subsidiary of Yukos Oil Company, which was previously run by Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2003, the Russian tax authorities charged Yukos and Khodorkovsky with large-scale tax evasion. On April 14, 2004, Yukos was presented with a bill for over US $35 bn in back taxes and a demand to pay the entire bill the same day. Requests by Yukos to defer payment, allow payment by instalments or to discharge the debt by sale of peripheral assets, including its shareholding in the Sibneft oil company, were also refused. Since Yukos was both legally and physically unable to pay the entire amount in cash on such short notice, Russian bailiffs froze Yukos‚Äô shares in Yuganskneftegaz. On November 19, 2004, Russian bailiffs placed a notice in the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya gazeta announcing that Yuganskneftegaz would be sold at an auctioned scheduled to be held 30 days later on December 19, 2004. The conditions for participation in the auction included an advance deposit of US $1.7 bn and prior clearance by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. In early December, the Russian state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom submitted an application to participate in the auction through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gazpromneft. Gazpromneft had been created in September 2004 in preparation for a planned merger between Gazprom and state-owned Rosneft. On December 15, 2004, Yukos filed for a bankruptcy protection in a Houston court, and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting Gazprom from participating in the auction. On the next day, December 16, a group of Western banks withdrew their financial support for the Gazprom application. On the same day, the previously unknown Baikalfinansgrup applied to participate in the auction. On December 19, 2004, only two companies appeared for the auction: Gazpromneft and Baikalfinansgrup. Gazpromneft declined to place any offer, thus allowing Baikalfinansgrup to acquire Yuganskneftegaz on its first bid. Four days later Baikalfinansgrup was acquired by Rosneft. Rosneft later disclosed in its annual financial statement that it had financed the acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz. At the time, Rosneft president Sergey Bogdanchikov was also the CEO of Gazpromneft. Shortly after the auction, the planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft merger was called off, and Sergey Bogdanchikov resigned his post as CEO of Gazpromneft. On February 7, 2006, in response to a question by a Spanish journalist, Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed that Rosneft had used Baikalfinansgrup as a vehicle to acquire Yuganskneftegaz in order to protect itself against litigation risks.
