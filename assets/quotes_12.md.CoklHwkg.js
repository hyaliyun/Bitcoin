Work began in 1992, but no prototype was ever produced. History The Yakovlev Yak-77 was to have been a large business jet and regional commuter, considerably larger than the earlier Yakovlev Yak-48. Little information has been released about this design. Development Work on the Yak-77 began in 1992, the project manager being S A Yakovlev. The aircraft was to have two AE 3010/12 turbofans, uprated members of the Allison 3000 family of two-shaft turbofans, each with a takeoff rating of 4,500 kg (9,920 lb). Avionics were to have been a Collins Pro Line 4 system. In configuration for a business jet, the aircraft would have had seating for eight in a generous cabin. Configured as a regional commuter it would have seated 32 in rows of 2+2. Streatched versions with seating for up to 70 were studied. The aircraft was to have entered production at Saratov in 1994.

A career prosecutor, Letten served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana for more than eleven years.Becky Borer, \\"Letten: New Orleans' Future Depends on Tackling Crime, Corruption\\" on the web site of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, posted 2006 November 08 from the Associated Press via the Times-Picayune (New Orleans). By the time Letten resigned as U.S. Attorney in December 2012, he was the longest-serving U.S. Attorney in the country. After stepping down, Letten joined Tulane University Law School as an assistant dean. Letten later became of counsel with the firm of Butler Snow, while retaining his post at Tulane. Early life and education Letten was born at Southern Baptist Hospital in New Orleans on September 12, 1953.Allen Johnson Jr., Letten Loose, New Orleans Magazine (October 2007). He is the only son of Alden and Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Letten; his father was a steel fabricator. Letten graduated from De La Salle High School in 1971. He received his B.A. from the University of New Orleans in 1976 and his Juris Doctor from the Tulane University Law School in 1979.James B. Letten, Assistant Dean for Experiential Learning, Tulane University Law School (accessed December 18, 2015). Career Letten worked for Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. for four years. In 1982, Letten became a federal prosecutor, beginning on an organized crime strike force. He was part of the team that prosecuted several leaders of the New Orleans mafia and figures from the New York crime families. From 1994 to 2001, Letten was first assistant U.S. attorney under then-U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan Jr. (who later became Orleans Parish district attorney). In that position Letten was best known as the lead prosecutor in the racketeering trial of former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards.Campbell Robertson, Crusading New Orleans Prosecutor to Quit, Facing Staff Misconduct, New York Times (December 6, 2012).

Nonetheless, when Republicans lost the Presidency to Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, many Democrats, including U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, took the unusual step of urging the new President to reappoint Letten.Landrieu Recommends Bagneris, Letten, May for Key Federal Appointments in Eastern District on Senator Landrieu's web site, 2009 April 27 (retrieved 2009 June 06).

Derrick Shepherd; former St. Tammany Parish Councilman Joe Impastato; a whole bunch of folks who worked for or did business with the Orleans Parish School Board; several high-profile associates of ex-Mayor Marc Morial; and ex-New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas, who had been pegged as a front-runner in the 2010 mayor's race.\\"Stephanie Grace, Louisiana U.S. Attorney Jim Letten is Obama's kind of prosecutor, Times- Picayune (December 11, 2008). These successes gained Letten bipartisan support, including from both Louisiana's U.S. Senators, Democrat Mary Landrieu and Republican David Vitter. In September 2009, the Times-Picayune praised Letten and the FBI for \\"bringing to justice\\" Bill Hubbard, who resigned as Saint John Parish president after receiving bribes of $20,000 from contractors.Another crook bites the dust, Times Picayune (September 25, 2009), Saint Tammany Edition, p. B4. After being retained in office by President Obama, Letten pursued a number of federal civil rights investigations into the New Orleans Police Department, a priority of the Obama administration's Department of Justice. In 2010, the conservative provocateur videographer/prankster James O'Keefe, \\"who specialized in often deceptively edited undercover camera work to expose what he considers to liberal hypocrisies,\\" pleaded guilty to federal misdemeanor charges of entering the New Orleans offices of Senator Landrieu disguised as a telephone repairman and attempting to tamper with the office's phone system under false pretenses.Jennifer Koons, Former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten Unloads on Conservative Prankster James O'Keefe , Main Justice (August 26, 2013).Journalist provocateur James O'Keefe posts video of confrontation with Jim Letten, New Orleans Times-Picayune (August 26, 2013). fellow activists who accompanied O'Keefe also faced prosecution.

In July 2013, after Letten the U.S. Attorney's office to become assistant dean at Tulane law school, O'Keefe appeared at Letten's home, where he complained to Letten's wife about his prosecution, and later confronted Letten on the Tulane campus in a tense videotaped exchange.

Spaatz, Muir S. Fairchild and Donald M. Wilson at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1946 The Bomber Mafia were a close-knit group of American military men who believed that long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding. After World War II, the 20 years of foundational work by the bomber mafia resulted in the separation of the United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, helped shape the mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command. Many years later a related term \\"Fighter Mafia\\" described those within the Air Force that favoured light weight fighters good at dog-fighting instead of heavy missile-firing fighters. Origins Developed over the years 1926–1929 at Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Langley Field in Virginia, a forward-looking doctrine of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by Brigadier General William \\"Billy\\" Mitchell who advocated a greatly expanded role for the bomber force. After graduating from ACTS in 1931, Mitchell protégée Harold L. George stayed at the school to refine and teach the new bombing theory, soon recruiting as teachers his former students Haywood S. Hansell, Donald Wilson and Laurence S. Kuter as fellow bomber advocates. These four instructors, the core of US bomber advocacy, argued that an enemy's army and navy could be defeated intact due to the destruction of industrial and military targets deep within enemy-held territory.Braxton, Leon E.; Wagner, Arthur H. (2012) Birth of a Legend: The Bomber Mafia and the Y1B-17, pp. 65–66. This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet, though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed.Griffith, Charles (1999). The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II. Air University Press , pp. 39–40.Miller, Donald L. (2006). Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany, New York: Simon & Schuster. , pp. 49–50. In contrast, American theorists devised a strategy of pin-point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons.Belote, Howard D. (1999). \\"Warden and the Air Corps Tactical School: What Goes Around Comes Around.\\" Airpower Journal, Fall 1999. Though unproven, the major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly, with minimal casualties, and that grinding, static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided. In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said \\"the bomber will always get through\\", he was talking about the terror bombing of cities. The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission. They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets, not populations. To effect this doctrine, the United States Army Air Corps would be required to expend the majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self-defending heavy bombers, and in the training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions. The ACTS officers who believed in the heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other Air Corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft would take away from the proposed large fleet of heavy bombers. Moreover, the men realized that the United States government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet. To implement these changes, the ACTS instructors began to instill a sense in their students that a separate and independent air arm of the type described earlier by Mitchell, to be called the United States Air Force, was the way forward. As a compromise first step, the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force was established within the Army Air Corps in 1935, commanded by General Frank M. Andrews, a strategic bombing advocate. Andrews staffed the command with like-minded officers such as Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold.Rentfrow, James C. (2001). Electronic Combat Support for an Expeditionary Air Force: The Lessons of History. Air Command and Staff College, Wright Flyer Paper No. 15. Although flawed and tested only under optimal conditions, the doctrine (originally known as the \\"industrial web theory\\")Griffith, p.45. Lt.Col. Donald Wilson of ACTS and a \\"Bomber Mafia\\" member is credited with the term. became the primary airpower strategy of the United States in the planning for World War II. Members of the \\"Bomber Mafia\\" produced the two airpower war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces. Opposition The term 'bomber mafia' came from the sometimes bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war, and that a separate air arm was required to command them. For the first few years, the strongest voice at ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain (later General) George C. Kenney who called for the use of air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy.Murray, 1998, p. 174. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.Griffith, p.13. As an expert in the use of air units to aid artillery and infantry, Gordon P. Saville held to the concept of tactical air power through his time as ACTS instructor from 1934 to 1936. Later, Saville successfully implemented his ideas in the Mediterranean Theater. Captain Claire Lee Chennault, senior instructor in fighter tactics at ACTS, was a vocal Air Corps officer who challenged the bomber mafia for more than a decade; he was forced into early retirement in 1937, leaving the precision bombing advocates unopposed.Severs, 1997 The teaching of fighter (\\"pursuit\\") tactics declined, though Earle E. Partridge and Hoyt S. Vandenberg continued to discuss the role of the fighter.Murray, 1998, p. 124. Other opposition was more subtle. USAAC Fighter Projects officer Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey appreciated that a large bomber fleet would be able to perform many military tasks, not just strategic bombing, and felt that the force's doctrine should remain flexible to meet any demand. Because of his lower rank, he was in no position to challenge the bomber mafia, and instead strove to work around their restrictions on pursuit aircraft. Kelsey formulated a new \\"interceptor\\" class of aircraft in order to sustain his idea that a well-armed fighter aircraft could successfully attack enemy bombers, and that, given drop tanks for long range, it could defend friendly bombers all the way to the target and back. The bomber mafia, through a \\"failure of imagination\\" in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success,Miller, p.41. would not accept either of these concepts—they believed the heavy bomber fleet could protect itself, and thus they contributed to the delay in the development of a long-range escort fighter until two years into the war. However, the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army, and the basis for modern airpower theory. Hansell concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the AWPD-1 war plan (of which he was both) made a serious mistake in neglecting long-range fighter escort in their ideas.Hansell, Haywood S. Jr. (1979). The Air Plan That Defeated Hitler, Ayer Press, , p.22. Hansell wrote: > It was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable, but no one > could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber > yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through > proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings. Advocates Lieutenant General Harold L. George, USAF Major General Haywood S.

Fleets of heavy bombers were not able to achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was a major factor in the eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.

It was located on the eastern side of the level crossing across the B2244 Junction Road near the hamlet of Udiam in East Sussex, England. Closed for passengers in 1954 and freight in 1961 with the line, The line through Junction Road Halt may yet be revived as the Rother Valley Railway, a preservation society, is proposing to reopen the line from Robertsbridge to Bodiam.  History  The Rother Valley Railway opened a small platform at Junction Road in 1900 as an informal private stopping place for the benefit of the tenant of the adjoining fields who enjoyed shooting rights over the land. The station was situated on the eastern side of a level crossing adjacent to Udiam Farm on the turnpike road from Hawkhurst to Hastings called Junction Road (now part of the B2244 road). The crossing was originally gated but cattle grids were later provided. The existence of the platform was discovered by the Board of Trade in January 1903 during an inspection of the line by Major Pringle who had stopped at the site to examine the new cattle grids. After the inspection, Colonel Stephens, the proprietor of the Rother Valley Railway, wrote to the Board of Trade to obtain permission to open the halt to the public. The station would be unstaffed and trains would only call as required. The Board of Trade indicated its willingness to authorise the halt so long as the railway provided suitable lights for trains calling in the hours of darkness. Despite Stephens' reply that guards would be instructed to aid passengers with a hand lamp, the Board of Trade still insisted on lights. Although it is unclear whether formal authorisation was actually granted, the station began to appear in the railway company's timetables in June 1903. The name Udiam Halt was first used but this was soon abandoned in favour of Junction Road (for Hawkhurst), even though the village of Hawkhurst was some away and had been served by its own railway station for the last eleven years. A lack of funds meant that no station buildings were provided at Junction Road, the station consisting merely of a single unsheltered platform constructed of wood and earth. In 1909, a siding was commissioned on the western side of the B2244 on the Up side of the line facing Robertsbridge and this was controlled by a two-levered ground frame situated nearby. The position of the siding meant that trains wishing to shunt here had to be tow-roped. Junction Road, which was convenient for the Guinness hop farm, saw substantial passenger traffic during the hop-picking season, and this may have contributed towards the decision to renew the platform in 1948. The KESR had acquired the materials prior to nationalisation, and the work was completed by British Railways. The concrete parts had been made at the Exmouth Junction concrete works near Exeter and supplied by the Southern Railway. The platform was sufficiently long to accommodate a two-carriage train. The proximity of hop-farms was most likely the main reason for the station's survival. Regular passenger services ceased in January 1954 but it continued to be used for special services, particularly hop-pickers' specials as late as September 1957. The last publicly advertised service to pass through the station was a seven-carriage Locomotive Club of Great Britain special, worked by LB&SCR; A1 class Nos. 32662 and 32670, which ran on 11 June 1961. After closure a preservation group was formed to reopen the line. After many years of negotiations the Ministry of Transport however refused permission for the section of line west of Bodiam, on the basis of difficulties that the reopened level crossings at Junction Road and on the A21 road would pose to road traffic, as well as the possibility that the roads might need to be converted into dual carriageways, in which case the taxpayer would have to bear the expense of bridging the line. The track was removed between Bodiam and Robertsbridge in the early 1970s however the section between Bodiam and Tenterden has been reopened. The platform was still in situ in 1987 but was removed a few years later. No trace of the station remained by 1996.  Present day  The Rother Valley Railway, a preservation group set up in 1991, had by March 2009 laid track from Bodiam to within of the site of Junction Road Halt at a cost of £200,000. The owner of Udiam Farm, whose land incorporates the original railway alignment, has agreed for the line to be rebuilt through his garden along its historic route. The previous owner of Udiam Farm had not been willing for the line to cross his land. Track was relaid through the site of the halt in June 2010. On 18 March 2011, a VIP dining special was the first passenger train to traverse the rebuilt line. The following weekend of 19/20 March saw KESR services run as far as Junction Road; services were hauled by Manning Wardle 0-6-0ST No. 14, LB&SCR; A1 class No.3, GWR 0-6-0PT No. 1638 and Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST No. 23, although passengers were not able to alight or board here. There are no plans to reinstate Junction Road Halt and arrangements have not yet been made for continuation of the line towards Robertsbridge.

Not much is known about his life but it is known that Pinytus was looked up to by St. Eusebius of Caesarea, who said that he was one of the foremost ecclesiastical writers of his time.Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould (M.A.). \\"S. PINITUS B. (ABOUT A.D. 180.)\\" In: The Lives of the Saints. Volume the Eleventh: October – Part I. London: John C. Nimmo, 1898. p. 223. Pinytus was in constant contact with Dionysius of Corinth and it seemed the two had disagreements. Dionysius, it appears, wrote to the Pinytus asking him not to impose too strict a yoke of chastity upon his brethren. But Pinytus was unmoved by this counsel and replied that Dionysius might impart stronger doctrine and feed his congregation with a more perfect epistle inasmuch as Christians could not always subsist on milk or tarry in childhood. It may be that Pinytus was influenced by Montanistic views; however, Eusebius vouches for his orthodoxy and his care for the welfare of those placed under him.

Originally presented by Liz Bonnin, Jem Stansfield, Dallas Campbell and Dr. Yan Wong, the show employs a hands-on approach to test scientific theory and demonstrate how science shapes our world. From series seven, Maggie Philbin replaced Dallas Campbell as a main presenter and Yan Wong no longer appeared.  Production  = Creation = The co-production between the BBC and the Open University was announced in June 2009 and was commissioned by Jay Hunt, controller of BBC One, for ten 30 minute episodes. It promises to \\"put scientific theory to the test\\" and examine \\"how science shapes the world around us\\". During the announcement, Hunt stated that the series \\"brings popular science back to the very heart of BBC One\\", referring to the long-running BBC series Tomorrow's World, which ran from 1965 to 2003 and was cancelled following falling ratings. Comparing Bang Goes the Theory to Tomorrow's World, series editor Dermot Caulfield said, Dr. Stephen Serjeant (Reader in Cosmology at the OU), and Dr Ian Johnston (Lecturer in Engineering for the OU) were the two academic team leaders for the production, covering disciplines including geology, astrophysics, neuropsychology and zoology. The studio elements of the series were initially recorded in a building that housed the supersonic wind tunnel fans at RAE Bedford in Bedfordshire and was also the testing facility for the first prototype Harrier Jump Jet V/STOL aircraft. They were later recorded in the old linear accelerator building on the University of Sussex campus near Brighton, where Jem Stansfield has his workshop. As of Series 6 (from March 2012) no studio was used and linking sections were filmed on location. To \\"inspire the audience to get hands on with science\\", the series was supported by a number of free events across the country organised by BBC Learning. Over time, the programme moved from being an educational entertainment format in which short films were interspersed with \\"street science\\" demonstrations (mainly presented by Yan Wong) and stunts (mainly presented by Jem Stansfield), to a current affairs-style format. Distinct changes occurred in series 6, when each episode explored a single theme, the studio setting was dropped, several guest presenters appeared over the course of the series (one of whom, Maggie Philbin, subsequently joined the show as a regular presenter), and Jem Stansfield's stunts were phased out, with his attempt to build a pedal-powered flying machine (featured across two episodes) being the last such item to appear. = Presenters = Yan Wong, Dallas Campbell & Liz Bonnin Bang Goes the Theory was originally presented by Dallas Campbell (series 1–6); Liz Bonnin, a biochemist with a Masters in wild animal conservation; Jem Stansfield, an aeronautical engineer, inventor and designer of museum exhibits; and Dr. Yan Wong (co-author of The Ancestor's Tale), an Oxford- educated evolutionary biologist. Both Campbell and Wong left after series 6, and were replaced by Maggie Philbin, a science television presenter. From series 6 onwards, some segments were also fronted by one-off guest presenters. Maggie Philbin initially appeared as a guest presenter in series 6 before becoming a regular. = Live trailer = Ahead of the start of the series, BBC One aired a live three-minute trailer on 14 July 2009 before EastEnders. Described as a television first and emulating the Honda television advert Cog, it featured a continuing chain of scientific experiments, with one triggering the next and so on. The sequence included Bonnin using a bicycle to power a Van de Graaff generator and Stansfield then using the 250,000 volts generated to, among other things, * light a Bunsen burner, * inflate a large inflatable bunny, * trigger a thermal switch, * repel Wong away from Campbell along a track (using electromagnets attached to both presenters), and * power a robotic hand The sequence did not quite complete as expected: the bunny did not fully inflate and manual intervention was required to break an infrared beam to allow the experiment to continue – the rest of the experiment was executed without problems. Prior to the broadcast, over 10,000 people voted online for Wong to be propelled using magnetic forces. The live BBC 1 trailer was directed by John Rooney.Video accessible at =BBC One ident= From 27 July 2009 until 5 May 2014, Bang Goes The Theory was the only programme on BBC One to have its own ident. It depicted a group of people using bicycles to generate electricity to illuminate a ring of lights, into the centre of which the BBC One logo was superimposed.  Live tour and roadshow  In 2010, a Bang roadshow happened, and in 2011 a Bang Live toured the UK with an exclusive live show and interactive tent. = Symphony of Bang Goes The Theory = Musician John Boswell created a song using clips from the Bang Goes The Theory shows and website. It features distortion of the presenters' words using pitch-correction software, over the top of original music, in the same vein as Boswell's Symphony of Science series. Although conceived originally as a web piece, the song is also used at the end of the Bang LIVE roadshows.  Episodes  = Series 1 = The first series consisted of ten episodes. At the end of the last episode, it was announced that the programme would return in March 2010. And also with the slogan \\"Putting science to the test\\" until Series 3. = Series 2 = The second series consisted of eight episodes, plus another hour-long special, starting on 15 March 2010. It was also broadcast on BBC HD. = Series 3 = The third series consisted of six episodes, starting on 8 September 2010. It was also broadcast on BBC HD. = Series 4 = The fourth series commenced with an hour-long special, starting on 10 March 2011. It was also broadcast on BBC HD, and also with the slogan \\"Revealing your world with a bang\\" until Series 5. The slogan \\"Revealing your world through science\\" was used on Japan Earthquake special episode. = Series 5 = The fifth series began airing on 15 August 2011 on BBC One and in HD on BBC One HD. = Series 6 = The sixth series began airing on 12 March 2012 on BBC One and in HD on BBC One HD, in England and Scotland. It is shown a day later, on BBC Two in Northern Ireland and Wales. = Series 7 = The seventh series began airing on 4 March 2013 on BBC One and in HD on BBC One HD, in England, at the same time but on BBC Two in Scotland, and a day later on BBC Two in Northern Ireland and Wales. = Series 8 = The eighth and final series began airing on 10 March 2014 on BBC One and in HD on BBC One HD, in England and Scotland. Jem Stansfield did not appear in episodes 4, 6, 7 and 8 but was still credited as \\"Engineering consultant\\", and replaced by Sir Terry Wogan, Charlie Dimmock, and Dr. Chris van Tulleken as guest host.  Controversy  = Episode on nuclear power found 'misleading' by BBC Trust = The 8th episode of series 5 looking at nuclear power was found to be 'not accurate' and 'misleading' by the Ethical Standards Committee of the BBC Trust. The review of the episode was prompted by a complaint registered by 50 co- signatories, which included MPs and nuclear experts.  DVD releases  A DVD set containing the first two series of Bang Goes the Theory was issued in 2010. A second DVD set containing Series 3 and 4 of Bang Goes the Theory was issued in November 2011. None of the subsequent series have been issued on DVD.

Pratt. The books are told mostly through the third person perspective of Marla Mason, the head sorceress of the fictional United States East Coast city of Felport. Critical reception for the series has been mostly positive, with Locus placing Blood Engines and Spell Games on their 2007 and 2009 \\"Recommended Reading List\\" for fantasy novels, as well as nominating them for the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel for their respective years. Development Pratt began writing the series shortly after moving to the Bay Area and set the events of the first novel in the city of San Francisco. He also said that Blood Engines \\"wasn’t intended to start a series, but it turns out I accidentally wrote something in a thriving subgenre.\\" Pratt based the character on a childhood friend of his by the same name and describes the character as \\"an ass-kicking sorcerer who doesn’t wear a leather catsuit, doesn’t suffer from low self-esteem, doesn’t wallow in angst, and is almost always absolutely certain she’s right... even when she’s dead wrong.\\" The first four books in the series were published by Bantam Books imprint Bantam Spectra, but after the publisher dropped the series Pratt continued publishing the remainder of the series first through serialized versions and reader donations and then through successful Kickstarter campaigns. Many of the characters that appear directly in stories or novels starring Marla Mason also appear in other works by Pratt without Mason in them. For example, Bradley Bowman and Mr. Zealand appear in \\"Down With The Lizards And The Bees\\" and \\"Life In Stone\\", respectively, but Marla Mason does not.

This was the original home of the lairds of Ochtertyre. The fortress was referred to as 'ancient' in a charter of 1467. It belonged to Red Comyn, who was killed in 1306 by Robert the Bruce in the convent of the Minorites (Greyfriars Kirk) at Dumfries. It is thought that Sir William Murray, 1st Baronet of Ochtertyre, last inhabited the castle in the middle of the 17th century.

He married twice. Career Landon graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1906. For ten years he worked as a journalist for the London Free Press. In 1916 he became chief librarian at the London Public Library where he established a local history collection. After completing his M.A. in history at the University of Western Ontario, Landon was appointed the university's first full-time librarian in 1923, a position he held until 1946 when he became university vice-president and dean of graduate studies. Professor James J. Talman replaced Landon as university librarian. Landon retired in 1950, and in that year was awarded honorary doctorates by UWO and McMaster University. Landon made a significant contribution to the historiography of Ontario, particularly that of southwestern Ontario, with a focus on social history.

His 1941 book Western Ontario and the American Frontier was part of a series of 25 volumes on Canadian-American relations (sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace under the direction of James T. Shotwell of Columbia University) by the most respected Canadian and American historians of the era, which cast a new framework for understanding North American history. Most of his essays were prepared for the journals Ontario History and Inland Seas. His most notable work was the five volume The Province of Ontario; a history, 1615-1927, co-edited with Jesse E. Middleton in 1928. He also pioneered the study of African Canadian history.

The following quote is of interest regarding the album concept. > I was featuring his LP A Hard Road on the air and was amazed that, in > addition to writing 8 of the 12 numbers on the record, playing 5 [sic] and 9 > string guitar, organ, piano, harmonica and singing, he had written the > sleeve notes and painted the portrait of the group on the front cover. > With this new LP, he has carried all of this to its logical conclusion and > has produced a record featuring no other musician than himself except for > the occasional aid of his drummer Keef Hartley.

In the sleeve notes, John Peel commented: \\"There is no truth to the rumours that the Bluesbreakers will be using dulcimer, sackbut and psaltery. Let's face it, guttural cries of \\"Let's hear your sackbut, son!\\" can only lead to violence.\\" In fact the instrument had previously been used in jazz and piano boogie pieces by artists such as Meade Lux Lewis. \\"Brown Sugar\\" is another slide guitar piece, not related to the famous Rolling Stones track of the same name, although both songs use the expression to mean the same thing.

The ballpark was installed at the same time as the football stadium in 1904; Texas A&M; were one of the original members of the Southwest Conference in 1914 but did not begin baseball until 1915. Field conditions As compared to the more modern Olsen Field, Kyle Baseball Field gave birth to rocks because it was constructed on an ancient parking lot, and the rocks came up through the surface. Each day preceding practice, the team had to line up across the field and went from one end to the other, removing the rocks so the infielders wouldn't get injured in the face from bad hops. Field contraction The ballpark had a grandstand finished in June 1923 which cost $7,500 at the time.http://www.brazosgenealogy.org/data/time6.htm With expansion to Kyle Field in 1929, 1954, and 1969, the baseball field, in contrast, kept shrinking. Due to the small capacity of the baseball field, the Aggies had to play the 1959 District 6 playoffs with the University of Arizona at Travis Field in nearby Bryan; the Aggies lost the two games in the double-elimination by identical 1–0 in front of 6,000. From 1972 to 1975, Texas A&M; had to make Travis Field their home away from \\"home\\" because the school representatives took Kyle Baseball Field from the baseball team during another series of augmentation of Kyle Field.

Jonathan Breck reprises his role as the Creeper. Gina Philips returns in a cameo as Trish Jenner, her first return to the series since the original film. The film was shown in theaters on September 26, 2017 in what was originally announced as a one-night-only showing and was then shown again on October 4, 2017. Plot A shuriken flies through the air and hits a wooden post as a man runs for his life. When the man reaches the road, the Creeper drops from the sky and flies off with him, while Kenny Brandon watches from his truck. When he gets out to investigate, he looks up in the air and sees a machete fall from the sky, followed by the Creeper's hand. 23 years later, shortly after the events of the first film, the police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies; however, the truck is booby-trapped with spikes that emerge from the back doors and a spear that shoots out from the tail-pipe. When Sheriff Dan Tashtego arrives, Sergeant Davis Tubbs tells him what happened and Tashtego informs him of the Creeper and its motives. They rush to get the Creeper's truck back after learning it is headed for the impound. As Frank and Deputy Lang transport the vehicle, the Creeper lands on the tow truck and severs the cables. They watch as the truck drives off seemingly on its own, while the Creeper stands on top of it. When the truck returns, the Creeper abducts Frank while Lang stands frozen in fear. The next day, Kenny's mother Gaylen sees a vision of Kenny, who was killed by the Creeper; he warns it will come for what he buried on the property and will kill anyone still there, including her and his niece Addison. Meanwhile, Tubbs joins a small team Tashtego put together from relatives of Creeper victims to kill it. Later, a group of teenagers discover the Creeper's truck in a field; however, one of them, Kirk, accidentally activates the spear, getting impaled in the leg and trapped. As two of the other boys try to free him, the Creeper returns and kills them both with another spear. The last boy almost escapes the Creeper, but it discovers he peed on his truck and kills him. Later, Addison goes into town to buy hay for her horse. When she can't pay for it, her friend Buddy pays for some; she joins him delivering more hay to a plantation house. They find the owner and a couple of workers hiding under cars; the owner tells them to call for help. Before they can leave, the Creeper abducts Addison. Gaylen remembers clues in her vision, digging up the hand Kenny found; she touches it, going into a trance. When Tashtego's team arrives, Gaylen reveals the hand can tell them about the Creeper; Tashtego touches the hand, being left shocked by how ancient the Creeper is. Addison wakes up in the Creeper's truck with Kirk; they try to find a way out, but Kirk activates a booby trap in the driver's seat, causing a metal pipe to impale his head. Meanwhile, Tashtego and Tubbs discover the Creeper's location and they head off, along with Michael (who has a mini-gun attached to their truck). They find the Creeper driving down the highway, but when they shoot at it, the bullets deflect and Michael is killed. A small explosive is ejected from the Creeper's truck and when it goes off, Tashtego and Tubbs' car lands in a field. Tubbs gets out and tries to shoot the Creeper, but all of his attempts fail. However, before the Creeper can kill Tubbs, Tashtego yells for its attention; seeming to sense he knows about it, the Creeper leaps into the air after him. Tashtego shoots him many times with the mini-gun, but the bullets have little effect and he is tackled to the ground and struck in the head with an axe. With most of the team gone, Tubbs retreats. That night, the Creeper discovers that Addison is still alive, but before he can kill her, she causes the metal pipe to shoot out and impale his head. Addison escapes as the Creeper loses an eye; he tries using his weapons to kill her, but his aim is off. He tries one last time to hit her with an axe, but he is hit by a truck. The axe lands directly at her feet and Addison runs away, leaving the weapon on the ground. When the truck driver gets out to see what happened, he is killed and his body was used by the Creeper to heal itself. Addison runs and hides in a field where she is found by Gaylen and Buddy and the three leave together. The Creeper later returns to Gaylen's house where he finds a sign that says 'We know what you are', along with the hand, and howls in anger. The next day, Addison says goodbye to Buddy before he leaves for a high school basketball game in the same bus that is attacked by the Creeper shortly before its hibernation. 23 years later, Trish Jenner is seen reading an open letter she presumably wrote on a computer calling for people to fight against the Creeper when it returns and vows to get revenge on The Creeper for the death of her brother, Darry.

In 2006, the film was officially announced and was tentatively called Jeepers Creepers 3: The Creeper Walks Among Us. MGM had originally planned to release the movie direct to DVD, but was unable to find proper financing. The movie's script was written by Salva with a new title, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral and Philips set to return as Trish from the first film. For nine more years, the film faced many false starts and setbacks, with Salva saying \\"the film has come close many times to going before the cameras and I hope someone sees the wisdom in shooting this.\\" On September 11, 2015, Salva's wish came true when the film was officially green lit to start filming in early 2016 under Myriad Pictures. However, before filming could begin in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canadian talent agencies sent out an alert to warn others about Salva's criminal past. The casting calls were subsequently removed, which halted the production, though producer Stan Spry assured a fan on Twitter that the movie was not cancelled. The original Cathedral storyline had the film take place 23 years after the first two films. However, on the special edition Blu-ray release of Jeepers Creepers 2, Salva stated that his new script for Jeepers Creepers 3 is set between the days of Jeepers Creepers and Jeepers Creepers 2 in 2001, where the Creeper terrorizes a farming community. Philips was brought in to reprise her role as Trish in a cameo. Stan Shaw, who plays a sheriff in this film, confirmed to a fan on Twitter that the Cathedral storyline was scrapped as that material was more than 12 years old. =Filming= In January 2017, it was confirmed the film was back in pre-production and that filming would begin in February 2017 in Louisiana, instead of Canada as had originally been planned. This more closely replicates the Florida setting of the original film. Principal photography began on February 15, 2017 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On April 4, 2017, one of the cameramen of the production revealed on their social networks that filming had by then been completed. Release During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated that Jeepers Creepers 3 would open on September 26, 2017. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night. Fathom Events then announced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after, \\"this Fall, the Creeper returns. See the next film in the iconic horror franchise when Jeepers Creepers 3 returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\\" Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.Wegotthiscovered.com The channel aired an encore showing on October 29. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 26, 2017.Dvdreleasedates.com Marketing After the filming announcement, several photos began to appear on the internet from the post-production of Jeepers Creepers 3, mainly for presenting actor Stan Shaw. Shortly after, a Behind- the-Scenes video of the film was released on social networks. The first teaser trailer ran 30 seconds and was released on September 6. The official trailer for the movie was released on September 15 on various YouTube trailer channels. Controversy Jeepers Creepers 3 sparked controversy over allegedly using child molestation as a plotline, which resulted in criticism of the film due to Salva's 1988 incarceration for sexual abuse of a 12-year- old and possession of child pornography. The dialogue \\"Can you blame him though? I mean look at her, the heart wants what it wants, am I right?\\", in reference to the film's character, a sexual abuse victim, was singled out for derision, ultimately being removed from the theatrical cut, although it was present in the screened version delivered to critics. Reception =Box office= During its limited two-day run, Jeepers Creepers 3 grossed $2.2 million in the United States and $1.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $3.6 million. The film played in 635 theaters on Tuesday, September 26 and was listed at #3 on the day's box office rankings behind Kingsman: The Golden Circle and It. =Critical response= The film received negative reviews from critics who panned its plot, directing, writing, pacing, acting, special effects and its ending. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a negative approval rating of 17% based on , with a weighted average rating of 3.8/10. Film critic Steve Pulaski gave the film a mixed review, saying that \\"through all its shortcomings, some admittedly due to what the wonders the passing of time does to one's expectations, I did find some enjoyment in Jeepers Creepers 3. All of these films have been a tad different from their predecessor, and this one is no exception. It clearly wants to give fans something they can appreciate, it just doesn't always know the best route.\\" Steve Barton, writing for Dread Central, gave the film three and a half out of five stars and said, \\"at the end of the day if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll be happy with this latest entry... which for my tastes is better than the second but just falls short of the goodness and quality of the original experience. The door has been left open for Jeepers Creepers 4 and whether or not that will happen remains to be seen.\\" However, Robert Yaniz, Jr. from We Got This Covered said that \\"lacking in imagination or genuine scares, Jeepers Creepers 3 falls tragically short on just about every front.\\" Adam Dileo from IGN wrote, \\"an unremarkable entry in a cult favorite franchise, Jeepers Creepers 3 offers fans too little to get excited about. While the monster still rules its slice of country highway and the skies above it, the rest of the film crashes in the cornfields,\\" while Ernie Trinidad gave the film two out of five stars, stating that it \\"didn't deliver the story fans were anticipating nor provide enough incentive to want to return for the inevitable sequel.\\" Trinidad also felt that the film's daytime setting drew attention to its low quality CGI and make-up effects. Possible sequel In an interview for Diabolique, Philips stated that Salva has a plot ready for a fourth installment. She said, \\"Victor has written what happens from the second after the conclusion of Jeepers Creepers 3. I think that's all I'm allowed to say about it, but he wrote in such detail and he had a lot of flashbacks to what happened over the years that it made it very easy for me. I got to see what will eventually happen to the character and he put enough flashbacks in there that I got to see what happened to her over the last 15 years. Let's just say, there's more to come.\\"  References   External links  Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:2010s monster movies Category:2010s supernatural films Category:American films Category:American monster movies Category:American sequel films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Demons in film Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Victor Salva Category:Interquel films Category:Obscenity controversies in film Category:Self-censorship ","title":"Jeepers Creepers 3"},{"id":"23124265","text":"Amandara is a village in Samarkand Region, Uzbekistan, Central Asia.

He made his debut at the age of 17 years for the Pakistan Cricket Team in 2009 against Sri Lanka. He is a left-arm fast bowler. He made his first-class debut in November 2008, and his first One-Day International and Test appearances in July 2009 in Sri Lanka at the age of 17. He played his first international match during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, where he played in every game, helping the national side win the tournament. On 29 August 2010, he was arrested for spot-fixing and was given a five-year ban for bowling two deliberate no-balls. Amir pleaded guilty on the verdict handed out by his prosecutor the International Cricket Council, and publicly asked for forgiveness. In November 2011, Amir was convicted at Southwark Crown Court, along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif, of conspiracy charges relating to spot-fixing and spent 3 months in prison. He was given a five-year ban which was considered lenient, due to his juvenile age and confession, as compared to the other two conspirators who were given 7 and 10 years' suspensions, effectively ending their careers. On 29 January 2015, it was announced that Amir would be allowed an early return to domestic cricket despite his original ban being due to expire on 2 September 2015. Mohammad Amir signed with Chittagong Vikings to play the BPLT20-2015. He has since returned to play for Pakistan on their tour of New Zealand in 2016. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018–19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

When I used to watch him on TV, I would try to see what exactly he was doing with the ball. Then I would go outside and imitate his actions and bowling.\\". Retrieved 30 August 2010. In 2003, at the age of 11, Amir was spotted at a local tournament and invited to join the sports academy set up by Sir Asif Bajwa, who is the chairman of Bajwa Cricket Academy, in Rawalpindi.

Together they have two daughters, Minsa Amir and Zoya Amir. Domestic and T20 career Amir was first selected as a fast bowler by the former Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram at a fast bowling camp in 2007. Amir, then 15 years old, went on a tour of England with the Pakistan U-19 cricket team and was one of the leading bowlers. He took 8 wickets at an average of 16.37. In 2008, he took 4 wickets in successive matches against Sri Lanka and England. In this tri-nation tournament played in Sri Lanka he again excelled with his speed and swing bowling taking 9 wickets at average of 11.22 in three matches.

In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Khulna Tigers in the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League. International career =Debut years= Amir made his international debut against England in the group stages of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. He took the wicket of Ravi Bopara with only his second ball, with Shoaib Malik taking a fine catch, and conceded only one run in his debut international over. Amir made his One Day International match debut against Sri Lanka taking 3 wickets at an economy rate of 4.50 and also scoring 23 runs. After his successful 2009 T20 World Cup tournament, Amir was selected in the test squad for Pakistan for the series in Sri Lanka. He was chosen alongside fast bowler Umar Gul and Abdur Rauf, ahead of more notable and experienced names such as Sohail Tanvir. He started his Test career well, taking six wickets in the match, which included the wicket of Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara in both innings, as well as the Sri Lankan batsman, Mahela Jayawardene's wicket in the 2nd innings. However he did not get any wickets in his next two Test matches. His next test wickets came in New Zealand where he managed to take four wickets in the first Test match, during a losing game.

He was particularly effective at using the short ball, with his skiddy bouncers rushing onto the batsmen, often causing them to mishit the ball for a catch. Amir consistently clocked speeds of above 145 kilometres per hour (90 miles per hour) and bowled his quickest delivery in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, at 152 kilometres per hour (94.4 miles per hour). His most important moment arguably came in the opening over of the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup final against Sri Lanka. He bowled with speed and with consecutive short deliveries to the tournament's top scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan obtained his wicket on the fifth delivery and managed to end the over with a wicket maiden.

This set a world record of three wickets for a bowler in Twenty20 and 5 wickets for a team in one over. =Pakistan Cricket Board contract= Amir was ignored by Pakistan Cricket Board when they awarded cricket contracts to Abdul Razzaq and Mohammad Yousuf, even after his exceptional performance in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. Later on the Pakistan Cricket Board awarded Amir a 'C' category contract. =Making a mark in the international arena= On 9 November 2009 he scored 73 runs against New Zealand which was a record for a number 10 batsman in ODI history until Ravi Rampaul surpassed that record with scoring 86* when batting at number 10 position in 2011. In that innings, with his batting partner Saeed Ajmal, Amir added 103 runs to Pakistan's chase, only to fall short by 7 runs. He impressed the Pakistan cricket team, including Wasim Akram, who took credit for discovering Amir, although Akram later commented that Amir needed to gain more weight to aid his development. Later in 2009, Pakistan toured Sri Lanka and in the first One Day International match, he shared a 62 run partnership with fast bowler Umar Gul for the tenth wicket but Pakistan lost by 36 runs. He also played a game against New Zealand in 2009–2010. During a match in the third One Day International match, when Pakistan were reduced to 8 wickets for 86 runs, he scored 73 runs not out, making the highest score by a number 10 batsman in One Day International cricket and putting on a 103 runs, 10th wicket partnership with Saeed Ajmal. He was unable to get his side to their victory target of 212 runs, as Ajmal was declare out in the last over and Pakistan lost by just 7 runs. During the Test match series against Australia in 2010, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took his first five wicket haul, taking the wickets of Australian batsmen Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke. On 24 July 2010 he was influential in helping Pakistan win the 2nd Test match against Australia; the first Test match Pakistan had won against them in 15 years, which also drew the series 1–1. During this match he took 7 wickets overall, and was declared man of the match. Overall, in the second series, he was the leading wicket taker of both teams with his 11 scalps. In the summer of 2010, Amir was awarded the man of the match award for becoming the youngest player to ever take a five-wicket haul in England. He also became the youngest player to take 50 test wickets earning praise from several former international cricketers. In that eventful series against England, he took 19 wickets, the highest of the Pakistanis and third highest overall at an outstanding average of 18.3. He also took 2 five-wicket hauls. =International comeback = After five years, on 13 March 2015, Amir made his domestic comeback playing for Omar Associates in the grade II patron's trophy. He took a wicket in his first comeback over. On 19 August 2015, Mohammad Amir was declared completely free to play all forms of cricket from 2 September 2015. On 15 January 2016, he made his return to international cricket in a T20I match against New Zealand. In February 2016, Amir took a hat-trick in a Pakistan Super League match for Karachi Kings. He also participated to the first T20I edition of Asia Cup in 2016 and also for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He later made his international comeback against England, where he was taunted by English fans chanting \\"No Ball!\\" at him.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2016/07/22/mohammad-amir-unmoved-by- old-trafford-no-ball-chorus/ On 30 August 2016, against England at Nottingham Amir scored 58 after coming at no.11 and became the first cricketer to score a half century in ODIs after coming last in the batting order. He was dropped for the next match against England two days later. He along with Sarfraz Ahmed set the record for the highest 8th wicket partnership in ICC Champions Trophy history(75*) =2017 ICC Champions Trophy= Amir played his second ICC ODI tournament in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. During the first two games against arch rivals India and South Africa, Amir failed to pick up wickets but was economical with the figures of 0/32 (8.1) and 0/50 (10) respectively. It was Sri Lanka game where he picked up his first wickets. He picked important wickets of Angelo Mathews and Niroshan Dickwella and ended with figures of 2/53 (10). But his important contribution came from bat where he scored 28 from 63. Chasing Sri Lanka's target of 237, Pakistan were struggling at 162/7 before he arrived and, along with skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, shared an unbeaten stand of 75 to guide his team to their fourth semi final of their Champions Trophy. Amir missed the semi final against England due to back spasms. But his absence was barely noticeable as his replacement, Rumman Raees bowled well on debut with 2/44. Pakistan won that match by 8 wickets. Amir was pivotal in helping Pakistan win the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy by claiming top three wickets against arch-rivals India in the Final. Amir entered his second ICC final. It was against India, who were in a comfortable position. After Pakistan posted a challenging total of 338, it was the Indian batsmen that needed to be taken care of. Their top three batsmen, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli scored 70% of India's runs in the tournament. Amir got them all out. He trapped Sharma in front for LBW where he was given a three ball duck. Then he took the Indian skipper for 5. Kohli, at first, was dropped by Azhar Ali at first slip. However, he didn't have to wait much to take the wicket,making him edge the next ball to point where Shadab Khan took a good catch. Amir got his third after he bowled a cross seamer to Dhawan, which he edged to the wicket-keeper, Sarfaraz Ahmed for 21. Amir finished with the figures of 3/16 (6). It was Amir's dream spell as his side bowled out the defending champions for 158, winning by 180 runs. Amir has rated Indian cricketer Virat Kohli as the best batsman in the world. Kohli also rated Amir as one of the ‘toughest’ bowlers to face in the world cricket. Amir's brother said that this was what he wanted to do. After that spot fixing scandal at same city, he wanted to make up for his wrongdoings and the spell in the final was something that brought his family relief. = 2018 Asia Cup = Amir's performance in the Asia Cup was mediocre. During the 3 games Amir played, he was unable to pick up a single wicket. Hence, for the last match he was dropped. In his final Asia Cup game against India, Amir was trounced for 41 runs in his 5 overs without picking up a single wicket. His performance was criticised by both his countrymen and the cricketing world, proving that the Mohammad Amir of the past was yet to return. =2019 Cricket World Cup= In May 2019, he was named in Pakistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named their final fifteen-man squad for the tournament. On 12 June 2019, in the match against Australia, Amir took his first five-wicket haul in ODIs. He finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker for Pakistan, with 17 dismissals in eight matches. Controversy =Spot fixing allegation= In August 2010, the English newspaper News of the World published allegations that Amir and fellow bowler Mohammad Asif deliberately bowled no-balls during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England in return for payment from a betting syndicate. The News of the World alleged that an agent affiliated with some of the Pakistani players, later identified as Mazhar Majeed, had accepted a £150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood for information that Amir and Asif would deliberately deliver no-balls at specific points during the match, information which could be used by gamblers to make wagers with inside information (a process known as spot-fixing, compared with match fixing to predetermine a match result). In the video posted by News of the World, Majeed, counting out the bribe money, promised that Amir would be Pakistan's bowler for the first over, and that the third ball of the over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the first over, and on his third delivery from the over, bowled a no- ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as a \\"massive overstep\\", a good half-metre beyond the popping crease. Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and the ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery. As a result of the allegations and video posted by News of the World, Scotland Yard announced during the evening that they had arrested Majeed on charges of suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. The allegations also affected the Mohammad Amir brand as the official Pakistani kit supplier BoomBoom Cricket announced that they had temporarily suspended their ties with Amir until further details on the allegations had emerged. BoomBoom stated that they will \\"make a complete decision once his [Amir] fate had been decided by the authorities\\" The Pakistani selector Yawar Saeed announced that Amir and the two other accused Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif had withdrawn from the Pakistani tour of England due to the mental torture suffered by the allegations. Amir also continued to protest his innocence in the allegations. =Suspension, tribunal and ban= On 2 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Amir under the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players (Asif, Amir and Salman Butt) were charged \\"under various offences under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behaviour during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\\". Amir has got the sympathy of several ex- cricketers, including that of former England captain Michael Atherton. In an article for the News of the World, Atherton asserted that Amir is an asset to the game and must not be given a harsh punishment, considering his immense talent and young age. Atherton, now a journalist and broadcaster, recalled how Nasser Hussain, also an ex-England skipper, had summed up the mood at Lord's the previous Sunday: \\"Nasser Hussain, who I once saw walking around the team hotel in Sri Lanka in the early hours of the morning before a Test match unable to sleep, so worried was he about his form, spoke for us all when he said, 'Please don't let it be the kid'.\\" Atherton added: \\"The 'kid' in question was Mohammad Aamer, the young, good-looking and prodigiously-talented Pakistan bowler who had blown England away on the second morning at Lord's with a mesmeric spell of left-arm bowling and who now, we had been told, had overstepped the front line twice for a few dollars more.\\" Former South Africa bowler Henry Williams has called for Mohammad Amir to be treated with compassion if found guilty of spot fixing. The ICC announced that Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt had filed appeals to their ICC. suspensions and set their hearing on 30 and 31 October 2010 in Qatar. The Pakistan Interior Ministry also gave the three players their passports back so that they could travel to the hearing being held in Qatar The Pakistan Cricket Board barred Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt from using the National Cricket Academy in Gaddafi Stadium. They have been barred until their names have been cleared of Spot-fixing The board said that Butt had used the facilities before the notices were sent and Asif and Amir haven't used them. Amir and Butt's appeals were heard by the ICC on 30 and 31 October 2010. They were however rejected and the players remain provisionally suspended. The case does not decide whether Amir is guilty but only if his suspension should be lifted. Both Butt and Amir hit out at the ICC stating they hadn't been given any evidence as to why their suspensions were rejected. Because the players couldn't participate in international cricket all three had their contracts also provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board Mohammad Amir stated that he was desperate to return to international cricket. He stated that he had been keeping his fitness levels high and that he had been participating in club cricket. Reports also emerged by Geo News that stated that Scotland Yard might call Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt back into the UK to complete the spot-fixing investigation Amir's teammate Butt who was also implicated in the Spot-fixing scandal announced that he wanted a delay in his hearing because he wanted the Scotland Yard investigation to be completed first. However Amir and Asif announced they were to go ahead with their trials as planned because they wanted a decision to be reached quickly so that they could be selected for the World Cup squad. Amir, Butt, and Asif had a tribunal in front of a three-man panel of members of the ICC from 6–11 January 2011. Amir's lawyers requested that the tribunal not announce its findings at the conclusion of the tribunal, wanting the tribunal to have the time necessary to fully review the evidence. The tribunal announced at its conclusion that they would announce their findings and any possible restrictions about a month later (the fifth of February 2011). The tribunal did announce that while additional charges against Salman Butt were filed over statements Majeed had made about the Third Test, that Amir and Asif would not face any charges over that test. On 5 February 2011, the ICC tribunal handed Amir a five-year ban, his teammate Mohammad Asif was handed a seven-year ban and Salman Butt was given a 10-year ban from participating in any cricketing related activities which are governed by the ICC or any of its members. Shortly after the decision Amir announced his intent to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration Amir also stated that he hoped to return to International Cricket soon, stating he had \\"received confidence and support from Pakistani fans supporting him outside the Qatar Financial Centre\\". Some former players around the world such as Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff & Ian Healy called for Amir to be banned for life. On 15 September 2011 Amir has reportedly admitted to his involvement in last year's spot-fixing scandal before a court in England. =Breach of ban= On 4 June 2011, Amir played an innings of cricket for Addington 1743 Cricket Club in a Surrey Cricket League match against St Luke's Cricket Club in breach of Article 6.5 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. Amir stated that he made enquiries in respect of the status of the match, and was informed that it was a friendly match and playing would not be in contravention of his ban. Addington 1743 claimed that they had asked whether or not Amir could play for them, and were told that he could. As of 10 June 2011, the ICC were investigating the incident. =Criminal conviction= On 1 November 2011, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were convicted at Southwark Crown Court, along with Amir who had previously pleaded guilty, of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. He was sentenced to 6 months in Feltham Young Offenders Institution on 3 November, whilst Butt and Asif were sentenced to 30 months and 12 months in prison respectively. Mazhar Majeed was sentenced to two years and eight months. Amir, along with Butt, appealed against the length of their sentences, however this was dismissed by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice on 23 November. Amir was later transferred to Portland Young Offenders Institute in Dorset, from which he was released on 1 February 2012, having served half of his six-month sentence. = Retirement from Test Cricket = Mohammad Amir announced his retirement from Test Cricket in July, 2019. He finished his test career with an average of 30.47 and taking 119 wickets. He played a total of 36 tests since his debut in 2009. However, Amir will still continue to play white ball cricket for Pakistan.

They were prominent members of the NJPW faction Bullet Club, after a \\"civil war\\" in 2018, The Young Bucks, Kenny Omega, \\"Hangman\\" Adam Page, Marty Scurll and Cody Rhodes formed The Elite. They have performed for various American independent promotions – most notably Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) – and had previously worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Generation Me under the names Max and Jeremy Buck. On the independent circuit, they have won numerous titles as well, including four reigns as PWG World Tag Team Champions as well as being the only team to win PWG's annual Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament on three occasions (2009, 2011, and 2013).

Professional wrestling career =Training and debut (2001–2004)= In 2001, the Massie family put a wrestling ring in their backyard, where brothers Matt, Nick and Malachi taught themselves how to wrestle by impersonating what they saw on television. At the age of 18 or 19, Matt began his professional wrestling training in La Mirada and City of Industry, California at the Revolution Pro Wrestling School called Rudos Dojo, training primarily under Ron Rivera (The American Wild Child), Disco Machine, Scorpio Sky and Super Dragon, among others. Matt attended the school with his good friend Dustin Cutler, and the two taught what they learned to their friends back home. Eventually Nick joined his brother and attended a few sessions at the school. Matt, Nick and Dustin were involved in their first professional match at an Alternative Wrestling Show/C4/Revolution Pro joint event held on August 8, 2004. Matt worked as Fluffy the Dog, Dustin dressed as a hillbilly and Nick was a high flying referee wearing a Santo mask. Afterward, Matt and Nick wrestled various times for Revolution Pro and Revolution X in chicken costumes, under the team name \\"Los Gallineros\\". =High Risk Wrestling (2004–2009)= In October 2004, with the help of his family, Matt opened up his own independent wrestling company called High Risk Wrestling (HRW). Matt was originally the head owner of HRW, but had help from Nick and Malachi, as well as good friend Dustin Cutler – these three eventually took over ownership years later. The company ran shows twice a month and helped Matt and Nick learn their craft. In the main event of HRW's \\"Highway 2 Hell\\" on August 4, 2007, Matt and Nick teamed up with Marty Jannetty ín a six-man tag, where they defeated Joey Ryan, Karl Anderson and Diablo. On February 26, 2005, at a show for Full Contact Wrestling, Matt and Nick were called \\"The Young Bucks\\" for the first time. Originally, Matt was wrestling under the name \\"Mr. Instant Replay\\", while Nick was called \\"Slick Nick\\". That night The Young Bucks were defeated by the Kaos and Mongol, the Santino Brothers. Later on, another promoter decided that Matt and Nick needed a surname and came up with \\"Jackson\\", which the two have used ever since. With the help of HRW, Matt and Nick eventually landed spots in several popular companies in Southern California. They also gained experience working in front of a camera doing television tapings for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) starting in 2006. The Young Bucks filmed their very first matches for the NWA on Maverick Television on November 7, 2006, when they were defeated by Karl Anderson and Joey Ryan. HRW closed in 2009. =Pro Wrestling Guerrilla= Feud with The Dynasty (2007–2008) Matt (left) and Nick (right) in 2008 The Young Bucks debuted for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) on June 10, 2007, in Burbank, California at Roger Dorn Night, losing to Arrogance (Chris Bosh and Scott Lost).

On January 5, 2008, The Young Bucks faced prominent Dragon Gate team Muscle Outlaw'z (Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino) at All Star Weekend 6 – Night 1 in a losing effort. The next night, they lost to The Dynasty (Scott Lost and Joey Ryan).

During the next two months the Young Bucks participated in the 2008 DDT4 qualifier series, where they lost to T.J. Perkins and Hook Bomberry, defeated Ronin and Scorpio Sky and drew with Los Luchas, before losing a deciding four-way elimination match to Los Luchas, who then advanced to the tournament itself.

At the end of the match, Max, thinking Jeremy was trying to steal the spotlight from him, turned on his brother, crotching him at the top rope, before dropping him to the mat with a rope-hung DDT. After Kendrick had pinned Jeremy for the win, Max removed his Generation Me armband and threw it at his brother. On April 17 at Lockdown, Max defeated seven other men, including Jeremy, in an Xscape match to become the number one contender to Kazarian's X Division Championship. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, Generation Me, seemingly once again on the same page as faces, came together with Amazing Red and Brian Kendrick to fight for X Division's future, after the legitimate firing of Jay Lethal. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Max failed in his attempt to win the X Division Championship from Kazarian. At the all X Division pay-per-view Destination X on July 10, Generation Me was defeated by the team of Eric Young and Shark Boy. This was their last match in TNA as the following day Matt announced that he and his brother had requested their release from their contracts with the promotion. Matt and Nick later revealed that the request stemmed from monetary issues, while also venting their frustrations with TNA's booking, noting the storyline with Tara, which went nowhere, and the quickly aborted feud between the brothers. Matt has also stated that after leaving TNA he was ready to quit professional wrestling altogether, before he and his brother decided to instead reinvent themselves and their act. On March 18, 2013, Generation Me returned to TNA to take part in the tapings of the Tag Team Tournament One Night Only pay-per-view. After defeating Petey Williams and Sonjay Dutt in the first round, they were eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon). At the tapings of the following day's Hardcore Justice 2 pay-per-view, Generation Me was defeated in a ladder match by Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian). =New Japan Pro-Wrestling= Debut and joining Bullet Club (2013–2016) The Young Bucks after winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on November 9, 2013 On October 15, 2013, NJPW announced that The Young Bucks would be making their debuts for the promotion in the 2013 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, which started October 25.

Three days later at Destruction in Kobe, The Young Bucks and Adam Cole were defeated by David Finlay, Ricochet and Satoshi Kojima in a match for the vacant NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.

The Young Bucks, along with Cody Rhodes, challenged the idea by planning a show specifically for the purposes of drawing ten thousand fans. In May 2018, it was announced that the show would be named \\"All In\\", and would be held on September 1, 2018 at the Sears Centre Arena, including many popular wrestlers from various promotions such as Ring of Honor, New Japan Pro-Wrestling and the independent circuit. When All In was announced on May 13, tickets sold out in 30 minutes. At the event, The Young Bucks along with Kota Ibushi defeated Bandido, Rey Fénix, and Rey Mysterio in the main event. =All Elite Wrestling (2018–present)= On November 5, 2018, several trademarks were filed in Jacksonville, Florida that indicated the launch of All Elite Wrestling. In December 2018, Cody, The Young Bucks and several other wrestlers left ROH. The official announcement of AEW's creation came at midnight Pacific Time on January 1, 2019 in an episode of Being the Elite, a YouTube web series created by and featuring The Elite. Also announced in the episode was \\"Double or Nothing\\", AEW's inaugural event and sequel to \\"All In\\". On January 2, 2019, Cody and The Young Bucks officially signed five-year contracts with the promotion, serving as AEW's executive vice presidents, while entrepreneur, football executive and longtime wrestling fan Tony Khan was announced as the president of the company. On January 8, 2019, the company held its inaugural press conference on the forecourt of the TIAA Bank Field, where they announced talents that were going to perform as part of the promotion including Joey Janela, Christopher Daniels, Scorpio Sky, Pac, Frankie Kazarian and Chris Jericho. They also announced a working relationship with Chinese professional wrestling promotion Oriental Wrestling Entertainment (OWE), an organization founded by Cima. On March 16, 2019, the Bucks made their debut at the Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) as part of partnership with All Elite Wrestling at the Rey de Reyes event where they challenged the newly crowned AAA World Tag Team Champions the Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Fénix) who defeated Los Mercenarios (El Texano Jr. & Rey Escorpión). Later that same night, the Bucks defeated the Lucha Brothers to win their titles, this being their first championship in Mexico.http://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/young-bucks-aaa-tag-titles/ They lost the titles back to the Lucha Brothers at Verano de Escándalo in June. At AEW's inaugural event, Double or Nothing, on May 25, The Young Bucks defeated the Lucha Brothers. The following month at the Fyter Fest event, The Young Bucks teamed with Kenny Omega to defeat the Lucha Brothers and Laredo Kid in a six- man tag team match. They then followed this with a win over Cody and Dustin Rhodes at Fight for the Fallen on July 13. At All Out on August 31, The Young Bucks lost in a rematch for the AAA World Tag Team Championship to the Lucha Brothers in a ladder match, ending their feud. On the premiere episode of Dynamite on October 2, The Young Bucks teamed with Kenny Omega in a losing effort to Chris Jericho, Santana and Ortiz. After the match, The Young Bucks, Omega and Cody were beaten down by Jericho, Santana, Ortiz, Sammy Guevara and the debuting Jake Hager, marking the debut of The Inner Circle faction to rival The Elite. The team then entered into a tournament to crown the inaugural AEW World Tag Team Champions, but were eliminated by Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) in the first round. The Young Bucks subsequently resumed their feud with The Inner Circle, leading to a match between The Young Bucks and Santana and Ortiz being arranged for Full Gear on November 9, which Santana and Ortiz won. The feud between the two teams concluded on the December 11 episode of Dynamite, when The Young Bucks defeated Santana and Ortiz in a street fight tag team match. At Bash at the Beach on January 15, 2020, The Young Bucks competed in a four-way tag team match to determine the number one contenders for the AEW World Tag Team Championship, but the match was won by Adam Page and Kenny Omega. On the February 19 episode of Dynamite, The Young Bucks won a tag team battle royal for the right to face Page and Omega for the championship at the Revolution pay-per-view on February 29, but failed to win after Page pinned Matt Jackson. On the March 11 episode of Dynamite, Nick Jackson was given a kayfabe injury by the hands of the Inner Circle; in reality, he had taken paternity leave for the birth of his third child. Shortly after Double or Nothing, they returned and on an episode of Dynamite, where they challenged FTR for a shot at the AEW tag team championship, Hangman Page interfering and costing them the title shot, kicking him out of the elite. At All Out, they faced The Jurassic Express and won, expressing a new attitude. On the September 9 episode of Dynamite, they superkicked Alex Marvez, turning heel in the process.

It claims a Taoist identityPalmer, 2011. p. 27 and is centered on the worship of Guanyin as the incarnation of the principle of the universe, the \\"Only God of the Unlimited\\" (无极只神 Wújí Zhīshén). History =Yang Zai's life= Zailiism was founded during the waning years of the Ming dynasty by Yang Zai (1621-1754; alias Yang Chengqing or Yang Rulai), a holder of the jinshi degree from Jimo, Shandong. Although anxious to take up an official position, Yang remained in Jimo to care for his aged mother. After her death he became a religious leader, and there are different accounts about how this happened. Some sources attribute this to a vision or encounter with Guanyin. He certainly migrated to the mountains of Ji County in Tianjin. Here he remained for ten years in meditation in the Lanshui Cave, he purified himself and formulated his philosophical teachings revolving around the Eight Proscriptions (ba jie). At the age of eighty he took ten disciples, who were sent in different directions to spread the teaching. Yang, thanks to his techniques of meditation and refinement, reputedly died at the age of 133. =18th century: Yin Ruo leadership= The religion was formally established in Tianjin, and by the mid 18th century it had spread throughout north China.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 Mass following was founded on the work of Yin Ruo (1729-1806; alias Yin Laifeng and Yin Zhongshan), the second great patriarch in the history of the sect. In 1766, Yin founded the first common house (gong suo) in the suburbs of Tianjin; common houses became the basic and characteristic organisation units of Zailiism. They are both temples and meeting houses, and early common houses were rooms in private homes and village temples. By the early republican period some of them had evolved into elaborate complexes of buildings and courtyards. Common houses were run by two layers of leadership: ritual and administrative. The ritual ministers were the dangjia, celibate men who engaged in a strict self-cultivation regimen.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 In Tianjin every common house had a single dangjia, who more than parish priests were holy men and moral exemplars, who led few yearly rituals of the sect. The administrative counterpart was the \\"manager\\" (chengbanren), a lay who cared for the daily activities of the common house. =19th and 20th century= The spread of Zailiism did not go unnoticed, and in the 19th century Qing dynasty officials carried out various investigations to verify the orthodoxy of the sect, always concluding that it was orthodox and contributed to the economy and morality of the population. Some officials advised the throne not only to recognise the sect, but even to encourage it to counter the growing influence of Christianity. In 1891, Zaili lodges led an uprising in Rehe, in a climate of Han Chinese discontent with privileges of the Mongol nobility and the Catholic Church.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 Although the uprising was crushed, the tensions festered and reemerged within the Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the century.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 The sect grew rapidly in the last years of the Qing dynasty and in the early republic. Zaili adherents operated a large number of lodges and took over some disrepaired temples of other religions.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 By the late 19th century it had already established a strong presence in Manchuria, and by the early 20th century it started to exhibit a national character. It even spread among ethnic Chinese in Russia. By the 1920s the sect had an established presence in all major cities of China, and when Jiangsu province outlawed it in 1929, influential leaders of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai appealed to the national government to have the ban lifted. In August 1929 the Ministry of the Interior gave explicit approval to Zailiism. =Contemporary developments= Zailiism returned active in China's Hebei province since the late 1990s.DuBois, 2005 It also has 186,000 members in Taiwan, corresponding to 0.8% of the total population. There is a Chinese United Church of Liism (中华理教总会 Zhōnghuá Lǐjiào Zǒnghuì) and other smaller bodies. Philanthropy The most characteristic element of Zailiism is the emphasis on physical purity and abstinence from addictive substances. Zailiism spread as members founded charities and campaigned for abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and opium, and offering cures for the addicts.Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98 Zaili followers developed drug rehabilitation centres using herbal medicines and self-cultivation techniques (zhengshen), which were said to fully cure two hundred addicts per year.Yeh, 2000. p. 344 Zaili members also founded the \\"China's General Association for the Prevention of Alcohol and Tobacco According to the Righteously Good Teachings\\" (中華全國理善勸戒煙酒總會 Zhōnghuá quánguó lǐ shàn quàn jièyān jiǔ zǒng huì), that was recognized by the Yuan Shikai government in June 1913.Yang, 2008. p. 213 See also * Taoism Footnotes References Sources * D.

It carries U.S. Route 31E and U.S. Route 150, from the intersection of Baxter Avenue (US 31E) and Broadway (US 150), southeast through Jefferson and Bullitt counties; in Spencer and Nelson counties, the road is named Louisville Road; that road becomes 3rd Street in Bardstown, where US 31E and US 150 split at the intersection with U.S. Route 62 (Stephen Foster Avenue). The segment in The Highlands from Douglass Boulevard to Bardstown Road's northern terminus at Baxter Avenue, along with several blocks of Baxter Avenue north of the terminus, is notable for being the only road in the United States that has both lane lights and on-street parking. Currently, that segment has four lanes in all, with the outer two lanes used for on-street parking during non-peak traffic hours. Parking is banned during morning and evening commuting hours, during which all four lanes become traffic lanes with movements controlled by lane lights. Two lanes are dedicated to traffic in the normal commuting direction (northbound in the morning and southbound in the evening); the lane to the left of commuting traffic becomes a dedicated left-turn lane; and the final lane accommodates traffic traveling opposite the commuting direction. In 2017, the merged government of Louisville and Jefferson County commissioned a study to suggest possible changes to traffic patterns through The Highlands, with the study being released in mid-2018. The study recommended that the permanent traffic pattern should be one lane in each direction at all times, with permanent on-street parking throughout except at the approaches to signalized intersections, which would now include permanent left-turn lanes. Recommendations were also made for two more southerly sections of the road between Douglass Boulevard and the Watterson Expressway, which currently have two traffic lanes in each direction. Between Douglass Boulevard and Taylorsville Road, on-street parking would be eliminated and a center two-way left-turn lane would be added. Such a turn lane would also be added between Tyler Lane and Brighton Drive (roughly from Assumption High School to Sullivan University), an area without on-street parking. The final plan is set to be announced in August 2018, though because of the road's designation as a U.S. highway, state approval is required before any work can start.

Included on the list was: Berwick Area High School. Five hundred fifty-two (552) public schools were on the list for 2016. The program empowers eligible students, residing within the boundaries of a low-achieving school, to apply for a scholarship to attend another public or nonpublic school. Berwick Area School District and Millville Area School District are the two school district in Columbia County with schools on the lowest achievement list in 2016-17. In 2015, the (PDE) released a report identifying Berwick Area High School School as among the lowest achieving schools for reading and mathematics in the state. It remains the only lowest achieving school in Columbia County. One hundred four (104) public school districts had one or more schools on the list. In April 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Education released a report identifying one Berwick Area School District school as among the lowest achieving schools for reading and mathematics in the state. Berwick Area High School was among the 15% lowest achieving schools in the Commonwealth. Students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. Fifty-three public schools in Allegheny County are among the lowest-achieving schools in 2011. According to the report, parents in 414 public schools (74 school districts) were offered access to these scholarships. For the 2012-13 school year, nine public school districts in Pennsylvania had all of their schools placed on the list including: Steelton- Highspire School District, Sto-Rox School District, Chester Upland School District, Clairton City School District, Duquesne City School District, Farrell Area School District, Wilkinsburg Borough School District, and William Penn School District.Olsen, Laura, State list of failing schools has 53 in county, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, July 26, 2012 In 2014, Monessen City School District had all three of its schools added to the list.

The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Berwick Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, the Berwick Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Berwick Area High School received $9,268 which was used to purchase equipment for its Get Fit Don't Quit program. Orange Street Elementary School also received a grant for $6,290 for a dance recess program.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Bullying policy and school safety Berwick Area School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the District in 2012. Additionally, there was one bomb threat and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in sixteen incidents at the schools with one arrest. In 2009, the administrative reported there were 3 incidents of bullying in the district. The Berwick Area School Board prohibits bullying by district students and faculty. The policy defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. =School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant= In 2014, Pennsylvania began a grant program providing funding for programs to address school violence and security. Eligible schools and municipalities could apply for up to $60,000 for a school resource officer and up to $40,000 for a school police officer. Berwick Area School District applied and was awarded $38,484.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees 2014, 2014 Berwick Area did not participate in the state's Safe Schools targeted grant. Special education In December 2015, Berwick Area School District administration reported that 576 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 52.1% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2013, 19.87% of Berwick Area School District students were identified as needing special education services, with 53% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Berwick Area School District reported that 600 pupils received special education services which was 18% of pupils enrolled. Fifty three percent (53%) of special education students had a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 595 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Berwick Area School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Senator Patrick Browne, Committee Chairperson, Senate Education Committee Holds Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability, November 1, 2011 The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Pennsylvania Department of Education Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 Overidentification of students in order to increase state funding has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have less than 10% supported through special education services.Baruch Kintisch Education Law Center, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 The Berwick Area School District received a $2,091,063 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. *2016-17 school year, Berwick Area School District received a 1.5% increase in state special education funding to $2,210,558.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016-17, July 2016 *2017-18 - $2,244,327, a 1.8% increase =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 179 or 5.52% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 By 2015, Berwick Area employed 244 teachers and administrators, with the average teacher salary in Berwick Area School District was $63,441 a year, while the highest salary was $150,729. The teachers receive health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, sick days, 2-5 personal days, 5 to 10 bereavement leave days, 2 emergency leave days and reimbursement for college courses. Teachers who have worked in Pennsylvania for 10 years and the district for 5 years can take sabbatical leave at one-half salary and all benefits paid by the district. Teachers work for a maximum of 185 days per year with 5 inservice days In 2013, the average teacher salary in Berwick Area School District was $58,177 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received rose to $25,944 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $84,122. In 2013, seventy-five of the District's teachers were paid $70,000 a year or more. Berwick Area School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each public school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year was 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.

Crimestoppers operates the 0800 555 111 telephone number, allowing people to call anonymously to pass on information about crime. People can also give information anonymously via an Anonymous Online Form on the Crimestoppers website. Callers are not required to give their name or any personal information. Crimestoppers now has more than 100 staff and almost 350 volunteers and has an income of more than £4.5m a year. Most Wanted In November 2005 Crimestoppers launched the Most Wanted section of its website where members of the public can look at images of people currently wanted by UK law enforcement agencies. Most Wanted is the only UK-wide online forum where individuals wanted by the police and other law enforcement bodies such as the National Crime Agency, HMRC and the UK Border Force can be found and information passed on about them anonymously by the public. As part of Most Wanted, the Unknowns Gallery was launched in February 2014. This allows law enforcement users to upload images of individuals that they require names for (often taken from e-fits or CCTV stills). With the gallery searchable by both crime type and location, this makes it easier for the public to put names to these faces without having to reveal their own identity.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/most-wanted/what-is-most-wanted/ Campaigns Crimestoppers runs a large number of campaigns each year educating the public about different crime types and appealing for information. Examples of campaigns include: =‘Scratch and Sniff’ Cannabis Cultivation Campaign= Starting in 2013, the charity and police forces across the country distributed \\"scratch and sniff\\" cards to the public to educate and inform them about the signs to spot and the specific smell of cannabis when it is growing. The campaign was designed to target cultivation by criminal gangs so hot spot areas, as informed by police intelligence, were targeted by 17 police forces throughout England and Wales. Due to the campaign, information passed to Crimestoppers on cannabis cultivation contributed to new cannabis farms being discovered and a number of arrests.https://crimestoppers- uk.org/get-involved/our-campaigns/national-campaigns/commercial-cannabis- cultivation/ =Game of Fraud= Crime figures show a substantial rise in reported fraud, boosted by a rise in identity theft and online scams costing the UK economy £63m per year. To help tackle these crimes, the charity has created a Game of Fraud website, featuring a survey with information on a variety of frauds, including romance fraud, courier fraud and online shopping fraud. Through a series of short questions, the quiz identifies which fraud types members of the public may be most vulnerable to and gives a detailed description of how they may be targeted. =Human Trafficking= Crimestoppers asks the public to help prevent human trafficking by passing on anonymously any information they have, no matter how small, about forced labour exploitation. Human trafficking is the second most profitable crime type in the world, second only to drugs, with an annual trade value of around $32 billion. Hundreds of men, women and children are identified as potential victims of labour trafficking in the UK each year, and the figure is rising.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/get-involved/our-campaigns/national- campaigns/human-trafficking/ Catching UK criminals abroad Crimestoppers works with partners including the National Crime Agency and the UK Border Agency to track down UK criminals that are believed to be on the run in Europe. Operation Captura is Crimestoppers’ campaign that aims to track down UK criminals on the run in Spain. Spain has always been a popular place for UK criminals to hide, but in 2004 European Arrest Warrants came into effect, making it easier to extradite criminals. Operation Captura works by publicising the names and faces of wanted criminals who are believed to be in Spain, so people there can identify them and provide information as to their whereabouts.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/get-involved/our- campaigns/international-campaigns/operation-captura/ In March 2010, Crimestoppers worked with the National Crime Agency, Meld Misdaad Anoniem and the Dutch Police to launch Operation Return. Operation Return aimed to track down six UK criminals that were believed to be on the run in the Netherlands. This list consisted of some of the UK's most dangerous criminals that were wanted for crimes that vary from drugs smuggling, the illegal sale of firearms, robbery, violence and rape. A second Operation Return appeal was made in Amsterdam in June 2011, a third in February 2014 and a fourth in March 2016.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/get-involved/our-campaigns/international- campaigns/operation-return/ The Operation Zygos campaign targets fugitives hiding in Cyprus. The first arrest was made within 48 hours of the campaign launch when a man wanted for sexual offences against a child was located. Among those caught were also Wayne Smith and Julie Skelding, who were wanted for causing death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/get-involved/our-campaigns/international- campaigns/operation-zygos/ Fearless In April 2010 Crimestoppers launched Fearless, a dedicated youth service for 11- to 16-year-olds. Fearless replaced ShadowCS, Crimestoppers’ original youth brand. Fearless aims to educate and empower young people with information and advice about crimes that might affect them personally, their friends or their family. It includes an option for young people to pass on information about crime anonymously via an online form.http://www.fearless.org/  Regional activities  Crimestoppers works at a grassroots level across the UK. Supported by a volunteer network, regional teams work alongside local police, businesses and other charities, launching campaigns and events to help make communities safer places to live.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/in-your-area/  Rewards Crimestoppers pays rewards for information that directly leads to an arrest. The amount paid can range between £50 and £1,000, depending on the severity of the crime and the significance of the information being communicated. They do not pay rewards for the recovery of stolen property. An individual's anonymity is never compromised by claiming a reward as, when an individual passes information on to Crimestoppers, they can request a special code. If that individual wants to check whether they are eligible for a reward, they are requested to call Crimestoppers again at a later date with the code they were originally issued with. Crimestoppers then inform the caller whether they are eligible for a reward. If they are, the caller can choose a bank branch and a date when they would like to collect the money. The caller then goes to the bank branch, provides them with the code and is issued with the cash reward.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/rewards/  History  = Origins in USA and Norfolk = Crimestoppers originated in Albuquerque, USA in 1976 when a young man was shot dead during a robbery at a filling station, and having made little headway in finding the perpetrator, police decided to set up an anonymous phone line for witnesses to come forward with information. Within 72 hours, arrests were made, but what amazed the New Mexico police was the number of people giving information on other, unrelated crimes. So the Crimestoppers concept was born. Six years later Detective Inspector Mike Cole from Norfolk Constabulary, learnt about the scheme on a police visit to Peoria, in Illinois. He was impressed with how information was given anonymously, and also how callers giving information that led to an arrest put themselves in line for a reward payment from money donated by local businesses. On his return to Great Yarmouth, Mike submitted a report to his chief superintendent and the chief constable, who gave their approval for a Norfolk scheme. However, it was by chance that Jim Carter, the manager of the local Woolworths, subsequently received a letter from Chief Superintendent Peter Howse asking for support. When Jim followed up on this letter and learnt about the Crimestoppers scheme, he saw it as a good opportunity to get the community involved in crime-fighting. Other areas around the UK also learned of Crimestoppers and took it up around this time but there was no national, co-ordinated approach. = National operation = In 1985, PC Keith Blakelock was murdered during the riots at the Broadwater Farm Estate in London and the police appealed for information, stating that people knew who had been responsible but were frightened of coming forward. Michael Ashcroft (now Lord Ashcroft, KCMG and Chairman of the Trustees of Crimestoppers), a businessman, offered to provide the police with money for a reward to encourage somebody to come forward with information. This led to discussions with the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, resulting in Ashcroft founding the establishment of a national operation in the UK in January 1988. He set up the charity and, together with some business colleagues who were also concerned about the rise in violent crime, they funded the UK operation calling it the Community Action Trust. In many ITV regions, such as HTV, Granada, Thames and Tyne-Tees, appeals were broadcast at various times of the day but usually aired at around 15:25 or 18:25 on weekdays and after the live First Division Football match on Sundays from 1992 to the early 2000s when appeals were shown less on TV. A moving mouth montage on a grey background with the words Crime (in red) and Stoppers (in white) plus a theme composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams opened the appeal which would then feature a brief police reconstruction before showing the 0800 555 111 appeal telephone number. The charity was renamed the Crimestoppers Trust in 1995; by then it had expanded to cover the whole of the UK as the other Crimestoppers’ schemes foundered or were encompassed within the charity. Initially, the administrative organisation was based on ITV regions, but the best model proved to be local county-based committees working in partnership with single police forces. The roll-out of this structure continues; there are now 44 volunteer committees across the UK. Ashcroft has been Chairman of the Trustees of Crimestoppers for the last 20 years and remains a core donor to the charity.https://crimestoppers-uk.org/about-us/our- progress/ = Website security flaws = For most of 2015 the Crimestoppers online reporting website, touted as secure and anonymous, received an \\"F\\" rating in industry standard security tests, using obsolete 20-year-old protocols that made it fundamentally insecure. Crimestoppers fixed these problems in November 2015, ahead of the National Crime Agency and Independent Police Complaints Commission, which still had unfixed problems of the same magnitude at that date.  Results  According to their own statistics, the promise of anonymity has never been broken. As a result of the information given to Crimestoppers:https://crimestoppers-uk.org/about-us/ *Nearly 134,000 arrests and charges have been made since 1988. *Over 1.6 million actionable calls have been received since 1988. *More than £131 million of stolen goods has been recovered since 1988. *More than £326 million of drugs have been seized since 1988. *Around 14 people are arrested every day as a result of information given to Crimestoppers. *At least 23 per cent of all our information helps the police deliver an outcome, from arresting someone to preventing a crime.

It had a low death rate compared to other hospitals that served blacks in the South during the period. The hospital ceased operation in 1966 as a fraternal entity after years of increasingly burdensome regulation, competitive pressure from government and third-party health care alternatives, and the migration of younger dues-paying blacks to the North. The Afro- American Sons and Daughters disbanded during the same period. Huddleston's grandson is Mike Espy, a former member of the House of Representatives and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.

He was bred by retired cardiologist Kalarikkal Jayaraman and his wife, retired pathologist Vilasini Jayaraman, at their Tiffany Farm near Ocala, Florida.. On June 3, 2010, Summer Bird was retired due to complications of a previous injury. Belmont Stakes Raced by his breeders, Summer Bird won the 2009 Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown, in which Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness Stakes runner-up Mine That Bird was favored. The win was the second of his five-start career, and followed a third in the Arkansas Derby and a sixth in the Kentucky Derby. After the Belmont, he was sent to Monmouth Park, New Jersey to prep for the Haskell Invitational. He finished second in that race to champion female Rachel Alexandra. Travers Stakes Summer Bird was then taken to Saratoga Race Course to compete in the prestigious Travers Stakes. Mine That Bird was also entered, and Rachel Alexandra was a possible contender. Both horses were taken out of the race, though, Mine That Bird because of throat surgery and Rachel Alexandra because she was entered in the Woodward Stakes against older males the week after the Travers. Summer Bird took the lead in the Travers over Kensei at the quarter pole and held off a late closing longshot, Hold Me Back, to win and earn his second Grade 1 victory on a sloppy track. Quality Road finished third. Summer Bird also won the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont on October 3, 2009. He was the first horse in over 20 years to win all three prestigious races in New York. He then finished fourth in the Breeders' Cup Classic behind champion mare Zenyatta at Santa Anita Park on November 7, 2009, as the third betting choice at 6-1. He won the Eclipse Award for male three-year-olds in 2009. He was being pointed towards the Japan Cup Dirt, but during a recent workout he showed signs of distress and pulled up lame. He did not race in the Japan Cup, due to a condylar fracture in his right foreleg. On February 9, 2010, owners K.K. and Vilasini Jayaraman transferred Summer Bird, along with five other horses, to trainer Tim Ritchey. Although the colt underwent rehabilitation for his injury, he did not return to the races.. Stud career Summer Bird was retired to stud in 2011 and initially stood at Pauls Mill in Versailles, Kentucky, for a fee of $15,000. His first crop of US foals (2012) would begin racing in 2014. He was sold and exported to Japan in 2013 where he stood for one breeding season and died on December 23, 2013 of colic. His first crop of Japanese-born foals would begin racing in 2016. Pedigree Summer Bird joined Mine That Bird as the second foal of Birdstone to win a Triple Crown race and became the second third-generation descendant of Unbridled to do so. On his sire's side, he is also descended from 1964 Triple Crown contender Northern Dancer. His dam, Hong Kong Squall, was sired by Summer Squall, giving Summer Bird relation to 1999 Triple Crown contender Charismatic and making him a descendant of 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat. His dam's mother, Hong Kong Jade, gives him descent from 1987 Triple Crown contender Alysheba and, thus, Alydar, the horse that finished second in all three Triple Crown races to Affirmed in 1978. Hong Kong Squall died May 20, 2010, after giving birth to a full sister to Summer Bird.

Declarative contextual, causal, behavioral, and adaptive models for computational inferencing, analysis, and control can run and adapt based on the changing context of data-in-motion. This patented software technology enables the processing and the orchestration of context and causality for counterfactual analysis, decision support, and learning machines – addressing key roadblocks in the continued evolution of current AI, interoperability, and system-of-systems solutions. Vector Relational Data Modeling (VRDM) is an object-based modeling language that differs significantly from traditional object-oriented software descriptions. A key goal of VRDM is to enable the definition of executable models. This means that the modeling constructs need to be capable of fully specifying the runtime structure of an application. One way VRDM achieves this is by introducing the notion of a Vector, which allows the participants in object relationships to be determined dynamically, as the model executes. This and the other core object-based constructs that make up the VRDM modeling language are combined through configuration, and not coding, to make possible software applications that are executable models and that are interpreted dynamically, just-in-time, just-in-context, and just-in-state. The computational model underlying the GINA software was designed to facilitate a new type of Global Information Grid (GIG) for US security and defense Net-Centric Operations. In 2004, The GINA research and development team was convened under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) between the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California and XSLENT LLC. XSLENT LLC contributed the patented executable component based modeling environment technology with NPS providing leadership and implementation sponsorship. The project was called Network Aware Business Data Management System (NABDMS). In late 2008, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) began a second phase of the project under CRADA with Big Kahuna Technologies LLC, the current IP holders for the GINA technology.

He states \\"my race is my religion\\", and advocates \\"racial holy war\\" in accordance with the tenets of the Creativity religion. Cobb gained notoriety within anti-racist and anti-fascist movements, and legal advocacy organizations that investigate hate speech and hate crimes, for his \\"celebration of violence and murder committed against minorities\\", as documented in his video recordings, online activities, and disruptions of public events. Cobb is known for his attempt to take over the city of Leith, North Dakota, with other white supremacists. The community has around 32 inhabitants. Cobb, who moved to Leith in 2012, attracted other white supremacists to the town and displayed white nationalist paraphernalia on his properties. As a result, local residents and anti-racist organizations organized a protest in Leith against Cobb and his allies. Cobb has appeared on several radio talk shows in order to talk about his plans for the white supremacist movement in Leith. During his appearance on The Trisha Goddard Show, a DNA test was performed on Craig Cobb, showing that Cobb has 14% sub- Saharan African ancestry. Welcome to Leith, a documentary film about Cobb's attempt to take over Leith, was released in 2015. Biography =Youth and early adulthood= Cobb says he grew up a Christian, but has since denounced Christianity, saying \\"I don't understand Christians. They have a need to be morally superior than the next guy. ... They are very threatened by anything with racial cohesion.\\" After serving in the armed forces, he lived in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, for five years before moving to Hawaii, where he lived for another 25 years and earned a living as a taxi driver. In 2003, he relocated to Frost, West Virginia, where he opened a grocery store and subsequently registered a business called \\"Gray's Store, Aryan Autographs and 14 Words, L.L.C.\\" During this time, he was involved in unsolicited inter-state deliveries of a neo-Nazi newspaper published by Alex Linder, and distribution of Project Schoolyard CDs to local children, and also attended an invitation- only leadership conference of the National Alliance. =Moving abroad= In late 2005, after receiving an inheritance of $85,000, he moved to Tallinn, Estonia. In Tallinn, Cobb met with white power skinheads, and purchased land south of Tallinn where he hoped to establish an \\"International Office of White Diaspora\\". During this period, Cobb established Podblanc, a white supremacist video sharing website. He also unsuccessfully attempted to find an Estonian wife and came to public attention after conducting an interview with a former Estonian Ministry of Justice employee whom he introduced as the leader of the Estonian Neo-Nazis. On August 25, 2009, he was issued a ten-year ban from Estonia and deported to Canada, where Cobb claims to hold citizenship, for \\"endangering state security, public order, public safety, moral standards, health, other public interests\\" and promoting racism. During his period of incarceration before deportation, his supporters in the U.S. made contact with Canadian neo-fascist Paul Fromm in order to prepare for Cobb's anticipated arrest under Canadian hate speech laws. In March 2010, after posting videos of anti-racist activists online, he was discovered to be living in the Downtown Eastside area of Vancouver, British Columbia, where he also made an unsuccessful attempt to register a non-profit society called Whitepeace. =Returning to the U.S.= In June 2010, Cobb was arrested by police in Vancouver, but released with a summons after which he left Canada to return to the United States. In 2010, Cobb was living in Kalispell, Montana, which was a recruiting target for several white nationalists. Cobb engaged in a feud with another local neo-Nazi, Karl Gharst, against whom he had filed a restraining order in October 2010. His activities were opposed by the local pro-tolerance group Love Lives Here. At the end of December 2010, Canadian authorities issued a warrant for his arrest on the charge of \\"willful promotion of hatred\\" after a failure to appear\\". Cobb responded to the warrant by stating \\"You can find me in the orange easy chair near the elevator\\" at the Flathead County Library in Kalispell. Leith, North Dakota Cobb relocated to western North Dakota for its supply of high-paying jobs at oil fields and its high proportion of white residents. He claimed that he was fired from a job over disagreements with a co-worker, and that he lost a job with a Fargo paving company after there was media coverage of his settlement plans. While Cobb was working in Watford City, North Dakota, he found on Craigslist that there were lots available for sale in Leith, North Dakota. He moved there in 2012. As of December 2013, Cobb resided in Leith, where he tried to create a white supremacist community. By August 2013, he had purchased 13 plots of land in the town. Several other prominent white supremacists, including April Gaede and her husband, also own land in Leith. He has transferred ownership of two plots to fellow white supremacists Alex Linder and Tom Metzger. Another white supremacist, Jeff Schoep, visited Leith in late September 2013 in order to support Cobb, and he brought several fellow members of the National Socialist Movement with him. Several former members of Anti-Racist Action formed a peaceful, grassroots movement called UnityND and began organizing a demonstration of their own in Leith, that would protest against both Cobb and Schoep. Several hundred people attended the protests against Cobb and his allies, including hundreds of members of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. As a reaction to Cobb's planned takeover of Leith, some have even advocated disbanding Leith and dissolving it into Grant County proper. Cobb stated that he will pursue to file a restraining order against the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. =Plans for expansion= Cobb expressed interest in purchasing lots in Regan, North Dakota, and Crosby, North Dakota, and said he would leave Leith if his charges will be dropped. In February 2014, he sold his house in Leith and one other plot of land to a man from neighboring Carson, and in March he deeded his remaining lots back to Leith. Of the lots he originally purchased, three remain owned by Alex Linder, Tom Metzger, and Jeff Schoep. The lot owned by Linder was seized for non payment of property taxes. In 2016 he started dating a 38 year old paralegal from Texas, Emily Henderson, who is also a White Nationalist and had been a member of The World Church of the Creator, joining the same year Cobb did, 2002. After meeting in person in Missouri and spending more time together, they decided to stay a couple and she moved to Sherwood, ND to be with him.

Citing Cobb's failure to install a running water and sewage system in his properties within the 30-day deadline, the health unit announced that it would seek a court order to condemn his properties, unless he cooperated and released a plan detailing future water and sewage installation. Afterwards, Cobb announced that he had no intention of cooperating with the health unit and planned to fight the eviction notice. Arrest and release on probation In November 2013, Cobb and Kynan Dutton were arrested by two Grant county deputies and held in the Mercer County jail. Dutton was already out on bond for a previous drunk and disorderly conduct charge. Cobb was upset, claiming his property was vandalized by the town's residents; two videos from their subsequent 'patrol' were posted on YouTube. They were booked on suspicion of terrorizing. Ultimately, the two were charged with six counts of \\"terrorizing\\". However, the district attorney dropped the second of seven original counts after one man—acting as a reporter in some capacity—later claimed that he \\"did not feel threatened\\". According to the Leith website developer, Cobb and the other man arrested held the guns high and then lowered them, but did not speak and did not point the guns directly at the men. This despite two YouTube videos depicting a heated, profanity-filled exchange and tirade by Cobb. The two men subsequently appeared in court for a bond hearing, and the court decided that both should be held without bail. He refused food while in prison, but said that his refusal was not a hunger strike; rather, he was practising mahasamādhi and that he believed he would leave his physical body for another \\"plane of existence\\" at Yuletide. He also said he considers himself a martyr. Together with his follower Kynan Dutton the two men were scheduled for a preliminary hearing on seven felony accounts of terrorism to be held on January 13, 2014. His bail was set at $1 million. After a plea agreement, Cobb was released on April 29, 2014, on four years' probation and time served. Leith's Mayor Ryan Schock and Councilman Lee Cook, who was one of Cobb's victims, expressed concerns for the town's safety because Cobb had given property to white separatist Tom Metzger, National Socialist Movement Commander Jeff Schoep and white supremacist Alex Linder. Cobb himself had earlier announced his \\"retirement from white nationalism\\" and has said that he will seek permission to transfer his probation to Missouri where he will look after his mother. =Media appearances and genetic testing= In October 2013, Cobb was featured as a guest on The Trisha Goddard Show, where he met with the lone black resident of Leith and his white wife. The couple said that their lives were being disrupted and that their experience in Leith since Cobb moved in was being ridden with \\"turmoil and deception\\". The episode featured Shahrazad Ali, who agreed with Cobb on the concept of racial separation. In a November 2013 interview, Goddard revealed the results of a DNA test, to which Cobb had agreed, indicating that he was genetically 14 percent Sub-Saharan African. Cobb dismissed the results as \\"statistical noise\\". USA Today report that this may have been a contributing factor in arguments between Cobb and Dutton which led to their arrest. Cobb said in March 2015 that a second DNA test found him Caucasian except for what he called a \\"3% Iberian thing\\". Antler, North Dakota In 2015, Cobb attempted to purchase $69,000 worth of property in Antler, North Dakota, in an attempt to take over the town and rename it \\"Trump\\", a reference to Donald Trump, whom Cobb says he admires. Nebraska In 2015, Cobb purchased three foreclosed properties, two in Red Cloud, Nebraska and one in Inavale, Nebraska. He stated that these purchases were part of another plan to establish an all-white community. A local court blocked the sale after nearby town residents were able to pay the back taxes for the properties. Video recordings and disruptions Cobb's video recordings fall into two types of productions. The first consists of unedited presentations of antisemitic canards commentary and discussion featuring close-up shots of himself, often presented as part of his \\"Deprogram\\" series on YouTube and Podblanc. The second consists of street interviews gathered at events where Cobb presents himself as a journalist for Vanguard News Network, asks a series of provocative questions laced with racial slurs, typically sparking outrage from targeted individuals. Documented incidents include a rally in Kingston, New York in 2005 and a 50 Cent concert in Tallinn in 2008. One such disruption occurred in October 2005 at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda as civil rights leader Rosa Parks was lying in state. Cobb confronted visitors, referred to Parks as a \\"shitskin communist\\", and stated that he was there to celebrate her death. Online activities Cobb posts under his own name on Stormfront and under the pseudonym \\"Chain\\" (on Podblanc), which references the abolition of the National Origins Formula in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. While his Internet activities center upon \\"tireless propaganda\\" for Podblanc he is also active in discussion boards where, after the arrest of Matt Hale in 2003 for soliciting the murder of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow, Cobb posted the judge's home address, family photographs and a map to her house. Lefkow's husband and mother were subsequently murdered, albeit by somebody not affiliated with Cobb or white supremacy. In reply to a reporter's question \\"What were you feeling when the double murder happened?\\" Cobb stated \\"What was I feeling? Emotions are not yet illegal. I was just fine with it. I think it was well done.\\" References External links * Category:Living people Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:American expatriates in Estonia Category:American Holocaust deniers Category:American neo-Nazis Category:Canadian Holocaust deniers Category:Canadian neo-Nazis Category:Converts to pagan religions from Christianity Category:American taxicab drivers Category:People from Boston Category:People from Minot, North Dakota Category:People from Missouri Category:American white supremacists Category:American white nationalists ","title":"Craig Cobb"},{"id":"23125199","text":"Kevin Wolthausen (born December 27, 1957) is an American football coach and former linebacker.

Early life Sandy was born into a family of musicians in Inverness, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada on April 17, 1935. His father Ronald and mother Cassie were both Scottish fiddlers. Cassie had long been considered one of the liveliest square dance fiddlers in the county. Sandy was one of fourteen children, most of whom played musical instruments. He started playing the pump organ at age 8 or 9 chording for family members and visiting fiddlers. At about age 16 he took up the fiddle, learning by ear. He also learned the guitar and in high school he was a drummer in the Inverness Pipe Band. Career Sandy moved to Toronto as a young man and took the music with him. He is personally responsible for creating a Cape Breton scene there. He linked up with other exiled Cape Bretoners to bring musicians to Toronto for Cape Breton style dances and to keep the music alive. Some of his guest appearances included the Mariposa Folk Festival at Toronto in 1971 and 1972 where he represented Cape Breton fiddlers. He performed at, and managed, the Scottish Talent Club in Toronto for approximately eight years. He has traveled extensively in Canada and the United States, and has made trips to Scotland as well as the Shetland and Orkney Islands doing fiddle workshops and concerts. He appeared for five years on the CBC National TV show “Ceilidh” from Halifax with other artists such as Winnie Chafe, Buddy MacMaster, John Campbell, Cameron Chisholm, and Doug MacPhee. Sandy was a member of the Cape Breton Symphony Fiddlers for many years, and performed on the John Allan Cameron CTV show with symphony director Bobby Brown, Buddy MacMaster, John Donald Cameron and Wilfred Gillis. Sandy made two trips to the Northwest Territories, where he taught fiddle and step dancing to many Native American and Inuit children under the auspices of the “Strings Across The Sky” program arranged by Toronto Symphony violinist Andrea Hansen. Sandy was an instructor at the Cape Breton Fiddling School at the Gaelic College in St. Ann's Bay for many years and successfully expanded the interest in that program to students from around the world. Sandy’s efforts in raising funds for the College through benefit concerts and his assistance to so many students was recognized by the Board of Governors of the College in 1995. Sandy was a feature artist on “Bridging Canada”, a simultaneous series of concerts held in October, 1996 on famous bridges from Vancouver to Montreal to foster and celebrate Canadian unity. Sandy performed on the famous Bloor Viaduct in Toronto. Sandy was one of the feature artists in the Mirvish production of “Needfire”, a Celtic musical, from 1998 – 2000 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre and the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto. He displayed the unique and traditional style of Cape Breton fiddling during numerous stage appearances throughout the show. Sandy has been a feature performer for many years at the Celtic Colours International Festival in Cape Breton. In 2009, the festival paid tribute to Sandy, to thank him for all he has done to preserve the music. His Toronto family band Steeped in Tradition , joined him for this concert in the beautiful St. Matthew's Church in his beloved Inverness. At Sandy's request, he was joined by some of his \\"teacher's pets\\", former students Jeff Gosse, Colin Grant , Kimberley Fraser and Dawn & Margie Beaton . Sandy worked as a manager at Air Canada until he retired after twenty-five years in 1983. He sold real estate in Scarborough until 1995. He continued to run fiddle classes in Toronto and taught Cape Breton step dancing. He is a prolific composer with over a hundred tunes to his credit, many in active circulation among Cape Breton players. Personal life Sandy married the former Lucy LeBlanc of Margaree Forks, Inverness County. They have two children, Brian, a guitarist, and Stephen, a bodhran player.

It aired weekdays on 160 stations across the United States. The program was produced and distributed by Meredith Corporation. The Better Show got its name from and is based on Meredith's flagship publication, Better Homes and Gardens. The show also tapped its other magazines' experts in home, shelter and parenting. This was not Better Homes and Gardens first foray into television; in the 1990s, the magazine presented a similar syndicated weekly program, Better Your Home with Better Homes and Gardens. In addition, the Australian version of the magazine has their TV program as well. The hour-long daytime strip show Better allows eight minutes of local content. While in Kansas City, the national version on KSMO-TV was also complemented by a total localized version, Better Kansas City, on KCTV. At least with Meredith stations those with some localized content gave a local version of the name. For example, WNEM-TV's version was called Better Mid-Michigan. while WGCL-TV's edition was known as Better Mornings Atlanta; and KPHO-TV's show was called Better Arizona. WPHL-TV (a Tribune-owned Better affiliate) aired the national version in the morning with local cut-ins throughout the hour, branded as Better Philly.  History and affiliates  The Better Show began on KPTV in Portland, Oregon as a local show. Production of the program began in several test markets in 2007 and placed into syndication later that year. By January 2008, the show was on 10 Meredith and 3 Journal stations. At that time, Meredith signed 12 additional stations to carry the show, 1 Fisher Communications, 7 LIN TV and 4 Northwest Broadcasting. Fisher launched in March 2008 while LIN and Northwest launched the fall. In Kansas City in September 2012, a totally localized Better Kansas City debuted on KCTV, while the national Better program aired on sister station KSMO-TV. Meredith announced that The Better Show would premiere on The Hallmark Channel in October 2012 to replace programming from Martha Stewart and to complement its \\"Home & Family\\" programming block. The CW Plus picked up Better for air on its stations in fall 2014, where it replaced The Daily Buzz. In February 2015, Meredith confirmed that the program would be cancelled at the end of May 2015. Repeats continued to air until mid-September 2015. Despite the cancellation of the national program, KCTV's Better Kansas City continues to be produced in that market as of December 2018, along with WFSB's Better Connecticut for central Connecticut.  Hosts and correspondents  The Better Show was co- hosted by Kristina Behr and JD Roberto from studios in Midtown Manhattan when it was cancelled. The show's other primary personality was correspondent Sarah Bernard. Initially, The Better Show was split-hosted by Emmy-nominated Audra Lowe in New York City and Kimberly Maus at KPTV in Portland, Oregon. In August 2009, the show's West Coast operations moved to WFSB in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, near Hartford. At that time Lowe became the program's solo host. Rhiannon Ally was named Lowe's co-host in January 2011. She originally joined the program in September 2009 as a correspondent based out of Rocky Hill. She had also served as Lowe's substitute. Ally left to take a news anchor position in Miami, Florida. On September 12, 2011, JD Roberto was added as a co-host. Reporter Leslie Nagy was the show's main correspondent. Home and design expert Jennifer Adams, gardening host Mar Jennings, and celebrity and country music interviewers Ashlie Kolb and Sarah Bernard made regular contributions to the program. Lowe served as the show's longest running host. When she walked away from her contract in 2013, the show hired soap opera veteran Rebecca Budig to replace her on the desk with Roberto. Budig stayed one season. All three hosts were nominated for a National Daytime Emmy in the \\"Best Hosting\\" category.

It is also used in the Indian film Aatish. The comedy troupe Warkop made a parody of this song in their 1979 film debut, Mana Tahan. The rhythm and melody of the song inspired many popular Egyptian chants, particularly related to Egyptian football. It is the most popular chant of Ahly (Cairo) fans, and is many directed at their most popular rivals Zamalek, they have used it to dis their rivals for more than 30 years. The Ahly chant has different lyrics and begins with a popular Egyptian folk term originally belonging to working farmers while digging the Suez canal, () meaning \\"hey hey, COME ON! (for enthusiasm)\\", and is then followed by () meaning \\"F*** the mothers of Zamalek\\". In 2019, the most popular chant for anti-government Lebanese protesters (particularly during the earliest protests) targeted their Caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, began with the famous Ahly chant against their rivals Zamalek, \\"Hela hela, hela hela ho\\", then followed by \\"Gebran Bassil k**s emmo,\\" which figuratively translates to \\"Hela hela, hela hela ho, f*** Gebran Bassil,\\" but literally insults his mother's genitalia. The Free Patriotic Movement, which Bassil leads, created an alternative version which failed to achieve popularity: \\"Hela hela, hela hela ho, Gebran Bassil mnħebbo,\\" meaning \\"we love him.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjbg51rTDc Meanwhile, feminist activists in Beirut coined an alternative pro-revolution chant: \\"Hela hela, hela hela ho, ay*i bi Gebran wa bi 'ammo.\\" This slogan, meaning \\"...f*** Gebran and his father-in-law.\\"Note: In Levantine Arabic, 'ammo (عمو) often means both paternal uncle and father-in-law.

He was born to another John Strange of Fleet Street, London and his second wife, Mary Plaistowe. He became a student at the Middle Temple on 11 July 1712 before starting a pupillage at the chambers of Charles Salkeld, who trained (among others) Lord Hardwicke.Foss (1870) p.636 He was called to the Bar on 27 October 1718. In 1735 he bought the lease of Leyton Grange House in Leyton, then in Essex. He married Susan Strong on 14 May 1722; they had two sons and nine daughters, including John Strange, a noted diplomat and philosopher. In 1725 he represented Lord Macclesfield at his impeachment, and he was made a King's Counsel on 9 February 1736. The same year, he became a Bencher of Middle Temple. He was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales on 28 January 1737, and was made a Member of Parliament for West Looe to allow him to take his position. After the death of the Master of the Rolls Joseph Jekyll on 19 August 1738, Strange was invited to succeed him, but declined the offer. He became Recorder of London in November 1739, and on 12 May 1740 he was knighted, along with Dudley Ryder, the Attorney General for England and Wales. He resigned as Member of Parliament for West Looe in 1741, but was reelected for Totnes in a by-election in 1742. In December 1742 he resigned as Recorder of London and Solicitor General, claiming ill-health, and also limited his practice as a barrister to the Court of King's Bench. In 1750 Lord Hardwicke convinced him to become Master of the Rolls, and he took his position on 11 January. On 17 March he was made a Privy Councillor. He served as master of the Rolls for four years until his death on 18 May 1754. After his death, his son John Strange, who had inherited (and sold) Grange House, published his father's court reports.

The military intervention, referred to as the Baguazo, resulted in two days of bloody confrontations, resulting in a total of 23 police deaths, 10 native/civilians deaths and more than 150 native wounded. This conflict has been described as Peru's worst political violence in years and is the worst crisis of President Alan García's presidency. Prime Minister Yehude Simon was forced to resign his post in the aftermath, and Congress repealed the laws that led to the protests. Background A free trade agreement negotiated between Peru and the United States that came into effect in February 2009 required certain changes in law allowing private companies access to the Amazon for development of resources. The Congress of Peru granted the government authority to implement the required regulatory changes. Indigenous tribes insisted that some of the new government regulations introduced by President Alan García in 2008 threatened the safety of their natural resources and would enable foreign companies to exploit them. Protests ensued in August 2008, and Congress repealed two laws and promised to examine and vote on others. When that didn't happen, protests and blockades resumed on 9 April 2009.ANALYSIS-\\"Peru Amazon conflict exposes rift over economic policy\\", Reuters, 9 June 2009\\"Peru's Deadly Battle Over Oil in the Amazon\\", Time, 10 June 2009 In the early 21st century, exploitation of mineral resources has been criticized by researchers based on the link they have shown between the abundance of natural resources (particularly minerals and oil) of a country and its poor growth performance, as well as poor governmental policies and institutions (subject to ills such as corruption, weak governance, rent-seeking, plunder). They found this relationship is especially related to development of 'point source' minerals such as mines and oil fields, which produce high value for few people, as opposed to agricultural diffuse development, which involves large quantities of workers, forcing benefits to be shared.MRE: Some believe that Peruvian oil development functions in such a model of 'point source', providing grievances and low benefit to local populations. In 2008 an oil scandal shook the government of Alan García when audio tapes revealing corruption and conflict of interest were released to the press. The tapes contained the conversations of Rómulo León, an important member of the ruling Apra party negotiating bribes from foreign companies in order to allow them to drill for petroleum in the Peruvian Amazon region. Romulo León was imprisoned, yet his daughter, Luciana León, a member of congress, continues to work in the parliament despite e-mail messages found by investigators that revealed that she was aware of and participating in her father's activities. In June 2009, as the dispute worsened, the government ordered the military in to assist the police. The deaths resulted in two clashes fought in the Amazon jungle on 5 and 6 June 2009. Battle at \\"Devil's Curve\\" On 5 June 2009, at least 32 people were killed in clashes between security forces and indigenous people on the \\"Devil's Curve\\" jungle highway close to Bagua, over 1,000 kilometres north of Lima, as the security forces attempted to break down a road blockade. The deaths came when police decided to break down a blockade of 5,000 protesters. 23 of the dead were native tribesmen and 9 were members of the police force. The tribes accused the police of using helicopters to fire on those protesting peacefully below. Alberto Pizango, an indigenous leader, told journalists that the government was responsible for the massacre. Police said the natives had first shot at them; the President said the tribes had \\"fall[en] to a criminal level\\". 6 June 2009 massacre On 6 June 2009, an additional nine police officers were killed at a petroleum facility belonging to a national oil company, Petroperú, which had been seized by the protesting indigenous tribes. Prime Minister Simon said the officers were killed as they tried to rescue 38 kidnapped police officers believed held. García criticised the protesters, claiming they had behaved like terrorists and suggested that they may have been \\"incited by foreigners\\". There was considerable confusion about the events, as it was reported that several police had been taken hostage, although 22 were freed and 7 were missing. This number was later revised to one missing policeman.Report on Massacre of Native Protesters in Peru Biased, Says Head of Inquiry The government announced a 3:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m. curfew effective immediately. According to Amazon Watch, the police staged a violent raid on the unarmed indigenous people who were participating in a peaceful blockade to revoke the \\"free trade\\" decrees, issued by President Garcia in the context of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. During that day, over 600 police attacked several thousand unarmed Awajun and Wamba indigenous peoples (including many women and children) and forcibly dispersed them using tear gas and live ammunition. After the police started shooting at the protesters, some indigenous wrestled away their guns and fought back, shooting and killing nine policemen. The confrontation resulted in the 25 civilian deaths and more than 150 wounded. The police were accused of burning bodies to hide the death toll.Teresa Bo Police in Peru accused of disappearing bodies, 10 June 2009, report hosted at The Real News At least 155 were injured, one third by bullet wounds; 72 people were arrested. The casualty toll was expected to rise. Not since the conflict with the Shining Path had so many people been killed or injured in political clashes of this nature in Peru. Consequences =AIDESEP leaders prosecuted, asylum for Pizango= On 9 June, the government of Peruvian President Alan García still refused to meet with the indigenous coalition AIDESEP. The government sought to arrest Alberto Pizango on charges of sedition; he is a Shawi Indian leader of the protesters and head of their organization, AIDESEP. Pizango entered Nicaragua's embassy in Lima on 8 June and was granted political asylum the next day.\\"Peru: Indigenous Leader Granted Asylum in Nicaragua\\", The New York Times, 9 June 2009 Four other AIDESEP leaders were accused of disturbing the peace and advocating sedition and revolt, and faced up to six years in prison.\\"PERU: Families of Dead Native Protesters Tell Their Stories\\" , Inter Press Service, 16 June 2009 =Decrees suspended, then overturned= In the week following the clashes, Congress suspended two of the offending government decrees. The indigenous protesters vowed to continue until the decrees were repealed and not just suspended.\\"Protesters Gird for Long Fight Over Opening Peru's Amazon\\", The New York Times, 11 June 2009 On 18 June, Congress repealed two of the decrees, and the protesters lifted their blockade.\\"Peru Overturns Decrees That Incited Protests\\", The New York Times, 18 June 2009 =Vildoso and Simon resign= Carmen Vildoso, minister for Women's Issues and Social Development, resigned on 8 June to protest the government's actions. Prime Minister Yehude Simon negotiated the deal to repeal the two decrees mentioned above and announced on 16 June that he would resign \\"in the coming weeks\\" over the government's handling of the crisis. President Alan García had appointed Simon, who is politically to the left of García, in October 2008 in an effort to mollify the country's poor and hard-line leftist nationalists.\\"Peru: Prime Minister to Step Down\\", The New York Times, 16 June 2009 =Peruvian government accused of undermining press freedom= In June 2009, Human Rights Watch condemned the Peruvian government's decision to revoke the broadcast license of a local radio station stating that \\"The timing and circumstances of the revocation suggest that it may have been an act of censorship, or punishment, in response to coverage of anti-government protests on June 5, 2009.\\" \\"If there is in fact credible evidence that a radio station has actively supported or incited violence, then the broadcasters should be subject to investigation and sanction, with all appropriate judicial guarantees\\", said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \\"But closing down a station this way certainly looks like retaliation for coverage the government didn't like.\\" =Documentary= The film When Two Worlds Collide is composed of footage shot from 2007 through 2013, and presents a view of events that is sympathetic toward the protestors.

History In the 1980s and 1990s, the United States Academic Decathlon had few third-party companies that wrote study materials for students, and individual teams had to do most of the research themselves. Daniel Berdichevsky had been part of the Taft High School Academic Decathlon in the 1992–1993 season, but had dropped out because he was \\"too scared of giving a speech\\". Despite this, Berdichevsky became team captain for the 1993–94 season. Berdichevsky and his teammates would go on to win the United States Academic Decathlon National Championship that year with the help of their coach, Dr. Berchin, who had also led a team to victory in 1989. Earlier that year, Berdichevsky had set an individual scoring record at the Los Angeles City competition that would remain unbroken until the 2007–08 season, when Isabel Salovaara from Whitney Young High School in Illinois earned 9,300 points to beat Berdichevsky's record by a mere three points. Six weeks after the competition, Berdichevsky and teammate Andrew Salter started creating guides and examinations for the next season. Their first year's product was very small, and was criticized for its errors, though it earned the two almost $20,000 in 5 months. However, when their old coach Dr. Berchin joined them the following year, DemiDec gained more stability and decided to continue with the venture in the future. During the following two years, the company changed structure to its current one; it began to rely heavily on \\"a network of former Decathletes, curriculum experts and experienced writers\\" to create a study course that included both study guides and practice examinations. In 1998, DemiDec nearly merged with USAD, but for an unknown reason, did not. Since then, the company has consistently come out with a variety of material for Academic Decathlon, including \\"Resource Guides\\", \\"Power Guides\\", flashcards, quizzes, and sequenced examinations. The materials are generally released in the summer, after having been seen by \\"Beta testers\\" – usually current or former Academic Decathletes. World Scholar's Cup Daniel Berdichevsky speaking at the 2009 World Scholar's Cup finals In 2006, Berdichevsky, citing disappointment that Academic Decathlon ended at just a national level (United States Academic Decathlon has offered International Programs since 2013) in a rapidly more interconnected world, created the World Scholar's Cup. Though the World Scholar's Cup is based on the Academic Decathlon, it follows a different format. Instead of ten subjects like the Academic Decathlon, the World Scholar's Cup includes only six subjects: science, history, literature, art and music, social studies, and a special area, of which three of those events are based on a different yearly theme. At the competition, students participate in four events that encompass all six subjects: a curriculum-based debate, an essay, a multiple choice test and the \\"Scholar's Bowl\\", a live tournament where team members may answer questions together. Teams generally consist of either two or three students and may represent either their school, multiple schools, or even countries; this policy further sets World Scholar's Cup apart from Academic Decathlon where six to nine students represent a single school. The culmination of the annual competition is held in one of the competing countries, of which there are currently 20. Companies that sponsor the World Scholar's Cup aside from DemiDec are FunnelBrain and iClicker Study Academies DemiDec also operates a number of \\"DemiDec Academies\\" in South Korea. The programs prepare students for variety of subjects, but focus on SAT Preparation for Korean students interested in studying in America.

The natural range of T. collina is from near Mount Gulaga (36° S) in the south of New South Wales to the border with the state of Queensland at the McPherson Range (28° S). The usual habitat is rainforest away from streams on shallow soils at high altitude. However, it can occasionally be seen at low altitudes such as at Seal Rocks and Chatswood West. T. collina is remarkably similar to the related T. laurina (Water Gum), but the latter species is strictly riparian.  Description  Tristaniopsis collina is a small to medium tree, up to in height and up to in trunk diameter. The trunk is irregular, not cylindrical. The bark is grey or creamy, very thin, with papery fibres that come off to touch. Branchlets are coloured purple and angular in cross section. The alternate simple leaves are around long, with a long thin tip, and numerous oil dots of varying sizes. The midrib is sunken on the top surface, but raised below. Yellow flowers form in cymes from November to January. The fruit is a dry capsule maturing from April to July. The fruit is practically identical to that of T. laurina.

He served for the duration of the conflict and is credited with saving the life of Col. William Washington (a cousin of then General George Washington). Background Everhart's parents, Christian Everhart and Maria Sybilla Geier Everhart were German immigrants. Their oldest son was Lawrence Everhart, born on May 6, 1755 in Frederick County, MD. (Note: His birth location so recorded by Lawrence Everhart in the Federal Government Pension papers of April 7, 1834.) Service in the Revolutionary War Following the Declaration of Independence, Everhart enlisted with the militia, The Flying Camp, headed by Capt. Jacob Goode as a private on August 1, 1776 at Taneytown, MD. The next day the company marched to Annapolis, MD and then to Philadelphia, PA for training. Lawrence was then reassigned to General Beall in New York. His first battle was at White Plains, NY. The battle resulted in a disastrous defeat for the American forces. Everhart's company retreated to Ft. Washington, but after reaching the Fort, Lawrence was taken prisoner along with the other troops. He, along with several others, later escaped from the British guards and fled to Ft. Lee. After Ft. Lee he was transferred to Hackensack, NJ. There he met with General George Washington. The General was extremely upset with the lack of trained soldiers and supplies provided by the Continental Congress and Everhart later remembered that \\"Washington was to the point of tears\\". Everhart was discharged from The Flying Camp in 1777 because he had served his required enlisted time. But he returned to regiment and remained with the officers to give assistance to them. He returned to his home in [Frederick County, MD] during harvest time of 1778. He reenlisted at the rank of Sergeant under Captain Swan with the cavalry regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Washington in Fredericktown, MD. In March 1779, his regiment marched through Fredericksburg to Petersburg with Lt. Col. Washington. During this time, he served as aide to Col. Washington. In April 1780, his cavalry regiment was stationed in Charlestown, SC. His regiment engaged in skirmishes with the British led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton at Stony Church, Monks Corner, and Rugley's Mill. Ongoing skirmishes between Lt. Col. Tarleton and American General Daniel Morgan's patriot forces finally culminated in the Battle of Cowpens. Everhart was wounded in the battle and taken prisoner by British forces. As a captive, Everhart famously expressed his wish to a nearby officer that he \\"hoped to God that it would be another Tarleton defeat\\". The British officer replied, \\" I am Colonel Tarleton, Sir!\\" And his retort being, \\"and I am Sgt. Everhart!\\" The conditions regarding Everhart's release either by escape or prisoner exchange remain obscure. However, it is known that he went on to Guliford Courthouse for medical care. Everhart was later sent to Yorktown, Virginia and had the opportunity to meet the Marquis de Lafayette. Everhart returned to his family home in Middletown, Maryland at the end of October. Within the next month he received a letter from Colonel Bayler to return to his former regiment to assist Bayler at Petersburg, Virginia. Before leaving he married Mary Anna Beckenbaugh, in Middletown, MD. Life After the War Following his service in the war, he became ordained as a minister in the Methodist church. In 1833, Rev. Everhart retired to his home near Middletown, MD where he resided until his death in 1840.

The school is the only St. Lucian secondary school to have produced a Nobel Laureate, producing the island's two Nobel laureates: Sir William Arthur Lewis and Derek Alton Walcott. The jurist and politician Sir Vincent Floissac was also a pupil at the school, as was John Compton, former Prime Minister of St. Lucia, and St. Lucia's former Ambassador to the United Nations (Honorable George William Odlum).  History  St. Mary's College was formally opened on 20 April 1890, three weeks after the first lessons had been given in the building. The school opened with a mere 27 students on roll ranging from age 6 years to 15 years in the now Parish Center on Micoud Street, Castries . The first headmaster, Mr. F.E. Bundy, received his training as a teacher at the \\"St. Mary's College for Teachers,\\" Hammersmith, England. His only assistant at first, was Mr. O'Neil Traynor. The first days at the college were full of difficulties for the teachers. The number of students on roll, by the end of 1890, had risen to 35. Of that number, a few spoke fluent English, some understood it but couldn't hold a fluent conversation. Others spoke French and the rest patois (French- based creole). It was really surprising that the masters were able to do as much as they did then with the material they were given. Fights frequently occurred and broken windows were an everyday occurrence. At the end of 1890, the College was in debt to the tune of €385, over €90 of which had been incurred since the College opened. To assist in writing off the debt, the F.M.I fathers gave €75 to the college. A handsome contribution in those days. In 1893, the College began receiving a \\"Grant-In-Aid\\" from the government on the condition that 10 pupils receive science scholarships from elementary schools on the results of an examination. Until 1895, students never sat any public exams, but this soon changed with the appointment of Mr. H.J. Meagher as headmaster. In December of that year, two students, Cecil and Garnet Garnaway were entered in the Cambridge preliminary local Examination which they sat in Barbados because there was no centre in St. Lucia. In December of the following year, a Cambridge Local Examination Centre was established at the college. At the end of 1898, the number of boys on roll was 53, the average attendance being 47. At that time the holidays were 6 weeks at Christmas, 2 weeks at midsummer and 2 weeks at Easter. The fees were from 3 to 6 guineas per annum payable in advance. There was also an arrangement by which the younger brother paid less. Towards the close of 1899, the staff consisted of 5 Brothers. At a Public Meeting in 1903, a resolution was passed that an Advisory Committee be appointed to control the affairs of the College and that Government Grant-In-Aid be raised from €200 to €400. The request was granted by the Government and Committee Formed. Brothers Canice Collins, Macartan Sheehy and Lawrence Reynolds arrived in St. Lucia on Saturday, 11 January 1947, having set out from Avonmouth, England on 28 December, 1946 on a 6,000 ton banana boat. They arrived at Port-of Spain, Trinidad, on 10 January 1947 and stayed overnight with the Holy Ghost Fathers, flying on to St. Lucia the following day. On their arrival in Castries they were welcomed by the French F.M.I. Fathers. Fr. Harcourt, who was Rector of St. Mary's College, was particularly glad to see them. They got a hearty welcome also from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny. St. Mary's College was the only secondary school in St. Lucia at that time. Founded in 1890, the student enrollment in 1947 was 80. The building was dilapidated; its woodwork had not been painted for years, the equipment was scanty and the classroom furniture was in poor condition. The Brothers had little over a week to settle in before the school would reopen after the Christmas vacation. Mr. Herman D. Boxill, who taught at the College for 18 years, was of considerable help in the preparation for the big day. On 22 January, Mass was celebrated before a packed audience in the ground floor of the College. Fr. Harcourt introduced the Brothers to the teachers, the students and the general congregation. Br. Canice Collins was installed as principal. For the first few months after they arrived in St. Lucia the Brothers lived in the presbytery in Castries, sharing accommodations with the F.M.I. Fathers. In March they moved into what became known as The Brothers' House, 69 Micoud St. This was to be their home for four years, until March 1951. During the first few years under the Brothers' administration, St. Mary's College saw many changes. Physical structures were improved and many aspects of Secondary Education were reorganized. =1948-1952= On 19 June 1948 much of the town of Castries was destroyed by fire. The work and courage displayed by the Brothers, lay staff and students were deeply appreciated by all and recognized officially. A local newspaper at the time referred to the leadership shown by the Brothers and stated that \\"it is a beacon of hope to the many striving to promote a spirit of initiative and cooperative action in the West Indies.\\" \\"At the New Year's Honours of 1949, Br. Canice received the MBE in recognition for his efforts on the night of the Castries fire.\\" During the next few years the number of students enrolled at St. Mary's College increased rapidly. As a result, the facilities available at the College in Castries became inadequate. Expanding and reconstructing the College on the same site was under consideration, as well as possible relocation to another location. At the same time, some military buildings dating back to the Anglo- French battles on the island which had housed soldiers of the West Indian Regiment at various times were vacant. One group of buildings was situated on a splendid site on the Vigie Peninsula a few miles from Castries. Though over 150 years old the buildings were in good structural condition and after lengthy negotiations with the authorities, including the War Office in London, an agreement was reached for their purchase. They were completely refurbished and at the end of July 1952 St. Mary's College was transferred to Vigie. By then, student enrollment had increased to 275. It proved fortunate that a bungalow adjacent to the main building, which had been the Commanding Officers' residence, was also available. In March 1951, a second fire devastated much of what remained of the old Castries, including No. 69 Micoud Street. The Brothers, now a community of five, moved into the bungalow at Vigie and it has continued to be the Brothers' residence ever since. =1953-1957= With the additional facilities and space available in the new location, new subjects were added to the curriculum and the student population increased to over 300. In 1953, hostel facilities at Vigie for students from out-lying rural areas were provided. One of the ancillary buildings was adapted and furnished for this purpose. \\"The Hostel\\", as it came to be called, served a very useful purpose for some 20 years. By 1973, the need was no longer acute and the building was then used to provide extra classroom space for the Sixth Form classes. In 1955, Br. Canice was transferred to San Fernando, Trinidad on completion of his term of office as Superior and College Principal. Br. Lawrence had previously moved to San Fernando in 1952 therefore, Br. Macartan was appointed Provincial Superior of the West Indies region in succession to Br. Dunstan Curtin, who returned to England. As Br. Macartan also took up residence in San Fernando, all three members of the founding community had left St. Lucia and were living in San Fernando. In 1957 Br. Canice went to Beaumont, Texas, U.S. for medical treatment. It was discovered that he would need brain surgery. Unfortunately the operation was unsuccessful and he died on 20 March at the age of 43 years. He is buried in Texas. In a telegram of condolence the Administrator of St. Lucia . J.K.R. Thorpe, CMG, wrote; \\"We are deeply conscious of the debt owed to him for his splendid and devoted work for this island, and he has an abiding place in our affection.\\" In 1990, to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of St. Mary's College, the St. Lucia postal authorities issued a commemorative stamp featuring a portrait of Br. Canice superimposed on a drawing of the college building at Vigie. From the mid-1950s onwards the number of Brothers coming to the West Indies increased. New foundations were established in Chaguanas, Trinidad and in St. John, Barbados. All this led to more frequent changes in the communities of the region, including the St. Lucia community. =1974= In November 1974 an event took place which was greatly to affect the Brothers in St. Lucia, both as a community and in their future relations with St. Mary's College. The Government introduced a bill establishing a Board of Management for St. Mary's College, replacing the St. Mary's College Advisory Committee. From the terms set out in the bill it was evident that the new Board of Management would have control over College affairs but would not accept responsibility for the College. It also became evident that the ownership of the property by the Brothers was an obstacle to a properly functioning Board as proposed by Government. After prolonged discussion at community and provincial level, in January 1975 the Brothers formally requested the Archbishop of Castries, Most Rev. Patrick Webster OSB, to take over the ownership of the buildings and property from the Presentation Brothers. (The Brothers retained ownership of their residence and three acres surrounding it.) The new arrangements for the administration of St. Mary's College, though the subject of various letters of protest in the local press and even of public demonstrations in Castries, came into effect in September 1975. The Presentation Brothers had agreed to remain as members of the College staff (for which the Government expressed appreciation) but for the first time since the arrival of the Brothers in 1947 there was a Principal other than a Presentation Brother. This was Fr. T J. Stack who had previously taught at the College as a Presentation Brother before being ordained priest for the Archdiocese of Castries. The patronal feast of the College is still Presentation Day, 21 November, and admiration of the work done by the Brothers for the College and for education generally has been expressed publicly on numerous occasions. During the College Speech Day on 21 November 1976, His Excellency the Governor, Sir Allen Lewis QC, a leading member of the Anglican community in St. Lucia, a past student of St. Mary's and brother of Nobel Prize winner Sir Arthur Lewis, said: \\"The advent of the Presentation Brothers in 1947 marked a turning point in the management and growth of St. Mary's College. Their breadth of vision, their concern for the welfare of the community, their administrative ability, scholarship and devotion to duty and to the welfare of their students have brought great benefits to St. Lucia. I should like to take this opportunity to express publicly the appreciation and gratitude of the people of St. Lucia for the work the Brothers have done and continue to do among us.\\" =1979= St. Lucia became an independent nation, having been ruled by Britain since 1814. The Prime Minister with a cabinet of 10 ministers forms the Government. The 17 member House of Assembly and the 11 member Senate pass the nation's laws. The members of the House are elected by the people and government leaders appoint the Senate members. In 1979, Sir Arthur Lewis (1915–91)http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic- sciences/laureates/1979/lewis-facts.html an economist and alumnus of St. Mary's College, was awarded the Nobel Prize. He and Theodore W. Schultz of the United States shared the prize for their work on the economic problems of developing nations. Lewis's economic theories emphasise the relationship between traditional agriculture and modern industries in the developing countries. He was a past pupil of St. Mary's College having been a student there in the 1930s. He was the first West Indian to be awarded the Nobel prize. Twenty years later another past pupil, Derek Walcott, would be similarly honoured. =1977-1991= In 1977 the St. Lucia community was reduced to two Brothers, Br. Cyril O'Sullivan who taught at the College and Br. Macartan. Br. Macartan had been awarded the MBE at the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1974 in recognition of his work and that of the Brothers for education in St. Lucia. Though now retired from teaching he continued to assist at the Ministry of Education with the organizing of the Cambridge Overseas Examinations Br. Macartan's health began to fail, and in September 1979, it was obvious that he was seriously ill. He went to Barbados for medical treatment and he died at St. Joseph's Hospital on 22 September. His remains were brought back to St. Lucia and after Requiem Mass celebrated by Bishop Guilly his funeral to the Riverside Cemetery was an indication of the very high esteem in which he was held by the people of Castries and St. Lucia. For quite a number of year's after Br. Macartan's death Br. Cyril was the only Brother in St. Lucia. Br. Martin Walsh from Canada was a regular visitor during the winter months. During the early '80s the community increased to two and then three and by 1989 there were four and in 1990 five. In 1991 the Community experienced another great loss. On 22 July of that year Br. Ligouri O'Mahony died during his sleep at the comparatively young age of 64. He had spent 37 years in the West Indies and was the last Presentation Brother to be Principal of St. Mary's College. Br. Ligouri is buried in St. Lucia. =1992= In 1992, Derek Walcott, who had been one of the senior form pupils at St. Mary's when the Brothers arrived, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Derek became a member of the teaching staff when he graduated at St. Mary's. A poet and playwright, his work explores such themes as the Caribbean experience from slavery to independence and the nature of the Caribbean's post-colonial identity, influenced by many cultures and traditions. Twenty years earlier another past pupil, Sir Arthur Lewis had also been a Nobel Prize winner. =1993 : CARE - a new apostolate= In March 1993 Br. Dominic Brunnock joined the St. Lucia community. He had been working in Trinidad with the SERVOL programme from 1989 to 1993. SERVOL caters for the needs of disadvantaged teenagers, especially early school leavers. =Modern college life= Today St. Mary's College is recognised as one of St. Lucia's top secondary schools, performing well in all aspects of school life on the island. As of 2009 the school placed a close second to St. Joseph's Convent in the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) Exams. Over the past few years the institution has produced the top national performers for the Caribbean Examinations Council CSEC examinations. In 2008 Trent St. Rose was the top performer, setting the trend for fellow Samarians Jarnickae Wilson (2011), Dajr Alfred (2012) and Ravindra Mangar (2013). The school also boasts a strong extra-curricular program. St. Mary's College has produced top ranking projects in the National Science Fair, having won top prizes in recent years. The school won the inaugural Sagicor Visionaries Challenge in 2013. Also, the school has an active Young Leaders program having placed consistently in the top three for the past couple of years. Additionally, St. Mary's boats a thriving drama club as well as choir and cadet corps. Other notable alumni *Dunstan St. Omer, painter and muralist; designed St. Lucia's national flag S.M.C.

Similar to the works of pop art, Blake has used everyday images to produce his art. His early works were based entirely on the idea of creating images and art from barcodes.  Education  Blake graduated from Brandon Senior High School in Tampa, Florida in 1995. He received a BFA in computer art from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2003.  Works  In 2003, Blake created Downloading Pixels which shows a progression of downloaded pixels that in turn become an image that could be viewed on a monitor or mobile device. Like John F. Simon Jr.'s Every Icon, each pixel is an image that loads up at different intervals to make the image seem like an animation, caused by the changing pixels. The image is tailored based on user-chosen image size, browser technology, internet connection speed, and device, causing the work to look differently on each platform. In 2006, Blake created a flipbook consisting of images of United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Accompanying the images are essays written by a wide range of participants, each expressing their personal experience of the September 11 attacks. The 9/11 Flipbook project is ongoing and Blake is still accepting written reactions to it.

The film, which was written by Eric Hughes (adaptation) and Adam Kennedy (screenplay), was based on the 1976 book of the same name by Clive Cussler. The story concerns a plan to recover the RMS Titanic due to the fact that it was carrying cargo valuable to Cold War hegemony. The film starred Jason Robards, Richard Jordan, David Selby, Anne Archer, and Sir Alec Guinness, it received mixed reviews by critics and audiences and proved to be a box-office bomb. The film grossed about $7 million against an estimated $40 million budget. Producer Lew Grade later remarked \\"it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic\\". Plot The film opens on the fictional island of Svardlov in the Barents Sea north of the Soviet Union where an American spy breaks into an old mine and discovers the frozen body of a U.S. Army sergeant and mining expert Jake Hobart. Next to Hobart's corpse is a newspaper from November 1911, as well as some mining tools from the early part of the 20th century. Using a radiation meter, the spy discovers that what he seeks, an extremely rare mineral named byzanium, was there but had been mined out leaving only traces. He is then chased and shot by Soviet forces, but is rescued at the last moment by Dirk Pitt (Richard Jordan), a former U.S. Navy officer and a clandestine operator. It is explained by scientist Gene Seagram (David Selby) and the head of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA, a NASA-like agency for sea exploration) Admiral James Sandecker (Jason Robards) that the mineral their man was trying to find is needed to fuel a powerful new defence system, codenamed \\"the Sicilian Project\\". This system, using laser technology, would be able to destroy any incoming nuclear missiles during an attack and \\"make nuclear war obsolete\\". The CIA and Pitt soon find out that boxes of the raw mineral were loaded onto the Belfast-built RMS Titanic by an American in April 1912. A search is then conducted in the North Atlantic to locate the sunken ocean liner. The search team is aided by one of the Titanics last survivors (Alec Guinness), who explains he was also the last person to see the American alive. Just before the Titanic went down, the junior officer said the man locked himself inside the ship's vault containing the boxes of mineral ore, his last words being \\"thank God for Southby!\\" At this point it is decided that the only way to recover the byzanium is to literally \\"raise the Titanic\\" from the ocean floor. Pitt comes up with a salvage plan that Sandecker presents to the U.S. president. The president signs off on the plan and Pitt is put in charge of the operation. At this time the Soviet KGB station chief in Washington, D.C., Andre Prevlov (Bo Brundin), is receiving bits of information on the project and leaks them to a reporter, Dana Archibald (Anne Archer), who is also Seagram's lover as well as a former girlfriend of Pitt's. The story blows the project's secret cover and Sandecker must hold a press conference to explain why the ship is being raised. Questions are raised about byzanium, but are not answered. After a lengthy search, the Titanic is located and the search team, with help from the U.S. Navy, begins the dangerous job of raising the ship from the seabed. One of the submersibles, Starfish, experiences a cabin flood and implodes. Another submersible, the Deep Quest, is attempting to clear debris from one of the upper decks when it suddenly tears free of its supports, crashes through the skylight above the main staircase and becomes jammed. Pitt decides they must attempt to raise the ship before the Deep Quest crew suffocates. Eventually, the rusting Titanic is brought to the surface using compressed air tanks and buoyancy aids. During the ascent, the Deep Quest safely breaks away from the ship. When Prevlov, who has been aboard a nearby Soviet spy ship, sees the Titanic, he arranges a fake distress call to draw the American naval escorts away from the operation. He then meets Sandecker, Pitt, and Seagram aboard their vessel. He tells them that his government knows all about the mineral and challenges them for both salvage of the Titanic as well as ownership of the ore, claiming it was illegally taken from Russian soil. Prevlov says that if there is to be a \\"superior weapon\\" made from the mineral, then \\"Russia must have it!\\" Sandecker tells Prevlov that they knew he was coming and that he would threaten them. Pitt then escorts him to the deck where U.S. fighter jets and a nuclear attack submarine have arrived to protect the Titanic from their attempted piracy. Prevlov leaves in defeat. The ship is then towed into New York harbour and moored at the old White Star Line dock, its original intended destination. The arrival is greeted with much fanfare, including huge cheering crowds, escorting ships, and aircraft. On entering the watertight vault, the salvage team discovers the mummified remains of the American, but no mineral. Instead, they find only boxes of gravel. As they contemplate their probable failure, Sandecker tells Pitt and Seagram that, in addition to powering the defensive system, they were actually thinking of a way to weaponise the byzanium and create a superbomb, which went against everything the scientist believed in. As Pitt listens, he goes through the belongings of the dead American found in the vault and finds an unmailed postcard. He then realises that there was a clue in those final words, \\"thank God for Southby!\\". The postcard showed a church and graveyard in the fictional village of Southby on the English coast, the place the American had arranged a fake burial for the frozen miner Jake Hobart prior to sailing back to the United States on the Titanic. Pitt and Seagram alone go to the small graveyard and find that the byzanium had indeed been buried there. They decide to leave the mineral in the grave because they agree its existence would destabilise the status quo that maintains the peace between the West and the Soviet Union.

The following month however it was clarified that the film rights had not yet been offered. =Stanley Kramer= Lew Grade said he read the novel by Clive Cussler and became interested, thinking there was potential for a series along the lines of the James Bond films. He discovered that Stanley Kramer was interested in directing, and Grade said he would buy the rights to the book and let Kramer direct and produce.Lew Grade, Still Dancing: My Story, William Collins & Sons 1987 p 260-261 (Kramer was making The Domino Principle for Kramer.) In October 1976 Grade announced he had the film rights for a reported $450,000. The book came out in late 1976 and was a best seller. In the summer of 1976 Kramer filmed footage from a Bicentennial Ball which he hoped to use in the movie. In January 1977 Kramer announced he had signed contracts to direct the film, which would be produced by Marvin Starger. In March Grade announced he had optioned the rights for two other Dirk Pitt novels, Iceberg and The Sea Dweller. At the Cannes Film Festival in May 1977, Lew Grade announced the film as part of a slate of projects which included The Boys from Brazil, The Golden Gate (from a novel by Alistair MacLean directed by Jerry Jameson), and $1.97 about the early years of Charles Bronson. Pre-production began and models of the ship were built; Grade said that the models were at least two or three times larger than they should be. The model was based on blue prints of the actual Titanic and were built at CBS Cinema Centre in Studio City at a cost of $5–6 million. Eventually in December 1977 Lew Grade announced that Kramer had left the project due to creative differences. Kramer said \\"the factors were casting and the number of miniatures we planned to use. You might say one of the possibilities as to why I left was that I felt things might have cost more. It's aways a little sad to see it happen this way. Raise the Titanic was a big challenge – all the excitement of special effects, underwater filming.\\" Kramer said the producers wanted the movie made for $9 million but he felt it would cost $14 million. Kramer was paid off with a fee of $500,000. =Jerry Jameson= In May 1978 Lew Grade announced the film would be directed by Jerry Jameson, who had been attached to The Golden Gate, which had not been made. Grade said the movie would be his most expensive yet, costing $20 million, but would not feature any major stars. \\"We don't need them\\", he said. \\"The ship is the star. Anyway the money that would normally go to actors has been spent on our models. They're magnificent.\\" Grade said the models cost $5 million. William Frye, who produced Jameson's Airport 77, was hired to produce. Production costs spiralled to as work was undertaken to find a ship that could be converted to look like the sunken Titanic. It was felt that the real Titanic, if raised from the bottom of the ocean, would come up rather gradually at a gentle angle, before levelling off on the surface. The tank in North Hollywood was too shallow and would launch the model like a rocket ship. It was decided to film in a bigger tank. In December 1978 construction began on a tanker in Malta to film the underwater scenes. \\"Malta was the only place we could find an existing tank with the right location and the right surroundings\\", said Grade. A double for the Titanic was found in Athens. =Screenplay= The screenplay also underwent numerous rewrites. The first writer to work on it was Adam Kennedy, who wrote the script for Stanley Kramer's film for Lew Grade, The Domino Principle. He was followed by Eric Hughes, Millard Kaufman and Arnold Schulman. Kennedy was brought back to do further revisions on the script and he gets sole credit. Novelist Larry McMurtry – who disliked Cussler's novel, considering it \\"less a novel than a manual on how to raise a very large boat from deep beneath the sea\\" – claims that he was one of approximately 17 writers who worked on the screenplay and the only one not to petition for a credit on the finished film. Admiral David Cooney, Chief of Information for the Navy, demanded the script be rewritten so as the Russians did not come off smarter than the Americans. Cussler was furious with the final result, because most of the original plot had been rejected leaving a hollow shell of his story; additionally he felt that the casting was wrong. =Casting= Elliott Gould was offered a lead role, but turned it down. \\"I don't want to raise the Titanic\\", he said. \\"Let the Titanic stay where it is\\", he said. Jason Robards said he did the film for \\"money, m'dear, money... We're all incidental to the hardware and the special effects on this one.\\" In October 1979 it was announced Richard Jordan would play Dirk Pitt. Clive Cussler made a cameo in the film as a reporter at the script conference. Filming Filming started in October 1979 at CBS Studio Centre. By this stage $15 million had already been spent on the tank and models. An old Greek ocean liner, SS Athinai, was converted into a replica of the Titanic. A scale model was used for close-up underwater scenes. At the time of filming there were conflicting views as to whether the Titanic had broken up as she foundered based on the original eyewitness testimony of the survivors, and – in line with the novel's assumption against the break-up narrative – the ship was portrayed as intact in the film. In 1985 the wreck of the real Titanic was located, confirming that she had broken up during the disaster, and lay in two pieces on the bottom of the North Atlantic in a state of advanced corrosion. A 10-tonne scale model was also built for the scene where the Titanic is raised to the surface. Costing $7 million, the model initially proved too large for any existing water tank. This problem led to one of the world's first horizon tanks being constructed at the Mediterranean Film Studios near Kalkara, Malta. The 10 million-gallon tank could create the illusion a ship was at sea. The Titanic model was raised more than 50 times until a satisfactory shot was acquired. Following the completion of filming, the scale model was left to rust for 30 years at the side of the horizon tank (at ). In January 2003 a storm caused damage to the model. By 2012 the remains of the metal structure had been moved to a new location closer to the sea (at ). The final scene involved Alec Guinness at St. Ives in Cornwall over two days. The day before the shoot St Ives had its worst storm in one hundred years, destroying the church where the scene was to be shot so it had to be relocated. Soundtrack John Barry created the film's musical score, which became the most acclaimed aspect of the production and is considered by many to be one of the very best of Barry's career – closely following the style of his soundtrack for the James Bond film Moonraker the preceding year, with militaristic passages reflecting the Cold War aspects of the plot to the dark, cold, brooding compositions reflected in the underwater scenes. Though the original recordings of the music have been lost, Silva Screen Records, along with Nic Raine, one of Barry's orchestrators, commissioned a re-recording in 1999 of the complete score with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In August 2014 Network On Air were to release Raise The Titanic on Blu-ray in the UK, with the only known available original Barry score. There are tapes from M&E; which contain the score plus sound effects. There is no known source for the original, complete score. In March 1980 Marble Arch auctioned off props for the film among others. Release In October 1978 it was announced the film would be released by a new distribution company, AFD. The film premiered in 1980. Twelve minutes were cut after the premiere. Reception Raise the Titanic received mixed reviews and has a 43% on Rotten Tomatoes. Cussler was so disgusted with the film that he refused to give any permission for further film adaptations of his books (in 2006, Cussler sued the filmmakers of Sahara, a film adaption of his 1992 book, for failing to consult him on the script when it also made huge financial losses). The film grossed $7 million against a budget of $40 million. Lew Grade later wrote that he \\"thought the movie was quite good\\", particularly the actual raising of the Titanic and the scene where Dirk Pitt walks into the wrecked ballroom. He blamed the failure of the film in part on the release of a TV movie on the topic, S.O.S. Titanic (released theatrically through EMI Films, of which Grade's brother, Lord Delfont, was then chairman). Raise the Titanic, along with other contemporary flops, has been credited with prompting Grade's withdrawal from continued involvement with the film industry. =Nominations= *1st Golden Raspberry Award :Nominated: Worst Picture :Nominated: Worst Supporting Actor (David Selby) :Nominated: Worst Screenplay References External links  Category:1980 films Category:1980s action adventure films Category:1980 independent films Category:British films Category:British action adventure films Category:American films Category:American action adventure films Category:English-language films Category:Dirk Pitt films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on works by Clive Cussler Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Alaska Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in England Category:Films shot in Greece Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Malta Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.

Monge was the last inmate to be executed before an unofficial moratorium on executions began in the United States in 1972. Murders Monge, a Denver, Colorado, insurance salesman, was a native of Puerto Rico who grew up in New York. He was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering his wife, Leonarda, and three of the couple's ten children after his wife had discovered his incestuous relationship with one of their daughters. Monge's murder victims were: Leonarda, Alan (aged 6), Vincent (aged 4), and Teresa (11 months old). Immediately after the four murders, Monge called police and admitted his guilt. The alleged motive for the murders was \\"to prevent exposure of sex crimes committed by defendant with his own children\\". He beat his wife to death with a steel bar, stabbed Teresa, choked Vincent, and bludgeoned Alan with the steel bar. He had no prior felony convictions; in 1961, however, he abandoned his family for two months and served a short jail sentence in Louisiana for vagrancy. Execution After Monge had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, psychiatrists evaluated him and found him to be sane. He then insisted on pleading guilty to first-degree murder. A jury that was convened for the penalty phase of the trial recommended a death sentence, and Monge's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. In January 1966, Governor John Arthur Love suspended all executions in Colorado, pending a referendum on capital punishment by voters. On November 8, 1966, the voters decided to retain the death penalty by a three-to-one margin. In March 1967, Monge attracted national attention when he asked a Denver court to allow him to be hanged at high noon on the front steps of the Denver City and County Building. This request was denied. The following month, Monge fired his attorneys and directed that no attempts should be made to save his life. He gave up all of his appeals and asked to be executed. Nonetheless, his surviving children appealed for clemency. Doctors again evaluated Monge's mental status and found him mentally competent for execution. A week before his death, Monge shared a final meal with his surviving seven children. On the eve of the execution, some seventy members of the Colorado Council to Abolish Capital Punishment gathered on the steps of the state capitol building in Denver in a rally to protest the execution. On June 2, 1967, Monge was executed at the age of 48 in the state's gas chamber. Upon his death, and according to his wishes, one of Monge's corneas was transplanted to a teenaged reformatory inmate. Monge was buried in Greenwood Pioneer Cemetery in Cañon City, Colorado in the pauper's section set aside for deceased inmates of the state penitentiary. His grave lies a few feet from that of John Bizup, Jr., a convicted murderer executed in 1964. The metal marker indicating Monge's grave has been marred with bullet holes. The Colorado gas chamber, retired after Monge's execution, is now an exhibit at the Museum of Colorado Prisons in Cañon City.  Moratorium  Opponents of capital punishment, in an attempt to abolish the death penalty, waged a national litigation campaign that ultimately found its way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court agreed to review a series of cases challenging that the death penalty was unconstitutional. While the Supreme Court reviewed these cases, lower courts in all states stayed all pending executions, thereby creating a de facto moratorium on death sentences throughout the nation. The period of this \\"unofficial\\" moratorium on capital punishment began on June 2, 1967, with the execution of Luis Monge in Colorado. It would end nearly ten years later on January 17, 1977, with the execution of Gary Gilmore in Utah.  Execution in context  Luis Jose Monge's was the last execution both in Colorado and in the United States prior to the 1972 Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia. It would be almost ten years before any state would carry out another execution, the state of Utah executed Gary Gilmore on January 17, 1977. The state of Colorado itself took 30 years before it would do so in the execution of Gary Lee Davis, on October 13, 1997. Monge's was one of only two executions to occur in the United States in 1967. His was also the last execution by gas chamber in Colorado.  See also  * Capital punishment in Colorado * Capital punishment in the United States * Furman v. Georgia * Gas chamber * Gregg v.

Rudolph was born in Elkton, Maryland of parents of German descent, and received no formal education. In April 1778, at around the age of twenty, he enlisted in Lee's Legion, where he served for the duration of the American Revolutionary War. He was commissioned a lieutenant in July 1779, and in September 1779 was brevetted a captain for his actions in the Battle of Paulus Hook. He was discharged at the conclusion of the war and returned to civilian life. He returned to the Army in June 1790, as a captain in the 1st U.S. Infantry. He was promoted to major commanding the Squadron of Light Dragoons in March 1792. In February 1793, he was made acting Adjutant General and acting Inspector General of the U.S. Army. Shortly afterward, he was given command of Fort Hamilton, Ohio. There, he refused to postpone the execution of several soldiers for desertion even though he knew an appeal of their case was pending. Moments after the execution was carried out, a messenger arrived with orders reprieving some of the executed men. The execution infuriated Rudolph's commander, General Anthony Wayne, who ordered Rudolph's resignation in July 1793. Accounts say he returned home to find his wife had been unfaithful, and went to sea to seek his fortune, where he was captured and killed by pirates. A legend which circulated in the mid-19th century had Rudolph making his way to France where he became the military commander Michel Ney.

But the Akshaya Patra, the vessel that could provide unlimited food, had one limitation that it could be used only once a day, and it had been done so.

Due to the programming of certain in-game events, players can encounter MissingNo. via a glitch. Encountering MissingNo. causes graphical anomalies and changes gameplay by increasing the number of items in the sixth entry of the player's inventory by 128. This beneficial effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines, while game publisher Nintendo warned that encountering the glitch may corrupt players' game data. IGN noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue was one of the most famous video game glitches and commented on its role in increasing the series' popularity. Fans have attempted to rationalize and incorporate MissingNo. as part of the games' canon as an actual in-game character, and sociologists have studied its impact on both players and gaming culture as a whole. History Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996 with the release of the Pokémon Red and Blue video games for the Game Boy. In these games, the player assumes the role of a Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon. Players use the creatures' special abilities to combat other Pokémon, and certain abilities also grant new ways to navigate the game's world, such as instantaneous travel between two areas. The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the Pokémon index (Pokédex), a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain creatures from all 151 Pokémon species. MissingNo. is not one of the official Pokémon species that players are meant to encounter, but it is accessible to players of European and North American copies of the games by a glitch. Nintendo of America first documented the events that cause MissingNo. to appear in the May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power. The company warned that \\"any contact with it (even if you don't catch it) could easily erase your game file or disrupt your graphics\\". Game developers did not remove several glitches from the 2016 re-releases of Pokémon Red and Blue on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and players can encounter MissingNo. in these versions of the games. Characteristics The player, using a Pokémon to surf on the eastern shore of Cinnabar Island, a key component for activating the glitch A player can encounter a MissingNo. in Pokémon Red and Blue by following a series of steps. First, the player watches an in-game tutorial for Pokémon capture in Viridian City. Second, the player uses a Pokémon with the \\"Fly\\" move to instantly travel to the game's Cinnabar Island location. Finally, the player uses a Pokémon with the \\"Surf\\" move to travel up and down the eastern shore of the island until a MissingNo. appears. These events manipulate the game's random encounter system to generate a Pokémon with an invalid identifier. Each area within the game assigns values to a data buffer to represent the Pokémon that can be encountered in that area. However, some areas—such as Cinnabar Island—do not overwrite the data in this buffer, so the data from the previous area is used instead. During an in- game tutorial in which the player character's name is overridden to read \\"Old Man\\", the player character's actual name is temporarily copied to that same data buffer. If the player travels directly to Cinnabar Island after viewing this tutorial, the player's name will be read as the Pokémon that can be randomly encountered in that area. Due to the player's name not being intended to be read as this kind of data, the game can attempt to generate an encounter with a Pokémon with an invalid identifier, such as MissingNo. Fans have dubbed this method of encountering MissingNo. the \\"old man glitch\\". As with any wild Pokémon, players may flee from, fight, or capture MissingNo. After an encounter with MissingNo., the quantity of the sixth item in the player's inventory is increased by 128, and the game's Hall of Fame Pokémon gallery becomes glitched. Temporary graphical glitches may also occur, which can be removed by viewing the statistics page for another non-glitched Pokémon or resetting the console. A captured MissingNo. is functional as a Pokémon and appears in the games' Pokédex as number 000. The games classify it as a hybrid Bird/Normal-type Pokémon even though the category of Bird-type Pokémon was cut from the games before release. It commonly appears with a scrambled block-like form commonly described as a \\"backward L-shape\\", but depending on the player's name, it can also appear as one of three ghost or fossil sprites not used by other Pokémon. Reaction and reception Calling MissingNo. a \\"programming quirk\\", Nintendo warned against encountering it, saying players could possibly have to restart the game from the beginning to remove the graphical glitches. Despite Nintendo's warning, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in several magazines and player's guides due to its perceived positive effect. Certain players attempted to sell tips on capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. Despite it not being an intentional part of the game, in 2009, IGN included MissingNo. in its list of the top video game Easter eggs, citing its usefulness in replicating the game's rarer items. IGN stated in a related article, \\"It really says something about Pokémon fans that they took what is a potentially game-ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon\\", and later called it an \\"unforgettable\\" glitch that helped push the original games to \\"gaming super stardom\\". The book 100 Greatest Video Game Characters describes MissingNo. as an example of a player-produced character and counterplay, adding, \\"as a cultural artifact, MissingNo[.] celebrates the creativity of deviant and subversive forms of play\\". Players' reactions to MissingNo. have been the subject of several studies. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge stated that Game Freak created \\"one of the most popular glitches ever in game history\\" and cited its creative usage by players. His daughter and fellow sociologist Wilma Bainbridge attributed it to the widespread interest in glitch hunting and speedrunning in video games. University of Portsmouth professor Lincoln Geraghty examined fan theories on the glitch, describing it as \\"an established work of fanon [fan canon]\\". He further elaborated in an Ars Technica article \\"fans’ desire to incorporate MissingNo[.] into the Pokémon world stems partly from a hope that the glitch may have been deliberate\\", as well as to compensate for the glitch's lack of backstory within Pokémon canon. In the book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, professor of education Julian Sefton-Green noticed that in his study of his son's reaction to MissingNo.'s usage as a cheat, the child's outlook towards the game was altered drastically, and added that the presence of such elements as a result broke the illusion of the game as an enclosed world and reminded him that \\"at heart, it is a computer program\\". The book Playing with Videogames contains an in-depth study of MissingNo., which details players' curiosity when encountering the Pokémon. It describes their tendency to compare notes on its appearance, and to give assessment and critique to each other's findings. The book states that, in their attempts to interpret MissingNo. as part of the series' narrative through fan art and fiction, Pokémon communities celebrated the game's imperfections and tried to imprint themselves on its canon. The author described these circumstances as unique to MissingNo. and called its popularity an unusual case.

The 18th District includes the cities of Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, and Waupun. Early life, education and career Born in Taylorville, Illinois, Hopper graduated from The Hill School. He then received his bachelor's degree from Denison University in 1989 and an MBA from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in 2002. Hopper is the co-owner of Mountain Dog Media, a radio station and broadcasting company that owns two Fond du Lac radio stations, KFIZ (1450) and WFON (107.1). In addition, Mountain Dog owns WCLB (950) in Sheboygan, which runs mainly automated programming from Fox Sports Radio. WCLB is run from MDM's Fond du Lac offices, and no staff is maintained in Sheboygan. He also operated New Holstein's WMBE (1530) in the same arrangement as WCLB, but with advertising meant for a Fox Cities audience. The station was sold to another party in late 2011, who terminated MDM's operating agreement and took the station silent to move it closer to Appleton as WLWB. Wisconsin Senate Hopper showed strong support for Governor Walker's 2011 budget, which removed certain collective bargaining provisions for state and local government employees and made significant cuts to state budget and many programs. According to Hopper, the business climate would improve as a result of these Republican policies.http://www.fox6now.com/news/witi-20110803-hopper- king,0,1649742.storyhttp://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/column/john_nichols/article_74ba6c45-f55b-5b7d-96d3-e33d17f654da.html?mode=story Hopper sat on the following committees 2011-2012: * Economic Development, Veterans and Military Affairs (Chair) * Energy, Biotechnology, Consumer Protection * Finance * Joint Committee on Finance * Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions (Co-Chair) =Patronage alleged= Court records indicate Hopper filed a petition for divorce in August 2010. In a letter to Milwaukee television station WTMJ, Hopper's estranged wife Alysia wrote: \\"It is correct that my husband, Randy Hopper, started an affair in January 2010 with a then-25-year-old Republican aide. This affair has caused great emotional pain for my children and me. Randy moved out, without attempting marital counseling, as of May 2010 and now lives mostly in Madison.\\" Hopper's alleged mistress, Valerie Cass, was reportedly hired on February 7, 2011, by the State of Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing as a limited-term communications specialist. Her salary was $5.35 per hour higher ($11,000 on an annualized basis) than that of her predecessor, explained by increased duties, professional experience, and relevant credentials. The limited-term position ended in August 2011. Hopper denied he had had any role in the hiring. 2011 recall Hopper was subject to an active recall effort. On March 2, 2011, the \\"Committee to Recall Hopper\\" officially registered with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. 15,269 valid signatures of electors residing within the 18th district had to be collected by May 2, 2011 to generate a recall election. His estranged wife reportedly signed his recall petition. A March 9, 2011, poll by Survey USA showed that voters in Hopper's district would vote for recall by 11 points. A March 10–13, 2011, poll by PPP (sponsored by Daily Kos) showed that voters in Hopper's district disapprove of his job performance 47-38 and support recall by 11 points. When asked if they would vote for Hopper or a generic Democratic candidate, Hopper trailed by 5% with 44% saying they would vote for Hopper again and 49% saying they would vote for the Democratic candidate. He was seen as particularly vulnerable to recall, considering that his victory in the 2008 election came only after a mandatory recount; the margin of victory was 163 votes. On March 29, 2011, it was reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the recall organizers appeared to have enough signatures to force a recall election. On April 7, 2011, organizers filed 23,946 signatures to recall Senator Hopper with the Government Accountability Board in Madison. On April 13, 2011, Oshkosh Deputy Mayor Jessica King, who lost to Hopper by 163 votes in 2008, announced she would run against Hopper in a potential recall election. In late May 2011, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board verified petitions against Hopper, and scheduled the recall election for July 12, 2011.

Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a protected area on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is one of two units, along with the Kona Forest National Wildlife Refuge that is managed as part of the Big Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Access to the Kona Forest is restricted since it contains several endangered species. Description Hakalau Forest NWR contains some of the finest remaining stands of native montane wet forest in Hawaii. The slopes below feet receive very high rainfall - annually. Bogs, fern patches, and scrubby forest dominate this area, which is dissected by numerous deep gulches. Rainfall decreases to about at elevations above , where majestic koa (Acacia koa) and red-blossomed ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees form a closed-canopy forest. Further upslope, above , rainfall decreases to or less and native forest merges into abandoned pastureland where alien grasses and weeds, introduced as forage for cattle, are the dominant vegetation. Since 1989, over 400,000 koa, ōhia, and other native plants have been planted in this area as part of the refuge's reforestation program. The Pua Akala Cabin, located within the refuge, was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in August 2008. In 1985, on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea were established as the Hakalau Forest Unit. In 1997, the Fish and Wildlife Service purchased an additional of land to create the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest NWR. The Kona Forest Unit includes lands within the Hookena and Kalahiki land divisions on the western slopes of Mauna Loa, at elevations of . One of the primary purposes for the creation of this unit was to protect the habitat of the alalā (Corvus hawaiiensis), which is now extinct in the wild. The Kona Forest Unit is located about south of Kailua-Kona, coordinates . The Kona Forest district is somewhat drier than the Hakalau Unit. Wildlife and habitat Much of Hawaii's native lowland habitat was degraded following the Polynesians’ arrival over a thousand years ago. In the late 18th century, cattle, goats, and European pigs were released into the forests, and hundreds of additional alien plants, animals, and insects have subsequently been introduced. Most lowland plants seen today like the orchid, ginger, and plumeria are aliens or nonnative. Introduced animals such as mosquitoes, wasps, small Asian mongooses, cats, and rats have also harmed Hawaiian habitat and native species. Grazing pressure by cattle and pigs has resulted in the replacement of Hawaiian plants by more competitive alien grasses and shrubs within the upper portions of Hakalau Forest. Below this pasture area, the native tree canopy is still intact, but the native understory has been replaced by alien grasses, blackberry (Rubus spp.), banana poka (Passiflora tarminiana), and English holly (Ilex aquifolium). The replacement process may have been accelerated by efforts to create more pasture land through bulldozing and burning, and by logging mature trees for timber and fence posts. Eight of the 14 native bird species occurring at Hakalau are endangered. Thirteen migratory bird species and 20 introduced species, including eight game birds, as well as the endangered opeapea (Hawaiian hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus semotus) also frequent the refuge. Twenty-nine rare plant species are known from the refuge and adjacent lands. Twelve are currently listed as endangered. Two endangered lobelias have fewer than five plants known to exist in the wild. Recreation Only the Upper Maulua Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife is open to the public for wildlife-dependent activities such as hiking, bird watching and photography. All other units of the refuge are closed. Access to Upper Maulua is permitted on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays between sunrise and sunset. Every visitor to Upper Maulua is required to have a reservation. Reservations can be made by calling the Hakalau Forest NWR office at least one week prior to entry.

Description The bronze frog grows up to 2–4 in (5.4–10.2 cm). Distinguishing characteristics include a bronze to brownish body, a white belly with dark, irregular blotches, and a bright-green upper lip and nose. Males may have yellowish throats. Bronze frogs are smooth-skinned, like all true frogs. They have long hind legs with webbed toes. Two dorsolateral folds begin behind the eye and runs two-thirds the length of body. The tympanum (ear disc) is larger in males. Behavior Bronze frogs are nocturnal and solitary. They remain under cover, in logs and crevices, most of the time. Male bronze frogs court females with a distinct call. Researchers agree that the mating call of the bronze frog sounds like someone plucking a loose banjo string. Named for its body color, the bronze frog may be difficult to find until warm, humid evenings, when its mating call is heard. Colloquially referred to as the \\"banjo frog\\", the primary breeding call is an explosive \\"clunk,\\" or \\"cloink\\" frequently repeated several times in succession, but less powerfully each time. Like many species of frogs, the males voice an aggressive call when concentrations of these frogs are high in breeding areas. This call is a quick, harsh, spitting sound that sometimes precedes an attack on a competitor. Distribution Bronze frogs are found in the southeastern portion of the United States, from North Carolina to the eastern third of Texas. Habitat Bronze frogs are found in shallow streams, ponds, marshes, springs, bayous, and bald cypress swamps with plenty of vegetation. They are active both day and night. Diet Bronze frogs eat a variety of vertebrates and arthropods. They eat flies, crickets, fish, small snakes, crayfish, tadpoles, and other frogs. Breeding It reaches sexual maturity in the first full summer after metamorphosis. Breeding season begins in early spring and lasts through the summer. Females lay 2,000–4,000 eggs in small masses attached to underwater vegetation. Eggs are 1.5 mm when laid, but grow to 6 mm as cells divide. Incubation is one to two weeks. Tadpoles are green with small, dark spots. They grow 1.0–1.5 inches (28 – 33 mm) before they metamorphose (change from tadpoles to frogs). Bronze frogs live seven to 10 years.

In 1987 he approached the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) about creating an SBS orchestra of young people. In 1988 the management agreed, but it was up to Krel to make it work. Virtually no funds would be available to the non-profit orchestra, and neither state nor federal governments would support them financially.2MBSFM However SBS did provide the new organisation with free rehearsal space, storage space for instruments and use of a photocopier. The orchestra gave its first public performance at the Sydney Town Hall in 1989.

Fowler in Ballston Spa, New York (Saratoga County). It was also known as New York State and National Law School, Ballston Law School, and Fowler's State and National Law School. In 1853 the school relocated to Poughkeepsie, New York (Dutchess County). The school closed in the 1860s. History Sans Souci Hotel, Ballston Spa, New York. Hand colored. Founded in 1849 by John W. Fowler, the school was one of the first in the country to provide practical training for law students, rather than just academic lectures on legal theories. The school began in the former Sans Souci Hotel in Ballston Spa, but only stayed in the facility for three years. The school was under supervision of a Board of Trustees appointed by the New York State Legislature. The National Law School used very advanced teaching methods for its time. \\"There, students were assembled into mock courtroom scenarios, playing all of the roles witnesses, bailiffs, jurors, and attorneys. The professors were the judges, and the teams of attorneys were given a set of facts to work with to build their case.\\" In 1849 the law school briefly hosted the Beta Proteron Charge of Theta Delta Chi fraternity.Theta Delta Chi International Fraternity, \\"Theta Delta Chi's history of growth. \\" The institution struggled financially and also encountered problems with its facilities in Ballston Spa. President Fowler made the decision to relocate the law school to Poughkeepsie in late 1852. In January 1853 the school opened for its first term in Poughkeepsie. The reasons given for the move as stated by the trustees: \\"The building in Ballston is old and the rooms are cold, while in Poughkeepsie our accommodations are comfortable and pleasant. The village to which we have removed is much larger and more pleasant than Ballston, containing six or eight flourishing Literary Institutions, of which four are Female Seminaries. The people of Poughkeepsie furnish, besides these Libraries, adequate funds to place the institution on a high and permanent basis.\\" =Degrees granted= The board was authorized to confer upon each graduate the degree of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws). =Closure= The law school closed in the early 1860s as the result of declining enrollment caused by potential students joining the military during the American Civil War.

In December 2012, Blackhawk School District administration reported that 257 pupils, or 10.3% of district pupils, received special education services. Of the identified pupils, 42.4% had a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 264 pupils, or 10% of district pupils, received special education services. Of the identified pupils, 41% had a specific learning disability. In December 2009, Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 271 pupils, or 10.5% of district pupils, received special education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted that the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. The school district has provided full-day kindergarten since 2011. The district has seen a slight increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These include review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website, regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per-pupil funding, as well as all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania special education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of these students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of their students receiving special education services, while others have 10%.Baruch Kintisch Education Law Center, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of these students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Blackhawk School District received a $1,496,931 supplement from the state for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–2012, 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they had received in 2010-11. This level of funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services, and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011–2012 Fiscal Year, 2011Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014–2015 school year, Blackhawk School District received an increase to $1,515,207 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion, or 30%, and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. = Gifted education = Blackhawk School District Administration reported that 67, or 2.46%, of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, Blackhawk School District must provide programs for mentally gifted students at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education for Gifted Students Notice of Parental rights, March 26, 2010  Budget  In September 2013, Blackhawk School Board approved by a 7-2 vote a new employment contract with the teachers' union. Four board members left the board in December 2013. In February 2014, the new Blackhawk School Board voted 6-2 to revoke the collective bargaining agreement questioning the legality of the agreement. The superintendent reported to the board that she would be forced to lay off teachers due to the high costs of the new contract. Pennsylvania state law allows districts to lay off professional staff in three circumstances: a reduction in enrollment, a program being curtailed or eliminated, or schools being consolidated or reorganized. The Blackhawk Teachers' Union filed an unfair labor complaint with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board. The Pennsylvania Labor Board examiner ruled that the contract was legal. In 2013, the average teacher salary in Blackhawk School District was $58,027 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $26,237 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $84,265. The district employed 195 teachers and administrators with a top salary of $119,000. Blackhawk School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x final average salary x total credited service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final three years of employment. In 2011, the average teacher salary in Blackhawk School District was $59,354 a year. The district employed 194 teachers and administrator with a top salary of $100,296. = State Basic Education Funding = According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Blackhawk School District receives 46.3% of its annual revenue from the state. For the 2015-16 school year, Governor Tom Wolf released partial Basic Education Funding of $4,347,656 to Blackhawk School District in January 2016. This was part of $10.3 billion in school funding withheld from the public schools by the governor since the summer of 2015. The disbursement did not follow the new Basic Education Fair Funding formula which had been established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in June 2015. Ten Pennsylvania school districts received no increase in Basic Education Funding under Governor Wolf's proposal. In compliance with a legislative mandate that was passed with veto proof majorities in the PA House and Senate, the final BEF funding was set for 2015-16. Blackhawk School District received $9,073,461 in Basic Education funds for the 2015-16 school year. This was a 1.53% increase, yielding a $136,579 increase over the previous school year's funding. The district also received $359,398 in \\"Ready to Learn\\" funding from the state.PDE, Ed Budget 2015–16, May 2016 The Pennsylvania education budget for 2015-16 was $5.93 billion for Basic Education, a $200 million or a 3.5 percent increase over the 2014-15 allocation. Another $1.08 billion was allotted for special education funding, a $30 million or 2.9 percent increase over 2014-15. Additionally, the state paid over $500 million towards school employee social security payments and over $1 billion to the teachers' pension fund (PSERS).Office of the Budget, Pennsylvania Total Operating Budget, March 2016 For the 2014-2015 school year, Blackhawk School District received $8,936,909 in state Basic Education Funding.

Among the public school districts in Beaver County, Midland Borough School District received the highest percentage increase in BEF at 10.2%. The district has the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion. Most of Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts received an increase of Basic Education Funding in a range of 0.9% to 4%. Eight public school districts received exceptionally high funding increases of 10% to 16%. The highest increase in state funding was awarded to Austin Area School District, which received a 22.5% increase in Basic Education Funding.Democrat Appropriations Committee, Report on Education funding by LEA, July 2, 2013 The highest percent of state spending per student is in the Chester-Upland district, where roughly 78 percent comes from state coffers.

Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Midland Borough School District, which got a 7.57% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County, which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell’s policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009–2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.16% increase in Basic Education Funding, for a total of $8,969,872, to Blackhawk School District.

The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $4,787,151.79. All Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several other funding allocations, including reimbursement of charter school expenditures, special education funding, secondary career and technical education subsidies, and PA Accountability Grants. Low-achieving schools were eligible for educational assistance program funding. All Pennsylvania school districts also receive federal dollars for various programs, including special education funding and Title I funding for children from low income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education – local, state and federal dollars combined.  Accountability Block Grants  Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These include teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size in K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, and before- or after-school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $367,720 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide intensive instruction for struggling students during the school day, to extend the school year, to provide after- school tutoring, and for high school reform.  Classrooms for the Future grant  The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funds to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, science, history, and math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers' use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Blackhawk School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07 or in 2007-08. The district received $113,840 in 2008-09. In Beaver County, the highest award was given to Freedom Area School District, which received $476,723.

Ready to Learn grant  Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the state funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Blackhawk School District received $180,532 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, special education funding, Accountability Block Grant funding, PreK Counts funding, transportation funding, and reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees, as well as other state grants which the district must apply to receive. = Other grants = Blackhawk School District did not participate in Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PreK Counts state preschool grants in years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015; PA Science It's Elementary grants (discontinued effective with the 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell);Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It’s Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 Education Assistance Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget); or federal 21st Century Learning grants. = Federal grants = Blackhawk School District received an extra $2,862,640 in ARRA – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010–2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.  Race to the Top grant  Blackhawk School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant, which would have provided hundreds of thousands in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010.  Title II grants  The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with \\"Highly Quality\\" teachers and principals, as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for Title II funds. In 2012-13, Blackhawk School District received $79,514 in federal Title II funding.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2012–13, 2012 In 2014-15, Blackhawk School District applied for and received $74,553.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2014–15, 2014  English language learners grant  The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school, a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at the pupils' homes. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.PDE, English As A Second Language (ESL), 2015 In 2012-13, Blackhawk School District received $1,358 in Title III funding for English language learners. For 2014-15, Blackhawk School District received $855 in Title III funding.PDE, Title III Grant Allocations 2014–15, 2014 = Common Cents state initiative = The Blackhawk School Board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Common Cents program – Making Every Dollar Count, 2007 After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. = Real estate taxes = Property tax rates in 2015-16 were set by the Blackhawk School Board at 59.1200 mills in Beaver County and 18.5000 mills in Lawrence County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth, as they create a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania apply only to real estate – land and buildings – and is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions, and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike in other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Landowners in Blackhawk School District are the target of a proposed major pipeline. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, thereby limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Blackhawk School District is adversely impacted this way by major transmission pipeline development.The Nature Conservancy – Pennsylvania Chapter, Natural Gas Pipelines Pennsylvania Energy Impacts Assessment, December 16, 2011The Nature Conservancy, Marcellus Shale Gas Development in Bradford County, December 16, 2011  Property tax relief  In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Backhawk School District was $173 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,977 property owners applied for tax relief. In 2010, the relief was $171. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 64% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Among Beaver County public school districts, the highest amount of property tax relief goes to property owners in Big Beaver Falls Area School District, who received $352 in 2010. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County, who received $632 per approved homestead.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead 2009 Report, May 1, 2010 Residents of Chester Upland School District have been the top recipients each year since the program began. The Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Blackhawk School District residents aged 65 and older, widows and widowers aged 50 and older, and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half of their Social Security income; consequently, an individual with income of much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.  Bullying and school safety  The school district was featured in the landmark court case Morrow v. Balaski, 719 F. 3d 160 (3d Cir. 2013), dealing with a school's responsibility to prevent bullying. In the case, the Morrows daughter was subject to bullying by another student in the form of threats, assaults, and acts of intimidation. Unable to obtain help from school officials, the Morrows were ultimately compelled to remove their children from school. According to the court opinion, \\"The Morrows subsequently met with school officials, but they responded by telling the Morrows that they could not guarantee Brittany and Emily's safety. Instead, rather than removing Anderson and her confederate from the school, school officials advised the Morrows to consider another school for their children. In October 2008, the Morrows enrolled their daughters in a different school.\\" The case stands for the precedent-setting proposition that even if a school is aware of bullying and does little to prevent it or protect the victim, it cannot be held legally liable. Blackhawk School District administration reported 23 incidents of bullying in 2012–2013. Additionally, there were two harassment incidents and no sexual harassment incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in no incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center, which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The district administration reported zero incidents of bullying in 2010. There were 40 cases of harassment and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in no incidents at the schools. Education standards relating to student safety and anti-harassment programs are described in 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.  Extracurriculars  Blackhawk School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy.Blackhawk School Board, Blackhawk School District policy manual Extracurriculars policy 122Blackhawk School Board, Blackhawk School District policy manual Interscholastic Athletics policy 123 The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. The Blackhawk High School Music Academy is a program open to students in grades 9 through 12 in Beaver County. The music program focuses on performance as well as music theory, technology and history. It provides voice and instrument instruction. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school, or home school, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to the PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti-child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 = Sports = Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

Towerkill is a phenomenon in which birds are killed by collisions with antenna towers. In poor visibility, birds may simply fly into the guy-wires. But night illuminations around the towers can also disrupt migration patterns, with disoriented birds colliding with the structure. Research indicates that blinking lights can reduce deaths without diminishing visibility by aircraft. Overview In the United States, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that between 4 and 50 million birds are killed each year by tower killCOMMUNICATION TOWERS: A DEADLY HAZARD TO BIRDS, American Bird Conservancy, June 2000Manville, A.M., II. 2005. Bird strikes and electrocutions at power lines, communication towers, and wind turbines: state of the art and state of the science – next steps toward mitigation. Bird Conservation Implementation in the Americas: Proceedings 3rd International Partners in Flight Conference 2002. The effect on overall bird populations by towerkill may be small, but the phenomenon is of considerable concern to ornithologists, because many endangered bird species are being killed, and because so many birds are killed in such a small area of land. In at least one instance, several thousand birds were killed at a single tower in one night. Additionally, the unnatural lights on communication towers disrupt bird migration patterns in ways that are still not fully understood. At least 231 species have been affected, with neotropical migrants making up a large proportion of all species killed. Mechanisms There are two mechanisms of bird death due to communications towers. The first is the \\"blind kill\\" where birds flying in poor visibility do not see the guy-wires in time to avoid them. This is more of a threat for faster flying birds such as waterfowl or shorebirds. Slower and more agile birds, such as songbirds, are not as likely to succumb to blind collision. Communications towers that are lighted at night for aviation safety may help reduce bird collisions caused by poor visibility, but they bring about a second, even more deadly mechanism for mortality. When there is a low cloud ceiling, hazy or foggy conditions, lights on a tower reflect off water or other particles in the air creating an illuminated area around the tower. Migrating birds lose their stellar cues for nocturnal migration in such conditions. In addition, they often lose any broad orienting perspective they might have had on the landscape. When passing the lighted area, it may be that the increased visibility around the tower becomes the strongest cue the birds have for navigation, and thus they tend to remain in the lighted space near the tower, afraid to leave. Mortality occurs when they run into the structure and its guy wires, or even other migrating birds as more and more passing birds aggregate in the relatively small, lighted space. It is important to clarify that the lights are not documented to attract birds from afar, but appear to hold birds that fly into the illuminated vicinity. Lights are required by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on any tower taller than , or on shorter towers if they are near airports. In 2008, it was estimated there were roughly 125,000 lit towers in the US and more than 7,000 new towers are constructed each year. Researchers at the University of Southern California reported in 2012 that red lights are worse than white lights, and switching to blinking lights can cut fatalities by half without reducing visibility by aircraft. In a 25-year study of bird mortality at the tower at Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee, Florida, US, kills occurred nearly every night from mid-August through mid-November. Moderate numbers of migrants were killed under perfectly clear skies, but the toll increased markedly with overcast conditions. Researchers believe the attraction to lighted regions results in most towerkill, and numerous studies have been conducted to further understand the phenomena. In May 2012, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a report which concluded that as long as the brighter flashing lights remained active, extinguishing the steady burning red lights on communication towers at night would still provide enough conspicuity for pilots, and result in significantly fewer avian fatalities. This change would also save tower operators maintenance and energy costs. Since the report was published, the FAA and FCC have approved the change in lighting systems, and it is now an option for tower operators to change the lights on their existing towers, or to build new towers with the new lighting system. Wind turbines Wind turbines represent a much smaller threat to birds, due to being much lower in number and lacking guy wires. The American Bird Conservancy estimates wind turbines kill 10,000 to 40,000 birds a year, which is a smaller percentage compared to communication towers, which kill 40 to 60 million a year, as estimated by the American Wind Energy Association. Overall, wind turbines cause about one-tenth of a percent of all unnatural bird deaths in the United States each year.

It originated as a tropical depression on September 11, 1971, in the tropical Atlantic. The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude, passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America. In the southwest Caribbean Sea, it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane. Irene made landfall on southeastern Nicaragua on September 19, and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low-lying terrain of the country. Restrengthening after reaching the Pacific, Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia, which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Olivia weakened significantly before moving ashore on the Baja California Peninsula on September 30; the next day it dissipated. In the Atlantic, Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96 homes were destroyed, and 1,200 people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing three people in Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1 million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Meteorological history The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September 7\\\\. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 miles (1300 km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, one of the most active single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16\\\\. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andrés. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior. Surface weather map of Irene on September 17 Tropical Storm Irene gradually intensified as it continued across the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Late on September 18, the storm attained hurricane status a short distance off the coast of Central America, with 80 mph (130 km/h) winds, its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean. As it strengthened, it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across Panama into the Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast, although its pressure dropped to 989 mbar. On September 19, the hurricane made landfall in the Nicaraguan South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region; it was the first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike Nicaragua south of Bluefields. Irene quickly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18 hours of moving ashore. The circulation remained organized over the low-lying terrain of southern Nicaragua, possibly due to it crossing Lake Nicaragua. After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September 20, the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status; upon doing so, it was re-designated by a new name, Olivia. It was the first time an Atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean; subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished the feat, although they were not known at the time. As an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone, Olivia maintained well-defined outflow and inflow. It gradually intensified as it paralleled the southern Central America coastline. Late on September 21, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and an eye 23 miles (37 km) in diameter; based on the readings, Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status. For several days, Olivia moved west to west-northwestward off the coast of Mexico, although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown, due to lack of significant observations. On September 25, the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery, and based on a report from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), about 245 miles (395 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar, which was the lowest reported pressure during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. The intensity of Hurricane Olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land, due to a blocking ridge over northwestern Mexico. Early on September 26 it weakened to winds of about 105 mph (165 km/h), before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity. Subsequently, dry air became entrained in the circulation, and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters. The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated. Late on September 28 it weakened to tropical storm status, after beginning a turn to the northwest and later to the north. About 24 hours later, Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September 30; the next day, Olivia dissipated near the border of Baja California and Baja California Sur. Impact and records Hurricane Irene near its Central America landfall As a tropical depression, the cyclone produced a wind gust of 43 mph (69 km/h) in Barbados. The system also dropped 3.35 inches (85.1 mm) of rainfall in Trinidad. Prior to its arrival, officials noted the potential for the depression to bring flash flooding to northern Venezuela, as well as heavy rainfall to the ABC islands. Later as a tropical storm, Irene brushed San Andrés island in the western Caribbean with gale- force winds; no major damage was reported there. Prior to the hurricane's landfall in Nicaragua, the country's army evacuated about 500 people from a settlement near Bluefields, and along the coastline, boats were advised to remain at port. When it moved ashore, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) in Bluefields. The winds destroyed 27 houses in the region. Observations were not available in the sparsely populated region near where Irene moved ashore, although winds were believed to have reached hurricane force there. Reconnaissance planes reported heavy structural and tree damage in southeastern Nicaragua. Satellite imagery suggested that heavy rainfall occurred from Panama through Honduras, and one location in Nicaragua reported more than 6.3 inches (160 mm) of precipitation. The rainfall caused flooding in many communities, killing three people in Rivas. At least five rivers reported flooding; along one of the rivers, 35 houses were inundated, and along another, the floodwaters swept away all of the crops and personal belongings of three villages. Across the country, the hurricane destroyed 96 homes, and 1,200 people were left homeless. In Costa Rica, Irene's passage resulted in more than $1 million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Late in its duration, Hurricane Olivia brought increased moisture into the southwest United States. More than 2 inches (50 mm) of rainfall were reported across Arizona and New Mexico. Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region. Near Yuma, Arizona, thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding that resulted in the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95. In Navajo and Pinal counties, the rainfall damaged roads, bridges, sewers, and homes, which amounted to about $250,000 in repair work for the state of Arizona. The storm's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Irene–Olivia is unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only nine other named storms are known to have done so. Irene was the first of three Atlantic-to-Pacific crossover tropical cyclones in the 1970s, all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O.

The layers of the structure stack in multiple ways, to produce a 3-layer rhombohedral structure (3R Polytype), or a 2-layer hexagonal structure (2H polytype) formerly known as manasseite. The two polytypes are often intergrown. The carbonate anions that lie between the structural layers are weakly bound, so hydrotalcite has anion exchange capabilities. It was first described in 1842 for an occurrence in a serpentine - magnesite deposit in Snarum, Modum, Buskerud, Norway. It occurs as an alteration mineral in serpentinite in association with serpentine, dolomite and hematite.  Applications  = Nuclear fuel reprocessing = Hydrotalcite has been studied as potential getter for iodide in order to scavenge the long-lived 129I (T1/2 = 15.7 million years) and also other fission products such as 79Se (T1/2 = 295 000 years) and 99Tc, (T1/2 = 211 000 years) present in spent nuclear fuel to be disposed under oxidising conditions in volcanic tuff at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Carbonate easily replaces iodide in its interlayer. Another difficulty arising in the quest of an iodide getter for radioactive waste is the long-term stability of the sequestrant that must survive over geological time scales. = Anion exchange = Layered double hydroxides are well known for their anion exchange properties. = Medical = Hydrotalcite is also used as an antacid. = Wastewater treatment = Treating mining and other wastewater by creating hydrotalcites often produces substantially less sludge than lime. In one test, final sludge reductions reached up to 90 percent. This alters the concentration of magnesium and aluminum and raises the pH of the water. As the crystals form, they trap other waste substances including radium, rare earths, anions and transition metals. The resulting mixture can be removed via settling, centrifuge, or other mechanical means.

It is a 1951 diner that has been in two other area locations during its history. Its design reflects the era when diners were modeled closely after railroad dining cars, with chrome exteriors and curved walls. In 1988 it became the first diner in New York, and the fourth in the nation, to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places.New York State historical marker at roadside near diner, see picture. Frommer's called it \\"one of the best ... midcentury American diners\\". Building The diner is in the center of a lot in downtown Red Hook. To the south is a Queen Anne Style house, to the north a small store and, across Cherry Street, the Elmendorph Inn. Across North Broadway are many 19th century residences. The front and rear of the lot are used as parking. The restaurant building itself is on a cement block foundation. Its exterior is stainless steel, curved at the corners fluted and painted with horizontal bands on a steel frame structural system. Windows are rectangular and retractable, high up the wall. A screen door on the south side is centrally located. All these features mimic those of a rail dining car. Atop the roof is a red neon sign reading \\"DINER\\". The main entrance is off-center, towards the south, as a result of a later expansion. A rear wing, added later, is sided in vinyl. alt=A long, narrow room with a counter and stools on the right at which two men are sitting and standing in the middle with a woman behind the counter a little further on. On the right are tables in booths. Above is a gently vaulted blue-green ceiling The interior further emulates its rail model, with tables in booths along the east and west walls with a single aisle between them. The ceiling is also vaulted. The rear is mostly given over to counter and cooking space; it has no windows as a result, a deviation from the model. A later rear addition expands the kitchen facilities to the east. Much of the interior trim is original, such as tiled floor and wainscoting in turquoise and black, cream enameled walls, a laminated counter with 16 stools and a back wall with ribbed metal covering for all the kitchen functions. These treatments are more utilitarian, more typical of a lunch counter than a lushly-furnished rail diner of the era. The rear wing has some open dining space with freestanding tables and chairs, plus restrooms with their original doors. The diner retains its original builder's plate upon which Paterson Vehicle stamped a serial number 5113 indicating that it was the thirteenth unit built in 1951. This was a typical practice employed by Paterson and is seen on many of its remaining Silk City structures still in existence. History From their origins as horse-drawn hot lunch carts, diners had evolved during the early 20th century into stationary, yet movable, fixtures of the developed urban landscape of the urban Northeast. The increasing use of the automobile during the 1920s for intercity travel brought them into the countryside. Manufacturers offered prefabricated models with lessons in management, giving entrepreneurs the chance to get into the restaurant business with less capital than it usually took. Original alt=A shiny metallic circular clock with a face illuminated from within, marked in plain numerals in a sans-serif font, showing 9:32 In 1925, Lou Dubois of Kingston, across the Hudson River from Red Hook, bought a popular Silk City Diner from the Paterson Vehicle Company, one of the leading diner manufacturers. He chose to install it first in an area along recently designated Route 9, the Albany Post Road, just north of nearby Rhinebeck called Astor Flats. They called it the Halfway Diner because he thought it was about halfway along Route 9 between New York City and Albany.Per mileages given at , the actual halfway point along US 9 between the two cities is in Hyde Park, 10 miles (16 km) to the south of that location. Dubois's wife managed the diner while her husband continued to drive trucks for a beer distributor. Three years later he died, and his family sold the diner to Bert Coons. He moved it to its current location and continued to make a profit. When the Taconic State Parkway was completed through northern Dutchess County after World War II, he moved the diner east, to where Route 199 intersected with the new road, to take advantage of changed transportation patterns. It is not clear whether he changed the name at the same time. In 1957, with the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge having restored some of the lost through traffic to Red Hook, Coons moved the diner back to its present location. He rented it to others and then finally sold it in the 1960s, after adding onto it to make it more of a traditional restaurant. A new roadside sign announced its new name to travelers — the Village Restaurant. The current owners refer to it as the Historic Village Diner. It has become a local institution.

Cowdin.  Overview  Ellen is one of several examples of Anti- Tom literature, a literary subgenre that emerged in the Southern United States in response to the 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which had been criticised in the South as inaccurately depicting slaveholding and the attitudes of slaveowners in general. Like other anti-Tom novels such as The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, Ellen acts largely as a criticism of abolitionism rather than a defence of slavery, highlighting the corruption within abolitionist movements such as the Underground Railroad.  Plot  The story follows Ellen, the daughter of a Southern mother from Louisiana and a Northern father. Ellen's father quickly leaves his family shortly after the birth of his daughter, and it is discovered shortly afterward that he is an abolitionist. Ellen, now older and wishing to find her father, sets off into the Northern United States where she discovers numerous atrocities being committed by the Northerners that far outrank the South in terms of oppression and cruelty. All Northern women are portrayed as foul- tempered shrews who abuse their white servants worse than black slaves, and all men are portrayed as being scheming, greedy capitalists. It is during her travels that Ellen comes across Parson Blake, an evil abolitionist priest who encourages abolitionism more to steal Southern wealth rather than to aid runaway slaves. Blake attempts several sinister schemes to deter Ellen from returning home, but Ellen luckily escapes his clutches and returns home safely to Louisiana.  Publication history  Ellen was first published in novelised form by S.H. Goetzel & Co. of Mobile, Alabama in 1860. Reaction to the novel is unknown, although one surviving copy of the work – currently in the care of the University of Virginia – bears a stamp indicating that the novel was on sale in Boston. Ellen was among the last anti-Tom novels to be published, with the genre dying out by the end of 1860.

Michael Hogan. 2009 Most genus members are dioecious, producing unisexual male or female flowers on separate plants. Ascarina lucida, the only member of its genus to occur in New Zealand, is monoecious.Lucy B. Moore. 1977 It will grow to a height of 6m and can have a 30 cm trunk. The leaves which are in opposite pairs are simple, yellowish green in color, have a raised mid rib and are very similar to Laurelia novae-zelandiae. Their margins have prominent teeth which are dark colored at the tips. Ascarina lucida is now nearly extinct in the Taranaki region but was last reported in Oct 1969 at Mt Taranaki, near Pukeiti by Colin Ogle.T.E.R:R.A.I.N. 2008-2015 Tolerance The distribution of Ascarina lucida suggests an inability to survive severe frosts or droughts. Its environmental tolerance to climatic extremes was experimentally tested by exposing the seedlings to frost, drought, and waterlogged soil conditions. Ascarina lucida has a similar drought tolerance to Coprosma grandifolia, a species known to be drought intolerant; seedlings had considerable tolerance of waterlogged soils, but exhibited reduced root weights when severely waterlogged; and a frost of -2 °C resulted in complete mortality for seedlings sourced from lowland and sub montane populations. Abundance of Ascarina lucia in a place can partially own to a warm, wet climate. However, the early successional nature of this species also suggests that disturbance regime plays an important role in regulating its distribution and abundance.Timothy J.

It attempts to \\"reconstruct what the client is thinking and feeling and to relay this understanding back to the client\\". Reflective listening is a more specific strategy than the more general methods of active listening. It arose from Carl Rogers' school of client-centered therapy in counseling theory.Lane, Lara Lynn (2005). \\"Reflective listening\\". Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology Empathy is at the center of Rogers' approach.Grogan, Jessica. March 11, 2013. It's not enough to listen. In: 'Psychology Today'  Fisher's model  Dalmar Fisher, an associate professor at Boston College, developed a model for Reflective Listening that includes the following elements:Dalmar Fisher, Communication in Organizations (St. Paul, MN, West Publishing Company, 1993, pp. 430-436) * Focusing upon the conversation by reducing or eliminating any kind of distraction. * Genuinely embracing the speaker's perspective without necessarily agreeing with it. By engaging in a non-judgmental and empathetic approach, listeners encourage the others to speak freely. * Mirroring the mood of the speaker, reflecting the emotional state with words and nonverbal communication. This requires the listener to quiet his mind and focus fully upon the mood of the speaker. This mood will become apparent not just in the words used but in the tone of voice, posture and other nonverbal cues given by the speaker. The listener will look for congruence between words and mood. * Summarizing what the speaker said, using the speaker's own words rather than merely paraphrasing words and phrases, thereby mirroring the essential concept of the speaker. * Responding to the speaker's specific point, without digressing to other subjects. * Repeating the procedure for each subject, and switching the roles of speaker and listener, if necessary. * During the reflective listening approach, both client and therapist embrace the technique of thoughtful silence, rather than to engage in idle chatter.  Additional application  Reflective listening has been found to be effective in a therapeutic setting. Subjects receiving reflective listening from a counselor have reported better therapeutic relationship and more disclosure of feelings. Cognitive content is one of the two main options that a counselor has for reflecting the client's previous communication in the counseling session. This form deals with people, places, problems, situations, and things. Cognitive content can play a role in help with problem solving. Incorporating cognitive content in problem solving makes it easier for clients to identify and work through issues. If neither the counselor nor the client can identify a problem that the client has, there is no need to problem solve and there is no need for counseling. Similar to problem solving where one initially identifies the quandary, counseling calls for identification of the fundamental issue in order to successfully change the client's behaviors or thought patterns.

He became a successful pastoralist and businessman, and also served as a magistrate and politician. He was born on 18 November 1796 at St Neot, Cornwall, United Kingdom, and was the first of six brothers to emigrate as free settlers to New South Wales. From 1845 to 1851 Dangar was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Soon after arrival in the Jessie on 2 April 1821 he was appointed assistant government surveyor under John Oxley, and employed in the counties of Camden and Argyle. He remained in this position until 1827, surveying among other places, the township of Newcastle. Cornish place names, scattered through the Hunter Region, mark Henry Dangar's surveys and record his deep affection for his birthplace. Mount Dangar, Dangarfield, Dangar Falls, and Dangarsleigh commemorate his name. Henry Dangar (1796 - 1861). He received two grants of land for his services as a surveyor - named 'Neotsfield' and near Morpeth, known as 'Baroona'. He returned to England in 1828 leaving his estates in the hands of his brother William, and when he returned to Australia his new wife Grace Sibly accompanied him.Dangar, Elisabeth Mary, William Dangar of Turanville, Scone & Upper Hunter HIstorical Society 1968 After his return he was granted land at Kingdon Ponds, and in the Port Stephens area he completed survey work for the Australian Agricultural Company until 1833. In 1848 Henry Dangar together with his brothers Richard and William began a meat canning factory at Honeysuckle Point, Newcastle. The Newcastle Meat Preserving Company had been established after a severe drought caused a decline in cattle and sheep prices. Although the business won awards at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, and exported their product to India and California, the company had ceased to operate by 1855.Turner, J.W., Manufacturing in Newcastle, 1801 - 1900. Newcastle History Monographs No 8., Newcastle Public Library 1980 Government surveyor and explorer In 1822 Dangar was transferred to Newcastle to survey the Hunter Valley in preparation for free settlement. He prepared the plans of King's Town (Newcastle) and in the next two years measured and marked out village reserves, church lands and allocations for settlers along the lower branches of the Hunter River and as far north as Patrick's Plains.Nancy Gray, Dangar, Henry (1796 - 1861), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, 1966 From 1824 he surveyed the road from Newcastle to Wallis Plains (Maitland), measuring reserves and grants and working steadily northwards until he reached the hitherto unsettled upper districts of the Hunter River, where he explored the present sites of Muswellbrook, Aberdeen and Scone. After crossing the Hunter River just to the north-west of the present site of Aberdeen, he discovered Dart Brook and Kingdon Ponds, two tributaries that flow from the north. In October 1824 he set out on an expedition during which he discovered the confluence of the Goulburn and Hunter rivers, and then, following Dart Brook to its source, crossed the Liverpool Range to the plains beyond. He turned back when attacked by the Geaweagal clan of the Wanaruah people west of where the town of Murrurundi now stands. His report on the quality of land on the plains caused an immediate rush of applicants for land grants. On this journey he sighted a domed feature that he named Mt Cupola. It was renamed Mount Dangar by explorer Allan Cunningham, who became the first European to climb it the following year. =Dismissal after investigation into land appropriation= In May 1825 he was commissioned to select land for a number of settlers in the area. He subsequently allocated to himself and his brother William some land to which another believed he had prior claim. A board of enquiry found Dangar guilty of using his public position for private gain and he was dismissed from office on 31 March 1827. Governor Sir Ralph Darling recommended that he be dispossessed of the land under dispute and required to take his grant in some other district. He returned to England to appeal against this recommendation. John Oxley supported him in his appeal, but it was unsuccessful. Surveyor for the Australian Agricultural Company During the voyage to England Dangar wrote his Index and Directory to Map of the Country Bordering Upon the River Hunter, which was published in London in 1828. It demonstrated his skill as a cartographer and ability as a surveyor, and brought him to the immediate attention of the directors of the Australian Agricultural Company. He was offered, and accepted, an appointment as a surveyor to the company.J. F. Campbell, The First Decade of the Australian Agricultural Company, 1824 to 1834, Journal and Proceedings (Royal Australian Historical Society), vol 9, part 3, 1923 Accompanied by his wife Grace, whom he married at St Neot on 13 May 1828, and by their infant son, he returned in April 1830 to take up his new position at Port Stephens. Dangar produced topographical and soil reports on the company's grants, and surveyed its reserve north of the Manning River. His reports of this area were so unfavourable that he was sent to explore, as an alternative location, the Liverpool Plains districts originally recommended to the company by John Oxley. From the headwaters of the Manning River, he crossed the Great Dividing Range to the Liverpool Plains, and selected an extensive area of attractive land for the company's consideration. After some negotiation the company's claim to the land was accepted by the government, and in June 1833 he retired to his property, Neotsfield, near Singleton. Pastoralist and businessman Neotsfield had for some time been managed by Henry Dangar's brother William. It was a flourishing and highly developed farm. Dangar quickly extended his interests, purchasing additional grazing properties and leasing extensive runs which by 1850 amounted to more than . These included: * Gostwyck (near Uralla) * Paradise Creek * Bald Hills * Moonbi * Buleori * Karee * Myall Creek Along the Great North Road to Liverpool Plains he acquired town allotments and established inns and stores. At Newcastle he had boiling-down works and meat- preserving and tinning works, and in New Zealand he established a steam flour- mill near the wheat farms around Official Bay (Auckland). Myall Creek Massacre The Myall Creek Massacre took place in 1838 on property owned by Dangar. Dangar advised two of the witnesses, George Anderson and William Hobbs, not to report the crime. Anderson was a convict assigned to Dangar, while Hobbs was a free man in Dangar's employ. Dangar spoke at the trial of how he had given Anderson 100 lashes. When Hobbs ignored Dangar's advice and alerted the local magistrate, Dangar terminated his service, but testified at the trial that the termination was not connected with Hobbs's actions.. =Efforts to pervert the course of justice= During the trial of the accused men, Dangar exercised his power and influence in order to sway the outcome.Australia on Trial, ABC TV, Episode 3, presented by Michael Cathcart, 2011https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBrFPMrlZms Dangar and his fellow squatters had established a secret society, the \\"Black Association\\", in their fight against the Aborigines over land. In addition to Dangar, the group included wealthy landowner, businessman and part owner of The Sydney Herald, Robert Scott. As the court case began, the group acted as a defence fund. In addition to funding the defence, The Black Association orchestrated and funded a smear campaign, particularly via The Sydney Herald, aimed at influencing public opinion on the case. At the first hearing, the group arranged for the erroneous arrest of a key witness, Hobbs, for debt. They also paid jurors not to testify, resulting on an empty jury box on one morning of the hearing. Four of the accused were remanded until the next session to allow time for the main witness against them, an Aboriginal boy named Yintayintin or Davey, to be prepared in order to take a Bible oath. According to the missionary, Lancelot Edward Threlkeld, Dangar had arranged for Davey \\"to be put out of the way\\" and he was never seen again. With Davey unable to be located, the four were discharged in February 1839. Magistrate and politician Dangar was a magistrate and member of the district council for a number of years. He devoted much time and energy to the agricultural and political advancement of the Hunter valley. He was nominated for the electoral district comprising the Counties of Hunter, Brisbane and Bligh in the first elective Legislative Council in 1843, but was beaten by William Dumaresq. In 1845 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council as the member for the County of Northumberland. He remained a member of the council until 1851 when he retired from public life. He died in Sydney on 2 March 1861.  References  External links *Henry Dangar, the Dangar Family and Dangar Park (Mayfield) History information session.

Background He studied theater in Paris at Académie du Théâtre de la Rue Blanche and L'Ecole Charles Dullin, and later taught at Kordj-el-Kifane (Algeria). He wrote plays in both French and Arabic; among his French plays are Ophélie n'est pas morte (Ophelia is Not Dead) (1969) and Schrischamtury (1975), and among his Arabic Les Milliandaires (The Millionaires) (1968), Les tortues (The Turtles) (1970), and Asseyez-vous sur les cadavres (Sit on Corpses) (1974). His first medium length film was Les mortes (The Dead) (1975), while his first feature-length film was Al Kanfoudi (1978). Career =Theater= Lahlou directed his first play al-Sa\\"aa in Morocco in 1965, then left to study in France, returning in 1970. Many of his works modify Shakespeare to reflect post-colonial Morocco. Written in 1968, his play Ophélie n'est pas morte was influenced from the Shakespearean, with its title being a reference to Shakespeare's Ophelia. Supported financially by the Morocco Ministry of Culture, it was first performed in 1969 by Lahlou's 'University Theater Companies'. Within the play, the two different Shaksphere characters of Hamlet and Macbeth are presented in a micro drama with the characters voluntarily paralyzed and their acting confined by the use of crutches or wheelchairs.Berrchid, Abdelkrim. imruu ?al-qays f'ba'ri'z (Imruu Al-Qais in Paris), Rabat, Editions Stouki, 1982.Berrchid, Abdelkrim.

Part of the line between Morrinsville and Waitoa remains open and is in use as the Waitoa Branch line, connecting to the Fonterra Dairy Factory at Waitoa. History The discovery of gold in the Thames area in 1852The History of gold mining on \\"The River Thames\\" - Ohinemuri Regional History Journal 1, June 1964, A.M. Isdale B.A. provided the impetus for building a railway line from Auckland to Thames. In 1872 the Auckland Provincial Council recommended a rail connection to Thames, primarily due to issues associated with barging coal from North Auckland coal mines to Thames to serve the gold mining industry. Surveys were completed in 1878, despite opposition from local Maori, putting the cost of the 54 km line at £178,000. The Thames-Te Aroha section had cost £159,340 (about $30m in 2018 values) when opened. Premier Sir George Grey turned the first sod of the line at Thames on 21 December 1878, but 18 months later work from Thames was stopped by the 1880 Royal Commission ordered by Grey's successor. The track bed had been built as far as Kopu by 1884, employing about 30 men. However, construction of the section from Hamilton continued, albeit slowly. The line crossed the Waikato River and was opened from Morrinsville to Te Aroha on 1 March 1886, to Paeroa on 20 December 1895, and finally to Thames on 19 December 1898.Morrinsville - Te Ara, Encyclopedia of New Zealand, 1966 The Minister of Railways, Alfred Cadman, drove the first train into Thames, headed by an F class locomotive. One of the lines first major traffic sources was A & G Price of Thames, who started producing locomotives for NZGR from 1904. Following the completion of the North Island Main Trunk in 1908, the government began planning the East Coast Main Trunk in 1909, eventually to connect to Gisborne. Work began in 1911 on a link from Paeroa through the Karangahake Gorge to Waihi. From this stage the Thames Branch was defined as Paeroa to Thames, with the Morrinsville - Paeroa section being designated as part of the East Coast Main Trunk. In 1928 the passenger service was being provided by a steam railcar. Freight was declining by 1930, leading to the loss of the porter at Puriri. The opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1978 and the closure of the Paeroa - Katikati section of the East Coast Main Trunk led to the re-designation of the Morrinsville - Thames section as the Thames Branch. Scheduled trains to Thames ceased 1985. The line closed on 28 June 1991. The track was lifted during May 1995,New Zealands Branch Railways (from a private website) between Thames and the dairy factory at Waitoa. In 2004 the section of the line as far as Waitoa (still in place) was re-opened for dairy traffic, as part of Fonterra's policy of reviewing its transport links. The Thames Railway Station building of 1898 survives as it was listed by NZHPT Category II in 1982.NZHPT listing with photo It is a standard Vintage station, with gables, finials and scalloped bargeboards.Rail Heritage Trust - Thames Services Currently services to Waitoa consist of unscheduled shunts to Morrinsville carrying dairy products, usually powered by a DSJ class shunting locomotive, or by a DC class mainline locomotive when higher tonnages are being moved.  Stations  Stations were at Thames North, Thames, Parawai, Kopu, Matatoki, Puriri, Omahu, Wharepoa Rd, Hikutaia, Komata North, Paeroa (junction for Tauranga), Tirohia, Waitoki, Mangaiti, Tui Pa, Te Aroha, Herriesville, Waihou, Waitoa (current terminus), Tatuanui, Piako and the present junction with the ECMT at Morrinsville.

It was opened on 30 June 2009 as a replacement for the previous bridge that collapsed two years earlier during severe weather. The bridge is named in honour of the five people who perished when the bridge collapsed. The Pacific Highway is the main road link from Sydney to Brisbane and travels alongside the coast. The section from Cowan to Kariong, where the Holt-Bragg Bridge is, follows a scenic winding route, however, with the majority of traffic using the Pacific Motorway. The original bridge was built around 1930 when the new road linking Sydney to Newcastle was opened. It replaced the road via Wisemans Ferry that had become inadequate and meant that the majority of travel was made by railway or sea. It is located roughly on the original track from Hornsby to Kariong constructed by George Peat in 1854 that was closed in 1899.  Culvert collapse  On 8 June 2007 the Central Coast was battered by strong winds and torrential rain caused by an intense low pressure system a short distance out to sea. The damage as a result of these storms resulted in them being declared a natural disaster. At approximately 4pm the road above Piles Creek gave way, leaving a by fissure. Shortly afterwards, Adam Holt failed to stop and the car fell into the creek. Holt, along with his girlfriend Roslyn Bragg, their daughters Madison and Jasmine and nephew Travis Bragg were all killed. A coroner's inquest was established to discover the cause of deaths. It found that the failure of the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) and Gosford City Council to take action or initiative to fix problems with the bridge led to the collapse. The bridge was first identified as being in need of maintenance in 1984 when an RTA scientific officer had drawn attention to the corrosion of galvanised iron pipes used in the culvert. In 1995, responsibility for the road was transferred from the RTA to Gosford City Council; however, the problems with the section were not identified to council engineers. In April 2000 the bridge slumped, however nothing was done to alleviate the problem until 2002 when the council requested an estimation for a major reconstruction of the culvert. In 2004, pavement repairs triggered a request by the council to ask for quotes for concrete lining of the culvert with tenders called. However, the information was not entered into the record system and no follow up action was taken.  Current bridge To replace the collapsed culvert, a replacement bridge was constructed by the RTA and opened on 30 June 2009, at a cost of 1.9 million. Responsibility for maintenance of the bridge is with the Central Coast Council (formerly the Gosford City Council) since its opening. The RTA named the bridge the Holt-Bragg Bridge in memory of the deceased. Two bronze commemorative plaques are located at either end of the bridge on Somersby sandstone.

Playing career Dougan was raised in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow, attended John Street Secondary School and studied as a draughtsman with local engineering firm Sir William Arrol & Co. while beginning his playing career at Junior grade with Shawfield. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II. In summer 1947, having just won the Scottish Junior Cup and been selected for Scotland at that level, he was brought to Heart of Midlothian by manager David McLean, establishing himself in the team alongside fellow post-war signings, Bobby Parker, Davie Laing, Jimmy Wardhaugh and Willie Bauld, the latter two forming the Terrible Trio front line at Tynecastle with Alfie Conn. Dougan was selected once by the Scotland national football team, for a friendly match against Switzerland in 1950, with Willie Woodburn or George Young normally selected ahead of him. He also played three times for the Scottish Football League picking up a serious ankle injury in the second of those games in September 1951, which kept him out of the game for almost a year. He picked up a second serious injury in November 1953 this time to his knee. The friendly away to Doncaster Rovers on 9 November 1953 was to be his last as a Hearts first team regular.http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/195311091.html Freddie Glidden had covered for Dougan at centre half and took over the position. Dougan waited over five months before appearing for the first team again. He only played again for Hearts in friendlies after the serious knee injury appeared. In December 1954, just over a year after injuring his knee, he was allowed to join Kilmarnock for a reported fee of £4 300. Dougan had played 125 league games and made 168 first team appearances for Hearts, departing just before their very successful period of the late 1950s began. He was active for Kilmarnock over five seasons, making a total of 80 appearances but missing out on a place in the team for the 1957 Scottish Cup Final to Willie Toner; he remained on the staff at Rugby Park for two further years until 1962 to provide support to the management teams of Malky MacDonald and Willie Waddell. He died in February 2010, aged 83, having suffered from Alzheimer's disease in later life.

Development The Stal-3 was an enlarged development of the Stal-2, designed at the OOS (Otdel Opytnogo Samolyetostroeniya - section for experimental aircraft construction), with a simplified structure which reduced manufacturing man-hours and structural weight, whilst increasing the design load factor. The layout of the aircraft was very similar to the Stal-2, but featured larger dimensions, slotted flaps, a wide chord engine cowling, slotted ailerons, and spatted wheels with brakes, or skis depending on season. Flight testing began in 1933 with acceptable results, leading to a production order for 79.

This system is relatively nearby, at a distance of about 19 light years. This system consists of two M-type stars. The primary star is the magnitude 9 Gliese (GJ) 752 A. The secondary star is the dim magnitude 17 Gliese (GJ) 752 B, more commonly referred to as VB 10. This stellar pair form a binary star system separated by about 74 arc seconds (~434 AU). This system is also known for its high proper motion of about 1 arc second a year. In August 2018, a group of scientist using measurements taken from the CARMENES spectrograph, on the Calar Alto Observatory located in Spain, announced they had detected a planet orbiting the larger of the stars, HD 180617 (Gliese 752 A). The measurements indicated the presence of a planet with a minimum mass comparable to Neptune on an orbit partly located within the habitable zone. The name and number are from the Catalogue of Nearby Stars, published by German astronomer Wilhelm Gliese in 1969. Interior dynamics of the Gliese 752 stars Diagram showing the relative sizes and internal dynamic processes of the two Gliese 752 stars. Before the Hubble Space Telescope observation of Gliese 752 system, astronomers thought magnetic fields in stars required the same dynamo process that creates magnetic fields on the Sun. In the classic solar model heat generated by nuclear fusion reactions at the star's center escapes through a radiative zone just outside the core. The heat travels from the radiative core to the star's surface through a convection zone. In this region, heat bubbles to the surface by motions similar to boiling in a pot of water. Dynamos, which accelerate electrons to create magnetic forces, operate when the interior of a star rotates faster than its surface. Recent studies of the Sun indicate its convection zone rotates at nearly the same rate at all depths. This means the solar dynamo must operate in the more rapidly rotating radiative core just below the convective zone.  Gliese 752 A characteristics  The primary star, also known as Wolf 1055, is a type M2.5 red dwarf with about half the size and mass as the Sun and considerably cooler at 3240 K. This star was first observed to be a high proper motion star by the German astronomer Max Wolf with his pioneering use of astrophotography. He added this star to his extensive catalog of such stars in 1919. It is a variable star with the variable star catalog name V1428 Aquilae. It is a BY Draconis type variable star subject to flare events. Planetary system  Gliese 752 B characteristics  Gliese 752 was not known to be a binary star system until the discovery of a small dim secondary star by George Van Biesbroeck in 1944. This star is identified as VB 10 in Van Biesbroeck's star catalog. This star is notable for its very low mass. At .08 solar mass it is near the lower mass limit for a star. It is also quite small at 10% of the solar radius. This star is a type M8V red dwarf. This star is also known for its very low luminosity, with an absolute magnitude of nearly 19, due to its very cool surface temperature of only 2600°K. It is a variable star with the variable star catalog name V1298 Aquilae. This star is a UV Ceti type variable star also subject to flare events. It shares the large proper motion, along with the tendency to flare, with the primary star. In 2009 the discovery of the extrasolar planet, VB 10b, was announced in orbit around this star. However a subsequent spectrographic survey failed to confirm the presence of any large planets in orbit around this star.

Description Boston Peak is located just north of the border between Chelan and Skagit counties. It is connected to Buckner Mountain, to the east by the sharp arête of Ripsaw Ridge, which follows the county line. Sahale Peak is located directly south of Boston Peak, connected by a short ridge. A longer ridge to the northwest connects Boston Peak with Forbidden Peak and Sharkfin Tower. The north slopes of Boston Peak and Ripsaw Ridge are covered by Boston Glacier, the largest glacier of the North Cascades. The west side of Boston Peak is covered by Quien Sabe Glacier. Davenport Glacier occupies the southeast side of Boston Peak. To the east of the high summits of Forbidden Peak, Boston Peak, and Sahale Mountain the land slopes down into the vast cirque of Boston Basin. Numerous headwater tributaries of the Cascade River flow down the slopes of Boston Basin. Cascade Pass, an important mountain pass of the North Cascades, is located about south of Boston Peak. To the south of the high peaks and ridges between Sahale Mountain, Boston Peak, Ripsaw Ridge, and Buckner Mountain is another vast cirque called Horseshoe Basin, from which some the headwater tributaries of the Stehekin River flow. Boston Peak sits on the boundary between the watersheds of the Skagit River to the west, via the Cascade River and other tributaries, and the Columbia River to the east, via the Stehekin River and other tributaries. History Boston Peak is named for Boston Mine, which operated on the southeast side of the peak in the late 19th century. The first mining claims of what would become the Cascade Mining District were made in 1889 by George Rowse and John Rouse, who named their claims \\"Boston\\" and \\"Chicago\\", respectively. Boston Peak was first summited in 1938 by Calder Bressler, Ray Clough, Bill Cox, and Tom Myers. It is a difficult climb as the slope is steep and the rock very loose and friable.

Background Dysart was the son of William Manners (later William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower) and Catherine Rebecca, daughter of Francis Grey. In 1821, when his grandmother Louisa Tollemache became 7th Countess of Dysart, he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Tollemache in lieu of Manners.

Political career Dysart sat as Member of Parliament for Ilchester, alongside his younger brother the Hon. Felix Tollemache, from 1827 until they were defeated at the 1830 general election. In 1836 he was appointed High Sheriff of Leicestershire. In 1841 he succeeded his grandmother in the earldom of Dysart and to her estate at Ham House in Richmond, London. However, as this was a Scottish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. Family Lord Dysart married Maria Elizabeth, daughter of Sweeny Toone, in 1819. In 1820 she bore one son, William Lionel Felix Tollemache. She died in March 1852.

Dan was born and raised in Vancouver. He graduated from Kitsilano High School and went on to study mathematics and meteorology at the University of British Columbia, where Dan earned an Honours B.Sc degree in mathematics. He was also a poet, and after readings by the poet Charles Duncan (poet) at U.B.C. in the summer of 1961, he, with some friends, began a small newsletter, Tish, which he edited from about 1964 until the Georgia Straight was founded in 1967. Foundation of the Georgia Straight :\\"Legend has it the joint decision to start a so-called underground newspaper like the Village Voice was made at a party following a poetry reading by Leonard Cohen. McLeod emerged as the prime leader behind the idealistic, naive, frequently irresponsible, consistently cheeky, often insightful, collectively-run initiative because he was most willing to take the brunt of police persecution and unmitigated legal harassment that ensued.\\" :In April 1967: \\"The proposed paper is christened the Georgia Straight over beer at the Cecil Hotel. The name aims to play on the fact that the weather forecasts will offer free publicity: they're always issuing gale warnings for the Georgia Strait.\\"The Georgia Straight: What the Hell Happened? Naomi Pauls and Charles Campbell, p. 67. (1997) Douglas & McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto. . The paper was founded by Pierre Coupey, Milton Acorn, Dan McLeod, Stan Persky, and others, and operated originally as a collective.The Georgia Straight: What the Hell Happened? Naomi Pauls and Charles Campbell, p. 20 (1997) Douglas & McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto. . The first issue appeared on 5 May 1967 and cost a dime. It was at first a biweekly. On 12 May the paper moved into its first office at 432 Homer St., and soon after Dan was taken away in a paddy wagon and jailed for three hours for \\"investigation of vagrancy.\\" College Printers refused to print the second issue, but an alternative printer was soon found. Dan continued to regularly find himself at odds with the Law, especially in the early days, and was even asked once by a policeman: \\"What do you want me to arrest you for—disturbing the peace?\\"The Georgia Straight: What the Hell Happened? Naomi Pauls and Charles Campbell, p. 20. (1997) Douglas & McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto. . \\"The Straight\\" soon developed into an anti-establishment alternative newspaper with a focus on investigative reporting, and providing a voice for the growing alternative culture in Vancouver, which grew rapidly in the late 1960s with an influx of many thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers and military deserters seeking refuge, as Canada remained technically neutral.Draft-dodger memorial to be built in B.C., CBC News, 09/08/2004 This exodus was \\"the largest politically motivated migration from the United States since the United Empire Loyalists moved north to oppose the American Revolution.\\"\\"On Strawberry Hill\\" by Chris Turner in The Walrus, September 2007. :\\"Then-editor (and now publisher) Dan McLeod was a grad student and a poet who strongly advocated press freedoms. He opened up the pages of the Straight as a forum for alternative opinions, which often got him in trouble with the law. Within the first two years of publication, McLeod and his paper were charged with 27 counts of obscenity, one charge of \\"counselling to commit an indictable offence\\" (for publishing tips on how to grow marijuana) and one count of criminal libel for comparing a judge to Pontius Pilate.\\" Awards In 1998 Dan won the Bruce Hutchison Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jack Webster Foundation.http://www.jackwebster.com/awards/1998.shtml/images/past_awards.swf In 2002, Dan McLeod was honoured with another Lifetime Achievement Award from the Western Magazine Awards Foundation. Current activities , Dan McLeod still owns, edits and publishes the Georgia Straight, and he and his partner Yolanda Stepien, are involved in many philanthropic and other projects supporting the arts. They have two grown children. Their son, Matt, is currently VP of Operations for the Straight, while Yolanda is the Distribution Director.

Its artistic director is Nicholas Dinopoulos. The choir was formed in 1939 by Vincent J. Kelly who was musical director until his death in 1972. Subsequent musical/artistic directors were Geoffrey Jones (1972–1978), Ian Harrison (1979–1983), Noel Ancell (1983–2018) and Nicholas Dinopoulos (2018-) Based in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, the choir presents an annual subscription series of formal concerts, as well as other engagements (television, radio and film). Films that the choir have provided soundtracks for include the Oscar-nominated Elizabeth, and the Australian box office hit The Dish. Known for its high standards of excellence and extremely broad repertoire of music, the choir performs pieces by many composers, including Bach, Benjamin Britten, John Rutter, Noel Ancell, Mahler, Tchaikovsky and Jim Steinman. The choir has a strong commitment to Australian choral music and regularly commissions and performs new or recent works. Training/performing groups The Australian Boys Choir consists of different levels for boys in training. Using Kodály methodology and starting at around the age of 7 or 8, boys begin training as probationers usually for one school term. Emphasis is on enjoyment and through musical games boys develop basic understanding of musical methods and singing. The next stage is 'tyros', where boys spend 9 to 12 months, depending on their abilities, working on aural development and music reading skills as well as vocal development. 'Junior singers' follows 'tyros', with more emphasis on vocal technique and music reading skills. Performance skills become important at this level. 'Senior singers' focus more on performance skills, while continuing to broaden their own musical skills and experience. Boys at this level become eligible to sing with the performing choir. Choir members who achieve the highest levels of musical proficiency are promoted to the rank of chorister, the highest rank in the Australian Boys Choir. The performing choir of the Australian Boys Choir comprises boys selected for their talent and dedication. Not every boy will earn a place in this performing group, which undertakes major concerts and other appearances, national and international tours and recording engagements. All of the above- mentioned groups and training levels are for the unchanged (treble) male voice. Once the voices of choir members have changed, the young men may continue in the 'Kelly Gang', named not for the notorious bushrangers, but in recognition of the founder of the Australian Boys Choir – Vincent J. Kelly. As part of the Kelly Gang, the emphasis is on learning to sing with their new voices with performances and tours of lesser priority. The young men continue in the Kelly Gang until finishing secondary school after which they can audition for the Vocal Consort. The Vocal Consort was formed in 1984 to complement the work of the Australian Boys Choir and is composed of adult men, most of whom have progressed through the training levels of the choir. In addition to performing with the Australian Boys Choir, the Vocal Consort tours in Australia and overseas and presents many performances in its own right. Tours The Australian Boys' Choir tours frequently. International tour locations include the United States, UK, Europe, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In 1989, the choir went on a world tour which ended in New York. The choir also tours in Australia. Recent national tour locations include Tasmania, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth. In 2013 the Australian Boys Choir and the Vocal Consort toured to Malaysia. Past members More than 1500 boys have reached the level of the performing choir in the nearly 75-year history of the Australian Boys Choir, including many who have gone on to careers in music and the arts.

It began in 2007 as a Saturday morning show on Orlando's ESPN. Throughout its duration, it has been hosted by Matt West. Matt's style is very Socratic. He commonly states, \\"Let's look at this from a global perspective.\\" While seemingly knowledgeable about many sports, he is best when he is trying to relate some sports activity to every day life. He doesn't talk a lot about his personal life, but he speaks glowingly about his wife. He also has a son and two daughters. His eating prowess has been the subject of many segments over many months of the show.  WHOO Era  When the show originated on WHOO, it was produced by Jared Lawrence, who has come back and visited when the show was regionally syndicated. Later, it was produced by Ryan Bonifant, who was also a regular contributor. During this period, there was a heavy emphasis on Orlando Sports. Jason Lucas, an official employee of the Orlando Predators of the now defunct Arena Football League came on several times. Further, there was a heavy emphasis on the Orlando Magic, as Pat Williams (NBA), Dwight Howard, and JJ Redick all came on the show.  Regionally Syndicated Era  In June 2008, the show expanded to include additional stations. Some of those stations have been St. Augustine's ESPN WAOC, Pensacola's Sports leader WTKE, Clemson's Sports Leader WCCP-FM, The Space Coast's ESPN WINT, and inexplicably Live 101.9 WBGE. Upon this initial expansion, Ballpark Frank produced the show and spoke when asked a direct question. After he left the show, a \\"Producer for the Day\\" who spoke sparingly, took over producing duties. While the moniker might suggest differently, he was on several times, and the host and co-hosts have made jokes about this. After that brief period, a female producer who only spoke over the \\"loud speaker\\" during the Sampler Platter. She seems to be the voice on the show's intro also. A female identified as \\"Suzannah, captain of the Non-Men\\" has recently been identified as the producer. During this era, the co-host became the Iceman. He is bombastic and likes to make up multi-syllabic words. His love for all teams Boston has been made known on several occasions.  Podcast Based Era  In 2013, the show moved to podcasts in lieu of live radio. Matt became known as \\"The Phat Man\\" and the Iceman was also revealed to be Aaron Crouch. They now use real names and sobriquets interchangeably. Since this format took over, they have had very few experts on the air, and they invite people, like Dave, Mike, Andrew, or Jacob on for the entire segment. They put out an hour-long podcast sometime early Wednesday morning, and they create 1-2 \\"samplers\\" during the week that are 10-20 minutes and include some relevant topic that falls between Wednesdays.  Other Voices on the Air  Steve \\"DIVA\\" Chapman and David \\"Tex\\" Poston both served as co-host with regularity. The two of them have rarely been on together, but when they were, some of the most memorable moments of the show have occurred. Each co-host has a nemesis. Tex's nemesis is \\"Dimarco\\" and the DIVA's nemesis is \\"Bishop Felipe\\". Each nemesis had a turn co-hosting the show. In addition to these nemeses, Steve Atwater, Mac Rogers, Marc Ryan, and Bret Brilliante have co-hosted once or twice. The DIVA came within a 9-iron of being a professional golfer. He was a semi-pro level basketball player. He commonly laughs at Matt's jokes, even when they aren't funny. He also has invited at least 5-6 callers and emailers to join them in the studio. Tex commonly uses the bathroom during the show and, apparently, always wears Cologne. He gives out pictures of himself for winning a contest. He claims to have dated an underwear model and be an ambidextrous tennis player. The show solicits calls and emails. With the exception of several calls during football season, the show gets a large amount of email and not as many phone calls. Whenever a new station is added, Matt signifies this by calling Coach Atwater. Coach Atwater has never appeared except on these initial shows. Since the move to podcasts, emails have not been read. To date, it is not certain if they are still soliciting them, but clearly they are not soliciting them to the same degree as they were.  Segments  *Every week, Matt does a Sampler Platter, which is where he does a fast-paced briefing on a variety of sports topics, in the first segment. *Until February 2009, Tex did a segment called the Wisdom of Tex, where he would give his take on 3-4 issues. When he served as a co- host, this segment was often skipped. *Until April 2009, Tex also had a mid- month hit list, which once a month, he asked several boneheads \\"What Were You Thinking?\\" *Through the Summer of 2008, there was a music contest, where the listeners got to choose a \\"theme song\\" for the DIVA. It is believed that this contest is where Steve became known as the DIVA. *During Football season, Steve Chapman conducts a segment called \\"The DIVA's Fantasy of the Week\\" where he gives Fantasy Football advice.  \\"Experts\\" who come on frequently  *Steve Atwater-Scout and Farm League Coach *Chuck Waltz-Golf Expert *Mac Rogers-NHL Expert *Josh Allen-MLB Expert, Baseball Historian *Lou DiPietro-NFL draft *Bradley Warren-College Football *Justin Barney-NBA, College Basketball *Greg Batten-Outdoors, pop culture *Gregg Kielma-NASCAR, NHRA *James Raia-Tour de France *Jason Lucas-Arena Football (defunct) *Billy Osborn-NASCAR, other car (former) *The Goober Brothers-NHL Expert (former) *Jorge Caravia-NFL draft expert (former)  External links  * http://www.TheSportBuffet.com - The show's official website Category:American sports radio programs Category:ESPN Radio shows Category:2000s American radio programs Category:American talk radio programs ","title":"The Sport Buffet"},{"id":"23128519","text":"Kalimantsi (also written Kalimantzi, Kalimanci; or Калиманци in Cyrillic) may refer to: * In Bulgaria: ** Kalimantsi, Blagoevgrad Province - a village in Sandanski municipality, Blagoevgrad Province ** Kalimantsi, Varna Province, a village in Suvorovo municipality, Varna Province * In the Republic of Macedonia: ** Kalimanci, Vinica, a village in Vinica Municipality ","title":"Kalimantsi"},{"id":"23128543","text":"Noam Scheiber is writer for The New York Times and a former senior editor for The New Republic.

Development  The 2A3 originated during the Cold War as a response to the United States' new \\"Pentomic Division\\" tactical doctrine that emphasized heavy use of nuclear weapons including nuclear artillery. The US M65 cannon was introduced in 1952 and deployed in Germany in 1953. The Soviet Union started its own program to develop a 406mm self-propelled howitzer capable of firing nuclear projectiles, codenamed 'Objekt 271'. Grabin Design Bureau completed the artillery system in 1955. The 'Objekt 271' chassis from the Kotlin Design Bureau in Leningrad was completed soon thereafter. The unified system received the military industrial designation 2A3 and was completed in 1956 at the Kirov Works in Leningrad. Total production only amounted to four vehicles. Western observers got their first look at the new weapon during a 1957 parade on Red Square. Initially observers thought that the weapon was a mockup created for deterrent effect. Kondensator had an exceptionally short service life. Following a period of extensive testing the weapons were assigned to the Artillery High Command reserve. There they remained in service until the military reforms of Nikita Khrushchev were enacted, favouring more effective missile systems over the super-heavy artillery and heavy tanks of the Stalinist era.

Description Honewort is a low-growing glabrous plant. Its stems can reach 20 cm, and are surrounded by abundant fibrous remains of petioles at the base. It is much-branched, with the branches spreading at a wide angle. The leaves are glaucous, and are 2- to 3- times pinnate, although upper leaves are less divided. The inflorescence is an umbel, with white flowers, and no sepals. It has an ovoid, laterally compressed fruit.Tutin, T. G. (1980) Umbellifers of the British Isles (BSBI Handbook no. 2) , pages 124-5 Taxonomy and nomenclature The genus Trinia is named after the German-born botanist Carl Bernhard von Trinius. Habitat In Britain, Honewort is restricted to dry stony limestone sites, typically occurring in short, open, grazed turf on south-facing slopes.  Status and distribution  Honewort is found in central and southern Europe, north to southern England, and in southwest Asia. = Status in Britain = In Britain, Honewort is found as a native species in three areas, all in southwest England: the Avon Gorge near Bristol, coastal limestone in South Devon, and in the western Mendip Hills (including the adjacent coast). Its British range covers around 20 sites in all, and the two largest native populations, comprising around 10,000 plants each, are both in this last area, at Sand Point and Crook Peak.Wigginton, M.

The tree grows to 4–8 meters in height, has grey or yellowish bark and compound leaves. New leaves are accompanied by purple flowers on multi-branched panicles. The fruit is a glabrous papery pod, usually containing one seed. L. laxiflorus is widely distributed in West Africa, Central Africa, the African Great Lakes, and Northeast Africa. It is found in savanna woodlands and dry forested areas, particularly fringing forest near water courses.Hans Dieter Neuwinger. African ethnobotany: poisons and drugs : chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, CRC Press, 1996, , 682–683  Human use  L. laxiflorus is used across its range for traditional medicine. These uses include: * Benin: A decoction of roots with Cymbopogan schoenanthus and Hymenocardia acidia the leaves of Vitex simplicifolia is used in vapor baths and administered orally to treat mental illness. A decoction of leafy twigs with those of Byrsocarpus coccineus is drunk and used as a lotion to treat dermatitis. The powder of calcined roots is rubbed on the forehead to treat headache. * Central African Republic: The Lissongo macerate the root to make a drink to treat intestinal worms. * North Gambia: Used as medication for \\"women's disorders\\" * Kenya: Root infusion used to treat back pain and paralysis * North Nigeria: Medicine made from leaves used for foot ulcers. Bark and roots used for jaundice and as a tonic. The bark is also used for an anthelmintic. * Senegal: Bambara practitioners uses the roots to treat leprosy and intestinal disorders. * Togo: Root bark mixed with that of Stereospermum kunthianum and elephant excrement to fumigate against leprosy or, alternatively, a root concoction mixed with that of young Parkia biglobosa and Vitellaria paradoxa is drunk * Northern Uganda: In traditional Acholi culture, before a war, an old woman of the chief's clan had to bless the weapons of the warriors by sprinkling them with a branch of L. laxiflorus dipped in water and millet flour., 40-41 In nearby Apac District, water sprinkled with L. laxiflorus branches around a home was used to ward off evil spirits.Reference HO 08 in Prelude Medicinal Plants Database, for Okello J., P.Ssegawa. \\"Medicinal plants used by communities of Ngai Subcounty, Apac District, northern Uganda.\\" African Journal of Ecology, Volume 45 (Suppl.1), pp. 76 – 83 (2007) Other uses of L. laxiflorus include applying a lotion with a decoction to the skin to treat venereal disease, constipation in children, skin diseases, sterility (insufficient semen).  Chemistry and toxicology  Skeletal formula of lonchocarpane (R=OMe) or laxiflorane (R=H) L. laxiflorus has been little studied, though many Lonchocarpus species contain rotenoids, tannins, flavonoids, and isoflavonoids. One study extracted several new compounds from the bark: two isoflavanes (lonchocarpane and laxiflorane) and two pterocarpanes (philonopterane and 9-O-methyl derivative). Nothing specific is known about the toxicology of L. laxiflorus, though several Lonchocarpus species are known to cause severe poisoning symptoms.

Overview The Plaza was originally developed by local landowner and banker Ernesto Tornquist. Facing San Martín Square, the nine-story hotel was designed by German born architect Alfred Zucker and built at the northern end of Florida Street. The establishment was inaugurated as the Plaza Hotel on July 15, 1909, with the presence of President José Figueroa Alcorta. The hotel's developer, Ernesto Tornquist, had died in 1908, however.Previaje: El Marriott Plaza Hotel de Buenos Aires Touted at the time as the finest hotel in South America, it was also its most modern. The original 160 rooms and 16 suites each had central heating and telephone access, and all were accessible via elevators. The hotel was wholly furnished at its outset by the prestigious London houses of Thompson & Company and Waring & Gillow. Marble sculptures by Gustav Eberlein of Germany and ceiling frescoes by Julio Vila y Prades of Spain added to the hotel's decor. Two new wings were added between 1942 and 1948, and additional work completed in 1977 brought the total number of rooms to nearly 400. The Philippine Embassy in Buenos Aires initially based itself out of the hotel when it opened in 1949. The hotel was a part of the Inter-Continental Hotels chain from 1981-1982 and was briefly renamed the Plaza Inter-Continental. The Washington, DC-based Marriott Hotels Group assumed management of the hotel in 1994 for a period of 30 years while the property was still controlled by Tornquinst's descendants. It was renamed the Marriott Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires. Following a US$10 million refurbishment, the establishment was awarded a five star rating.Marriott Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires The hotel today maintains 270 rooms and 48 suites. It received a facelift on the occasion of its 100th anniversary in 2009, celebrated with tours for the local people and a book retelling its fabulous and centennial history. The hotel was sold in 2013 and returned to its historic name, the Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires.http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/Alvear-compran-Hotel-Plaza- millones_0_899910073.html The hotel closed April 29, 2017 for renovations.

Most of the line is unelectrified and single-tracked. It links Buchholz in der Nordheide with Hanover, the capital city of Lower Saxony. Together with the east-west Uelzen–Langwedel railway, this north-south line is one of the two most important railways on the heath.  History Already in the middle of the 19th century, Walsrode sought a connection to a railway line in response to the growth of gunpowder factories in neighbouring Bomlitz. In 1866, during discussions of a proposal for the construction of the so-called America Line (Bremen–Uelzen–Berlin), the town of Walsrode unsuccessfully campaigned for a connection to this line. It was not until 27 February 1885 that the Prussian government approved the building of the Hannover–Walsrode–Visselhövede railway. This line was opened to Walsrode in 1890. Initially, freight operations were opened to Walsrode station on 16 June 1990 and the grand opening ceremony of the new Hanover–Visselhövede railway took place on 25 August 1890. Later, the section from Walsrode to Visselhövede was extended via Rotenburg an der Wümme, Zeven and Bremervörde to Bremerhaven. The Bremervörde–Walsrode section was intended as a long-distance connection and was built in largely straight sections. However, it could never establish itself as a through route. Already at the beginning of the construction of the Hanover–Visselhövede line, Fallingbostel and Soltau also sought a connection to it. The Walsrode–Fallingbostel–Soltau branch line was opened on 1 October 1896. The first passenger train reached Fallingbostel on 1 June 1896. The construction of the Soltau–Buchholz section began in 1898. The line was built using a mechanised method, with workers filling wagons hauled by narrow-gauge steam locomotives. The most expensive work of this section was a viaduct over the Dumpetal, which cost 27,000 marks. The opening run took place on 30 September 1901. These sections have a distinctly secondary character. = Development= The current Heath Railway was now complete, but it was then supplemented by eight branch lines. * The Celle–Schwarmstedt–Wahnebergen–Verden (Aller) state railway was built from 1903 to 1905. It formed part of the so-called Aller Valley Railway (Allertalbahn). * The Verden–Walsrode Railway followed in 1911. * The later OHE line was connected from Soltau to Celle (23 April 1910), to Lüneburg (13 June 1913) and Neuenkirchen (1 January 1917). * In Cordingen, the electrified Wolff & Co. works railway was connected to Bomlitz in 1915. At times it also carried public passenger traffic. * The most important branch today, the so- called Hasenbahn (Hare Railway) from Langenhagen to Celle, was opened on 15 May 1938. The resulting Hannover–Langenhagen–Celle connection now forms part of the Hanover–Hamburg railway. *The factory railway of the Eibia munitions company was connected in Honerdingen in 1938. Until 1945, it had the largest freight traffic in terms of quantity of the branches from the Heath Railway. It connected to the Wolff & Co. works railway to Bomlitz in Benefeld. During the Second World War, the Heath Railway was an important transport route serving prison camps, the Bergen military training area and the local armament industry, such as the Eibia works. So the prisoner transports to Stalag XI B and Stalag XI D ran over the line. The prisoners were driven from Fallingbostel (now Bad Fallingbostel) station to the camps. Bad Fallingbostel station has a plaque commemorating these events. The branch lines across the heath did not last long. Passenger traffic was abandoned on the OHE lines around Soltau from 1961 to 1975 and on the Verden–Walsrode Railway in 1964. In 1980, the line to Visselhövede was reduced to traffic to the works and passenger traffic to Bomlitz, which was served until 1991. The passenger traffic on the Aller Valley Railway (Verden–Schwarmstedt–Celle) was discontinued in 1966 and the line was closed in 1995. The closure of the Heath Railway was repeatedly discussed in the 1980s and the early 1990s, with the Buchholz–Soltau section particularly at risk. An S-Bahn was opened in Hanover in preparation for Expo 2000. The section of the Heath Railway to Bennemühlen was included in this network. The number of stops was increased from three to ten. Bennemühlen station was selected as a provisional end point, where passengers usually had to change trains to continue to Soltau until December 2012. Located on the border of the Hanover Region, this station has little of its own traffic. In the first years of operation, the new S-Bahn line was able to increase the number of passengers from 2,600 in 2000 to 7,200 in 2002. Between Buchholz and Soltau there are still semaphore signals and this section of the line is still equipped with mechanical signal boxes. Since October 2011, Hodenhagen station has been extensively rebuilt and is now remotely controlled from Walsrode using a computer-based interlocking. In 2016, electronic interlockings were installed in Dorfmark and Fallingbostel, replacing the mechanical signal boxes.  Development and modernisation  The Heath railway was upgraded until 2016 for a top speed of up to 120 km/h. The upgrade was carried out in three sections: * section 1: Bennemühlen–Walsrode * section 2: Walsrode–Soltau * section 3: Soltau–Buchholz The completion of the first construction phase between Bennemühlen and Walsrode was originally planned for 2007. It was only in December 2007 that the contracts necessary for the project were signed by the railway and the state of Lower Saxony (represented by the State public transport company of Lower Saxony—Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen, LNVG). As part of the project, the halts of Hademstorf and Eickeloh were closed in the summer of 2010. Under the winter timetable of 2011, the first regional trains ran on the first stage at 120 km/h, which reduces travel time by ten minutes. This reduction was made possible by the station closures, the upgrade of level crossings and the installation of a digital train radio system. The third construction phase (Soltau–Buchholz) had to completed before the second construction phase (Walsrode–Soltau) to comply with the time restrictions on the use of EU funds. The design for the third construction phase was completed in 2008, so that the upgrade could be started by the end of 2009. By the end of 2011, the 46-kilometre section was upgraded to increase train speeds from 80 km/h to 120 km/h. The travel time was shortened by eleven minutes. After the completion of all construction works (2017), the stations of Wintermoor, Büsenbachtal and Suerhop were considered for closure. With passenger numbers (as of 2009) of 150 (Suerhop), 90 (Büsenbachtal) and 80 (Wintermoor), the minimum number of 200 passengers per day was not reached. The halt of Hemsen has not been served due to the construction work since 6 November 2010. In response to rising passenger numbers, the three halts were adapted to be barrier-free and extended in 2016, so now there can be served by sets of three LINT 41 railcars. The remaining work lasted until 2017. The second construction phase started in early summer 2015. All construction measures were expected to be completed by 2017. The reduction of stops in Soltau to 15 minutes (2015: 24 minutes) at the timetable change in December 2016 resulted from the largely completed upgrade of the missing section. In addition, the travel time between Hanover and Buchholz was reduced while maintaining hourly intervals between services all day. With the transfer of the train crossings from Dorfmark to Soltau, a clock-face hub was established in Soltau for direct transfer to the trains on the Bremen–Uelzen railway, which also cross there at hourly-intervals. Running time from Buchholz to Hanover: * before start of construction (summer timetable for 2008) at least 2:24 * after completion (annual timetable for 2017) 1:50 (according to the timetable, typically 1:53 or 1:55) The total cost of the upgrade was over €100 million. Plans to upgrade the Heath Railway south of Walsrode as part of the Y-Trasse (Y-route) to the high-speed line have been abandoned. Instead, smaller upgrades are planned on other existing lines in the area.  Current services  The Heath Railway is important for commuter traffic to Hanover and Hamburg as well as for day tourists. The RB 38 service runs hourly each day over the entire line between Hanover and Buchholz (Nordheide). By the time of the timetable change in 2016, however, only the line between Hanover and Soltau (Han) was served hourly on weekends. The line is approved for a top speed of 120 km/h. On its southern section between Langenhagen and Bennemühlen the Heath Railway is electrified and forms line S 4 of the Hanover S-Bahn network. The track has been doubled as far as Bissendorf. The northern end between Buchholz in der Nordheide and Handeloh is part of the Hamburg Transport Association (HVV) network. On the line between Handeloh and Soltau the HVV fare tariff is restricted to season tickets. Because the Hamburg–Uelzen–Hanover and Hamburg–Rotenburg (Wümme)–Verden (Aller)–Hanover routes are much faster, the Heath Railway is of little importance for through services; the journey from Hamburg to Hanover via Soltau takes at least 2 hours, 32 minutes according to the winter 2016/2017 timetable. No through connexions are offered; for example passengers have to change in Buchholz (Nordheide), Soltau and/or Bennemühlen. There are regular goods trains only on the southern part of the line to Walsrode. Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen AG (OHE) won the tender for the Heath Railway and took over operations at the timetable change in December 2011 for eight years. For this purpose, they founded a new subsidiary, Heidekreuzbahn GmbH, which was renamed Erixx GmbH on 18 April 2011.

Cornish 'Went North' in 1899 switching to rugby league, joining Hull F.C.Jenkins (1991), pg 32. Rugby career Born in England in 1876, Cornish is first recorded playing rugby for his hometown club, Bridgwater & Albion. He moved to Wales and joined the Grangetown Stars, but before the end of the century Cornish became a member of first class Welsh team Cardiff RFC, and during the 1896/97 season was selected to play for the Welsh national team, under the two-year residency ruling. Cornish was brought into the pack, along with fellow first caps, Jack Rhapps and Dick Hellings to face England as part of the 1897 Home Nations Championship. Wales won the game in style, but it would be the only international the team would play that year, as an argument broke out between the Home Unions surrounding professionalism, now known as the Gould Affair. The next season, with Arthur Gould now forced into retirement, Wales were readmitted into the Championship. The only two members of the 1897 pack to return for the 1898 Championship were Cornish and Hellings. Despite a large influx of new caps, Cornish was now playing in a Wales squad dominated with his Cardiff team mates; including captain Selwyn Biggs at centre and a threequarters trio of Jones, Nicholls and Huzzey. The Welsh were again victorious winning the opening match against Ireland 11–3, but Cornish found himself in a losing international for the first time when Wales lost to England in the final game of the Championship. Towards the end of the 1897/98 season, Cornish was part of the Cardiff team that faced the touring Barbarians as part of their annual Easter tour. Cardiff won the game 6–0, with Cornish and wing Huzzey scoring a try each.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 77 The 1899 Home Nations Championship saw the Welsh selectors again overhaul the pack, with five new caps. Cornish was not among those reselected, which saw a spectacular win over the English team; but after a heavy away defeat by Scotland in the next match, Cornish was back in favour for the Irish encounter at the Cardiff Arms Park. Cornish, brought in as a replacement for Tom Dobson, would play his last international in this match, with Wales losing to a single Gerald Doran try. Cornish may have been selected for further international games, but in August 1899 he switched rugby codes joining Hull rugby league team, preventing his return to the union code of rugby. =International matches under the union code= WalesSmith (1980), pg 463. * 1897, 1898 * 1898, 1899 Bibliography  * References Category:1876 births Category:1940 deaths Category:British boilermakers Category:Cardiff RFC players Category:English rugby league players Category:English rugby union players Category:Hull F.C. players Category:People from Bridgwater Category:Rugby union forwards Category:Wales international rugby union players ","title":"Fred Cornish"},{"id":"23128787","title":"Prior to 1800 in New Zealand"},{"id":"23128795","text":"Joseph Webbe (fl. 1610 – 1630) was an English grammarian, physician, and astrologer. He is now remembered for his views on language teaching, which were based on minimal instruction in grammar, against the contemporary fashion. Life A Catholic, he graduated M.D. and Ph.D., perhaps at Padua. Before 1622 he returned to England, and in 1623 was residing in the Old Bailey; John Gee, in his Foot out of the Snare, describes him as there and taking pupils. Through Samuel Hartlib Webbe corresponded in 1629 with another innovator, William Brookes.Margaret Ann Thomas, Universal Grammar in Second Language Acquisition: a history (2004), p. 129. Works In 1612 he published at Rome an astrological work entitled Minae Coalestes Affectus segrotantibus denunciantes, hoc anno 1612. He strongly advocated a colloquial method of teaching languages, proposing to extend it even to the classical tongues, and to substitute it for the manner of grammatical study in general use. He was influenced in this by Georgius Haloinus and Wolfgang Ratke.Anthony Philip Reid Howatt, H. G. Widdowson, A History of English Language Teaching (2004), pp. 39-40. In 1622 he published, in support of his views, An Appeale to Truth, in the Controuersie betweene Art and Vse (London), which he supplemented in 1623 by A Petition to the High Court of Parliament, in the behalf of auncient and authentique Authors (London), in which he says that his system has received encouragement from James I, and that he wishes to receive a monopoly of the right to teach by his method. The Pueriles confabulatiunculae, or children talke, claused and drawne into lessons appeared in 1627. A work dedicated to Charles I from 1626, entitled Vsus et Authoritas (London), was a treatise on hexameters and pentameters. Webbe was also the author of translations, including one of The Familiar Epistles of Cicero (London), undated, but probably published about 1620.

Siphon coffee history in Hong Kong Hong Kong is a unique city in China. Due to the strong influence of British colonists, Hong Kong has a unique mixed Chinese-Western culture. After British rule for more than 150 years, tea has been a more common beverage than coffee during the 1960s to 1980s. Thanks to the opening of Pacific Coffee Company, the first Seattle coffee house in 1992, coffee became a very popular drink in Hong Kong. Hong Kong people were then exposed to all kinds of European-style coffee such as espresso and latte. In Hong Kong, the very first appearance of a siphon coffee maker was in the 1970s, at a coffee shop (which may also be the city's first bona-fide coffee shop) on Patterson Street, Causeway.

It shows evidence of 12th- and 14th- century building and was largely rebuilt in 1476. On 17 April 1959, it was designated as a Grade I listed building. History The church is built in the Perpendicular style. The date 1474 is recorded in an inscription on the tomb of the rector who re-built it. The rebuilding of the church in 1476 took about one year, and was performed under John Selwood, then Abbot of Glaston, who was also the patron and donor of the rectory. The rector John Dyer built the present chancel in 1476. The rector Adrian Schall wrote a memoir about the church in 1598. Some 19th-century restoration work was done by John Norton. Architecture =Structure= The design is a four-cell plan with a three- bay chancel, and five-bay nave. There are north and south aisles, a south porch, and a west tower. Building materials include local lias stone and hamstone. The main roofs are composed of Welsh slate with moulded coped gables, battlemented parapets. The aisle and porch roofs are of sheet lead. The tower dates from the early 14th century, and is in three stages. It is squat with triple plinth bands, parapets, corner gargoyles, angled and straight buttresses. The chancel was built in 1499. It has a double plinth course, gargoyles, parapets, coped gables, and angled buttresses. Each buttress had an east window of five-light panes; the north and south sections had three-light windows. The chancel was built with a moulded king post truss roof and many rosettes, angels and other carvings. The wide panelled chancel arch has a well preserved Devon-style timber screen. The north aisle has similar features as the chancel with double plinth eaves course, gargoyles, battlements, buttresses, and three-light windows of standard tracery in hollowed pointed-arched recesses. The nave dates from 1476; it is visible as a clerestorey and includes three-light windows. 15th-century stained glass fragments are found in the east window tracery, and there are also late-17th- century windows resembling those of Low Ham Church. There is a small, almost triangular, arched, moulded doorway, an arched chamfered doorway, and a near semi-circular arched doorway with 19th-century wrought iron gates. Other features of note include a canopied statue niche with a 19th-century figure and an empty statue niches along the east wall. =Fittings and furniture= Choir stalls are of the 15th century, as are many of the pew bench ends. The pulpit and lectern are also of the 19th century. There is a canopied stoup, and a 12th-century lead-lined tulip bowl font on a stem with rope moulding. The church has five bells cast in ca.1500, 1641, 1763, 1795, and 1877. A brass engraving in the chancel floor is dedicated to the rector John Dyer (died 1499) who paid for the rebuilding of the chancel. Churchyard Churchyard There are several Grade II listed structures, enlisted 7 February 1986, in and by the churchyard. The Gillet Monument is a late-18th-century altar tomb with an obelisk made of hamstone and it is located in the churchyard, southwest of the tower. The Swain Travers Monument is also located in the churchyard, just east of the chancel; it is a 19th-century chest tomb, a possibly reuse of an 18th-century tomb. An unidentified late-17th-century monument in the churchyard is located just south of the chancel. Adding to the setting of the churchyard which it abuts is a portion of the east boundary wall, to Ham Court, south of the church. Also historically important is the section of the south boundary wall with railings, south of the church, with cast iron railings and patterned with cross/Fleur-de-lis caps.

The reactors were \\"System 80\\" pressurized water reactors built by Combustion Engineering in Chattanooga TN. Three similar reactors were installed at Palo Verde Nuclear Plant in Arizona. The site, as of 8 November 2010 Construction on the reactors began in 1978, but in August 1984, the TVA officially canceled construction of the reactors (with about 30% of the plant complete, construction having ceased (due to suspension of the work) de facto in 1982) because the cost to finish construction had risen dramatically and also because of lower electricity demand. Following TVA's cancellation, the partially completed site with infrastructure already in place underwent reconstruction as a site for NASA to build solid rocket motors. Construction was about 80% complete when Congress pulled funding on the site in 1993. The cancellation of this project led to a poor economy and high unemployment in the area. Today, some buildings remain on the site including what was to be a reactor, the accompanying turbine building, and a circular base for the plant's cooling tower. The site is close to the tripoint of Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, on a peninsula surrounded by Pickwick Lake. The site's namesake creek, whose original outlet comprised the western arm of the lake, was almost completely captured by the lake or channelized into the uppermost reach of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway by the time plant construction ceased.

The term is also used where the tunnels are built in response to a siege.  Europe  =Bosnia = Sarajevo Tunnel The Sarajevo Tunnel operated during the Siege of Sarajevo as a passage underneath the no-man's land of the city's (closed) airport, providing a vital smuggling link for the beleaguered city residents. Guns were smuggled into the city and people were smuggled out. After the Bosnian War, the Sarajevo Tunnel Museum was built onto the historic private house whose cellar served as the entrance to Sarajevo Tunnel. ;In popular culture *It features in the British film Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). *A similar tunnel in an unknown city, probably Belgrade, features in a dark Serbian satire of conflict, Underground (1995). = Germany = More than 70 tunnels were used to smuggle people under the Berlin Wall between West Germany and East Germany. = Ukraine–Slovakia = A 700-meter smuggling tunnel with a narrow gauge railway was revealed in July 2012 between Uzhgorod, Ukraine, and Vyšné Nemecké, Slovakia, at the border of Schengen Area. The tunnel used professional mining and security technologies. It was used primarily for smuggling of cigarettes. =United Kingdom= Many villages on the southern coast of England have a local legend of a smugglers' tunnel, although the entrances to most of the actual smugglers' tunnels have been lost or bricked up. Some tunnel stories turn out to be plausible, such as the tunnel at Hayle in Cornwall, which seems to have been built specifically for smuggling. However, tunnels often double as a storm drain or some other functional channel, or else as an extension of a natural fissure in the rock as at Methleigh and Porthcothan, but tunnels and caches (both wholly excavated and formed by extending natural formations) are more commonplace where covert landings in areas with few sheltered beaches exposed smugglers to the attentions of the Revenue Men. While many sites are rudimentary, extensive workings have been found which show evidence of skillful excavation, strongly implying the assistance of tin miners, doubtless the case in the recent example of extensive excavations discovered in 2008 when builders renovating a waterfront warehouse in Penzance took up hatch covers and found several tunnels, one extending some 300 yards and emerging into the cellar of an 18th-century public house after passing beneath several roads. Beith in North Ayrshire was a notorious haunt of smugglers at one time, and legend has it that a tunnel ran from the town centre down to Kilbirnie Loch.  Middle East =Gaza Strip = Smuggling tunnel in Rafah, Gaza Strip (2009) The Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels connect Egypt and the Gaza Strip, bypassing the Egypt–Gaza barrier built by Israel along the international border established by the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The tunnels pass under the Philadelphi corridor, an area specified in the Oslo accords as being under Israeli military control, in order to secure the border with Egypt.  North America = US–Canada = In early 2005, a group of Canadian drug smugglers took up the idea, and constructed a tunnel between a greenhouse in Langley, British Columbia and the basement of a house in Lynden, Washington, which lay across the ditch marking the Canada–US border (the house on the Langley side was on 0 Avenue (\\"Zero Avenue\\"), which runs parallel to the border (and is the baseline of Langley's avenue-numbering system). They bought the two properties and began construction work. Authorities were alerted when a neighbor noticed the large-scale construction work being undertaken in the greenhouse. Inspection revealed that tons of construction material were entering, and piles of earth were coming out. It became known within a short time, by both American and Canadian border authorities, that a tunnel was being built. Video and audio devices were installed secretly by United States customs officials both at the termini and in the tunnel itself. On July 14, the tunnel having been completed, the first packs of marijuana began going through. Officials raided the home soon afterward and arrested the three men, who then appeared before court in Seattle. The tunnel was sealed and the roads above it were rebuilt, but the US house where the tunnel exited still exists. =US–Mexico= Route of a Sinaloa Cartel drug tunnel under the US/Mexico border As of September 30, 2015, 183 illicit cross-border tunnels have been discovered in the United States since Fiscal Year 1990. On January 25, 2006, a tunnel was found on the US-Mexico border by a joint US Drug Enforcement Administration, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Border Patrol task force. The long tunnel runs from a warehouse near the Tijuana airport to a warehouse in San Diego. When discovered, it was devoid of people, but it did contain of marijuana. It was high and up to deep. The floor was made of cement, and the walls were exposed clay, with lights lining one side, a ventilation system to keep fresh air circulating, and a water drainage system to remove infiltrating ground water. Authorities said it was unclear how long the tunnel had been in operation. On January 30, US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a Mexican citizen who was linked to the tunnel via the US warehouse, operated by V&F; Distributors LLC. On the Friday before, January 27, immigration authorities reportedly received information that the Mexican cartel behind the operation was threatening the lives of any agents involved with the construction or occupation of the tunnel. US Customs and Immigration, however, pledged to protect them as best they could. Authorities believe Tijuana's Arellano-Felix drug syndicate, or some other well-known drug cartel, was behind the building and operation of the tunnel. On November 26, 2010, a tunnel was discovered linking Tijuana to Otay Mesa, San Diego, California. In the same month another tunnel was discovered between these two cities. Both tunnels were discovered by a San Diego task force and are believed to be the work of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. Over of cannabis was found and confiscated between the two. An analysis of US-Mexico smuggling tunnels, the US-Canada smuggling tunnel, and the smuggling tunnels in Rafah, Gaza Strip, was completed by Lichtenwald and Perri as part of a transnational analysis of smuggling tunnels. Lichtenwald and Perri outlined sources and methods for evaluating which tunnels are used by different populations in various parts of the world to smuggle contraband that does not threaten a nation’s security, which tunnels that smuggle contraband that does threaten a nation’s security, and hybrid tunnels that smuggle contraband that threaten a nation’s security as well as that which does not. In December 2012, a tunnel 3 feet in diameter and 100 yards long, with electricity and ventilation, was found near the Nogales, Arizona, port of entry. Since 1990, there have been almost 170 tunnels found leading into Mexico, mostly in Arizona and California. On February 14, 2014 another underground drug tunnel was discovered in Nogales. The tunnel spanned , or longer than 1.5 American football fields. The tunnel was being used to smuggle marijuana and other drugs into the US. Another of marijuana was seized after federal agents stopped a vehicle they saw driving away from the residence. Some of marijuana and of heroin were found inside the tunnel. Three people have been arrested in connection with the bust. On March 19th, 2020, a tunnel connecting Tijuana to San Diego was discovered by the San Diego Tunnel Task Force. The tunnel extended 2,000 feet (610 m) and was outfitted with an underground rail system, ventilation, and lighting. Over 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of cocaine, 86 pounds (39 kilograms) of methamphetamine, 17 pounds (7.7 kilograms) of heroin, 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of marijuana and 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms) of fentanyl were seized.

Physical findings typically include follicular atrophoderma, multiple basal cell carcinomas, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis.Bolognia, J (2008) \\"Dermatology,\\" Mosby, .  Genetics  BCDS is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder. Males are normally hemizygous for the X chromosome, having only one copy. As a result, X-linked dominant disorders usually show higher expressivity in males than females. As the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes (the other being the Y chromosome), X-linked inheritance is determined by the gender of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex. This is because, typically, females have two copies of the X-chromosome, while males have only one copy. The difference between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X-linked disorder from their parentage.A locus of Xq24-q27 has been described.

The bays are articulated by slender buttresses with crocketed finials above the castellated parapet. Each bay on both stages contains a tall two-light mullioned-and- transomed window with tracery. The lights to the top are filled with pierced stonework; those to the base are solid. The stair turret has string courses coinciding with those on the tower, and a spirelet with a weathervane. Organ The pipe organ has two manuals and pedals, with 19 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. Bells The tower contains a peal of 8 bells. It contains a ring of 8 bells, with the 4th and 6th of the ring dating from 1611 and 1614 respectively (cast by George Purdue), the 5th dating from 1732 cast by Thomas I. Bilbie, and the tenor from 1790 cast by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family.

It was created in 1929 as one of the enterprises of the Literary Guild, which was an adult book club created in 1927 by Samuel W. Craig and Harold K. Guinzburg. Book clubs often marketed books to libraries as well, and by the 1950s the majority of the Junior Literary Guild's sales were to libraries. In 1988, the name was changed to the Junior Library Guild to reflect this change in the company's business. The Junior Library Guild is operated by Media Source Inc., which is based in Plain City, Ohio. Company information derived from a Hoover's, Inc. profile. The editorial department is in New York City. Selection of works Selection of a children's book by the editors of the Junior Literary Guild (or latterly the Junior Library Guild) is a distinction used for publicity by publishers and authors of children's books. At present, 492 books are selected each year. The position of editor-in-chief of the Junior Literary Guild has been held by only a few individuals over the years. Carl Van Doren was the first editor. He was followed by Helen Ferris, who served from August 1929 until 1960. Ferris was a close associate of Eleanor Roosevelt, who served on the editorial board of the Junior Literary Guild from 1929 through her death in 1962. Roosevelt's involvement in the Guild was fairly active; for example, in a My Day column from 1938 she wrote, \\"One of the stories I thought interesting about these books was the fact related by the postmaster in a mining town — that two miners' families had often gone without food, but had never cancelled their subscriptions to the Junior Literary Guild books\\". Ann Durell served until 1962, Thérèse Doumenjou served until 1970, and Marjorie Jones served until 1994, which included the transition from the Junior Literary Guild to the Junior Library Guild. Susan Marston is the current editorial director. =2004 selection= In 2004 the Junior Library Guild posted a webpage indicating four classics of children's literature that had been Junior Literary Guild selections.

TLR11 belongs to the toll-like receptor (TLR) family and the interleukin-1 receptor/toll-like receptor superfamily. In mice, TLR11 has been shown to recognise flagellin and/or profilin present on certain microbes, it helps propagate a host immune response. TLR11 plays a fundamental role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses, through the activation of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the Interleukin 12 (IL-12) response, and Interferon-gamma (IFN- gamma) secretion. TLR11 mounts an immune response to multiple microbes, including Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), Salmonella species, and uropathogenic E. coli, and likely many other species due to the highly conserved nature of flagellin and profilin. Leucine-rich repeat Structure and localization Proteins in the TLR family are pattern recognition receptors whose task is to alert the immune system of foreign invaders. These foreign invaders may be bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Every TLR has three domains that compose its overall structure: a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region, a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The LRR region of TLR11 interacts with the T. gondii profilin and uropathogenic E. coli. It is localized to the endosomal compartment of the cell with the LRR region facing into the endosome. The domain mounts TLR11 to the endosomal membrane and connects the LRR region to the TIR domain. Lastly, the TIR domain resides on the cytosolic side of the cell. Its job is to initiate a signal that will activate the Toll pathway in the cell. The ultimate end of the Toll pathway is the expression of genes by the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 that initiate an immune response to the pathogen. TLR11 is expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, and liver, kidney, and bladder epithelial cells.  Function  Many mammals, including humans, have the TLR11 gene. But only some species’ TLR11 can successfully code for the functional protein that is able to play an active role in the innate immune response. Human TLR11 contains stop codons, meaning functional TLR11 protein is not found in humans. All the collective knowledge about the function and immunopathology of TLR11 has come from experiments in other animals, often mice. Experiments on mouse TLR11 both in vivo and in vitro have revealed much about the biological role of TLR11. TLR11 has a primary role as a \\"sentinel\\" for the innate immune system. Like all TLRs, TLR11 distinguishes between self molecules and non-self molecules. When an infection of T. gondii or uropathogenic E. coli reaches a host cell expressing TLR11 on its surface, the LRR region binds to the pathogen and activates the Toll pathway through the TIR domain. The transcription factor NF-kappa B at the end of the pathway transcribes pro- inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-12) and chemokines. Activation of the Toll pathway also results in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells, which then go on to activate naïve CD4 cells in the lymph nodes. Toxoplasma gondii TLR11 and T. gondii T. gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that can cause infection in humans. The parasite can live in many mammals and birds, but it carries out the sexual part of its lifecycle in cats. Feline feces from infected cats or undercooked meat from infected livestock contain T. gondii oocysts. Ingesting these could lead to Toxoplasmosis, a disease which at its worst can cause encephalitis or miscarriage as the disease is passed from mother to fetus. T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites rely on actin-dependent gliding motility in order to gain access to the body. This form of cellular motion requires profilin, an actin filament binding protein that helps restructure the actin cytoskeleton. Without profilin, T. gondii can still grow and replicate, but it loses the ability to pass through cell layers and biological barriers in order to carry out infection. Thus profilin is a conserved, essential protein for T. gondii infection efficacy. Profilin from T. gondii is a critical parasite ligand for TLR11. It preferentially induces IL-12 production in dendritic cells that communicate with natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells. In one study, mice bred to not express TLR11 (knock-out mice) did not mount the IL-12 response upon profilin stimulation. Dendritic cells in the knock-out mice also failed to migrate to lymph nodes, halting the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Furthermore, mice lacking the TLR11 gene are susceptible to pancreatitis, fat cell necrosis, and increased inflammatory reactants. Pancreatitis is also a pathological response in humans to T. gondii infection. Wild-type mice are able to produce an immune response, marked by IL-12 and IFN-gamma production that is unseen in humans, who lack a functional TLR11 protein. TLR11 and uropathogenic E. coli Uropathogenic E. coli is a bacterium that causes urinary tract infections. The infection begins with colonization in the urethra. The infection typically ascends and can reside primarily in the bladder or the kidneys, though the latter is more threatening due to the possibility of transmission of pathogens to the bloodstream. TLR11 is expressed in mouse kidney and bladder epithelial cells, the cells that line the urinary tract and protect the underlying tissue. In another study of TLR11 in mice, exposure of human uropathogenic E. coli bacteria to mouse cells expressing TLR11 resulted in NF-kappa B activation. While the bladders from both wild-type and knockout mice were almost equally infected, the kidneys of the mice without TLR11 had 10,000 times more bacteria and showed a greater inflammatory response than the normal mouse kidneys. TLR11 appears to recognize a pattern on uropathogenic E. coli and can prevent ascending infection. It is important to note that mice as a species do not grapple with urinary tract infections like humans do unless some part of their TLR11 immune response is made non-functional. With functional TLR11, humans might not succumb to urinary tract infections so readily.

Credit: Wellcome Library John Booker (1603–1667) was an English astrologer, respected in that career for over 30 years. In the 1640s he was appointed licenser of mathematical publications, and so in effect a censor of astrological works, for the Stationers' Company.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1973), p. 363. Life He was born at Manchester 23 March 1601 OS (equals April 3, 1601); his nativity is among the Ashmolean manuscripts. He was apprenticed to a haberdasher in London, taught writing at Hadley School in Middlesex, and clerk to two city magistrates. The first number of his almanac, the Telescopium Uranium, was published in 1631. He obtained a reputation from a prediction of the deaths of Gustavus Adolphus and Frederick V, Elector Palatine, founded on a solar eclipse. In 1640 William Lilly thought highly of him, but they quarrelled over Booker's actions as licenser. Booker also engaged in violent controversy with Sir George Wharton. In 1648 Booker and Lilly were required to come to the siege of Colchester to encourage the Parliamentarian troops with predictions.http://www.skyscript.co.uk/lilly.html At the Restoration he petitioned for leave to continue the publication of his almanac. He died on 8 April 1667, after three years' suffering from dysentery. Elias Ashmole bought his books and papers. Works His Bloody Irish Almanack contains historical material on the Irish rebellion, and he is the author of Tractatus Paschalis, or a Discourse concerning the Holy Feast of Easter (1664).

His senior playing career, which was delayed by the Second World War, had its high point at Dundee, where he won two Scottish League Cup winners' medals in consecutive years. Flavell won two caps for the Scotland national football team, both in 1947. He later became a manager of Ayr United, St Mirren and Albion Rovers. Playing career Flavell was born in Annathill, North Lanarkshire in 1921. He joined the senior game by signing for Airdrie in 1937 as a teenager, but only played two seasons before the war broke out; he had to wait until the 1946–47 season to make another league appearance. During the conflict, Flavell had made guest appearances for both Arsenal and Tottenham. When the Scottish Football League resumed in 1946, Flavell scored over a goal per game for Airdrie and won his two caps for Scotland, which convinced Heart of Midlothian to pay £10,000 to acquire his services. He again scored frequently at Hearts, but he became a football outcast on 12 June 1949 by signing for Millonarios, of the breakaway Colombian league, a move that Hearts manager Dave McLean said meant he would \\"never play for Hearts again\\". Flavell played alongside the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano in Bogota, but at the end of the Colombian season returned to Scotland in December 1950; he was punished heavily for his actions in going to Colombia, attracting far stronger sanctions than English players who had made a similar move. He was fined £150 – then a record fine for a Scottish player – and suspended from playing until May 1951. He was transfer-listed by Hearts in February 1951, before signing for Dundee in April, making his debut for the club in a Dewar Shield game against St Johnstone on 5 May 1951. Flavell scored goals in both the 1951 and 1952 Scottish League Cup Finals, which helped Dundee win the cup in successive years. He also played in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final, which ended in a 4–0 defeat by Motherwell. He also played for Kilmarnock and St Mirren before retiring as a player. Coaching career Flavell had five stints as a manager at three clubs, starting with Ayr United in 1961. He quickly moved to St Mirren, whom he guided to the 1962 Scottish Cup Final. He briefly returned to Ayr, before having two spells at Albion Rovers. Flavell later became a director of Albion Rovers.
