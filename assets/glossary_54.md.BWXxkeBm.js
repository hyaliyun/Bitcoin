The EU is a global player; it pursues a specific foreign policy philosophy which one could term ‚Äúeffective multilateralism‚Äù; and, thanks to its specific nature, the EU disposes of a wide range of foreign policy instruments which are particularly suited to respond to today's challenges. In his first Commission, President Barroso established a Group of Commissioners, chaired by him, and in charge of six external relations services. Prior to its abolition, there were four external relations posts; *Benita Ferrero-Waldner was deputy chair of the Group of External Relations Commissioners, and responsible for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy. She was responsible for two Commission Directorate-Generals: External Relations (Relex) and the EuropeAid Co-operation Office (Aidco). *Catherine Ashton was responsible for External Trade. The Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission is in charge of implementing the external trade policy of the European Union.

A closely related goal is enhancing the effectiveness of the Union's development assistance. He was responsible for two Directorate-Generals: the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) and Development. *Olli Rehn was responsible for Enlargement.

History The kibbutz was established in 1943 by members of the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed youth group, and other young immigrants from Germany and Poland. At one point the kibbutz was renamed Ramim (, lit. Tall ones) in an attempt to replace its Arabic name (Manara derives from Minaret) with a Hebrew one. However, the new name failed to take hold amongst local residents. The kibbutz then came to a settlement with the government whereby the name Menara, with an accent on the last syllable (a Hebraicized form of Manara, accented on the second syllable) would be made official. In June, 1948, the kibbutz requested land from the newly depopulated Palestinian village of Qadas, as it was \\"suitable for winter crops.\\" Leon Uris visited the kibbutz while researching his novel, Exodus.

They were contemporaries of The Beatles, and later had the same manager, Brian Epstein. Its members were Colin Manley (born Colin William Manley, 16 April 1942, in Old Swan, Liverpool, Lancashire died 9 April 1999) (lead guitar/vocals), Phil Rogers (rhythm guitar/bass guitar/vocals) (born Philip Rogers, March 1942, in Liverpool, died 14 January 2020), Don Andrew (born Donald Andrew, in 1942, in Liverpool) (bass guitar/vocals), and Roy Dyke (drums) (born 13 February 1945, in Liverpool). Andrew and Manley were in the same class at school (Liverpool Institute for Boys) as Paul McCartney.Spencer Leigh, BBC presenter, in sleeve notes to SEECD349 (see Discography) Career Manley and Andrew formed the Remo Quartet in 1958, with singer/guitarist Keith Stokes (born in 1942) and drummer Harry Prytherch (born 4 August 1941, Liverpool d. 13 October 2015). They progressed from playing local parties and contests to regular hall appearances, and turned professional, changing their name to the Remo Four in summer 1959. They played a mix of vocal harmony material (√† la The Everly Brothers), and instrumental numbers in the manner of The Shadows, The Ventures, and Chet Atkins. The Remo Four were voted Number Three Group in a 1961 Mersey Beat poll, and among their fans were The Beatles, fresh from a season in Hamburg, Germany. Both groups were among the regulars at the Cavern Club during 1961 and 1962, and both shared the bill with Gerry & The Pacemakers, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, and Ted \\"Kingsize\\" Taylor and the Dominoes, at the 1961 \\"Operation Big Beat\\", a festival at New Brighton's Tower Ballroom.Beatles full discography, complete song index, lyrics, history, pictures, links, forum, chat While The Beatles travelled back and forth to Hamburg, the Remo Four began playing American Air Force bases in France, building their stage and musical experience. A highlight of their early career was sharing the stage with the Shadows, in the latter's only Cavern Club appearance. Johnny Sandon joined the band as vocalist in 1962, and stayed for two years. Johnny Sandon & The Remo Four publicity photo, circa 1963 In early 1963, Prytherch decided to get married and find a regular job, and Roy Dyke took his place in the band. That year the band signed up with Epstein's NEMS Enterprises and acquired a new lead singer, Tommy Quickly, and a recording contract with Piccadilly Records, backing Quickly on Lennon and McCartney's \\"Tip of My Tongue\\" and other songs. The band also released instrumentals, including a driving rendition of Henry Mancini's Peter Gunn theme. In a significant line-up change,Tony Ashton (keyboards/vocals) replaced Don Andrew, with Rogers moving to bass. Another NEMS artist, Billy J. Kramer, became a frontman for the band, which adopted the name \\"The New Dakotas\\" while backing him. Despite their talent and track record, the band's success in the record market was limited, and most of their work came as backing musicians, or as the house band in German clubs, including the Star-Club in Hamburg. They released an album, Smile!, on the Star-Club's own label in 1967, featuring elements of rock and jazz. Late in 1967, Beatle George Harrison hired the Remo Four as his backing band for part of his first solo project, the soundtrack album to the movie Wonderwall. While the songs were mostly instrumentals, they did record one lyrical song, \\"In the First Place\\", with Harrison, which was left in the can until the 1990s. (Ashton, Gardner and Dyke later reworked the song and recorded it as \\"As It Was in the First Place\\".) They also became Billy Fury's backing band, in the late 1960s. Disbanding in 1970, Ashton and Dyke joined guitarist Kim Gardner, formerly of The Creation and The Birds (not to be confused with California rock band The Byrds),Remo 4 Biography - Barnes & Noble.com to form Ashton, Gardner & Dyke, who later recorded a song called \\"Ballad of the Remo Four\\". Ashton later formed Paice Ashton Lord with members of Deep Purple. Manley became an accompanist for singers including Engelbert Humperdinck, and later joined The Swinging Blue Jeans. Don Andrew and Colin Manley appeared with Gerry Marsden (of Gerry & The Pacemakers fame) performing on stage in an episode of the UK TV soap \\"Brookside\\" in the 1990s. Manley died of cancer on 9 April 1999, and a memorial concert was held for him that June, with some of his former bandmates performing. Ashton also died of cancer, on 28 May 2001. Keith Stokes died on 19 June 2010, cause unknown. He was living in Wallasey and friends and relatives had been trying to trace him for 15 years, without success.

Laurie first appeared in John Carpenter's original 1978 film, portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis, who reprised the role in three sequels. She is also the main protagonist in Rob Zombie's 2007 remake and its 2009 sequel, portrayed by Scout Taylor-Compton. In September 2017, it was announced that Curtis signed on to reprise her role in Halloween, which was released in October 2018. The film reboots most of the series and serves as a direct sequel to the original film. Strode also has a lead role in the Halloween expanded universe, appearing in the novelizations and merchandise based on the films. In 2016, Strode was released alongside Michael Myers as one of the playable characters in the asymmetric survival horror online multiplayer video game Dead by Daylight (2016) in which she is voiced by Catherine Lecours. Her attire is based on the outfit she wore during the final scenes of the original Halloween (1978), while her facial features are based on her comic book incarnation. In academic materials, Strode is widely cited as one of the earliest and most influential examples of the \\"final girl\\" slasher film archetype. Appearances=Films1978= Laurie Strode first appears in the original Halloween (1978). The 17-year-old Laurie (Curtis) is a high school student who has plans to babysit Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) on Halloween night, 1978. However, throughout the day, she keeps seeing a mysterious masked man watching her wherever she goes; unbeknownst to her, he is Michael Myers (Nick Castle), an escaped mental patient who murdered his sister, Judith Myers (Sandy Johnson), 15 years before and has begun stalking her. Laurie notices Michael watching her and becomes increasingly worried, though her best friends Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (P. J. Soles) brush off her concerns. As Laurie babysits Tommy, Myers kills Annie and Lynda in the house across the street. Growing concerned when they fail to call her, Laurie goes to investigate and sees their corpses laid out for her to find, before being attacked by Michael. Barely escaping, Laurie races back to the Doyle house. Michael follows, but Laurie manages to fend him off long enough for Tommy and Lindsey to escape. Laurie is saved by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Michael's psychiatrist, who shoots him off the balcony; when Loomis goes to check Michael's body, he finds it missing. An unsurprised Loomis stares off into the night, while Laurie begins sobbing in terror. =1981‚Äì2002= Halloween II (1981) picks up directly after the first film, with Laurie Strode being taken to a hospital. Upon learning who attacked her, Laurie asks \\"Why me?!\\" Laurie says she does know that she was adopted and has a few dreams that offer vague insights into her birth family. The first dream she has is of when she was a little girl, with her adoptive mother saying with a tone of annoyance \\"I'm not your real mother! Stop asking me questions!\\" The second dream shows her walking into a large room where a pre-teen Michael is seen sitting in a chair and turning to look at her. Waking up, she begins to roam the hallways of the hospital until coming face to face with Michael, who has been killing his way through the hospital staff in search of her. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is told that Michael and Judith Myers are actually Laurie's biological siblings; she was put up for adoption after the death of their parents, with the records sealed to protect the family. With the realization that Michael is after Laurie, Loomis rushes to the hospital to find them. Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, blinding him, and Loomis causes an explosion in the operating theater, allowing Laurie to escape. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room before finally collapsing. The traumatized Laurie is last seen being transferred to another hospital. In Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), Laurie is revealed to have died in a car accident prior to the film's events, with the role of protagonist taken up by her young daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). A photograph of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie appears in a scene where Jamie remembers her mother. The character of Jamie would go on to reappear in two more Halloween sequels, while Laurie's adopted cousin Kara (Marianne Hagan) and her family appear in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995). Curtis returned as Laurie Strode in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), the seventh film in the series. The screenplay was based on a story by Kevin Williamson. The story was conceived as a sequel to the sixth film, thereby keeping the timeline's continuity, but producers ultimately decided to go with a reboot and ignore the previous three films. In this timeline, Laurie faked her death in a car accident as a way of escaping her murderous brother, whose body was not found after Halloween II. She is now living under the name Keri Tate, and works as the headmistress of a California private school, where her teenage son John (Josh Hartnett) is a student. Laurie, who by now has become an alcoholic, is still haunted by memories of her brother's rampage, and lives in fear that he will return. Although John dismisses her as paranoid, her fears become reality when Michael (Chris Durand) resurfaces on Halloween and murders two of John's classmates. After getting her son and his girlfriend to safety, Laurie decides to stop running and face her brother. She stops Michael, but, unconvinced that he is truly dead, goes on to steal his body and decapitate him. In Halloween: Resurrection (2002), it is revealed that the man Laurie killed was a paramedic with whom Michael (Brad Loree) had swapped clothes. The guilt-ridden Laurie is now an inmate at the Grace Andersen Sanitarium, where the nurses believe her to be catatonic. Instead, she is preparing for Michael to return, and when he does, she lures him on to the institution's rooftop. Although he falls into her trap, Laurie's fears of again killing the wrong person get the better of her; when she tries to remove his mask, Michael stabs her and throws her off the roof, to her death. =2007‚Äì2009= A new version of Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) appears in the Rob Zombie remake (2007). This film establishes from the beginning that Laurie is Michael's baby sister, nicknamed \\"Boo\\", with whom young Michael (Daeg Faerch) shares a close bond. When Michael is institutionalized for killing their older sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall), their mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is unable to cope and commits suicide. The infant Laurie is discovered by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif), who omits her from the records for her own protection, and she is eventually adopted by the Strode family. The adult Michael (Tyler Mane) escapes and comes home in search of his sister, killing her adoptive parents and her friend Lynda (Kristina Klebe) before kidnapping Laurie. Michael tries to make Laurie remember him by showing her a picture of them as children. This fails, and Laurie proceeds to stab Michael with his own knife. Laurie hides as Michael hunts her down in their old childhood home; when he finds her, she shoots him in the head with a gun she took from Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), after which she begins screaming hysterically as the scene fades to an old home video of young Michael and baby Laurie. In the sequel (2009), Laurie has moved in with Sheriff Brackett and his daughter Annie (Danielle Harris). She suffers recurring nightmares about Michael and their mother, and is seeing a therapist to deal with the trauma. Loomis later tells her that she is Michael's sister, and that she also suffers from his \\"illness\\". In the film's climax, she tells a mortally wounded Michael that she loves him, before stabbing him to death and putting on his mask. In the film's final scene, she sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of her mother. In the director's cut of the film, Laurie picks up Michael's knife after Michael is killed and walks over to an injured and unconscious Loomis, and the police open fire on Laurie, apparently killing her too. =2018‚Äì2021= Although Laurie supposedly died in Halloween: Resurrection, Curtis reprised the role in Halloween (2018), which ignores the previous sequels in the franchise and serves as a direct sequel to the 1978 film. Consequently, Michael and Laurie are no longer related in this continuity since that revelation does not exist without the 1981 sequel.http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/06/08/halloween-sequel-michael-myers- brother-update/ This film establishes that Michael (James Jude Courtney) was arrested following his killing spree in 1978, and institutionalized for 40 years in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Similar to Halloween H20, Laurie suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of Michael's rampage, and has prepared for Michael's potential return through combat training; she has been divorced twice, became an alcoholic, and lost custody of her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer). Michael eventually escapes again and returns to Haddonfield for another killing spree. Michael is taken to Laurie's home by his deranged psychologist and engages in a showdown with Laurie, who severely injures him and severs two of his fingers, but he stabs her in the stomach and pushes her over a balcony; when Michael goes to check Laurie's body, he finds it missing, before being attacked by a very much alive Laurie. Trapping him inside the basement safe room, Laurie, Karen and Allyson set the house ablaze, and the trio escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck. Literature Laurie Strode's first literary appearance was in October 1979, in Curtis Richards' novelization of Halloween, which largely follows the events of the film. She also appeared in the 1981 adaptation of Halloween II written by Jack Martin; it was published alongside the first film sequel, with the novel following the film events, with an additional victim, a reporter, added to the novel. Laurie appears in the twist ending of the comic book Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. While examining Loomis' diaries in the hopes of finding out more about Michael Myers, an adult Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace are attacked by a person dressed as Michael. They unmask the figure to reveal Laurie Strode, who has taken on her brother's mantle. At the conclusion of the book, Laurie kills Tommy (losing an eye in the process) and is subsequently incarcerated in Smith's Grove, where Dr. Terence Wynn takes an interest in her. This story follows on from Halloween H20, but is set in a non-canon timeline contradicted by the release of Halloween: Resurrection. The anthology one-shot comic Halloween: 30 Years of Terror includes a Laurie Strode storyline entitled \\"Visiting Hours\\". Set between H20 and Resurrection, it shows Laurie in the Grace Anderson Sanitarium, where she wonders how her life could have been if Michael hadn't found her in 1978. In this alternate universe, she lives a happy life in which her friends are still alive, but the memory of Michael invades her fantasy world and leaves her with nothing. Laurie concludes that \\"I can't even dream of a normal life without [Michael] killing it\\", and can do nothing but wait for her brother's inevitable \\"visit\\" to set her free. Laurie appears prominently in the comic book limited series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode; set after Halloween II, it depicts the events which led to her faking her death. Video games Strode made her video game debut with the 1983 Atari video game Halloween. The game is rare to find, often being played on emulators. No characters from the films are specifically named, with the goal of the game focusing on the player, who is a babysitter, protecting children from a \\"homicidal maniac [who] has escaped from a mental institution\\". Laurie Strode was added as a playable character, alongside Michael Myers, in downloadable content for Dead by Daylight released in October 2016. Her biography states: :\\"You never know what really matters in life until you‚Äôve realized it might end soon. Laurie is one of those who just wants a quiet life in the suburbs, hanging out with friends, family and maybe go on a date or two. Laurie is a typical teenager. You could pass her on the street and not think twice. She does her homework and is liked by her friends, teachers and family. A simple night of babysitting turns into something that will forever change the course of her young life. A knife swooshing through the air. Screams from afar. Noises that play tricks with her mind. But not Laurie, she‚Äôs made of something stronger. Something that won‚Äôt give up.\\" Casting In an interview, Carpenter admits that \\"Jamie Lee wasn't the first choice for Laurie. I had no idea who she was. She was 19 and in a TV show at the time, but I didn't watch TV.\\" He originally wanted to cast Anne Lockhart, the daughter of June Lockhart from Lassie, as Laurie Strode. Lockhart, however, had commitments to several other film and television projects.John Carpenter, Entertainment Weekly interview, quoted at HalloweenMovies.com ; last accessed April 19, 2006. Debra Hill says upon learning that Curtis was the daughter of Psycho star Janet Leigh, \\"I knew casting Jamie Lee would be great publicity for the film because her mother was in Psycho.\\"Debra Hill, Fangoria interview, quoted at HalloweenMovies.com ; last accessed April 19, 2006. Reception Laurie has been compared to the character of Sally Hardesty from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre by a variety of scholars. James Rose notes the parallels between Laurie and Sally, stating: :\\"...for as much as both survive, each, in the end, requires male intervention to fully save them from the narrative's male antagonist: Sally is rescued by a passing driver, while Laurie is saved by Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Despite this, both Sally and Laurie combine to make manifest the key attributes of the Final Girl as both struggled, endured and, in Laurie's case, attacked their aggressor until they could escape and be saved. In the slasher films that followed in the wake of Chain Saw and Halloween, the Final Girl steadily gains in strength until she herself vanquishes the male antagonist.\\" Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Curtis' performance as Laurie to the performances of Sandra Peabody as Mari Collingwood in The Last House on the Left (1972) and Marilyn Burns as Sally in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).

Cleverley played domestic first-class cricket for Auckland over 21 seasons, from 1930/31 to 1951/52, before playing a final season in 1952‚Äì53 for Central Districts. He also played for Piako against the touring MCC side in February 1936, and for Taranaki against Nelson in the Hawke Cup in December 1952. International career He played two Tests for the New Zealand cricket team, 14 years apart, but failed to take a wicket in either match. He first played in New Zealand's inaugural Test match against South Africa, at Christchurch in February 1932. Cleverley bowled 22 overs without success, and scored 10* and 7 with the bat, and New Zealand were beaten by an innings and 12 runs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62603.html He also played in the notorious one-off Test against Australia at Wellington in March 1946, New Zealand's first Test against Australia. Electing to bat first on a rain- affected pitch, New Zealand were bowled out for 42 inside two hours on the first morning. Australia scored runs as the pitch dried out, and ended the day at 149‚Äì3, but lost quick wickets after they resumed on a damp wicket the next morning and declared on 199‚Äì8. This was more than sufficient, and New Zealand were bowled out for 54 inside another two hours, to lose by an innings and 103 runs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62661.html Cleverley bowled 15 overs without taking a wicket, and was the not-out batsman on one run in each innings. After this debacle, which highlighted the gap in quality between the sides, Australia and New Zealand did not play against each other in Test cricket until 1973.Beating up your neighbour, ESPNcricinfo, 16 June 2007 Trivia On the death of M.

He moved to Australia in 2012 to play in that country's domestic leagues, and in 2016 became an Australian citizen. In January 2019, he retired from all forms of the game. Born in Johannesburg, Botha represented the South African under-19s at the 2000 Under-19 World Cup, and made his first-class debut for Eastern Province later in the year, aged 18. An all-rounder who bats right-handed and bowls right-arm off-spin, he made his international debut in November 2005, in a One Day International (ODI) against India. Botha's Test debut came in January 2006, against Australia, although at the end of the match he was reported for an illegal bowling action (an issue that arose on several more occasions). He would play only five Test matches in total during his career, the last of which came in 2010. Botha had much greater success in the limited-overs formats, representing South Africa at the 2009 World Twenty20, the 2009 Champions Trophy, the 2010 World Twenty20, the 2011 World Cup, and the 2012 World Twenty20. He captained the team for periods at both ODI and Twenty20 International level, generally in the absence of more senior players. Botha retired from international cricket after the 2012 World Twenty20, signing a contract to captain South Australia in Australian domestic cricket. He currently only plays at Twenty20 level, representing the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. He has also made appearances in the Indian Premier League and the Caribbean Premier League. Early life and career Botha was born in Johannesburg but attended Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, the same school that other notable South African cricketers such as Graeme Pollock attended, and captained a South Africa Schools cricket team. In the early parts of his cricket career he was a medium-pace bowler, but when he was playing cricket for the Warriors, future South African coach Mickey Arthur suggested that he should switch bowling style to off break, which Botha then bowled for the rest of his professional career. Once he had made the switch he also focused on learning to bowl a doosra, a ball which turns in the opposite direction to a normal off break. A year after changing bowling styles, Botha went travelled with South Africa A, South Africa's second XI team, to Sri Lanka. He took key wickets and scored runs to put his name up as a potential future Test spinner for South Africa. ODI debut A determined and fiercely competitive individual, Botha found a place in the squad to tour India for a five-match one-day series after Nicky Boje pulled out over security concerns in regard to charges of match fixing. He played in the first match at Hyderabad and produced a spell of 31 runs from six overs with the wicket of Irfan Pathan, bowled through the gate. Both Arthur and Graeme Smith rated him highly enough to see him as a vital part of the side's world cup campaign. Test debut and throwing allegations He made his Test debut against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 2006 during the 2005‚Äì06 tour, and claimed batsman Mike Hussey as his first Test wicket. However, he was reported for throwing the ball at the conclusion of the match.S Africa spinner Botha reported, from BBC Sport, published 6 January 2006 He was allowed to play several games during the 2005‚Äì06 VB Series, but in February, was suspended from bowling following an analysis by bowling expert Bruce Elliott. Spinner Botha banned from bowling, from BBC Sport, published 7 February 2006 He hoped to return to bowling after an examination by the ICC in August 2006, but he was found still to be straightening his arm more than the acceptable 15 degrees.Botha's action declared illegal, from Cricinfo, published 2 September 2006 On 21 November 2006, Johan Botha's action was passed by the International Cricket Council and he was again eligible for selection by the South African national team.Botha's action passed by ICC, from Cricinfo, published 21 November 2006 He made his comeback during the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup and returned to the South African one-day team during the tour of Pakistan in 2007‚Äì08. On 14 April 2009, he was again reported for suspected illegal action. The match officials cited concern over two components of Botha's repertoire, his quicker ball and his doosra, after the completion of fourth ODI against Australia at Port Elizabeth.Botha reported for suspected 'illegal action' , from Cricdb published 14 April 2009 On 12 May 2009 the ICC announced that Botha's doosra ball had been deemed 'illegal' by an independent test and that he would not be allowed to bowl the delivery in international cricket. The same test found his off-break and arm-ball deliveries to be bowled within the permitted tolerance level of 15 degrees of elbow extension. The test was carried out on 30 April by Prof. Bruce Elliott, member of the ICC Panel of Human Movement Specialists, at the School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, University of Western Australia, Perth. The doosra delivery was found to have an extension of 26.7 degrees and no single delivery tested was within the legal limit. Botha was told that he could re-apply for the delivery to be tested again once he had modified it, or appeal the decision within 14 days.Botha bowling in the Adelaide Oval nets, January 2009 However his action was then deemed within the legal limits.  Captaincy of the Protea T20 team  On 20 August 2010 Graeme Smith announced that he was to surrender the captaincy in T20 Internationals but continue playing in the format. Cricket South Africa subsequently handed over the captaincy to his deputy Botha. Botha also took the One-Day International captaincy after the 2011 Cricket World Cup when Smith gave up his ODI captaincy. The deciding factor was that Botha had led South Africa to a series win against Australia earlier in 2010 when Smith was absent with injury.http://www.cricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/473641.html Botha's first match as permanent captain was on 7 October 2010 against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe scored what looked like a competitive 168 however Zimbabwe's bowling attack severely let them down and it was easily chased by the South Africans with seven-wickets and five-overs to spare.  IPL career Johan Botha had played for 2 franchises in the IPL, Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils.

A right-arm, fast bowler and lower order batsman, his selection for the tour was controversial, because of his suspect bowling action ‚Äì some of his deliveries were judged to be thrown rather than bowled. The core of his problem was that, due to a childhood accident, he was unable to fully straighten his right arm. During the 1960 tour he was no- balled for throwing in several matches prior to the Test series, but retained his place in the side nevertheless. In his second Test appearance, at Lord's in June 1960, he became the first South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first cricketer of any nationality to do this at Lord's. In the same match, however, he was no-balled for throwing eleven times, and again in an exhibition match that followed the match's early conclusion. These events ended his international career, and after fruitless attempts to resolve his problem, he retired from cricket in 1963, at the age of 23. Griffin was unfortunate to emerge on the international scene at a time when cricketing authorities were particularly concerned about the growing proliferation of bowlers with dubious actions and were determined to eradicate it. He, along with others, was convinced that he had been made a scapegoat to ensure that certain bowlers would be omitted from the Australian side due to tour England in 1961. After 1960 the throwing controversy largely subsided as an issue in international cricket. Life=Early life and cricket career Griffin was born in Graytown, Natal, on 12 June 1939. He received his education at Durban High School, where he excelled at many sports: cricket, athletics (he held state titles for high jump, triple jump and pole vault), and Rugby football (in which he played for the state's under-19 XV). After leaving school he made his debut for Natal's Cricket XI in the 1957‚Äì58 season, and played regularly in 1958‚Äì59. In 1959‚Äì60 he returned bowling figures for the season of 35 wickets for an average of 12.23, heading the national bowling averages. His figures included 7 wickets for 11 runs in the extraordinary Currie Cup match at East London on 19‚Äì21 December 1959, in which Natal dismissed Border for 16 and 18. These performances were significant, because a Test tour of England was scheduled for 1960, and South Africa were looking for a partner for their star fast bowler Neil Adcock. Griffin was duly selected, at 20 the team's youngest player. These early successes with Natal were, however, marked with a degree of controversy about Griffin's bowling action. As the result of an accident when a schoolboy, he could not fully straighten his right (bowling) arm; he experienced problems with his action while at school, and was twice no-balled for throwing during the 1958‚Äì59 season while bowling for Natal, although he escaped censure in the 1959‚Äì60 season. According to Griffin's Wisden obituarist many years later, his bent arm \\"allied to an open-chested action, with front foot splayed towards gully, made him look more like a baseball pitcher than a conventional bowler\\". John Waite, Griffin's future Test colleague, batting for Transvaal against Natal in 1958‚Äì59, says he informed the umpire that Griffin was throwing. The umpire replied: \\"You concentrate on batting, and leave the umpiring to me.\\" It was Griffin's misfortune that his emergence as a possible Test bowler occurred at a time when the matter of illegal bowling was an issue of considerable and rising concern among cricket's international authorities. Incidents in a recent England tour to Australia had brought the issue to the fore; South Africa were, therefore taking some risk in selecting Griffin. Throwing controversy: background The Laws of Cricket, in their various formulations, had always specified that the ball delivered to the batsman must be bowled, not thrown ‚Äì that is, the bowler's arm must be straight at the point of delivery. This rule had, from time to time, created problems in the game. Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the Australian umpire Jim Phillips no-balled the Australian fast bowler Ernie Jones for throwing; the same umpire ended the career of England's star bowler Arthur Mold by declaring his bowling action illegal. Fifty years later, during South Africa's 1951 tour of England, the umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African quick bowler Cuan McCarthy, but was told by the Lord's authorities to desist: \\"These people are our guests\\". England's Tony Lock was called for throwing during a Test Match in the West Indies, in 1953‚Äì54 (he subsequently remodelled his bowling action). The issue arose again during England's 1958‚Äì59 Australian tour, which was dominated by the suspect actions of four Australian bowlers: Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke; Jack Fingleton, the former Australian batsman, provocatively entitled his account of the series Four Chukkas to Australia. Neither England's captain, Peter May, nor the tour manager, Freddie Brown, raised the issue publicly during the series, but did so afterwards, causing considerable concern to the leading administrators on each side, Gubby Allen and Sir Donald Bradman. The principal issue in these administrators' minds was what would happen if these bowlers were brought to England in 1961, when the Australians were due to visit. They decided that the matter had to be resolved before then, and accordingly they resolved to adopt what they termed a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy during the intervening period, especially with regard to the forthcoming 1960 tour to England by South Africa. South African tour of England, 1960Early matches= Griffin's first match of the 1960 tour was against Derbyshire, on 7‚Äì10 May. During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14‚Äì17 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \\"there was something amiss\\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21‚Äì24 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called. When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken. The immediate step was to send Griffin to the indoor cricket school run by the former England bowler Alf Gover, in Wandsworth. This treatment seemed to help, but at the same time to reduce Griffin's effectiveness. He returned to the side, and was duly selected to play in the First Test, at Birmingham, on 9‚Äì14 June. Langridge was one of the umpires, but the match passed without official incident, Griffin taking two wickets in each of England's innings in a game comprehensively lost by the tourists. However, a week later in Southampton, in the match against Hampshire, Griffin was called again, so his inclusion in the South African side for the Second Test at Lord's, on 23‚Äì27 June, was something of a risk. =Lord's Test, 23‚Äì27 June, and after= At Lord's, England batted first and scored 362. The match provided mixed fortunes for the beleaguered bowler. In the third over of the innings, Griffin was no-balled by umpire Frank Lee, and ten further times by the same umpire, before the innings closed in sensational fashion. In three successive balls, Griffin had Mike Smith caught behind for 99, Peter Walker bowled for 52, and Fred Trueman bowled for 0, to record the first-ever hat-trick in a Test at Lords. South Africa were then twice bowled out cheaply, the match ending with their defeat early on the afternoon of Monday 26 June. Because a visit from the Queen was scheduled for later that afternoon, to fill the available time the teams agreed to play an exhibition match of 20 overs per side. In the exhibition match, despite its informal nature, the umpires Lee and Syd Buller chose to apply the Laws of cricket strictly. Bowling at half-pace from a shortened run, Griffin was no-balled by Buller for throwing on four occasions. When the South African captain, Jackie McGlew, remonstrated, Buller replied: \\"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by\\". Griffin was allowed to finish the over by bowling underarm, but was then pedantically no-balled again by Lee, standing at square leg, for failing to notify him of the change of action. These events provoked both great sympathy for the player and contempt for the authorities. The South African writer Louis Duffus challenged Buller's intransigency concerning the Laws; the exhibition match, he said, was being played outside the \\"strict tenets of play\\", because of the arrangement that every player was required to bowl. McGlew later wrote: \\"My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce.\\" There was general anger that the South African management had exposed Griffin to the Lord's Test, given the high likelihood of an incident; the management's response was to blame the press for stirring up the trouble. =Subsequent matches= The events at Lord's finished Griffin as a bowler on the tour. He remained with the team, and played in a number of subsequent matches as a specialist batsman, generally in the lower order, but on a couple of occasions as an opener. He made a few useful scores, including 65 not out against Lancashire in his next match after the Lord's Test, and 37 in the final match of the tour, against T.N. Pearce's XI at the Scarborough Festival in September. Griffin was praised in The Cricketer magazine for \\"the superb manner in which he has taken [his] misfortune\\". A final attempt to analyse and perhaps correct his bowling action was made in the nets at Lord's, during the tourists' match against Middlesex in mid-July. In front of Bradman and McGlew, he bowled wearing a specially-designed surgical brace on his arm, but the experiment came to nothing. Late career, retirement, later life After the tour, Griffin was approached by a lawyer who offered to bring the issue to court, assuring the bowler that he would win if he brought a case against the authorities, but Griffin declined, not wishing, he said, \\"to sully the great game further\\". He returned to South Africa, and attempted to revive his cricket career there. He moved from Natal to Rhodesia, and played a few times for his new state, but this ended after he was repeatedly no-balled in a match at Salisbury, against North-Eastern Transvaal, in 1962‚Äì63. At the age of 23 he retired from first-class cricket. He continued his involvement with the game at club level and as a coach, while pursuing a new career in hotel management. Griffin died on 16 November 2006 at the age of 67, after collapsing while attending a dinner held at his old school, Durban High. In all first-class cricket he played 42 matches, taking 108 wickets for 2324 runs, averaging 21.51. With the bat he scored 895 runs, av. 17.90, with a highest score of 73. He held 19 catches. In his two Tests he took 8 wickets, averaging 24.00, and scored 25 runs, av. 6.25. Aftermath Not everyone was convinced that Griffin threw rather than bowled the ball. The former England batsman Denis Compton wrote: \\"I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw\\". Against this, the South African commentator Charles Fortune was convinced that Griffin threw, as were his team-mates Waite and Adcock. Fortune questioned the wisdom of the selectors in sending Griffin to England: \\"they chanced their arm\\", he wrote. The England batsman Peter Walker, who played at Lord's, was unequivocal: \\"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike [Smith]'s or my mind that he threw virtually every ball\\". Some believed that Griffin had been deliberately scapegoated, as part of a conspiracy to ensure that Australia's suspect bowlers were excluded from the forthcoming 1961 tour of England. In support of the conspiracy theory the journalist Martin Chandler, in his analysis of the throwing controversy, writes that umpire Lee may have been instructed by Allen, during a rain break in England's innings in the Lord's Test, to take a firmer line against Griffin, who had largely escaped attention in the match at that point in time, but was afterwards called on six occasions in rapid succession. According to Griffin's later account, after the match Bradman came to the tourists' dressing room to offer sympathy, and claimed that Allen had ordered Buller to \\"call Griffin out of the game\\". Griffin asserted: \\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did\\". In the event, none of Australia's suspect quartet was selected for the 1961 tour. Burke retired from Test cricket after the 1958‚Äì59 series; Slater did not add to the one cap he gained during that series, and Rorke's international career had ended by December 1959. Meckiff played on until December 1963, when he was no-balled four times by the umpire Colin Egar during the first Test of a series against South Africa. He then retired from all forms of the game. In cricket generally, the throwing controversy rumbled on in low-key fashion, but did not re-emerge in Tests until 1995, when the Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled for throwing seven times in Melbourne. Analysis through modern technology, however, demonstrated that every bowler, on delivery of the ball, flexed his arm to some extent, and the Laws were changed to reflect this; a 15-degree elbow bend was thenceforth permitted. Had this rule been applied in Griffin's day, it might have saved him.

He also played for Surrey, Berkshire and Griqualand West in a career spanning 1964 to 1988. He later played for Farsley Cricket Club and coached at Ampleforth College and Woodhouse Grove School, and was head groundsman at the latter when he died, aged 60, in 2006. The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, remarked, \\"Graham Roope was one of those cricketers who thrilled spectators and frustrated selectors. Tall and stylish, there was a touch of class about his middle-order batting. He could make the ball swing at medium pace and his slip fielding was what you would expect from a Corinthian Casuals goalkeeper\\". Bateman added \\"as a former selector said: 'He looked the part ‚Äì but never played it'\\". Life and career Roope was born in Fareham, Hampshire. After spending five years developing his cricketing talent at St John's School in Porthcawl, he was educated at Bradfield College in Berkshire, and played for Public Schools against Combined Services at Lord's in 1963 and 1964. He played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire in 1963, before making his county cricket debut for Surrey in 1964. He received his Surrey cap in 1969. He was tall and wiry, with distinctive curly hair. He was an all-rounder: an outstanding slip fielder, often said to be one of the best of his generation, he was also an attacking middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler. He took fifty first-class wickets in 1968, and 5‚Äì14 against the touring West Indians in 1969, but bowled less later in his career. He was a member of the Surrey sides that won the County Championship in 1971; making a major contribution with 1,641 runs and an exceptional 59 catches in all first-class matches; and the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1974. He retired from full-time first-class cricket after the 1982 season, and played his last first-class match in 1986. In a career of 403 first-class matches, he scored 19,116 runs at 36.90, and took 225 wickets at 37.35, as well as holding 599 catches and making two stumpings as a substitute wicket- keeper. He scored over 1,000 runs in a season on eight occasions. Roope was remembered by former teammate Geoff Arnold as \\"having an astounding ability to predict the weather ‚Äì he would regularly forecast rain when there was not a cloud in the sky\\".(London) Metro, 29 November 2006, p. 58. It is often said,For example, in Wisden in 1977, and in his obituaries in The Times, and The Independent that Roope was at the non-striking end when both John Edrich, and later Geoff Boycott, reached their 100th centuries in first-class cricket in 1977. Although the second is certainly correct, achieved at 5.49pm on the first day of the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley on 11 August, when Roope had to take evasive action to avoid a straight-hit four off the bowling of Greg Chappell to bring up Boycott's century,Stump The Bearded Wonder No 76, BBC, 3 June 2004; Scorecard from CricketArchive. a close inspection of the record books indicates that Roope had swapped batting positions with Geoff Howarth, for the match against Derbyshire at The Oval on 12 July, and Howarth was at the crease when Edrich scored the necessary runs off the bowling of Alan Hill, shortly after play should have ended at 5:30pm on the third and final day.Stump The Bearded Wonder No 82, BBC, 31 August 2004; Stump The Bearded Wonder No 83, BBC, 18 September 2004; Stump The Bearded Wonder No 84, BBC, 5 October 2004; Scorecard from CricketArchive. He toured India and Pakistan with England in 1972‚Äì73, making his Test debut in the fourth Test against India at Kanpur. He played at home against New Zealand and West Indies in 1973, making two Test half-centuries, but was not then selected until the fourth and final Ashes Test against Australia at The Oval in 1975. After a first-inning duck, he made his best Test score of 77 in the second innings, enabling England to save the match against Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson and Max Walker, despite a first innings deficit of 431 runs. He then fell out of favour again, before returning for the fourth and fifth Ashes Tests in 1977. He scored three further half-centuries on tour to Pakistan and New Zealand in 1977‚Äì78, and one more playing at home against Pakistan in 1978. His last Test appearance was in the first Test against New Zealand at home later in 1978. In all, he played 21 Tests and eight One Day Internationals for England, and was on the losing side in only two Tests and one ODI. Roope also played Non-League football as goalkeeper for a number of clubs including Corinthian Casuals, Wimbledon, Hayes, Guildford City, Ramsgate, Kingstonian, Woking, and Margate. He also played as an amateur in the Mid Sussex League for Ardingly and Cuckfield and in the Mid Sussex League Representative side in 1984 and 1985. He played again for Berkshire from 1983 to 1988, after retiring from Surrey. He moved to Yorkshire, where he became a coach at Ampleforth College and Woodhouse Grove School, and played for Hall Park in the Airedale and Wharfedale League. He was also a cricket commentator for BBC Radio Leeds. Graham Roope died suddenly of a heart attack in St George's, Grenada, while on a charity cricket tour. He was married three times, with a son and two daughters.

The battle was an attempt by the South Vietnamese navy to expel the Chinese navy from the vicinity. As a result of the battle, the PRC established de facto control over the Paracels.  Background  The Paracel Islands, called Xisha Islands (; Xƒ´shƒÅ Q√∫nd«éo) in Chinese and Hoang Sa Islands (Qu·∫ßn ƒê·∫£o Ho√†ng Sa) in Vietnamese, lie in the South China Sea approximately equidistant from the coastlines of the PRC and Vietnam (200 nautical miles). With no native population, the archipelago‚Äôs ownership has been in dispute since the early 20th century. China first asserted sovereignty in the modern sense to the South China Sea‚Äôs islands when it formally objected to France‚Äôs efforts to incorporate them into French Indochina during the Sino-French War (1884‚Äì1885). Initially, France recognized Qing China's sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagos, in exchange for Chinese recognition of Vietnam as a French territory. Chinese maps since then have consistently shown China‚Äôs claims, first as a solid and then as a dashed line. In 1932, one year after the Japanese Empire invaded northeast China, France formally claimed both the Paracel and Spratly Islands; China and Japan both protested. In 1933, France bolstered their claim and seized the Paracels and Spratlys, announced their annexation, and formally included them in French Indochina. They built several weather stations on them, but they did not disturb the numerous Chinese fishermen found there. In 1938 Japan took the islands from France, garrisoned them, and built a submarine base at Itu Aba (now Taiping / Â§™Âπ≥) Island. In 1941, the Japanese Empire made the Paracel and Spratly Islands part of Taiwan, then under its rule. In 1945, in accordance with the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations and with American help, the armed forces of the Republic of China government at Nanjing accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrisons in Taiwan, including the Paracel and Spratly Islands. Nanjing then declared both archipelagoes to be part of Guangdong Province. In 1946 it established garrisons on both Woody (now Yongxing / Ê∞∏ÂÖ¥) Island in the Paracels and Taiping Island in the Spratlys. France promptly protested. The French tried but failed to dislodge Chinese nationalist troops from Yongxing Island (the only habitable island in the Paracels), but were able to establish a small camp on Pattle (now Shanhu / ÁèäÁëö) Island in the southwestern part of the archipelago. In 1950, after the Chinese nationalists were driven from Hainan by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA), they withdrew their garrisons in both the Paracels and Spratlys to Taiwan. In 1954 France ceased to be a factor when it accepted the independence of both South and North Vietnam and withdrew from Indochina. In 1956 the PLA reestablished a Chinese garrison on Yongxing Island in the Paracels, while the Republic of China (Taiwan) stationed troops on Taiping Island in the Spratlys. That same year, however, South Vietnam reopened the abandoned French camp on Shanhu Island and announced it had annexed the Paracel archipelago as well as the Spratlys. To focus on its war with the North, South Vietnam by 1966 had reduced its presence on the Paracels to only a single weather observation garrison on Shanhu Island. The PLA made no attempt to remove this force.  Prelude  On January 16, 1974, six South Vietnamese Army officers and an American observer on the frigate L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (HQ-16) were sent to the Paracels on an inspection tour. They discovered two Chinese ‚Äúarmored fishing trawlers‚Äù laying off Drummond Island to support a detachment of PLA troops who had occupied the island. Chinese soldiers were also observed around a bunker on nearby Duncan Island, with a landing ship moored on the beach and two additional Kronstadt-class submarine chasers in the vicinity. This was promptly reported to Saigon,Thomas J. Cutler, The Battle for the Paracel Islands , Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD. Retrieved on 4-24-2009.Monique Chemillier-Gendreau, Sovereignty Over the Paracel and Spratly Islands, p.3, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2000. . Retrieved on 4-24-2009. and several naval vessels were sent to confront the Chinese ships in the area. The South Vietnamese Navy frigate signaled the Chinese squadron to withdraw, and in return received the same demand. The rival forces shadowed each other overnight, but did not engage. On January 17, about 30 South Vietnamese commandos waded ashore unopposed on Robert Island and removed the Chinese flag they found flying. Later, both sides received reinforcements. The frigate Tr·∫ßn Kh√°nh D∆∞ (HQ-4) joined the L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (HQ-16), while two PLA Navy minesweepers (#274 and #271) joined the Chinese. On January 18, the frigate Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng (HQ-5) arrived carrying the commander of the South Vietnamese fleet, Colonel H√† VƒÉn Ng·∫°c. The corvette Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o (HQ-10) also reached the islands, moving cautiously because it had only one functioning engine at the time.  Balance of forces  These four warships from the South Vietnam Navy would participate in the battle: the frigates, , , and , and the corvette . A platoon of South Vietnamese naval commandos, an underwater demolition team, and a regular ARVN platoon were by now stationed on the islands. China also had four warships present: the PLA Navy minesweepers 271, 274, 389 and 396. These were old and small warships with an average length of and width of , and they had not been well- maintained. However, they were reinforced by two Type 037 submarine chasers (281 and 282) by the end of the battle. In addition, two PLA marine battalions and an unknown number of irregular militia had been landed on the islands. The 48th Aviation Division of the People's Liberation Army Air Force provided some air support. Although four ships were engaged on each side, the total displacements and weapons of the South Vietnamese ships were superior. The supporting and reinforcement forces of the PLA Navy did not take part in the battle.  Military engagement  In the early morning of January 19, 1974, South Vietnamese soldiers from Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng landed on Duncan Island and came under fire from Chinese troops. Three South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more were wounded. Finding themselves outnumbered, the South Vietnamese ground forces withdrew by landing craft, but their small fleet drew close to the Chinese warships in a tense standoff. At 10:24 a.m., the South Vietnamese warships L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o opened fire on the Chinese warships. Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng and Tr·∫ßn Kh√°nh D∆∞ then joined in. The sea battle lasted about 40 minutes, with vessels on both sides taking damage. The smaller Chinese warships managed to maneuver into the blind spots of the main cannons on the South Vietnamese warships and damaged all four South Vietnamese ships, especially Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o, which could not retreat because her last working engine was disabled. The crew was ordered to abandon ship, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander Ng·ª•y VƒÉn Th√†, remained on board and went down with his ship. L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát, severely damaged by friendly fire from Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng, was forced to retreat westwards. Tr·∫ßn Kh√°nh D∆∞ and Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng soon joined in the retreat. The next day, Chinese aircraft from Hainan bombed the three islands, and an amphibious landing was made. The outnumbered South Vietnamese marine garrison on the islands was forced to surrender, and the damaged navy ships retreated to ƒê√† N·∫µng. During the battle, the South Vietnamese fleet detected two more Chinese warships rushing to the area. China later acknowledged these were the Hainan-class submarine chasers 281 and 282. Despite South Vietnamese reports that at least one of their ships had been struck by a missile, the Chinese insisted what the South Vietnamese saw were rocket-propelled grenades fired by the crew of #389 and that no missile- capable ships were present, and the Chinese ships closed in because they had no missiles. The South Vietnamese fleet also received warnings that U.S. Navy radar had detected additional Chinese guided missile frigates and aircraft on their way from Hainan. South Vietnam requested assistance from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, but the request was denied.  Result  Letter from South Vietnam's General Staff of the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces, dated 02-18-74, concerning the Battle of the Paracel Islands Following the battle, China gained control over all of the Paracel Islands. South Vietnam protested to the United Nations, but China, having veto power on the UN Security Council, blocked any efforts to bring it up. The remote islands had little value militarily, but diplomatically the projection of power was beneficial to China.  South Vietnamese casualties  The South Vietnamese reported that the warship Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o was sunk and L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát heavily damaged, while Tr·∫ßn Kh√°nh D∆∞ and Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng were both slightly damaged. 53 South Vietnamese soldiers, including Captain Ng·ª•y VƒÉn Th√† of Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o, were killed, and 16 were wounded. On January 20, 1974, the Dutch tanker, Kopionella, found and rescued 23 survivors of the sunken Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o. On January 29, 1974, South Vietnamese fishermen found 15 South Vietnamese soldiers near M≈©i Y·∫øn (Qui Nh∆°n) who had fought on Quang H√≤a island and escaped in lifeboats. After their successful amphibious assault on January 20, the Chinese held 48 prisoners, including an American advisor. They were later released in Hong Kong through the Red Cross.  Chinese casualties  The Chinese claimed that even though its ships had all been hit numerous times, none of them had been sunk. Warships 271 and 396 suffered speed-reducing damage to their engines, but both returned to port safely and were repaired. 274 was damaged more extensively and had to stop at Yongxing Island for emergency repairs. It returned to Hainan under its own power the next day. 389 was damaged the most by an engine room explosion. Its captain managed to run his ship aground and put out the fire with the help of the minesweepers. It was then towed back to base. Eighteen Chinese sailors were killed and 67 were wounded in the battle.Carl O. Schustser. \\"Battle for Paracel Islands\\".  Aftermath  A potential diplomatic crisis was averted when China released the American prisoner taken during the battle. Gerald Emil Kosh, 27, a former U.S. Army captain, was captured with the South Vietnamese on Pattle Island. He was described as a ‚Äúregional liaison officer‚Äù for the American embassy in Saigon on assignment with the South Vietnamese Navy. China released him from custody on January 31 without comment. The leaders of North Vietnam gave a glimpse of their worsening relationship with China by conspicuously not congratulating their ally. An official communique issued by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam mentioned only its desire for a peaceful and negotiated resolution for any local territorial dispute. In the wake of the battle, North Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Nguy·ªÖn C∆° Th·∫°ch told the Hungarian ambassador to Hanoi that \\"there are many documents and data on Vietnam's archipelago.\\" Other North Vietnamese cadres told the Hungarian diplomats that in their view, the conflict between China and the Saigon regime was but a temporary one. However, they later said the issue would be a problem of the entire Vietnamese nation.Bal√°zs Szalontai, Im l·∫∑ng nh∆∞ng kh√¥ng ƒë·ªìng t√¨nh. BBC Vietnam, March 24, 2009: http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2009/03/090324_paracels_hanoi_reassessment.shtml . After the reunification of Vietnam in April 1975, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam publicly renewed its claim to the Paracels, and the dispute continues to this day. Hanoi has praised the South Vietnamese forces that took part in the battle.For an overview of Hanoi's reactions to the Chinese occupation of the Paracels in 1974‚Äì1975, see also Chi-kin Lo, China's Policy toward Territorial Disputes.

They are the descendants of the people who inhabited Batavia (the colonial name of Jakarta) from the 17th century onwards.No Money, No Honey: A study of street traders and prostitutes in Jakarta by Alison Murray. Oxford University Press, 1992. Glossary page xi However, the term \\"native\\" itself is questionable, since the Betawi people emerged in the 18th century as an amalgamation of various immigrant ethnic groups into Batavia. Origin and history The Betawis are one of the most recently formed ethnic groups in Indonesia. They are a creole ethnic group in that their ancestors came from various parts of Indonesia and abroad. Prior to the 19th century, the self- identity of Betawi people was not yet formed. The name Betawi are adopted from the native rendering of the term \\"Batavia\\" city which is originally named after Batavi/Betuwe, an ancient Germanic tribe. In the 17th century, Dutch colonials began to import servants and labours from all over the archipelago into Batavia. One of the earliest were Balinese slaves bought from Bali and Ambonese mercenaries. Subsequently, other ethnic groups followed suit; they were Malays, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau, Bugis and Makassarese. Foreign ethnic groups were also included; such as Mardijker, Portuguese, Dutch, Arabs, Chinese and Indian, who were originally brought to or attracted to Batavia to work. Topeng Betawi dance troupe during colonial Dutch East Indies. Originally, circa 17th to 18th century, the dwellers of Batavia were identified according to their ethnics of origin; either Sundanese, Javanese, Malay, Ambonese, Bugis-Makassar, or Arabs and Chinese. This was shown in the Batavia census record that listed the immigrant's ethnic background of Batavian citizens. They were separated into specific ethnic-based enclaves kampungs, which is why in today's Jakarta there are some regions named after an ethnic-specific names such as; Kampung Melayu, Kampung Bali, Makassar and Kampung Ambon. These ethnic groups merged and formed around the 18th to 19th centuries. It was not until late 19th or early 20th century that the group ‚Äì who would become the dwellers of Batavia, referred to themselves as \\"Betawi\\", which refers to a creole Malay-speaking ethnic group which has a mixed culture of different influences; Malay, Sundanese to Arabic and Chinese. The term \\"Betawi\\" was first listed as an ethnic category in 1930 census of Batavia residents. The Betawi people have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding Sundanese and Javanese. The Betawis are known for their traditions in music and food. The Betawi are part of the Malay family, because their traditions, customs, and language are categorized into the Malay culture.deutro malayan (2012), Suku Betawi, http://deutromalayan.blogspot.co.id/2012/10/suku-betawi.html Language Distribution map of languages spoken in Java, Madura, and Bali. Betawi language spoken in and around modern Jakarta (blue) is traditionally registered as Malay. The Betawi language‚Äîalso known as Betawi Malay, is a Malay-based creole language. It was the only Malay-based dialect spoken on the northern coast of Java; other northern Java coastal areas are overwhelmingly dominated by Javanese dialects, while some parts speak Madurase and Sundanese. Betawi vocabulary has many Hokkien Chinese, Arabic, and Dutch loanwords. Today the Betawi language is a popular informal language in Indonesia and used as the base of Indonesian slang. It has become one of the most widely spoken languages in Indonesia, and also one of the most active local dialects in the country. Religion A majority of the Betawi people follow Sunni Islam. However, there are a significant number who profess the Christian faith. Among the Betawi ethnic Christians, some have claimed that they are the descendants of the Portuguese Mardijker which intermarried with the local population, who mainly settled in the area of Kampung Tugu, North Jakarta. Although today Betawi culture is often perceived as a Muslim culture, it also had other roots which includes Christian Portuguese and Chinese Peranakan culture. Recently, there is an ongoing debate on defining Betawi culture and identity‚Äîas mainstream Betawi organizations are criticized for only accommodating Muslim Betawi while marginalizing non-Muslim elements within Betawi culture‚Äîsuch as Portuguese Christian Betawi Tugu and Tangerang Cina Benteng community. Culture Betawi traditional dress known as Baju Demang or Ujung Serong The culture and artform of the Betawi people demonstrate the influences experienced by them throughout their history. Foreign influences are visible, such as Portuguese and Chinese influences on their musics, and Sundanese, Javanese and Chinese influences in their dances. Contrary to popular perception, which believed that Betawi culture is currently marginalized and under pressure from the more dominant neighbouring Javanese and Sundanese culture‚ÄîBetawi culture is actually thriving, since it is being adopted by immigrants who has settled in Jakarta. The Betawi culture also has become an identity for the city, promoted through municipal government patronage. The Betawi dialect is often spoken in TV shows and drama. Music Gambang Kromong. The Gambang kromong and Tanjidor, as well as Keroncong Kemayoran music is derived from the kroncong music of Portuguese Mardijker people of Tugu area, North Jakarta. \\"Si Jali-jali\\" is an example of a traditional Betawi song. Dance and drama Ondel-Ondel Betawi. The Ondel-ondel large bamboo masked-puppet giant effigy is similar to Chinese-Balinese Barong Landung and Sundanese Badawang, the artforms of masked dance. The traditional Betawi dances costumes shows both Chinese and European influences, while the movements such as Yapong dance, which is derived from Sundanese Jaipongan dance with a hint of Chinese style. Another dance is Topeng Betawi or Betawi mask dance. Betawi popular folk drama is called lenong, which is a form of theater that draw themes from local urban legends, foreign stories to everyday life of Betawi people. Martial arts Silat Betawi demonstration in Jakarta. Silat Betawi is a martial art of Betawi people, which was not quite popular, but recently has gained wider attention thanks to the popularity of silat films, such as The Raid. Betawi martial art was rooted in Betawi culture of jagoan (lit. \\"tough guy\\" or \\"local hero\\") that during colonial times often went against colonial authority; despised by the Dutch as thugs and bandits, but highly respected by local pribumis as native's champion. In Betawi dialect, their style of pencak silat is called maen pukulan (lit. playing strike) which related to Sundanese maen po. Notable schools among other are Beksi and Cingkrik. Beksi is one of the most commonly practiced forms of silat in Greater Jakarta, and is distinguishable from other Betawi silat styles by its close-distance combat style and lack of offensive leg action. Ceremonies During a Betawi wedding ceremony, there is a palang pintu (lit. door's bar) tradition of silat Betawi demonstration. It was a choreographed mock fighting between groom's entourage with bride's jagoan kampung (local champion). The fight is naturally won by groom's entourage as the village champs welcomes him to bride's home. The traditional wedding dress of Betawi displays Chinese influence in bride's costume and Arabian influences in groom's costume. Betawi people borrowed Chinese culture of firecrackers during wedding, circumcisions or any celebrative events. The tradition of bringing roti buaya (crocodile bread) during wedding is probably a European custom. Other Betawi celebrations and ceremonies include sunatan or khitanan (Muslim circumcision), and Lebaran Betawi festival. Cuisine Finding its roots in a thriving port city, Betawi has an eclectic cuisine that reflects foreign culinary traditions which have influenced the inhabitants of Jakarta for centuries. Betawi cuisine is heavily influenced by Peranakan, Malay, Sundanese, and Javanese cuisines, and to some extent Indian, Arabic and European cuisines. Betawi people have several popular dishes, such as soto betawi and soto kaki, nasi uduk, kerak telor, nasi ulam, asinan, ketoprak, rujak, semur jengkol, sayur asem, gabus pucung, and gado-gado Betawi.

They are living in kampungs around the city filled with orchards. As Jakarta become more and more densely populated, so does Betawi traditional villages that mostly now turned into a densely packed urban village with humble houses tucked in between high rise buildings and main roads. Some of more authentic Betawi village survived only in the outskirt of the city, such as in Setu Babakan, Jagakarta, South Jakarta bordering with Depok area, West Java. Traditional Betawi houses can be found in Betawi traditional kampung (villages) in Condet and Setu Babakan area, East and South Jakarta. Stairs and stilts of Rumah Si Pitung in Marunda On coastal area in Marunda area, North Jakarta, the Betawi traditional houses are built in rumah panggung style, which are houses built on stilts. The coastal stilts houses was built according to coastal wet environs which sometimes flooded by tides or floods, it was possibly influenced by Malay and Bugis traditional houses. Malay and Bugis migrants around Batavia were historically clustered in coastal areas as they work as traders or fishermen. Today, the cluster of Bugis fishermen villages can be found inhabiting Jakarta's Thousands Islands. The example of well-preserved Betawi rumah panggung style is Rumah Si Pitung, located in Marunda, Cilincing, North Jakarta. Betawi houses are typically one of three styles: rumah bapang (or rumah kebaya), rumah gudang (warehouse style), and Javanese-influenced rumah joglo. Most betawi houses have a gabled roof, with the exception the joglo house, which has a high pointed roof. Betawi architecture has a specific ornamentation called gigi balang (\\"grasshopper teeth\\") which are a row of wooden shingles applied on the roof fascia. Another distinctive characteristics of Betawi house is a langkan, a framed open front terrace where Betawi family receive their guests. The large front terrace is used as an outdoor living space.

Before World War II it belonged to Szabolcs county. Location from county seat Ny√≠regyh√°za. History Nagyk√°ll√≥ was already an oppidum (market town) in the 14th century. Its name probably comes from the old word k√°ll√≥ meaning \\"gathering place\\". Nagy means \\"large\\"; this prefix was used to differentiate between Nagyk√°ll√≥ and the nearby Kisk√°ll√≥ (\\"small K√°ll√≥\\"), which later became a part of Nagyk√°ll√≥. In 1315 King Charles Robert granted the town rights to hold a market, later the county councils were held here, thus the town became the centre of the region. After the Ottomans burnt the town in 1556, the citizens built a stone castle for defence. In 1603 Istv√°n Bocskai settled Hajd√∫k in the town. After his death they moved to Hajd√∫b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny, but Nagyk√°ll√≥ remained an important industrial centre. It was the property of the K√°llay de Nagy-K√°ll√≥ family. In 1630 George II R√°k√≥czi occupied the town and issued the Proclamation of Independence here. Francis II R√°k√≥czi attacked the castle on July 29, 1703 (first battle of the war for freedom) and occupied it the following day. In 1704 he ordered the castle to be destroyed (it was destroyed only later, in 1709).

The remains are seen today in the Petermann Ranges. Prior to the Petermann Orogeny, which resulted in exhumation of the Musgrave Block, the Amadeus Basin was contiguous with the Officer Basin in South Australia. Geological interpretation of the West Musgrave Block, Western Australia. 50x50km grid for scale. The extent and effect of the Petermann Orogen appears to be relatively confined, occurring most pervasively within the central northern-Musgrave Block. Here, older Musgravian (~1200-1150 Ma) fabrics are partially to completely overprinted by sub-eclogite-facies mineral assemblages (11-12 kbar at 650 ¬∞C). The Woodroofe Thrust, Davenport Shear Zone and Mann Fault accommodated much of the 30‚Äì40 km exhumation. Exhumation of the Musgrave Block (and overlying sediments) resulted in successive unroofing and deposition of rock types such as arkose and conglomerate in localised sedimentary basins that now outcrop as Uluru and Kata Tjuta respectively. Beyond this region of intense Petermann-aged activity, deformation related to the Petermann Orogen is less pervasive and ductile. Sedimentation associated with the Petermann Orogeny is responsible for the deposition of the Georgina Basin, Officer Basin, Ngalia Basin and Amadeus Basin sediments in the Cambrian. Sediments are a mixture of fluvial conglomerates, sandstones, and siltstones. Several pull-apart structural grabens formed at flexures in the orogenic belt, forming the Levenger and Moorilyanna Grabens. Dynamics The Petermann Orogeny is dominated by south- over-north movement on several large, anastomosing curved thrust faults. The prime thrust fault is the Woodroffe Thrust, which is a laminated pseudotachlyte-schist zone up to 300 metres thick. This has accommodated up to 42 kilometres of vertical movement at an angle of about 15 to 20 degrees. The structure of the Petermann Orogen within the Musgrave Block is considered to be a flower-structure, which is a set of vertically arcuate thrust faults which dip toward each other and accommodate vertical movement by essentially squeezing the central block up and out. Several northeast trending discontinuities including the Mundrabilla lineament divide the Petermann orogeny, with extensive vertical offsets across them, usually west-side-up, though the timing of this event is unknown. Deformations Six deformations are known (to be completed) * Folds of D1, D2 and D3 rare; D4 isoclinal upright, and D5 and D6 restricted to cleavage formation or small scale interference folds. *Megascale Z folding of unknown provenance correlates with NE trending Mundrabilla Lineament parallel structures, and is probably D2 or D3. Foliations Foliations associated with the Petermann Orogeny are typically steeply to gently south-dipping and subparallel to the thrust faults upon which they were developed. S regionally pervasive stretching lineation is potentially associated with some of these faults, especially in the deeper areas of the crust which have been exhumed, because these were within the temperature and pressure conditions for brittle-ductile and ductile deformation. Tectonics The tectonics of the Petermann Orogeny are extremely unusual, as it occurred in an intraplate setting in the centre of the Australian continental block. Several theories about the causes and dynamics of the orogen are currently under investigation, including; Transpression The Transpression model (by SRK Ltd) considers the Petermann Orogen to be caused by transpressional strike-slip along a series of anastomosing crustal-scale strike-slip thrusts which included movements during the pan-African orogenies and tectonic events of the Cambrian-Ordovician. The theory states that the degree of extreme uplift experienced in the Petermann Orogeny, specifically the ~42 km of uplift along the Woodroffe Thrust, occurred as a consequence of a crustal scale detachment surface forming a 'basement pop-up' as rock was thrust laterally along the detachment. Problems with this model include lack of geochronology, and general lack of kinematics directly linked to transpression. Intraplate thermal depression-rebound Another theory for the causes of the deep and extremely rapid exhumation of the Petermann Orogen is that it is due to isostatic instabilities caused by thermal events in the deep crust, causing accumulated stress to be released by violent thermal rebound (Sandiford, et al. 2001). This is envisaged as a kind of feedback loop between sedimentation and isostatic orogenic events. However, some authors (Camacho et al.) have called this into question with isotopic models. Economic Geology The Petermann Orogeny exposes deep crustal roots of the previous Musgrave Orogen and lkely parts of several poorly exposed Proterozoic orogenic belts and igneous provinces. As such, the rocks of the Petermann Orogen are considered prospective territory for mineral exploration. The history of mineral exploration in the Petermann Orogen extends back to the last half of the 19th century, with a series of prospectors and exploring pioneers transiting the area. Most famously was Lasseter, who allegedly found Lasseter's Reef, a near-mythical gold lode of such richness and scale that it has fired imaginations for over a century, but remains undiscovered. In the mid and late 20th century, government missionaries brought to the indigenous Aboriginal people of the area European law, European culture and the concept of salaried work, previously unknown to the hunter-gatherer inhabitants. In order to provide work, subsidised exploration was undertaken by the Western Mining Corporation, resulting in the discovery of podiform copper at Warburton Range, and eventually the Wingelinna nickel laterite resource. The advent of the Mabo Decision and land rights movements has seen aboriginal land rights improved, with the result that they now control access to land and exploration tenements. This has created uncertainty about tenure and land access for mineral exploration. There are three main known forms of mineralisation in the Petermann Orogen; * Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE at the undeveloped Nebo-Babel Deposit, found by Western Mining Corporation, and now owned by BHP Billiton. * Podiform copper hosted in sheared basalts in the Warburton Ranges, near Warburton, Western Australia, worked in the 1960s and 1970s. * Laterite nickel, primarily at Wingellina. Exploration for Olympic Dam lookalikes and for magmatic nickel copper mineralisation is continuing.  In popular culture  There are only one or two geology oriented documentaries that trace Uluru and Kata Tjuta's origins with the Australian Petermann Ranges. The Time Traveller's Guide To Australia in 2012 is possibly the first documentary to make the connection with reasonable clarity.

Biography=Military Career Yashiro was born in Gakuden Village, Owari Province (present-day Inuyama, Aichi), as the third son of a village headman, Matsuyama Shoichi. The Matsuyama claimed descent from a retainer of the medieval pro-Imperial hero Kusunoki Masashige, and as a youth Yashiro joined a cadet movement of pro-Sonn≈ç j≈çi militia of Owari Domain and despite his young age, fought in the Boshin War. He was adopted in 1868 by Yashiro Ippei, a samurai retainer of Mito Domain, whose surname he took. His adopted father saw that he was enrolled in the han school and subsequently Yashiro graduated from the 8th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1881, ranked 19th of his class of 35 cadets, and excelled at navigation and surveying. After midshipman service in the ironclad warship , he served as a crewman on the corvette . He was the posted to various administrative assignments within the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. From July 1890 to November 1892, he was sent as a naval attach√© to Vladivostok, in Russia. After his return to Japan, he was assigned to the cruiser , and was serving as a division officer aboard that vessel during the Battle of the Yalu on 17 September 1894 in the First Sino-Japanese War. Yashiro briefly served on the cruiser during the next year, before being assigned as a naval attach√© to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where his principal duty was making an Intelligence assessment of the capabilities of the Imperial Russian Navy. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1896 and commander the following year, Yashiro served on the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff between 1899 and 1900. In early 1900, he was appointed the executive officer on the cruiser , and in June 1900, he received his first command: the cruiser , followed by the in October 1901. Following his graduation from the Naval Staff College, Yashiro was promoted to captain in 1901. Commander of the armored cruiser during the Russo-Japanese War, Yashiro earned a reputation as a cool-headed and intelligent battle commander in skirmishes against the Russian cruiser and the gunboat in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay on 9 February 1904. Yashiro developed the plan to blockade the entrance to Port Arhur by sinking obsolete ships: however, he was overruled in his desire to lead the attack in person by Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç. The intimately unsuccessful operation was led by Takeo Hirose, and Yashiro was so overcome with remorse that he later personally sponsored the education of any children who had been orphaned in the operation. During the war, also participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. At the war's end, Yashiro was assigned to Berlin, Germany as naval attach√© until December 1907, when he was promoted to rear admiral. In December 1908, he was commander of the Yokosuka Reserve Fleet, and became commander of the IJN 1st Fleet from December 1909, Training Fleet from July 1910, and IJN 2nd Fleet from March 1911. In December 1911, he became commandant of the Naval Staff College. During his time at the Naval Staff College, Yashiro was a strong proponent of introducing karate into the Navy's training program. In September 1913, he was transferred to become commandant of the Maizuru Naval District. Minister of the Navy Following the Siemens-Vickers scandals, Yashiro replaced Sait≈ç Makoto as Navy Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister ≈åkuma Shigenobu. Yashiro was a surprising choice, as he was far down on the seniority list, but the Maizuru Naval District was completely free from any taint of the Siemens Scandal. World War I began almost immediately after he assumed office. The opportunities for Japan to use the Anglo-Japanese Alliance as an excuse to enter the war and to expel Germany from Asia, seizing its possessions in the Shantung Peninsula and in the islands of the South Pacific were clear, but Yashiro was at best ambivalent, knowing how these actions would create a larger conflict with the United States. Although appointed due to his commendable military and apolitical record, Yashiro's bluntness over issues with the Navy's budget led to his forced resignation in April 1915. In December, he was sent back as commander of the IJN 2nd Fleet. Yashiro was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system in July 1916. From December 1917, he was commander of the Sasebo Naval District. Raised to the rank of full admiral in July 1918, he became a member of the Supreme War Council in December 1918. Yashiro was placed on the reserve list in August 1920 and lived in retirement from January 1930 until his death six months later in June 1930.

Australian Aboriginal music during the prehistory of Australia is not well documented; this timeline will concentrate on the time since radio began broadcasting in Australia (1923). 1950s Because Australia had military ties with the US (through the Korean War), various Australian agents would invite the biggest American stars of the day such as Frank Sinatra, Little Richard and Ricky Nelson to come to Australia and perform in Sydney, Melbourne, and the other state capitals. Johnny Ray was the first to do this, in 1952. Until the late 1950s, Australian music was limited to jazz, country (with Slim Dusty being the biggest country star) and the music of its Indigenous peoples. Television was introduced to Australia in 1956, but because many people could not afford one at the time, the main medium for music was radio. Those who could not attend the concerts thus relied on the radio to hear the newest and most popular music. Nearly all the singles released in Australia at the time were recorded by Americans. The original 'rock and roll', popularised by Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry in America became popular in Australia as well because it fitted in with the changing image of its popular culture. The first 'rock and roll' dances were held at Preston Town Hall, Melbourne. Bill Haley and his Comets \\"Rock Around the Clock\\", when released in Australia in 1955, sold over 150,000 units as a 45rpm EP. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) By the end of the decade, rock and roll music was the most popular source of entertainment among young Australians. It was through these artists that Australians started recording its modern popular music. In 1955, the New South Wales government extended pub closing time from 6pm to 10pm to allow more rock and roll bands to play at these clubs (see Six o'clock swill). In March 1958, Johnny O'Keefe's \\"The Wild One\\" was the #1 single on the Australian charts - he was the first Australian rock star to have such a hit. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) Channel 9 began broadcasting an Australian version of the American Bandstand programme, with Brian Henderson as host, which lasted for 14 years. In 1959, Johnny O'Keefe took over the recently launched Six O'Clock Rock (ABC), which ran until 1962. 1960s Still strongly reflecting American culture, in 1962 Australia experienced the Twist fad, soon followed by the Stomp fad (reflecting surf culture, which came to Australia through the Americans a few years before). In 1964, one of the biggest bands of this genre, the Beach Boys toured Australia. Other American acts also toured - rock and roll was still quite popular there - but very few American acts were just as successful. More and more Australians were buying television sets, which gave the four television networks - Seven, Nine, Ten and ABC - an opportunity to air its own music show. In music shows of the 1950s and 1960s, every single song on the show was performed live in a small studio in front of an audience of 300 at the most, and they were nearly always teenagers. Rick Springfield's success began in 1962 and peaked in 1981 to 1983. The British invasion, which started with The Beatles, swept through Australia with many British acts being considered alternatives to the American ones. When the Beatles toured Australia in 1964, there were fans running to meet them everywhere. They performed to sell-out crowds in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The Rolling Stones also toured Australia in 1965, again to sellout crowds. But American singers still came to Australia for tours - Bob Dylan in 1966. The mid-1960s saw the 'mod' fad, which had been popular in Britain, come and go. Most of the Australian acts of the 1960s were influenced by the British acts, which were more common and thus more exposable, than the American acts and so most of the Australian songs of the decade were recorded in British styles of music. However, there were some Australians who were willing to stay Americanized and record surf rock, or rock and roll songs (although for the latter genre, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles would have been bigger influences than the US acts of the 1950s). Because of its small population at the time, not every Australian singer could be signed to an Australian label the traditional way (via a demo). So to pursue their dreams of becoming music stars, they had to enter talent shows. The winner of each talent show would get the chance to travel to Los Angeles, New York or London and be signed to a major British or American recording label. Olivia Newton-John and Helen Reddy were two of these singers, with Newton-John moving to London and performing songs with fellow Australian singer Pat Carroll. The Bee Gees, influenced by the big bands of the 1940s and 1950s also had to go on a talent show before they could start their recording careers. They became extremely successful in this style of music. A cover of The Coasters' \\"Poison Ivy\\" (also covered by the Rolling Stones) gave Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, a surf rock band, their first #1 hit, keeping even the Beatles at bay. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) 1964 also saw Jimmy Little have a hit with \\"Royal Telephone\\" - he was the first indigenous Australian to do so. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) The Seekers had two Hot 100 top 5 hits, the #4 hit \\"I'll Never Find Another You\\" in May 1965 and the #2 hit \\"Georgy Girl\\" in February 1967, plus several smaller hits. In 1966, Australia's prestigious (but quite Anglicized) annual rock band competition, Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds began, and this ran until 1972. By 1966, the Loved Ones (through \\"The Loved One\\") and the Easybeats (through \\"Friday on my Mind\\")had both seen success. Johnny Young was host of Young Talent Time and the Seekers became the first Australian band to sell over a million records internationally. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) Their best known songs were \\"Georgy Girl\\" and \\"The Carnival is Over\\". The last three mentioned bands all list British bands as their influences (to some extent). Pop paper Go-Set was also launched this year (1966), hosting their own televised pop awards (the Pop Poll). 1970s There was a 'boom' of Australian music acts in the early 1970s. Masters Apprentices, Spectrum, AC/DC, and Daddy Cool were some of the most successful Australian bands of this time. The popularity of surf culture continued into the 1970s. From 1972 to 1975 the Sunbury Music Festival (considered to be Australia's answer to America's Woodstock) was held in Victoria, dominated by the likes of Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, Daddy Cool and the Skyhooks. At this point, however, Australians were being exposed to a new distinctly American style of music - soft rock. Although they could listen to this sort of music through television and radio, it wasn't popular here until it came to Australia via the Eagles. The Little River Band is one of the noted Australian bands of this era to play in this style of music. In 1972, \\"It's Time\\" was recorded by Alison McCallum, and was (in)famously (and successfully) used by the ALP in Gough Whitlam's bid for government. He introduced many reforms, including legislating for the establishment of community-based FM radio and increased funding for the arts. Due to his government's reforms, 2JJ (now the influential Triple J) was established. 1972 also saw Michael Gudinski form Mushroom Records. In 1975, Skyhooks, who were signed to Mushroom, released Living In The 70's. Six tracks from the album were banned, and the controversy combined with the singles \\"Living in the 70s\\" and \\"Horror Movie\\" ensured the album sold well. Their actual style of music was originally surf rock, but became glam rock, which originated in Britain during the early 1970s; they are thus Anglicized in this way. Nevertheless, they were hugely successful because they gave the young Australian public what they wanted - songs about Australia - places, experiences, values and so on, rather than songs about love, which Australians up until that time had been famous for. The debut song played by 2JJ was one of the banned Skyhooks tunes, \\"You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good In Bed\\". Glam rock would go on to become one of the most popular styles of music in Australia in the 1970s with Sherbet and Split Enz both being successful bands. At the end of 1974, the ABC began broadcasting Countdown with Ian Meldrum as host, a show which became hugely popular and influential. The show started as a conventional music show, it was still common for every single song to be played live. By 1976 onwards, overseas artists began to send the ABC and other television networks promotional videos to air on their music shows when they could not perform live. Thus Australian bands like Dragon, the Little River band and Skyhooks made promotional videos to accompany many of their songs, even though they rarely aired on Countdown at this time. Songs played on the show often experienced a wild upswing in sales. Disco emerged in America in the mid to late 1970s and came to Australia via artists like KC & the Sunshine Band. The Bee Gees, who had stopped recording big-band style music in the early 1970s, used this style of music to make their comeback to the Australian charts. In 1977, the Bee Gees's soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever was a huge success worldwide, and in Australia broke all previous sales records. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) Disco also had other Australian followers: Leo Sayer had a Top 10 hit in 1977 with \\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\\", and John Paul Young achieved success with \\"Yesterday's Hero\\" in 1976 and \\"Love is in the Air\\" in 1978. The aforementioned styles of music existed alongside hard rock acts such as AC/DC. Australian music was starting to gather momentum overseas, with the Skyhooks touring the United States, and AC/DC and Sherbet attracting attention in Britain. In the late 1970s, as the punk rock phenomenon began overseas, Radio Birdman and the Saints began to be seen as scene leaders such as Shelby Ryan :S. Little River Band gained success in the United States in 1977, with their album Diamantina Cocktail being the first Australian-made American gold record (500,000 sales). (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) Melbourne became a haunting ground for many influential although not huge-selling rock acts during this time, including Nick Cave's the Birthday Party, the Go-Betweens and the Triffids. 1980s The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the dominance of the hugely popular pub rock, typified by Mental As Anything, Matt Finish, Midnight Oil, The Angels, Cold Chisel and Icehouse. (See Australian Rock.) Air Supply's huge success spanned 1980 to 1983. In 1981, Men at Work's \\"Down Under\\" was hugely popular both domestically and in the U.S., with the single staying at #1 on the Billboard charts for 4 weeks in January to February 1983. INXS also experienced big success with \\"What You Need\\" reaching the U.S. top 5, and the band selling over 1.3 million copies of their Listen Like Thieves album. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) The launch of MTV in America in 1981 ensured that Australians were exposed to the new generation of musical acts - and video clips - produced in the Northern Hemisphere. By 1983 Australian musical acts were making the transition from regular live performances to making promotional video clips - some acts for all of their singles. In 1984, Midnight Oil's charismatic lead singer Peter Garrett ran for parliament with the Nuclear Disarmament Party. In the end Garrett narrowly missed out on winning a senate seat. In the mid-1980s, politics and music were increasingly entwined - the 1985 Live Aid concert was huge. Midnight Oil's Diesel and Dust album, featuring the \\"Beds Are Burning\\" single, broke the band in the US. The mid 1980s also saw the arrival of dance music and the synthesiser, for example Rockmelons and Pseudo Echo who topped the Australian charts for 7 weeks with 'Funky Town'. There was a sudden burst of interest in female singer/songwriters in the late 1980s, with Kate Ceberano, Wendy Matthews and Jenny Morris (actually a New Zealander) being popular. In 1987, Kylie Minogue hit the pop charts with a bang, \\"Locomotion\\" becoming the biggest selling Australian single of the decade and #2 in the UK, #3 in the US. Split Enz split up and Neil Finn formed Crowded House. In 1987 \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\" peaked at #2 in the US. Alternative music was well represented during the 1980s, with the formation of bands such as, The Birthday Party, the Hoodoo Gurus, The Cruel Sea and TISM. It has been said that Madonna and Michael Jackson, American singers who were both quite popular in Australia during this time, are major influences for Australian music from the 1980s onwards: in terms of the topics of the songs (nearly every song recorded since 1990 are related to love), the video clips, and the actual styles of music. 1990s The 1990s saw the continued expansion and then popularity of alternative music. It also saw a renaissance in music festivals, with some dozen or more being established and holding their own. Several expanded to cover multiple cities (Homebake, Big Day Out, Livid). The trend was kicked off by the establishment of the Big Day Out in 1992 in Sydney. Grunge had become huge in Australia after the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in 1994, and Silverchair were the chief beneficiaries, with huge success both locally and within the US (1996). Alternative going mainstream was confirmed in 1994, when the Cruel Sea dominated the ARIA Music Awards with their album The Honeymoon Is Over. Nick Cave experienced wider commercial success, and You Am I had three successive albums debut at #1. Other stalwarts of the 1990s have been Regurgitator, Magic Dirt and Spiderbait. The baby boomer's rock scene, by the 1990s, translated into adult contemporary, with Wendy Matthews, Daryl Braithwaite and the Screaming Jets finding success. In the late 1990s, pop broke out all over. Savage Garden hit the US#1 with their single \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" and their debut album sold over 8 million copies. (Creswell & Fabinyi, 1999) Tina Arena and Natalie Imbruglia also had big chart success. The 1990s also saw a rise in popular Australian music and videos for young children, particularly The Wiggles and Hi-5. Triple J's influence in possible success for a band was clearer than ever, with the station breaking Grinspoon, Missy Higgins and largely responsible for promoting the Whitlams, who after winning Triple J's Hottest 100 poll in 1997 with their \\"No Aphrodisiac\\", went on to win Song of the Year at the 1998 ARIA music awards.

It stars Edward Norton, Colin Farrell, Jon Voight, and Noah Emmerich. The film was released on October 24, 2008, in the United States. Plot Assistant Chief Francis Tierney Sr. is the head of a multigenerational New York City Police Department (NYPD) family, which includes his wife Maureen; their son Francis \\"Franny\\" Jr., his wife Abby, their three children Caitlin, Francis III & Bailey; their son Ray; and their daughter Megan, her husband Jimmy Egan, their two children Shannon and Matthew. Deputy Inspector Franny is the Commanding Officer of the 31st Precinct, where Sergeant Jimmy is a patrol officer, while Detective Ray works in the Missing Persons Squad, having transferred to this lighter duty after being shot during an arrest two years earlier. Jimmy leads the NYPD to victory in city-league football. While everybody is celebrating, Franny receives a call that four men from his precinct have been shot dead when answering a \\"shots fired\\" 911 call at the Washington Heights apartment of a local drug gang leader, Angel Tezo. Francis Sr. bullies Ray into joining a task force put together to investigate the killings. Jimmy and fellow patrol officers Kenny Dugan, Reuben \\"Sandy\\" Santiago and Eddie Carbone find the abandoned cab Tezo fled in, containing the dead cab driver. The four officers are part of a corrupt group in Franny's precinct, along with the four dead officers. Under Jimmy's direction, they burn the cab and dead driver, and set about finding Tezo before Ray and the task force do. Ray tells Franny that his investigation has revealed that a policeman named Sandy had tipped off Tezo to the raid. When Franny later confronts Santiago, he admits to what he did and expresses surprise that Franny never knew what was going on with the officers in his precinct. He says \\"Everyone knew.\\" The cops had intended to kill Tezo so they could work with another dealer, Eladio Casado, but Santiago warned Tezo due to a childhood friendship, believing Tezo would simply flee. Though Franny tells Santiago to hand over his badge, he does not take the information to his superiors for fear of losing his command. Later, Casado arrives at Jimmy's house, pressuring Jimmy for failing to find and kill Tezo. Steady police work helps Ray find Tezo, while elsewhere Jimmy beats Tezo's cousin and prepares to kill the cousin's baby to get the same information. Ray reaches Tezo only to find Jimmy and his crew there first, torturing Tezo to death. Ray tries to intervene; however, Jimmy suddenly uses Ray's gun to kill Tezo, then tells Ray to accept being the hero who killed the cop-killer. Jimmy's crew leaves just before Ray's backup arrives. Overcome with grief over his role in the murders and the corruption, Santiago meets privately with a reporter and confesses to the corruption (but gives no names) in the 31st Precinct. Santiago then commits suicide in the reporter's car. After the newspaper reports the corruption, Internal Affairs (IAB) investigates the Tezo killing. Ray says he was not the shooter and refuses to say more, while Jimmy admits his crew was there then fabricates a story that Ray killed Tezo in cold blood. Francis Sr. is furious with his son for not lying to IAB, to which Ray reveals that he did enough lying for his father regarding the shooting that hurt him two years earlier, at which his fellow officers threw the shooter off a building for revenge. Franny arrives and tells his father that the lies and corruption end now, and they will arrest their brother-in-law even if it costs Franny his career. Things quickly unravel within the 31st Precinct sector. Franny and Ray look for Jimmy, while Dugan and Carbone hold up a liquor store, with Carbone and a customer soon dead and Dugan holding the owner hostage. While Tezo's cousin agitates the crowd outside the liquor store, Franny goes in and arrests Dugan. Ray confronts Jimmy at a nearby bar, where Ray wins a brutal brawl between them. Ray is walking a handcuffed Jimmy back to the liquor store when the still-agitated crowd surrounds them. Tezo's cousin has the crowd hold Ray while Jimmy offers himself to be beaten to death. Ray staggers away from his dead brother-in-law, making it back to Franny at the liquor store. A few days later, the three Tierney men arrive at the New York County Courthouse to give their statements.

Hopes in 1999, after the completion of Tumbleweeds. The brothers, whose father was a police officer, were given \\"rare\\" access to the police department and its officers. Gavin O'Connor described their intent: \\"My father was a New York City detective, and I grew up in that world. It's a birthday bash of honest cops, which was everything my father was about. Though it is fictional, it is an homage to my father.\\" They also hoped to create a film which evoked those of the 1970s, using corruption in the police force, as a metaphor for wider institutional corruption. The script was optioned in June 2000 by Fine Line Features, a subdivision of New Line Cinema, and Joe Carnahan was hired to rewrite the script. Production on the film was expected to begin later in 2000, with Gavin O'Connor directing and Greg O'Connor producing. In 2001, the project was subject to a turnaround deal, which saw the rights ceded to Intermedia. Production was expected to start in February 2002 in New York City, and Mark Wahlberg and Hugh Jackman were in talks to star. The film's development was subject to further delays until 2005. Carnahan cited the September 11, 2001 attacks as the primary reason for the delay: \\"There was a moment after 9/11, where the notion of doing what might be deemed an anti-cop film, particularly an attack of the NYPD, would be grounds for hanging.\\" In September 2005, the rights were once more with New Line Cinema. Production president Toby Emmerich (brother of actor Noah, who had previously starred in O'Connor's Tumbleweeds and Miracle) had been a fan of the script for several years, and the studio entered negotiations with Norton, Farrell and Noah Emmerich to star. Production was set to begin in New York City in January 2006, though principal photography did not begin until the following month. Nick Nolte was on set at the start of filming to play Francis Tierney Sr., but after a chronic knee injury flared up, he was unable to perform and was replaced by Voight. Cinematographer Declan Quinn said that the biggest challenge was \\"[trying] to find a fresh way to do a police drama where it feels real and not like something we've seen a hundred times before.\\" Release Pride and Glory was originally scheduled for release on March 14, 2008, and trailers for the film appeared, with showings of No Country for Old Men, Atonement, and American Gangster. In January 2008, New Line announced that it was pushing back the release until 2009, citing both Norton and Farrell's 2008 releases of The Incredible Hulk, and In Bruges respectively. The studio had not commented further on the delay, which angered O'Connor. He blamed internal New Line politics for the delay, specifically chairman Bob Shaye, saying, \\"I don't think [Shaye] believes in it, and he's decided he'll only release [sure bet] films. He never had the decency to call me.\\" O'Connor had said he would withhold delivery of his next script for New Line, Warrior, until he discovered the film's fate, and also looked at the possibility of taking the film to another studio. In February 2008, O'Connor held a screening at the headquarters of talent agency CAA, in order to publicize that the film may need a new distributor. O'Connor said of the situation, \\"We've delivered something special and unique, a film that's not for everybody but has something to say. We're all heartbroken.\\" Norton blamed a wider industry \\"paralysis\\" for the problems, rather than New Line Cinema: \\"We're a victim of the moment, and I just hope they will either find a way to give the film its due or graciously let us do it with someone else.\\" Farrell said he believed in the film and called the situation \\"bizarre\\". Reception=Critical reaction The film was eventually released on October 24, 2008 in the United States. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 140 reviews, with the critical consensus being that \\"Formulaic in its plotting and clich√©d in its dialogue, Pride and Glory does little to distinguish itself from other police procedurals.\\" The film was also accused of racism for its portrayal of Dominican Americans. Box office As of January 28, 2009, the film has grossed $43,440,721 worldwide. In North America, the film opened at #5 with $6,262,396 behind High School Musical 3: Senior Year, Saw V, Max Payne, and Beverly Hills Chihuahua, respectively, from 2,585 theaters with a $2,423 average. Soundtrack The film's original score was composed by Mark Isham.

Biography  Johnson was born in Hardwick, Massachusetts, in 1853, son of Gardner Nye and Eliza (French) Johnson, a paternal ancestor, John Johnson, having emigrated from England and settled in Massachusetts about 1635. He was prepared for College in Jennings Seminary at Aurora, Illinois, from which he entered Northwestern University at Evanston. Passing later to Harvard he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1878, subsequently studying for a short time under Johannes Conrad at the University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany.Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Edward Potts Cheyney, Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer (1901) \\"JOHNSON, Joseph French, 1853-,\\" in: University of Pennsylvania: its history, influence, equipment and characteristics; with biographical sketches and portraits of founders, benefactors, officers and alumni, Vol. 1. p. 427. From 1878 to 1881 he was a teacher at the Harvard School in Chicago. Soon after, he entered journalism as part of the editorial staff of the Springfield, Massachusetts, Republican. He did this for several years, and afterward served as Financial Editor of the Chicago Tribune. After twelve years of a practical journalist's life he was called to the School of Finance and Economy in the University of Pennsylvania. In 1893‚Äì1894 he was Associate Professor of Business Practice and since 1894 he has been Professor of Journalism, that department of instruction having just been established in that year. Although it is a wholly new branch of University work, considerable success has already been attained by Professor Johnson in training College men for practical careers in newspaper offices. Sequentially he lectured at Columbia University, and in 1901 became a professor at New York University and in 1903 Dean of the School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance of the University. In 1909 he was founding Dean of the Alexander Hamilton Institute in New York. Johnson then became a member of the commission to revise the banking laws of the State of New York, and worked for the National Monetary Commission.

His parents were Albert IV and Kunigunde of Austria, a daughter of Emperor Frederick III. Biography Though his father had determined the everlasting succession of only the firstborn prince in 1506, Louis as a second-born son refused a spiritual career with the argument that he was born before the edict became valid. With support of his mother and the States-General, Louis forced his elder brother William IV to accept him as co- regent in 1516. Louis then ruled the districts of Landshut and Straubing, in general concord with his brother. In 1516, he refurnished the medieval Trausnitz Castle in Landshut decorating it in the south German Renaissance style. Like his elder brother, he first showed sympathy for the Protestant Reformation but decided to take action against its expansion in Bavaria already in 1522. Both the dukes also suppressed the uprising of farmers in South Germany in their duchies in 1525. Since Louis claimed the Bohemian crown Bavaria was in opposition to the Habsburgs until 1534 when both dukes reached an agreement with Ferdinand I in Linz. After his visit in Italy, Louis built the first Italian Renaissance style palace constructed north of the Alps, the Landshut Residence which was modeled 1537‚Äì1543 after the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. The Landshut Residence also consisted of an adjoining palace to the previous mentioned which was built in German Renaissance style under the architect Bernhard Zwitzel of Augsburg. Both the palaces were connected together by two wings. Having no son, the districts that Louis ruled were passed up to his brother William in the end at his death in 1545. This was finally the end of the divisions of the duchy of Bavaria. His illegitimate daughter was Anna von Leonsberg (1525‚Äì1556) who married Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter (1506‚Äì1557).

It is divided into the junior college, a military junior college program, high school, and middle school. It was originally known as Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College, until 1900. Although it is a state-funded institution, GMC is not affiliated with either the University System of Georgia or the Technical College System of Georgia. GMC's main facility is housed in the restored old Georgia state capitol building which was the seat of government for the State of Georgia from 1807‚Äì1868. The main campus in Milledgeville serves approximately 254 full-time, resident ROTC Cadets and 1300 commuter students. GMC's seven campuses, five extension campuses, and online campus serve nearly 14,000 students across Georgia. GMC is one of four military junior colleges that participate in the U.S. Army's Early Commissioning Program. Students who graduate from GMC's two-year, military science-oriented curriculum receive an officer's commission in the U.S. Army. The junior college was established in 1879, and later added a preparatory school for students in sixth grade through twelfth grade. GMC's military preparatory school for Cadets is in Baldwin County and has approximately 279 middle school students and 277 high-school Junior ROTC (JROTC) students. The preparatory school's dual enrollment program enables qualified sophomores, juniors, and seniors to attend classes at the junior college and the high school simultaneously, while earning credit for both their high school diploma and their college degree.  Campuses  Valdosta campus In addition to the main campus in Milledgeville, GMC Junior College other campus locations and extension offices are located in Atlanta (Fairburn), Augusta, Columbus, Madison, Sandersville, Valdosta, Warner Robins, Fayetteville, Dublin, Eastman, Stone Mountain and Albany. The other campus locations serve as junior colleges to their local communities. Georgia Military College Columbus Campus is the only liberal arts junior college in Columbus.

This allows GMC to offer degrees to people who that work and don't have the time to come to campus, who are stationed overseas, or just enjoy going to school online. The online campus allows GMC to serve not just local but also global communities.  Corps of Cadets  Georgia's second capitol building, 1937, now part of Georgia Military College GMC's Early Commissioning Program (ECP) is designed to enable students to become a second lieutenant in the US Army after the first two years in college. GMC offers funding specifically to help pay costs for Corps of Cadet members on the Milledgeville campus. The State Service Scholarship Program provides 39 full scholarships to qualified Georgia residents with an interest in military service as well as a quality college education. The program is funded through the Georgia General Assembly. Scholarship recipients are required to become members of either the Army or Air National Guard, and must be nominated by a member of the Georgia General Assembly. These scholarships cover tuition, fees, rooms, board, books and supplies. Scholarship winners must join the Corps of Cadets and participate in Army ROTC. Army ROTC scholarships are also available for qualified cadets interested in the Early Commissioning Program (ECP). These scholarships are funded through ROTC and cover tuition, fees, and books, plus a monthly stipend. There are various options for ROTC scholarship based on the student's desire for active duty or reserve component duty. After completing studies at GMC, a transfer scholarship is available for those GMC graduates desiring to complete their four-year degree at Georgia's senior military college, the University of North Georgia (UNG) (formerly North Georgia College and State University, NGC&SU;) in Dahlonega. Georgia is the only U.S. state with both a senior military college (UNG) and a military junior college (GMC). Combined, GMC and UNG currently have almost 900 cadets pursuing a commission in the U.S. Army. One of the ways in which a student can become an ECP cadet is to attend the Cadet Initial Entry Training. The course is twenty-nine days long. Between the cadet's freshmen and sophomore years, the cadet will attend the Advanced Camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Following AC, the cadet may be able to attend additional training with Army units all over the world and in the United States. After completing required training, the Cadet is commissioned as a U.S. Army officer at the end of his/her sophomore year. The ECP program allows cadets to become commissioned second lieutenants two years earlier than normal ROTC cadets and even West Point cadets. These commissioned army officers can then serve in the Army Reserve or Army National Guard. After completing their four-year degrees, they will be promoted as a first Lieutenant. GMC opened its modern barracks (dorm) facility in January 2007 for the 254 students that comprise the Corps of Cadets. A new academic building and dining hall have recently been completed. High school and middle school Because it is part of JROTC, GMC's high school has mandatory 50-minute LET (Leadership, Education, Training) classes throughout the day. The school day is followed by a 50-minute period of marching on Davenport field three times a week. After-school extracurricular activities include marching band, football, baseball, basketball, softball, rifle team, drill team, dance line, cheerleading, color guard, cross country, soccer, tennis, track, and raiders. The school's middle school is modeled after the high school, having drill at the end of the day led by cadets.  History  1890 graduation class Georgia Military College was created in 1879 by act of the Georgia General Assembly \\"to educate young men and women from the Middle Georgia area in an environment which fosters the qualities of good citizenship.\\" It was the apparent intention of the General Assembly to establish the school as a unit of the slowly forming University System of Georgia. State property in Milledgeville, including the former state capital building which had been damaged by General William T. Sherman's \\"March to the Sea\\", was loaned to the University of Georgia by the Act of 1879, and the Board of Trustees of the University of Georgia was given veto powers by this Act over the acts of the local Board of Trustees of the new institution. The school was originally called Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College and was ceded state government lands surrounding the Old Capitol Building, the seat of government for the state of Georgia from 1807‚Äì1868. The Old Capitol Building, then as now, is the main college facility and sits on the highest point in Milledgeville. Former Confederate general Daniel Harvey Hill served as president from 1885 until August 1889, when he resigned due to failing health. (He died in Charlotte, NC on September 24, 1889.)Bridges, Hal. Lee's Maverick General: Daniel Harvey Hill. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1991, pp. 277‚Äì279. . First published 1961 by McGraw-Hill.Owen, Richard, and James Owen. Generals at Rest: The Grave Sites of the 425 Official Confederate Generals. Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Co., 1997, p. 176 . The 1890 graduating class was the first to include female students. The college's intended purpose was to enable graduates to enter higher classes at the University of Georgia, to give training in agriculture and mining, and, finally, to train teachers. The name of the school was changed to Georgia Military College in 1900. Legislative acts of 1920 and 1922 severed the relationship with the University of Georgia and gave the local board total power over the operations of the school. In 1922 the method of electing members of the Board of Trustees and filling vacancies on the board was changed. This act provided for a seven-member board to be elected from and by the citizens of Milledgeville, with trustees' terms staggered to provide continuity. In 1930 the official addition of a junior college division to the college-preparatory secondary school finally justified its name. In 1950 the Defense Department designated the institution a \\"military junior college.\\" Today it is one of only four remaining US military junior colleges so designated.  Athletics  Georgia Military College competes in soccer, tennis, golf, cross country, softball, and football. The football program has firmly established itself as one of the finest junior college programs in the country. Since 1991, GMC has developed 36 All-Americans, won the Junior College National Championship in 2001, played for the national championship in 2002, played in eight junior college bowl games, and sent over 250 young men to continue their education and athletic careers at four-year institutions across the country. The football team finished the 2005 season ranked second in the nation. On the golf course, the Bulldogs took home the 2004 NJCAA DIII National Championship Trophy, with Brendon O'Connell taking the individual title. Alumnus Macoumba Kandji scored the game-winning goal in the 2010 MLS Cup, lifting the Colorado Rapids soccer team over FC Dallas.  Notable alumni  * Maj Gen William P.

In the criminal law, an omission will constitute an actus reus and give rise to liability only when the law imposes a duty to act and the defendant is in breach of that duty. In tort law, similarly, liability will be imposed for an omission only exceptionally, when it can be established that the defendant was under a duty to act. Criminal law In the criminal law, at common law, there was no general duty of care owed to fellow citizens. The traditional view was encapsulated in the example of watching a person drown in shallow water and making no rescue effort, where commentators borrowed the line, \\"Thou shalt not kill but needst not strive, officiously, to keep another alive.\\" (Arthur Hugh Clough (1819‚Äì1861)) in support of the proposition that the failure to act does not attract criminal liability. Nevertheless, such failures might be morally indefensible and so both legislatures and the courts have imposed liability when the failure to act is sufficiently blameworthy to justify criminalisation. Some statutes therefore explicitly state that the actus reus consists of any relevant \\"act or omission\\", or use a word that may include both. Hence, the word \\"cause\\" may be both positive in the sense that the accused proactively injured the victim and negative in that the accused intentionally failed to act knowing that this failure would cause the relevant injury. In the courts, the trend has been to use objective tests to determine whether, in circumstances where there would have been no risk to the accused's health or well-being, the accused should have taken action to prevent a foreseeable injury being sustained by a particular victim or one from a class of potential victims. So, returning to the drowning example, the accused would be liable if the victim was a child in a pool with a water depth of six inches, or there was a flotation device nearby that could easily be thrown to the victim, or the accused was carrying a mobile phone that could be used to summon help. However, the law will never penalise someone for not jumping into a raging torrent of water, i.e. the law does not require the potential saver to risk drowning even though the individual might be a lifeguard paid to patrol the given beach, river or pool. No matter what the terms of employment, an employee can never be required to do more than what is reasonable in all the circumstances. In R v Dytham (1979) QB 722 an on-duty police officer stood and watched a man beaten to death outside a nightclub. He then left without calling for assistance or summoning an ambulance. He was convicted of the common law offence of willful misconduct in public office. Widgery CJ said: :The allegation was not one of mere non- feasance, but of deliberate failure and willful neglect. This involves an element of culpability which is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty, but which must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment. In the Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 2003) (2004) EWCA Crim 868http://uniset.ca/other/css/2005QB73.html police officers arrested a man with head injuries for a breach of the peace because of his abusive and aggressive behaviour towards the hospital staff who were trying to treat him. He later stopped breathing in the police station and all attempts at resuscitation failed. Five police officers, who were involved in the care of A at the time of his death, were charged with manslaughter by gross negligence and misconduct in a public office. It was held that the latter offence required that a public officer was acting as such, that he willfully neglected to perform his duty and/or willfully misconducted himself in a way which amounted to an abuse of the public's trust in the office holder, without reasonable excuse or justification; that whether the misconduct was of a sufficiently serious nature would depend upon the responsibilities of the office and the office holder, the importance of the public objects which they served, the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities and the seriousness of the consequences which might follow from the misconduct; that to establish the mens rea (Latin for \\"guilty mind\\") of the offence, it had to be proved that the office holder was aware of the duty to act or was subjectively reckless as to the existence of the duty; that the test of recklessness applied both to the question whether in particular circumstances a duty arose at all and to the conduct of the defendant if it did arise; and that the subjective test applied both to reckless indifference to the legality of the act or omission and in relation to the consequences of the act or omission. Assumption of responsibility for care of dependents The general rule is that parents, legal guardians, spouses (see R v Smith (1979) CLR 251 where the wife died after giving birth to a stillborn child, delivered by her husband at home) and anyone who voluntarily agrees to care for another who is dependent because of age, illness or other infirmity, may incur a duty, at least until care can be handed over to someone else. In three cases, the duty was implied: *R v Instan (1893) 1 QB 450, Instan lived with her aunt, who was suddenly taken ill and could no longer feed herself or call for help. She was convicted of manslaughter because she neither fed her aunt, nor called for medical help, even though she continued to stay in the house and ate her aunt's food. *R v Stone & Dobinson (1977) QB 354. Stone and his mistress agreed to care for his sister who was suffering from anorexia. As her condition deteriorated, she became bed-ridden but no help was summoned and she died. They were convicted of her manslaughter because they had accepted her into their home and so assumed a duty of care for her. *R v Gibbins & Proctor (1918) 13 Cr App Rep 134. A father and his lover neglected his child by failing to feed her. The lover had taken on a duty to care for the child when moving into the house and was under an obligation to care for her. Statutory omissions Misprision of felony was abolished in 1967 but new statutory offences of failure to comply with a duty to disclose terrorist acts or funding under s19(2) Terrorism Act 2000, and failure to disclose knowledge or suspicion of money laundering maintain the tradition. Similarly, the appropriation element in s1 theft may be committed by an act or by keeping when there is a duty to return the property, a deception under s15(4) Theft Act 1968 may be committed by what is not said or done, and \\"dishonestly secures\\" under s2(1) Theft Act 1978 may also be committed by omission (see R v Firth (1990) CLR 326 in which the defendant failed to tell the NHS that patients using NHS facilities were in fact private patients thereby obtaining the use of the facilities without payment). One of the simpler examples is the offence of failing to report a road traffic accident (s. 170 Road Traffic Act 1988). Duty to act when the defendant has created the danger A person who creates a dangerous situation may be under a duty to take reasonable steps to avert that danger. In R v Miller (1983) 2 AC 161, the defendant was sleeping rough in a building. He fell asleep on his mattress while smoking a cigarette. When he woke, he found that the mattress was smouldering but, instead of calling for help, he simply moved into another room. This allowed the fire to spread. He was convicted under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 for recklessly causing damage by omission. Lord Diplock said: :...I see no rational ground for excluding from conduct capable of giving rise to criminal liability, conduct which consists of failing to take measures that lie within one's power to counteract a danger that one has oneself created, if at the time of such conduct one's state of mind is such as constitutes a necessary ingredient of the offence. But although this may apply to the generality of offences, \\"constructive manslaughter\\" is different. R v Lowe (1973) QB 702, the defendant committed the offence of neglecting his child under s1 Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and this caused the child's death. It was held that there should be a difference between commission and omission. Mere neglect without some foresight of the possibility of harm resulting is not a ground of constructive manslaughter, even if that omission is deliberate. R v Khan & Khan (1998) CLR 830, confirmed that there is no separate category of manslaughter by omission unless the omission constitutes a breach of duty to act. The defendants supplied a 15-year-old prostitute with twice the amount of heroin likely to be taken by a regular user. The defendants left her unconscious in the flat, returning the next day to find that she had died of the overdose. Had medical assistance been called, the girl would probably not have died. The unlawful act was supplying the drug but the death was caused by the quantity injected by the victim. The trial judge invited jury to consider liability on the basis of the defendants' failure to summon medical assistance. On appeal, the conviction was quashed because the brothers had not accepted a duty to act before she took the heroin. Failure to provide medical treatment In general terms, doctors and hospitals have a duty to provide appropriate care for their patients, and an omission may breach that duty except where an adult patient of ordinary capacity terminates the duty by refusing consent. There is a conflict in public policy. The policy of patient autonomy enshrines a right of self-determination‚Äîpatients have a right to live their lives how they wish, even if it will damage their health or lead to premature death. Society‚Äôs interest is in upholding the concept that all human life is sacred and should be preserved if at all possible. It is now well established that the right of the individual is paramount. In Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) (1994) 1 WLR 290, a patient diagnosed as a chronic, paranoid schizophrenic refused to allow his gangrenous foot to be amputated. This was permitted because his general capacity showed him capable of understanding the nature, purpose and effect of the life-saving treatment. In Re B (Adult: Refusal of Medical Treatment) (2002) 2 AER 449 the presumption that an adult has full capacity can be rebutted if: :(a) the person is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision, especially as to the likely consequences of having or not having the treatment; or :(b) the patient is unable to use the information and weigh it in the balance as part of the process of arriving at a decision. Ms B was a competent but paralysed, ventilator-dependent patient, and she won the right to have the ventilator turned off. Although the switching-off had to be performed by a doctor, and this is an act intentionally causing death, the law characterises this as an omission because it amounts simply to a cessation of the ongoing treatment. The doctors‚Äô conduct qualifies as lawful \\"passive euthanasia\\". If the particular doctor invited to omit further treatment has conscientious objections, a doctor who will undertake the omission should be sought. But, in more general cases of necessity, urgent surgery may not be unlawful to preserve life pending any judicial decision. Similarly, when the patient is a minor, emergency treatment to preserve life will not be unlawful (note the power to refer issues of consent to the courts under their wardship jurisdiction). In death with dignity situations where a patient is incapable of communicating his wishes, a doctor may be relieved of his duty, as the House of Lords recognised in Airedale National Health Service Trust v Bland (1993) AC 789. Here a patient who had survived for three years in a persistent vegetative state after suffering irreversible brain damage in the Hillsborough disaster continued to breathe normally, but was kept alive only by being fed through tubes. It was held that treatment could properly be withdrawn in such circumstances, because the best interests of the patient did not involve him being kept alive at all costs. Lord Goff nevertheless drew a fundamental distinction between acts and omissions in this context: :. . . the law draws a crucial distinction between cases in which a doctor decides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for his patient treatment or care which could or might prolong his life, and those in which he decides, for example by administering a lethal drug, actively to bring his patient's life to an end . . . the former may be lawful, either because the doctor is giving effect to his patient's wishes . . . or even in certain circumstances in which . . . the patient is incapacitated from stating whether or not he gives his consent. But it is not lawful for a doctor to administer a drug to his patient to bring about his death, even though that course is prompted by a humanitarian desire to end his suffering, however great that suffering may be. Duty to act when contracted to do so In R v Pittwood (1902), the defendant was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter after he failed to close the gate on a level crossing as he was contracted to do. This caused a train to collide with a hay cart, and the court ruled that \\"a man might incur criminal liability from a duty arising out of contract.\\" Preventing and prosecuting war crimes Following the Nuremberg Trials international law developed the concept of command responsibility. It holds that military commanders are imposed with individual responsibility for war crimes, committed by forces under their effective command and control, they failed to prevent or adequately prosecute, if they: :\\"either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time, should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes.\\"Joint Criminal Enterprise and Command Responsibility by Kai Ambos, Professor of Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure, Comparative Law and International Criminal Law at the University of G√∂ttingen; Judge at the State Court (Landgericht) G√∂ttingen, Journal of International Criminal Justice, originally published online on January 25, 2007Command Responsibility The Mens Rea Requirement, By Eugenia Levine, Global Policy Forum, February 2005 Tort law In the law of negligence, if the defendant's conduct took the form of an omission, rather than a positive act, then it will be more difficult to establish that she owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. The rationale is that a positive duty is more onerous to fulfill than a negative duty, and therefore limits more severely the liberty of the duty-bearer.

Beside the single locomotive M62 also twin versions 2M62 and triple versions 3M62 have been built. A total number of 7164 single sections have been produced, which have been used to build 5231 locomotives. History According to the Comecon directives production of heavy diesel locomotives among Eastern Bloc countries was left exclusively to Romania and the Soviet Union. The first few prototypes of this heavy freight locomotive were ready in 1964 and their first destination outside the Soviet Union was Hungary. A total number of 723 units were produced in the Soviet Union. Operators=Soviet Union M62 First made M62-1 From 1970 till 1976 the former Soviet Union Railway (SZhD) received 723 engines M62, further 13 M62U have been delivered from 1989 till 1990. These engines were single 3M62U sections. For the Soviet military 154 locomotives named DM62 were built. These engines have been modified for pulling SS-24 Scalpel ballistic rocket launcher trains. For industrial railroads 39 engines of the version M62UP have been built . These engines had improved trucks, larger fuel tanks and modified exhaust silencers. Poland ST44 ST44-968 ST44-133 In the early 1960s an urgent need appeared in Poland for a heavy freight diesel locomotive. The Polish industry at the time was not able to produce such a locomotive, so a decision was made to import a large number of M62 locomotives from the Soviet Union, which were already imported by Hungarian M√ÅV. In Poland those machines received ST44 designation During first-revision repairs all locomotives had front lights changed from small ones into standard, Polish large types. The decision is said to have been made after Poland had started to import ST43 locomotives from Romania and was probably influenced directly from the Soviet Union. For political reasons, the Soviet Union simply forced Poland to buy Soviet instead of Romanian locomotives, as it preferred satellite countries not to export their products. The first four locomotives, produced by the Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Factory (in today's Lugansk, Ukraine), were delivered to Poland in September 1965. Deliveries continued until 1988, with 1,191 locomotives delivered in total (1,114 for PKP, 68 for LHS and 9 for industry). One of the locomotives (ST44-1500 ‚Äì producer's designation M63) had bogies and traction engines exchanged with newer types which allowed it to achieve a higher top speed. The series, with numbers between 2001 and 2068 was imported to run on the LHS broad gauge line. In addition to a different gauge, this series was equipped with an automatic coupling system. There were several reasons for importing M62 locomotives to Poland, and today's views on this decision are quite ambiguous. The locomotive was more powerful than even the strongest of the Polish steam locomotives used for freight transport in those days, yet it could not haul passenger trains (due to lack of carriage heating devices) and caused huge damage to the railway tracks. Another important weakness of the M62 locomotive was with its vast fuel consumption. The advantages of this machine though are a fairly simple construction coupled with a largely reliable diesel-electric transmission. Intensive electrification of Polish railways caused the relatively new ST44 locomotives to be mothballed into reserve stock. Many machines withdrawn from PKP found their place among industrial and private railways, where they only bore the producer's M62 designation. =Present use= ST44-321 Heavy fuel and oil consumption as well as heavy wear caused to the tracks has resulted in Polish State Railways reducing the use of the class. In 2007 many of them still remain in service with PKP for freight use, although most of them have now been stored. Some routes (e.g. Gdynia - Hel line) forbid the running of the ST44 class because this class's excessive weight causes serious damage to lightly built track work. The locomotives that are still in use in large numbers, are owned and operated by private railroad companies, as well as the LHS broad gauge lines. Today around 50 of the class are located at Zamo≈õƒá Engine Shed, and it has been decided to mothball them for the moment. In 2005, two ST44 locomotives were completely rebuilt by Bumar-Fablok S.A. and delivered to the LHS line. Changes made included new Caterpillar 3516B HD Diesel Engines and Primary Alternators. These locomotives were designated as 3001 and 3002. North Korea K62 Naey≈èn 706, a Soviet-built M62-type diesel locomotive obtained second-hand from Germany Because of its low maintenance requirements M62 locomotive is quite popular with the Korean State Railway of the North Korea, where they serve not only on non-electrified lines but on electrified ones as well. 64 locomotives of this type were imported from the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation between 1967 and 1995, numbered in the ÎÇ¥Ïó∞6xx (Naey≈èn 6xx) series.Kokubu, Hayato, Â∞ÜËªçÊßò„ÅÆÈâÑÈÅì (Sh≈çgun-sama no Tetsud≈ç), Between the years 1996 and 1998 31 locomotives were delivered from Deutsche Bahn. In 2000 six units were delivered from Slovakian Railways and 13 units from Polish State Railways. None of the delivered locomotives was painted in standard North Korean livery (which is light blue over green) and they still bear the same livery as in previous service, except the former German ones, which were given a different, green livery. Those units acquired from Germany are numbered in the ÎÇ¥Ïó∞7xx (Naey≈èn 7xx) series, while those acquired from Poland and Slovakia are numbered in the ÎÇ¥Ïó∞8xx (Naey≈èn 8xx) series. K≈≠ms≈èng 8002, a North Korean- built copy of the M62. Locomotive Naey≈èn 602 has a special red tablet mounted on it that states that this machine was personally inspected by Kim Il-sung. Two copies were built in North Korea, numbers 8001 and 8002, and given the designation ‚ÄúK≈≠ms≈èng‚Äù (‚ÄúVenus‚Äù). 8002 has been on display at the Museum of the Three Revolutions since its construction, while 8001 is in regular service. At least 15 North Korean M62 locomotives were converted to electric locomotives by Kim Ch≈èng-tae Electric Locomotive Works in 1998. This is presumed to be quite easy, as the overhead voltage in North Korea is 3000 V. Numbered 1.5-01 to 1.5-15, these are known as the Kanghaenggun-class (Í∞ïÌñâÍµ∞, \\"Forced March\\"). Germany BR 120 A total of 396 locomotives were sent to East Germany between 1966 and 1978, most of which ended up at the Deutsche Reichsbahn with some being delivered to East German industry. The Reichsbahn used the M62 locomotives at first under the designation V 200, while later reclassifying those units as BR 120\\\\. After the reunification of Germany and subsequent merger of the Deutsche Reichsbahn into the Bundesbahn the class designation was changed to BR 220 for the Deutsche Bundesbahn, as the original class number was already in use for the electric BR 120, and class designation ranges 100-199 were reserved for electric locomotives under the Bundesbahn's scheme. However, they were quickly phased out and by the end of 1994 the class had all but disappeared, with 31 units from Germany having been sold to North Korea. Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic class 781 Czech 781.600 locomotive in museum Between 1966 and 1979 a total of 599 locomotives were imported into Czechoslovakia where at first they were given a T679.1 designation for standard-gauge locomotives and T679.5 for broad-gauge machines. Later in 1988 those numbers were changed to 781 and 781.8 respectively. Those machines were working in the Czech Republic and Slovakia until 2002. Hungary M62 Hungarian locomotive M62 271 From 1965 till 1978 the Hungarian State Railways M√ÅV received 294 locomotives named M62. The M62 001 was actually the first M62 ever built, and is still running. A program to replace the original, very outdated two-stroke Kolomna 14D40 power plants with a modern, more efficient engine was started in 1997, with the first locomotive, M62 301 debuting in early 2001. M62 301, 303 and 304 received MTU, the rest Caterpillar power plants. The program also included a thorough overhaul of the locomotives, including fitting better equipment for the driver, air conditioning, improved electrical system, etc. The 34 remotorized locomotives (M62 301-335) have been renamed M62.3 and received the nicknames \\"Remot-Szergej\\" for remotorized Szergej, \\"Csendes\\" meaning quiet, as well as \\"Cs√∂rg≈ës\\" because of the rattling sound made by the engine. Between 1970 and 1978, M√ÅV purchased 15 locomotives M62.5 with bogies for the Russian broad gauge. Three more M62.5 have been rebuilt from standard gauge M62. The broad- gauge engines are used for operation near Zahony in the border region of the former Soviet Union (now Ukraine). In 2005 still seven M62.5 have been in use. 1972 also the Raab-Oedenburg-Ebenfurther Eisenbahn (Gy≈ër-Sopron-Ebenfurti Vas√∫t, GySEV), an Austro-Hungarian joint venture, received six standard-gauge locomotives named M62.9. The locomotives were stationed in Sopron but were scrapped in 1996. Cuba class M-62K Twenty locomotives, named M-62K class were shipped to Cuba between 1974 and 1975 and subsequently used by the Ferrocarriles de Cuba. The \\"K\\" designation comes after the Russian spelling of the name Cuba, \\"–ö—É–±–∞\\".) Though most of these machines are no longer in service on the island, one of them, numbered 61602 is on display at the National Railroad Museum in Havana. This one was driven by Fidel Castro on the inauguration of a tram between Cumbre and Placetas in the center of the country. Other surviving M-62Ks have been spotted in the central city of Cienfuegos; these are numbered 61611 and 61605. (See photo here:) Mongolia M62 From 1980 till 1990 MTZ received 13 single units M62UM and 66 twin units 2M62M. Technical data=Overview The M62 locomotive has a Co-Co wheel arrangement, running on two bogies with three axles on each bogie. Chassis and bogie frames are constructed out of box elements. The two-stroke diesel engine and the main alternator are mounted on a steel frame. The frame is fixed to the chassis with elastic supports. Electric traction motors are mounted on bogie frames with a tram system. M62 is equipped with electro- pneumatic multiple-unit controls; therefore it is possible to drive two locomotives from one cab. The locomotive had enough power to pull a freight train with a top speed of (on level track), while two coupled locomotives are able to pull trains up to . The top speed in such a case was . Comparison with M61 In Hungarian service, the M62 proved inferior to the Swedish- American NOHAB M61, which, while 10 tons lighter and slightly less powerful, could haul 25% more weight with 50-60% of the Soviet engine's fuel consumption. The M61 was unable to run from Budapest to Ny√≠regyh√°za and back without refueling, which led to congestion and timetable problems when the NOHAB was replaced by the M62 on that route. Engines The M62's 14D40 V diesel engine had substandard reliability because it was developed in a short timeframe from scratch, without previous design experience. In the 1950s domestically built Soviet diesel locomotives, having the wider track base and taller tunnel clearances, used vertical opposed-piston engines.Locomotive Panorama Volume II. E.S. Cox. Ian Allan Publishing 1966 (Paperback Edition 1974). Pages 68 to 73 inclusive deal with Mr. Cox's visit to the Soviet Union. These (f.e. Kharkov 2D100/9D100/10D100) were based on the Fairbanks-Morse 38D8 design which, when used for locomotives, was installed by F-M in their H15-44 Hood and H20-44 Hoodroad switcher locomotives, as well as the F-M 'Erie-Built' Passenger and Freight cab units. The Soviet opposed-piston engines, like their US counterparts, were simply too tall to fit in locomotives designed for the standard-gauge railways with the tighter tunnel allowances of Eastern Bloc satellite countries. After the fall of the Soviet Bloc, 31 units of M√ÅV's M62 fleet were rebuilt with Caterpillar engines in the 1990s, but lack of funds stopped further upgrades. No train heating The M62 was a dedicated freight mover and lacked any central heating apparatus for coaches, even though most Soviet satellite-state customers needed to use them in dual cargo/passenger role regularly (Soviet trains of the era were heated with individual per-coach drum fireplaces). In cold times a dedicated heating wagon had to be added to M√ÅV's M62-drawn trains, producing steam from oil-fired boilers (1960-70s era), later on generating electricity for resistor-based heating (1980s era). This proved to be a high-cost solution, in contrast to the M61 NOHAB, which could produce 750 kg of steam per hour using an internal water tank and engine waste heat, with minimal effects on fuel consumption.

As a written language, it benefited from the fact that B√©arn was an independent state from the mid-14th century to 1620. B√©arnese was used in legal and administrative documents long after most other Gascon provinces were incorporated into France. (French definitively replaced B√©arnese for legal documents only in 1789, during the French Revolution). Fondeville's play La pastorala deu paisan  Sociolinguistics  B√©arnese is currently the most prominent variety of Gascon. It is widely used in the normativization attempts to reach a standard Gascon and is the most likely dialect to succeed, due to the stronger cultural identity and output of this area. A 1982 survey of the inhabitants of B√©arn indicated that 51% of the population spoke B√©arnese, 70% understood it, and 85% were in favor of preserving the language.The Ethnologue on Gascon (15th edition) However, use of the language has declined over recent years as B√©arnese is rarely transmitted to younger generations within the family. There is a revival of focus on the language which has improved the situation, though, leading children to be taught the language in school (comparable to the way Irish students are taught a standardized form of Irish). Currently, the majority of the cultural associations consider Gascon (including B√©arnese) an Occitan dialect. However, other authorities consider them to be distinct languages, including Jean Lafitte, publisher of Ligam-DiGam, a linguistic and lexicography review of Gascon.DiGam project A detailed sociolinguistic study presenting the current status of the language (practice and different locutors' perceptions) has been made in 2004 by B. Moreux (see Sources): the majority of native speakers have learned it orally, and tend to be older. On the other hand, the proponents for its maintenance and revival are classified into three groups: B√©arnists, Gasconists and Occitanists, terms which summarize the regional focus they give respectively to their language(s) of interest: B√©arn, Gascony or Occitania. Cyprien Despourrins's obelisk  Literature  Concerning literature and poems, the first important book was a B√©arnese translation of the Psalms of David by Arnaud de Salette, at the end of the 16th century, contemporary with the Gascon (Armagnac dialect) translation of these Psalms by Pey de Garros. Both translations were ordered by Jeanne d'Albret, queen of Navarre and mother of Henry IV of France, to be used at Protestant churches. Henri IV was first Enric III de Navarra, the king of this independent Calvinist and Occitan-speaking state. The B√©arnese dialect was his native language that he also used in letters to his subjects. During the 17th century, the B√©arnese writer Jean-Henri Fondeville (among others) composed plays such as La Pastorala deu Paisan and also his anti-Calvinist Egl√≤gas. Cyprien Despourrins is certainly one of the main 18th-century B√©arnese poets; many of his poems are still B√©arn's folk songs.\\"Mais l'association de la musique et du genre pastioral donnait en B√©arn, au XVIIIe si√®cle une floraison d'un autre type : la chanson. Ce fut l'oeuvre de Cyprien Despourrins (1698-1759).

Robert Lafont, op. cit (448) From the 19th century we can mention poet Xavier Navarrot and also Alexis Peyret, who emigrated to Argentina for political reasons where he edited his B√©arnese poetry.Argentine edition of Peyret's poetry After the creation of the Felibrige, the Escole Gasto√ª F√®bus (which would become Esc√≤la Gaston F√®bus) was created as the B√©arnese part of Fr√©d√©ric Mistral's and Joseph Roumanille's academy.

Several of the songs had appeared on singles in 1965, where their biggest success came in the United Kingdom off the back of \\"The Price Of Love\\" (present on this album) and \\"Love Is Strange\\" (from Beat & Soul), the former of which ascended to No. 2 on the UK Charts, but only No. 104 in America. Included on the album also was the flipside for \\"The Price Of Love\\", \\"It Only Costs A Dime\\", a self-written piece. In December of that year, the final single \\"It's All Over\\" appeared, in an arrangement containing harpsichord and vocals. In a break from the usual routine, however, this song would feature Phil singing the principle vocal line and Don singing the harmony line a third lower. The song would later be covered by Cliff Richard. Revisiting their classic style of singing, they recorded the Sonny Curtis-written \\"I Used To Love You\\". Curtis, former member of The Crickets, had previously written another Everly Brothers hit single, \\"Walk Right Back\\". For the first 45 release of 1966, they visited the songwriting partnership of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, with a rendition of \\"Glitter And Gold\\". This arrangement, featuring fuzz guitar and harpsichord, was backed with another Brill Building number, the Howard Greenfield and Jack Keller-written \\"Lovey Kravezit\\". With hardly enough time to gauge the success of this single \\"(You Got) The Power of Love\\" (written by Delaney Bramlett and Joey Cooper), containing Motown influences aplenty and backed with \\"Leave My Girl Alone\\", was to hit the stores. Filling out the album, \\"The Doll House Is Empty\\" (later to become Warner Brothers single 5689 in February 1966), the mainstream-orientated \\"(Why Am I) Chained To A Memory\\" (Edward A.

Most of the narratives embodying Hittite mythology are lost, and the elements that would give a balanced view of Hittite religion are lacking among the tablets recovered at the Hittite capital Hattusa and other Hittite sites. Thus, \\"there are no canonical scriptures, no theological disquisitions or discourses, no aids to private devotion\\".Gary Beckman, \\"The Religion of the Hittites\\", The Biblical Archaeologist 52.2/3, (June - September 1989:98-108) noting E. Laroche, Catalogue des textes hittites 1971, and K. Bittel, Hattusa, the Capital of the Hittites, 1970. Some religious documents formed part of the corpus with which young scribes were trained, and have survived, most of them dating from the last several decades before the final burning of the sites. The scribes in the royal administration, some of whose archives survive, were a bureaucracy, organizing and maintaining royal responsibilities in areas that would be considered part of religion today: temple organization, cultic administration, reports of diviners, make up the main body of surviving texts.J. G. Macqueen, '\\"Hattian Mythology and Hittite Monarchy'\\", Anatolian Studies (1959). The understanding of Hittite mythology depends on readings of surviving stone carvings, deciphering of the iconology represented in seal stones, interpreting ground plans of temples: additionally, there are a few images of deities, for the Hittites often worshipped their gods through Huwasi stones, which represented deities and were treated as sacred objects. Gods were often depicted standing on the backs of their respective beasts, or may have been identifiable in their animal form.R.Lebrun, \\"Le zoomorphisme dans la religion hittite,\\" L'Animal, l'homme, le dieu dans le Proche-Orient ancien, (Leuven) 1985:95-103, noted in Beckman 1989. Overview Though drawing on ancient Mesopotamian religion, the religion of the Hittites and Luwians retains noticeable elements of reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion. For example, Tarhunt, the god of thunder and his conflict with the serpent Illuyanka resembles the conflict between Indra and the cosmic serpent Vritra in Vedic mythology, or Thor and the serpent J√∂rmungandr in Norse mythology. This myth also bears a resemblance to the daily struggle between Re and the serpent Apophis in Egyptian mythology. Hittite mythology was also influenced more directly by the Hurrians, a neighboring civilization close to Anatolia, where the Hittites were located. Hurrian mythology was so closely related that Oxford University Press published a guide to mythology and categorized Hittite and Hurrian mythology together as \\"Hittite-Hurrian\\".Leeming, David. \\"Hittite- Hurrian Mythology.\\" The Oxford Companion to World Mythology. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. 185-7. Unfortunately, much of the knowledge about the Hittites has come from artistic, rather than textual, sources, making it difficult to ascertain specific details on this topic.√únal, Ahmet. \\"The Power of Narrative in Hittite Literature.\\" Across the Anatolian Plateau. Boston, MA: American Schools of Oriental Research, 2001. 99-121. Hittite tablets regarding mythology often date back toward the end of the Old Hittite Kingdom, with significantly fewer sources beyond that. Groups of Hittite documents that are found are called \\"cult-inventories\\" and are valuable in learning about how Hittite myth and practice was included in daily life.Cammarosano, Michele. \\"Hittite Cult Inventories ‚Äî Part One: The Hittite Cult Inventories as Textual Genre.\\" Die Welt Des Orients 43, no. 1 (2013): 63-105. Hittite mythology is a mix of Hattian, Hurrian and Hittite influences. Mesopotamian and Canaanite influences enter the mythology of Anatolia through Hurrian mythology. There are no known details of what the Hittite creation myth may have been but scholars speculate that the Hattian mother goddess who is believed to be connected to the \\"great goddess\\" concept known from the Neolithic site √áatal H√ºy√ºk may have been a consort of the Anatolian storm god (who is believed to be related to comparable deities from other traditions like Thor, Indra and Zeus). Priests and cult sites The liminal figure mediating between the intimately connected worlds of gods and mankind was the king and priest; in a ritual dating from the Hittite Old Kingdom period: Hittite statue of a priest- king > The gods, the Sun-God and the Storm-God, have entrusted to me, the king, the > land and my household, so that I, the king, should protect my land and my > household, for myself.Quoted in Beckman 1985:101. The Hittites did not perform regularly scheduled ceremonies to appease the gods, but instead conducted rituals in answer to hard times or to mark occasions. Myth and ritual were closely related, as many rituals were based on myth, and often involved performing the stories.Bachvarova, Mary R. \\"Adapting Mesopotamian Myth in Hurro-Hittite Rituals at Hattu≈°a: I≈°tar, the Underworld, and the Legendary Kings,\\" in Beyond Hatti: A Tribute to Gary Beckman, edited by Billie Jean Collins and Piotr Michalowski. Atlanta, Ga.: Lockwood Press, 2013. 23-44. Many of the rituals were performed at pits, sites that were created to represent a closeness between man and the gods, particularly those that were chthonic, or related to the earth. This type of pit ritual is known as \\"necromantic\\", because they were attempting to commune with gods of the Underworld and summon them to the living world. The city of Arinna, a day's march from Hattusa, was perhaps the major cult center of the Hittites, and certainly of their major sun goddess, known as dUTU URUArinna \\"sun goddess of Arinna\\". Records found in cult-inventories show that local cults and practices were also active. Traditions and the status of local cults were constantly changing due to the lack of a national standard for ritual practice. Smaller festivals and times of worship did not always require the priest-king's presence, so local places had more leeway when it came to worshiping the gods, however the king did make a point to observe every cult site and temple on his lands, since that was his duty to the gods and to his people. Once the king died, he was deified, having served his people and worshiped the gods faithfully. Responsibilities placed upon the priest-king were not one-sided: the gods had to provide for the people if they were being worshiped properly. Gods held much of the obvious power, but without dedicated practice and ritual from mortals, they couldn't function. King Mursili II made a plea to the gods on behalf of his subjects, at a time when their agricultural livelihoods were struggling: > \\"All of the land of Hatti is dying, so that no one prepares the sacrificial > loaf and libation for you (the gods). The plowmen who used to work the > fields of the gods have died, so that no one works or reaps the fields of > the gods any longer. The miller-women who used to prepare sacrificial loaves > of the gods have died, so that they no longer make the sacrificial loaves. > As for the corral and the sheepfold from which one used to cull the > offerings of sheep and cattle- the cowherds and shepherds have died, and the > corral and sheepfold are empty. So it happens that the sacrificial loaves, > libation[s], and animal sacrifices are cut off. And you come to us, o gods, > and hold us culpable in this matter!\\"Quote from KUB 24.3 ii 4'-17' Obviously, the preservation of good relationships with deities that were closely affiliated with nature and agriculture, such as Arinna, would have been essential. If the balance between respect and criticism was significantly shifted, it could mean disfavor in the eyes of the gods, and likely a very unlucky harvest season at the very least. Despite this danger, the Hittites mostly communicated with their gods in an informal manner, and individuals often simply made requests of the gods without the accompaniment of rituals or the assistance of priests when the occasion was casual. The Hittites also utilized associations with the divine in a way similar to the ancient Egyptians, using the will of the gods to justify human actions. Deities and their myths Mythological creatures, Lion-headed man and Bull-legged man Similar to other kingdoms at the time, the Hittites had a habit of adopting gods from other pantheons that they came into contact with, such as the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, who is celebrated at her famous temple at Ain Dara. The Hittites referred to their own \\"thousand gods\\", of whom a staggering number appear in inscriptions but remain nothing more than names today.E. Laroche, Recherches sur les noms des dieux hittites, 1947; O.R. Gurney, Some aspects of Hittite religion (Schweich Lectures, 1976) 1977:4-23. This multiplicity has been ascribed to a Hittite resistance to syncretization: \\"many Hittite towns maintained individual storm-gods, declining to identify the local deities as manifestations of a single national figure,\\" Gary Beckman observed.Beckman 1985:99. The multiplicity is doubtless an artifact of a level of social-political localization within the Hittite \\"empire\\" not easily reconstructed. For example, the Hittites believed the Bronze Age cult centre of Nerik,V. Haas, Der Kult von Nerik(series Studia Pohl 4), 1970. to the north of the capitals Hattusa and Sapinuwa, was sacred to a local storm god who was the son of Wurusemu, sun goddess of Arinna; he was propitiated from Hattusa: The weather god was identified there with Mount Zaliyanu near Nerik, responsible for assigning rain to the city's croplands. Among the crowd a few stand out as more than local: Tarhunt has a son, Telipinu and a daughter, Inara. Inara is a protective deity (dLAMMA) involved with the Puruli spring festival. Ishara is a goddess of the oath; lists of divine witnesses to treaties seem to represent the Hittite pantheon most clearly,G. Kestemont, \\"Le Panth√©on des instruments hittites de droit public\\" Orientalia 45 (1976:147-77).. though some well-attested gods are inexplicably missing. His consort is the Hattic solar deity. This divine couple were presumably worshipped in the twin cellas of the largest temple at Hattusa. gods of the underworld In the 13th century BC some explicit gestures toward syncretism appear in inscriptions. Puduhepa, a queen and priestess, worked on organizing and rationalizing her people's religion.Trevor Bryce, The Kingdom of the Hittites :286-89 In an inscription she invokes: > Sun-Goddes of Arinna, my lady, you are the queen of all lands! In the land > of Hatti you have assumed the name of Sun-Goddess of Arinna, but in respect > to the land which you made of cedars,Coastal Syria is intended. you have > assumed the name Hebat.Quoted in Beckman 1985:99f. Kumarbi is the father of Tarhunt; his role in the Song of Kumarbi is reminiscent of that of Cronus in the Theogony of Hesiod. Ullikummi is a stone monster fathered by Kumarbi, reminiscent of Hesiod's Typhon. The Luwian god of weather and lightning, Pihassassa, may be at the origin of Greek Pegasus. Depictions of hybrid animals (like hippogriffs, chimerae etc.) are typical for the Anatolian art of the period. In the Telipinu myth, the disappearance of Telipinu, god of agriculture and fertility causes all fertility to fail, both plant and animal. This results in devastation and despair among gods and humans alike. In order to stop the havoc and devastation, the gods seek Telipinu but fail to find him. Only a bee sent by the goddess Hannahannah finds Telipinu, and stings him in order to wake him up. However this infuriates Telipinu further and he \\"diverts the flow of rivers and shatters the houses\\". In the end, the goddess Kamrusepa uses healing and magic to calm Telipinu after which he returns home and restores the vegetation and fertility. In other references it is a mortal priest who prays for all of Telipinu's anger to be sent to bronze containers in the underworld, of which nothing escapes.The Ancient Near East, J.B.Pickard, p 88 Many of the Hittite myths involve a full cast of characters, usually because the problem has widespread effects so everyone gets involved. Usually, the solution can only be found by working together to overcome the issue, although these are less wholesome ethical stories and more action-based epics with an ensemble cast. Another myth reflecting this style of plot is \\"The Slaying of the Dragon.\\" This myth was recited during New Year rituals, which were performed to ensure agricultural prosperity in the coming year. The myth centers around a serpent (or dragon) that represents the \\"forces of evil\\" and defeats the Storm God in a fight. The goddess Inara comes up with a plan to trick and kill the serpent, and enlists a human, ·∏™upa≈°iya, to help. ·∏™upa≈°iya is, of course, reluctant to assist without some kind of incentive, so he gets Inara to sleep with him before they carry out her scheme. Inara then invites the serpent over and they have a feast, getting so drunk that ·∏™upa≈°iya is able to tie the serpent up. The Storm God then steps in and slays the serpent himself. Much like in the Telipinu myth, a human was used to help the gods in their plots, which further emphasizes the familiar relationship between mortal and divine. The mortal doesn't have much of a role in the story, but his presence is a help rather than hindrance. It also highlights the roles that goddesses played, within myth and in life. The powerful gods provoke a fight or do something else to create the central issue of each myth, and then the goddesses clean up after them and solve everything with intellect. Unfortunately despite their helpful interference, nature cannot return to its status quo until the god completes the final step before normality sets in. He must wake up and resume his duties, or kill the beast, or some other action that proves his power is beyond all others. Myths regarding deities that were not originally Hittite were often adapted and assimilated. The Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar (I≈°tar) was one of the many adopted deities who were assimilated into Hittite pantheons through association with similar deities and adjustments to their myths. Since mythology was a large part of Hittite cult practice, an understanding of Ishtar‚Äôs powers and history was essential to the development of rituals and incantations invoking her. Subtle changes like this were also made possible with her absorption/close association of other goddesses, namely Anzili, as well as ≈†awu≈°ka, and Ge≈°tinanna. With the personality traits of multiple other goddesses, Ishtar's power grew, as did her popularity. One innovative way that she was utilized was in purification rituals such as Allaiturahhi‚Äôs, in which her affinity for the underworld was exploited and interpreted in a way that benefited the reader and cast her as a protector, rather than a victim, as in Mesopotamian myth. Ishtar's relationship with the underworld also made her a valuable chthonic deity, especially when her other affinities for war, sexuality, and magic were considered. The combination of these characteristics greatly increased her influence, as fertility of the earth was one of the most fundamental priorities for the Hittites. The Hittites even recognized that she was fairly prominent in other cultures and created a ritual which \\"treats her as an international goddess\\".Quoted from Bachvarova 2013: 27 The differences between outsider deities like Ishtar were respected, even though she had been appropriated for Hittite usage.

The station's studio is located at Design Center of the Philippines, Vicente Sotto Street, CCP Complex, Pasay City (beside Star City); while its transmitter is located at I. Marcelo Street, Brgy. Malanday, Valenzuela City. The station has nationwide coverage via relay stations located within the Philippines. DZRH is the oldest radio station in the Philippines. The station celebrated its 80th anniversary last July 15, 2019. History=The Heacock era DZRH first went on air as KZRH on July 15, 1939, after being founded by Samuel Gaches, the owner of H. E. Heacock Company, a department store based in Escolta, Binondo, Manila, with Hal Bowie as the station's first announcer. KZRH, which was broadcasting using the frequency of 650 kHz with the power of 10,000 watts; and became the fourth commercial radio station in the Philippines. Later in 1940, it bought KZRC (now DYRC) from Isaac Beck in Cebu City. KZRH's radio broadcasts centered on musical, variety shows, comedy skits and short newscasts. Jazz and ballads became standard fare. At that time, KZRH broadcasts were in English. During the outbreak of the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese troops took over the stations and KZRH was rebranded PIAM (\\"Philippine Islands AM\\"), becoming a tool for the Second Republic's propaganda. The birth of MBC; expansion of DZRH After World War II, the Elizalde brothers (Federico \\"Fred\\", Joaquin Miguel \\"Mike\\" and Manuel \\"Manolo\\") took over KZRH and KYRC. With the help of station manager Bertrand Silen, KZRH transferred its operations to the Insular Life Building in Plaza Cervantes. In June 1946, the Elizaldes established KZRH as the flagship of the country's pioneer radio network under the Manila Broadcasting Company (initially known as Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation; incorporated on September 30, 1947). KZRH returned to the airwaves on July 1, 1946. On July 4, 1946, it aired the live coverage of the Philippine independence from the United States and the inauguration of the third Philippine Republic. With this, the station gradually gave way to Tagalog language broadcasts. In 1948, after the international telecommunications conference in the United States where the Philippines changed its first letter to \\"D\\", KZRH changed its callsign to DZRH, and has been expanded to over 30 stations nationwide. The same year, MBC launched its sister station in Manila, DZMB and DZPI. In 1949, DZRH began airing the first radio drama, Gulong ng Palad (\\"Wheel of Fortune\\"). Radio drama is one of the traditions of Philippine radio before the rise of television industry and continues until today this time on the FM band (only Ito ang Palad Ko !, \\"This is my fate\\", one of the longest-running drama anthology series since 1973). Martial Law era In 1972, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law, DZRH was temporarily closed for a few months. It was reopened but only under strict government censorship. It was the only other time in DZRH's history since the Second World War that the station's broadcast operations were interrupted. Upon resumption of broadcasts, DZRH (along with sister stations DZMB and DZPI) gained a new studio complex at San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City at that time. In November 1978, DZRH moved from 650 kHz to the current frequency at 666 kHz due to the switch of the Philippine AM dial from the NARBA-mandated 10 kHz spacing to the 9 kHz rule implemented by the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975. In the same year, DZRH launched Operation Tulong (\\"Help\\"), a socio-civic organization that helps the people in time of need. In February 1986, the station covered the controversial snap elections and the ensuing People Power Revolution that peacefully deposed President Marcos and installed President Corazon Aquino. Post-People Power Revolution In 1988, DZRH moved from the former studio at San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City, to its new studio location at FJE Bldg., Makati City. In 1989, DZRH celebrated its 50th golden anniversary by launching \\"50 Taon ng Radyo\\" (\\"50 Years of Radio\\") on Sunday, July 23, 1989. Ceremonies and events held at Rizal Memorial Stadium and Araneta Coliseum included parades, games, concerts, as well as outdoor and indoor fireworks displays. In 1991, radio veteran Joe Taruc joined the station, where he hosted Damdaming Bayan which is now the longest-running public affairs program, as well as a morning newscast. Aside from being a newscaster, he was also station manager, and later, Senior Vice-President until his death in September 2017. In 1994, as part of their 55th anniversary, DZRH launched its own nationwide satellite radio broadcast reaching 97% of the Philippine populace. Thus, the slogan is \\"One Nation, One Station\\"; and at the same time, DZRH became the first AM station to broadcast in full AM stereo signal, equipped with an upgraded 50,000 watt solid-state digital transmitter. It also bought some of the broadcast veterans such as Jay Sonza, Rey Langit and Ka Louie Beltran. In July 2002, DZRH, along with other MBC stations, transferred from FJE Bldg. in Makati, to its current studios at MBC Building, Sotto St., CCP Complex on Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City. In October 2007, DZRH once again ventured into television broadcasting with the launch of DZRH RadyoVision (which is not related to the now defunct VHF TV station DZRH-TV Channel 11), which was renamed RHTV in 2008 and DZRH News Television in 2013. The channel is currently being seen on Cignal Channel 18, SkyCable Channel 129, CableLink Channel 3 and some cable TV affiliates nationwide, on Digital Terrestrial TV via Channel 43 in Cebu City, and Channel 39 in Bacolod; and worldwide via livestreaming on their official website. It is also the first cable channel to broadcast via Facebook Live by mirroring the live stream of DZRH News Television to the Facebook servers. In 2009, DZRH celebrated its 70th anniversary by launching of the \\"Fiesta Sitenta\\" as well as the launch of its first ever theme song commissioned for the station. In the final quarter of 2011, DZRH did changes in their programming line-up as well as the adoption of the new slogan \\"RH Agad!\\" (\\"RH right now\\"). In 2012, DZRH launched its new slogan, \\"Ang Makabagong Bayanihan\\" (\\"The Modern Spirit of Volunteerism\\") and also includes the theme song of the station (still heard in the station IDs of the station up to this day). DZRH celebrated its Diamond Jubilee on July 15, 2014 at the Manila Hotel with the launching of the coffee- table book and the special commemorative stamp courtesy of PhilPost. In 2015, DZRH celebrated its 76th anniversary with the theme 76 Taon ng Balita at Serbisyo (\\"76 years of News and Service\\"). In 2016, DZRH celebrated its 77th anniversary with the theme \\"77 Years: Serbisyong tapat sa inyo\\". In 2017, DZRH celebrated its 78th anniversary with the theme \\"78 taon ng Tamang Balita at Tamang Serbisyo sa Bawat Pilipino\\". In 2018, DZRH celebrated its 79th anniversary with the theme \\"Walong Dekada ng Tamang Pagbabalita at Tamang Paglilingkod\\". In October 2018, DZRH again aired its classic top-of-the-hour ID (which was launched on January 1, 1999 featuring the voice of Nick de Guzman) on a one-off airing basis, although the 2012 \\"Ang Makabagong Bayanihan\\" station ID continues to air on a regular basis. On the same month, DZRH launched its new slogan, \\"DZRH: Ang Kaunaunahan sa Pilipinas\\" (\\"DZRH: The First in the Philippines\\") in preparations for the 80th anniversary of the station in 2019. On October 2, 2019, the studios of DZRH in MBC Building, along with its sister MBC Manila radio stations, were affected by a major fire that originated in the nearby Star City theme park, prompting the station to suspend regular programming.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/710107/fire-hits-part- of-star-city/story In interim, DZRH broadcasts from its backup studio in BSA Twin Towers, where the transmitters of its FM counterparts are located, where it played automated music throughout the day. Regular programming resumed at the following day (October 3) at 4 am, with video streaming for the station's social media accounts and simulcast nationwide satellite relay feed restored later; but the audio live streaming and DZRH News Television channel for cable, DTH and regional digital TV remained off air until November 26 only on TV. On November 11, DZRH moved its studio at Design Center of the Philippines which is near the MBC Building. In March 2020, DZRH temporarily suspends its regular programming, especially radio dramas and DZRH News Television programs, in line with the enhanced community quarantine imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which replaced them with news updates.

It won the Silver Dragon Prize in Krakow, Poland, and was broadcast by the BBC, CBC and ABC Scope in the US, as well as being added to medical school curricula. Graef commented in a BBC interview in 2014 that \\"nobody had ever seen them as people, they had only seen them as cases and it entered medical school curricula immediately because doctors had never seen them at home\\".BBC Radio 4 Front Row radio interview with Roger Graef broadcast 19:15hrs, 13 June 2014. Graef's film The Life and Times of John Huston, Esq for the BBC, CBC and NET in the US, was one of the first documentary co-productions for television.

First of all Thatcher talked about it in parliament, it was on CBS news in America and also in Sweden and other places. Our film came after three very controversial rape cases the week before and the police quietly changed the way they handled rape\\".

It is the monetary unit of account of the principal economic environment in which an economic entity operates. International Accounting Standards (IAS) and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) provide rules for translation of foreign currency transactions and financial statements. SFAS 52 introduced the concept of functional currency, defined as \\"the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates; normally, that is, the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash.\\" Businesses may enter into transactions (sales, payments, etc.) in multiple currencies. Each qualified business unit (QBU) of the business translates these items to its functional currency at an appropriate exchange rate. It then prepares periodic reports of its position (balance sheet) and activity (income and cash flow statements) in that functional currency. When various QBUs are combined, these reports are translated and consolidated to become financial statements. Translation of statements may result in translation differences, which are accounted for as a cumulative translation adjustment. Transactions are often translated at the spot rate, i.e., the rate of exchange between the transaction currency and the functional currency on the date of the transaction. Example: Jim is traveling on business and pays a hotel bill for SFR 200. Jim's home currency is the GBP. On the date Jim pays the bill, the exchange rate is SFR2 = GBP 1. Jim records an expense of GBP 100. Alternatively, businesses may record transactions in another currency using some sort of standard rate for some period, such as the average rate for the month. Businesses using the accrual method of accounting may recognize revenue or expense in one period and receive or pay it in another. In the intervening period the exchange rate may have changed. When an accrued item is settled, the difference due to exchange rate movement in the amount accrued and the amount settled is treated as foreign exchange gain or loss. This gain or loss is recognized in the same manner as the underlying transactions, such as an ordinary travel expense.

It was first published as a d≈çjinshi in 1983, and was later reprinted in tank≈çbon format by Seishinsha in 1985. The series was later adapted into an OVA in 1987 which was directed by Hiroyuki Kitakubo. AIC and Animate provided the animation/production while Bandai Visual was chosen as the distributor. The OVA is very loosely based on one of the chapters of the manga and centers around the efforts of a female journalist named Sybel, trying to save a young girl from an out-of-control military android created by the girl's grandfather. Plot=OVA A military transport chopper is flying to an undisclosed location with secret cargo ‚Äì two fully equipped, but un-programmed M-66 battle androids. It becomes apparent that the chopper is suffering from some sort of attack, as one of the turbines flares up before exploding. Both men evacuate the doomed craft and it crashes in a remote forest miles away from Center City, and both of the M-66's storage pods are thrown from the wreckage. The pods open as the M-66s automatically begin their mission. Sybel, a freelance journalist, receives an intercepted Military Broadband Transmission and loads up her equipment to go see what type of footage she can get of the event to sell to the major networks. She's joined by Leakey, her cameraman. Rushing to the scene of the accident, the two of them abandon their truck and try to sneak closer to the crash site, which has already been sealed and cordoned off by the military's retrieval teams. The military's Special Ops Forces are directed by a professional soldier who is identified only as the 'Major', his status rank. Among the retrieval team is the assistant professor of the android's main design programmer. The M-66s are active searching out their target as well, this becomes apparent when the lead designer, Professor Matthews arrives at the site and talks to Professor Slade, his assistant. It seems that Slade loaded a 'dummy' program into the M-66s before they were transported, which mimics an actual mission engagement. Professor Matthews tells the Major that the SpecOps Forces must find and rescue his granddaughter Ferris, as she is the target the M-66s have been tasked with killing. The Major decides that the best course of action is to confront the androids on their way into the city area, and he sets a trap for both of the cunning machines. Sybel and Leakey, meanwhile ‚Äì had been captured by the SpecOps Forces in the forest, their equipment was taken, and they were arrested. Both were to be administered a shot of sodium pentothal ‚Äì but only Leakey is given the shot- the android's arrival at the soldier's temporary base allows Sybel enough time to try to knock out the guard, but she is ineffective and he shouts at her to quit resisting. Another soldier walks over to their vehicle with a machine gun, and the guard shouts at him to watch Sybel and Leakey, before jumping out to run and join in the battle. Actually mortally wounded, the soldier falls forward and dies, and Sybel takes advantage of the situation to get herself and Leakey out of there. Despite the Major's best advances and planning, the androids engage his men and kill the majority of them, before his soldiers deploy a magnetic device which shuts down the androids for a limited time. Using the device, the soldiers manage to pin one of the M-66s on the hood of a transport vehicles and restrain it using nets. However just before they can retrieve the android, it self-destructs, which propels 20,000 small bore projectiles embedded within its skin in every direction. The Major's surviving forces turn their attention to the remaining M-66, which easily beats them back and then makes its own escape by jumping into the air and disappearing into the surrounding forest. Beaten, but not one to give up easily, the Major regroups his forces and calls for a transport craft to pick them up. Sybel and Leakey make it back to their truck, and Sybel drops Leakey off with the film to go sell to the networks while she tries to get more information on what has happened. By accident, she discovers Professor Matthew's house deep in the forest. It has been ransacked by the surviving M-66. She then listens as a voicemail message begins playback. It is Professor Matthew's granddaughter Ferris saying that she will be home late and that she is out with friends at a restaurant in the city. Sybel realizes that the M-66 must have heard this same message and has gone to kill Ferris. In her haste, Sybel arrives at the restaurant and finds Ferris, who is reluctant to follow her. Sybel has to tell Ferris that the M-66 is there to kill her, and from then on, it's a fight to stay alive for both Sybel and Ferris- with help from the Major and his SpecOps Forces running defense against the unstoppable android. Sybel and Ferris make their way up the skyscraper, pursued by the android as it dispatches the soldiers attempting to escort the pair. As they reach the roof, a fight between the M-66 and a gunship results in the top several floors of the building starting to collapse. As the android closes in, Sybel sets off explosive charges, propelling the M-66 off the tower. Sybel and Ferris are rescued by the military, and the remains of the M-66 are recovered. The Major decides not to arrest Sybel out of gratitude for her assistance, but does confiscate her equipment. Sybel returns home and turns on the news, where it's revealed the incident has been passed off as a terrorist attack. Leaky appears on the news, having sold the footage and taken full credit for it, only to realize too late it includes video of him passed out in the truck. During the credits, scenes play out of Sybel filming various stories, before cutting to a lab where the now-inactive M-66 is placed back into a pod.

Berg wind (from Afrikaans berg \\"mountain\\" + wind \\"wind\\", i.e. a mountain wind) is the South African name for a katabatic wind: a hot dry wind blowing down the Great Escarpment from the high central plateau to the coast. Overview When the air that has been heated on the extensive central plateau flows down the escarpment to the coast it undergoes further warming by adiabatic processes. This accounts for the hot and dry properties of these off-shore winds, wherever they occur along South Africa's coastline.Danielson, Levin, and Abrams (2003). Meteorology, McGraw Hill Although berg winds are often called a F√∂hn winds, this is probably a misnomer, as F√∂hn winds are rain shadow winds that result from air moving over a mountain range, resulting in precipitation on the windward side. This releases latent heat into the atmosphere which is then warmed still further as the air descends on the leeward side (e.g., the Chinook or the original F√∂hn). Berg winds do not originate in precipitation, but in the mostly dry, often arid central plateau of Southern Africa. On the other hand, katabatic winds are technically drainage winds, that carry high density, usually cold air from a high elevation down a slope under the force of gravity. These are thus \\"fall winds\\", which occur most typically down the coastal ice slopes of Antarctica and Greenland. Berg winds blow off the African escarpment in response to large scale weather systems in the South Atlantic Ocean, the African interior, and the Southern Indian Ocean. Coastal lows and berg winds The weather pattern commonly associated with a berg wind and accompanying coastal low along the coast of South Africa. The light blue lines indicate surface wind directions. The \\"H\\" indicates the position of a portion of the South Indian Ocean Anticyclone (high pressure system); the \\"L\\" indicates the position of the coastal low. Berg winds are usually accompanied by coastal lows. These coastal lows owe their existence to the configuration of the plateau, escarpment and coastal plain (see diagram on the right, above), in that they are confined to the coastal areas, always below the escarpment. Though they can arise almost anywhere along the coast, they often first appear on the west coast, or even on the Namibian coast. They are then always propagated counter-clockwise along South Africa's coastline at between 30‚Äì60 km/h, from the west coast southwards to the Cape Peninsula and then eastward along the south coast, and finally north-eastward along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, to finally dissipate north of Durban, due to the divergence of the coastline from the plateau which disappears altogether in the vicinity of the Limpopo valley.Carter, T.J. (2005). The evolution of coastal lows along the coast of South Africa. Masters Thesis, University of Zululand. retrieved 3 June 2015. There is always a hot off-shore berg wind ahead of a coastal low, which can blow for several days or for only for a few hours. This is then followed by cool onshore winds which bring low cloud, fog or drizzle to the region, but may, on occasions, produce substantial precipitation when coupled to an approaching cold front. Coastal lows are a common feature of the coastal weather in South Africa with an average of about 5 lows of varying intensities passing through Port Elizabeth per month. They are shallow (not more than 1000‚Äì1500 m deep), mesoscale (medium-sized) systems that are generally not more than 100‚Äì200 km across, trapped on the coastal plain by the escarpment on the inland side, Coriolis effects on the oceanic side, and an inversion layer above. The pressure minima of these systems lie just off-shore. In the south-west corner of the country the coastal lows are bounded on the inland side by the Cape Fold Mountains, which tend to have a higher elevation than the escarpment, and form an almost continuous 1000 km mountain barrier running parallel to the coast from the Cederberg, 300 km to the north of Cape Town, to Cape Hangklip on the east side of False Bay and then eastwards for 700 km to Port Elizabeth, where they eventually peter out (see the map above). Origin of coastal lows Berg wind blowing desert sand off the Namibian coast. These strong, hot winds are lofting plumes of dust directly out into the Atlantic Ocean in this panoramic image. The southern African equivalent of Santa Ana winds in California, berg winds blow on a few occasions in fall and winter, off all coasts of southern Africa. Other images from the space station have captured these dust plumes. Namibia's great Sand Sea appears here as a reddish zone along part of the coast (centre). The Sand Sea is more than 350 kilometers long, giving a sense of the length of the visible dust plumes. A light-toned sediment plume enters the sea at the mouth of the Orange River (lower left), southern Africa's largest river. Coastal lows are initiated by the interaction of large scale weather systems such as the quasi-permanent South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean Anticyclones (high-pressure systems), the cold fronts that approach the subcontinent from the South Atlantic Ocean, as well as the pressure systems on the plateau, causing air that has been warmed on the plateau by 2‚Äì3 days of sunny weather to flow down the Great Escarpment on to the coastal plain either on the west or south coasts of the country (i.e. causing a berg wind). The descending air warms up adiabatically, heating up the coastal plain, while, at the same time, causing an off-shore wind which blows the surface water away from the land to be replaced by cold water which wells up from the depths. This upwelling of cold subsurface water from the ocean increases the ocean- land temperature difference, causing an on-shore wind. The on-shore airflow is strengthened by the fact that the berg wind is not only hot, but it is also ‚Äústretched‚Äù vertically due to the sudden lowering of the floor over which it moves below the escarpment. Its low density, therefore, lowers the atmospheric pressure on the coast. This low-pressure area caused by the berg wind draws the dense moist maritime air onshore to the right of the off-shore berg wind. Shear forces between these on- and off-shore winds on the right-hand side of the berg wind tend to cause clockwise (or cyclonic) rotation of the air in this region. In addition, on reaching the escarpment the maritime air curves to the right round the low-pressure zone due to Coriolis forces (in the southern hemisphere) accentuating the cyclonic circulation of the \\"coastal low\\". The entire system is capped by an inversion consisting of a layer of warm air that has moved horizontally off the plateau at the level of the upper edge of the escarpment. This inversion layer prevents the upwardly spiraling cyclonic air of the coastal low from rising above 1000‚Äì1500 m, thus preventing it from causing significant precipitation. The weather associated with a coastal low Along the south coast the passage of a coastal low is typically preceded by a north-easterly wind driven by the South Indian Ocean Anticyclone. The wind then backs quickly through northerly to north-westerly as its temperature rises. This is the berg wind phase of the coastal low. The wind then changes abruptly to a strong, cold, south or south-westerly wind (called a ‚Äúbuster‚Äù if the change in wind speed is greater than 35 km/h). The buster coincides with the passage of the pressure minimum. The onshore wind gradually diminishes in intensity during the course of about a day, and is associated with cloudy, misty or drizzly weather. Because of the often abrupt changes in horizontal and vertical wind speeds and direction that can occur within these small weather systems they represent a significant hazard to aircraft on landing and taking off. During the climb-out and approach phases of flight, aircraft airspeed and height are near critical values, thus rendering the aircraft especially susceptible to the adverse effects of these wind shears. The Atlantic cold fronts that move into and across the subcontinent, especially during the cooler months of the year, are frequently associated, the day before, by a coastal low that moves ahead of the front. Under these circumstances the southerly or south-westerly onshore wind of the coastal low gradually diminishes in intensity over the course of 12‚Äì20 hours, when it is replaced by a westerly wind (which may temporarily reach buster proportions) and a further drop in temperature accompanied by rain, indicative of the passage of the cold front. Thus, particularly in Cape Town, an obvious berg wind is generally regarded as a harbinger of cold, wet weather. Other orographically trapped weather systems Coastal lows are orographically trapped weather systems that also occur in other parts of the world, where there are mountain ranges between 1000 ‚Äì 4000 km in length. Thus they occur along the coast of Chile, eastern Australia and the west coast of North America, as well as on the eastern side of the Appalachian mountains of the United States. In each of these cases the weather systems are trapped vertically by stable stratifications, and laterally by Coriolis effects against the mountains. However, only the South African and the South American coastal disturbances are ‚Äúcoastal lows‚Äù; the remainder are generally produced by coastal ridging.

It was the network's attempt to capitalize on the emerging popularity of music videos as seen on MTV. Belinda Carlisle appeared on the first episode. History=Early years Friday Night Videos was initially produced by Dick Ebersol. From 1974 until 1981, in his role as Director of Late Night Programming at NBC, he co-produced The Midnight Special with that series' creator Burt Sugarman. Ebersol departed from The Midnight Special in 1981 to take over as the executive producer at his co-creation with Lorne Michaels, Saturday Night Live. Ebersol replaced Jean Doumanian, who had been promoted from associate producer when Michaels left to take a job at Paramount Pictures and who had dealt with various problems during her tenure, including an instance where Charles Rocket said the expletive \\"fuck\\" on air during a live broadcast which resulted in his termination. While at SNL, Ebersol decided that he would attempt another Friday night music-based program and his idea grew into what would become Friday Night Videos, which would replace SCTV on NBC's weekend late-night lineup in 1983. In its early years, MTV was still a phenomenon that only a minority of Americans actually could see in their homes, as there were many areas not yet serviced by cable television, and not all cable television providers offered MTV at first. Friday Night Videos took advantage of that fact and proved to be the next best thing for many viewers. While it primarily showcased music videos by popular top 40 acts of the day, unlike its cable rival, Friday Night Videos tended to offer more variety; featuring artists from the genres of pop, rock, R&B;, and rap. In the beginning, like its predecessor The Midnight Special, the show ran 90 minutes long, and consisted of music videos introduced by an off-camera announcer. In addition to this, classic artists of the 1960s and 1970s occasionally appeared in \\"Hall of Fame Videos\\", major stars were profiled in \\"Private Reels\\", and new clips made their network debuts as \\"World Premiere Videos\\". The most popular feature was \\"Video Vote\\". Two videos were played back-to-back, and viewers across the country, with the exception of the West Coast, could call in and vote for one of them, using nationwide 900 numbers for a small per-call fee. The winning video faced a new challenger the following week. When a video won four consecutive video votes, it was declared a \\"retired champion\\" and two new videos were introduced the week after to start over. To increase the number of voters, they started to offer free T-shirts every fifteen seconds during the time of the voting when they called to register their votes. Nick Michaels and Scott Muni were the off-camera announcers. For the show's first few years on the air, the audio portion of the show was presented as a stereo simulcast over FM radio on NBC's owned and operated radio stations, along with several affiliates of the NBC Radio Network. This arrangement continued until the launch of television stereo on the NBC Television Network under the MTS standard over a period of two years from fall 1984 until the fall of 1986; it was one of NBC's first programs produced exclusively in stereo. Celebrity hosts Beginning on October 18, 1985, FNV had celebrity guests as the weekly hosts. The first guest hosts were Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Lisa Bonet. As a result of the host banter, the show often would have to slightly shave off bits of the end of the videos to conserve time. Weekly guest hosts would last through March 29, 1991, occurring occasionally afterward. Notable hosts included: { border=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  *Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Landesberg *Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jay Leno *Ahmad RashƒÅd and Phylicia Rashad *Bobby Brown and Malcolm-Jamal Warner *Darryl M.

In early 1990, NBC sporadically ran a Saturday morning edition of FNV for viewers who missed the show hours earlier because of its late night timeslot. These episodes, however, were usually not repeats of the new episode that just aired earlier in the AM but instead tended to be a compilation of past guest hosts. That fall, the network premiered a clone show on the Saturday morning line up named Saturday Morning Videos, which followed Saved by the Bell and was basically a campier version of FNV that targeted the lead-in teenage audience. It was cancelled in 1992. In late 1990, much like what was occurring gradually on MTV, FNV began to move away from an all-video format. Regular bumper segments were added, featuring various comedians. In 1991, live in- studio musical performances were added. On April 5, Tom Kenny, a then-unknown comedian who would gain fame through voice acting, most notably as SpongeBob SquarePants, became the regular on-screen host, joined by Frankie Crocker who hosted his own feature, \\"Frankie Crocker's Journal\\", which highlighted important dates in music history. Crocker later became the host, followed by Darryl M. Bell and eventually Tonight Show Bandleader Branford Marsalis in 1993. Format change Friday Night's logo In January 1994, after years of falling ratings and seemingly becoming more and more insignificant in the wake of the cable television boom that allowed more households to have access to MTV, the show was retooled in an attempt to stay relevant. Beginning with the Jan. 14 broadcast, the show moved to NBC Studios in Burbank from New York and the name was shortened to Friday Night. Additionally, it became less of a music video show and more of a general entertainment and variety program, featuring celebrity interviews, stand-up comedy, movie reviews, live performances, viewer polls, and comedy sketches. Subsequently, the show now only made room to air approximately two music videos per episode. The new format also brought two new hosts: comedians Henry Cho and Rita Sever. Brian Copeland delivered humorous commentary on the news of the week in his segment, \\"The World According To Copeland\\". In 1996, Sever took over as sole host. The old Video Vote segment, meanwhile, was brought back and renamed \\"Friday Night Jukebox.\\" For the host segments after 1998, Sever would be seated or standing in front of the giant videoscreen on the right side of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno set, near the guest's entrance. The twilight years Late Friday In 2000, despite having its highest ratings in years, the show was once again reformatted by NBC for budgetary reasons. Under that title, Friday Nights last telecast was December 29. On January 5, 2001, the show returned under the name Late Friday. Discontinuing the music and feature segments, the show now solely revolved around stand-up comedians doing their stage routines. Late Friday continued to air until Last Call with Carson Daly was expanded to five nights a week in May 2002. The cancellation marked the end of 29 years of NBC programming a weekly Friday late-night music or comedy/variety show.

The story was based on Cornell Woolrich's novel The Black Curtain. It was later dramatized three times on the CBS Radio series Suspense. Plot Frank Thompson awakens in the middle of the street after wreckage falling from a building in New York City hits him on the head. Frank soon discovers that his apartment has been rented out for a year and his wife Virginia has been living on her own elsewhere. Frank confronts Virginia, who is shocked to see the husband who disappeared without explanation a year earlier. As Frank slowly pieces together his old life, it turns out he is known by another name and running from a murder he cannot remember committing. Joe Marucci, a detective, is shadowing his every move. Looking for answers in the neighborhood where he awoke on the street, Frank meets Ruth Dillon who knows him only as \\"Danny\\". Ruth takes Frank/Danny to the mansion of the wealthy Diedrich family, where she has been employed as a servant. Family matriarch Grandma Diedrich was an eyewitness to the murder of son Harry, the one Frank/Danny is suspected of killing, but she is a housebound invalid who also is mute. Through sign language, Frank/Danny learns from her that Ruth is the killer, Harry having caught her stealing. Frank/Danny's life is in danger until Marucci arrives and catches the culprit.

Context The cartoon was initially conceived to promote the sales of \\"defense bonds\\", which were renamed war bonds by the spring of 1942. Between feature films, or between the feature films and the animated shorts, the lights of the movie theater would come on and ushers would collect monetary contributions from the audience, to help finance the war effort.Sigall (2005), p. 54 Bonds and stamps were also available at the box office on a daily basis- \\"including Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays\\"- for the duration of the conflict. Fat Elmer features Any Bonds Today? is also one of five cartoons featuring the Elmer Fudd modeled after his voice actor, Arthur Q. Bryan, which is fatter than the popular incarnation. Clampett made these shorts with a fat Elmer because he could not make Porky as fat as he was in his first cartoon, I Haven't Got a Hat.

The year of 1897 is considered the year of establishment of the today's Illich Mariupol steel and iron works, when in Mariupol was mounted and gave out the first products pipe workshop of Nikopol- Mariupol mining- metallurgical society. The location of factory in a Mariupol city was advantageous from geographical position which provided the closeness of raw materials and fuel resources, presence of marine auction port, labor force of peasants from the nearest villages. The factory broadened to beginning the twentieth age became a major metallurgical enterprise at the South of Russia. It is finally picked up thread after World War I and the Civil War in 1927, the factory began to develop as a comprehensive machine- building enterprise. The factory received its modern name in the 1920s when the Petrograd sovnarkom confiscated all of the property from the previous owners during the nationalization of all the industry in the region and to commemorate the leader of the October Revolution, Vladimir Lenin. Later its powers of operating productions were broadened and new subdivisions were built: new-pipe, thick-sheet, sheet-finishing workshops, a number of other workshops. In 1941 the enterprise passes to the issue of defensive types of products, including armor plating for the tank T-34, production of which it was mastered at the plant before World War II. In the war-time the most valuable equipment dismantled and it is sent on the factories of Ural and Siberia, and blast-furnace and martin stoves are put out of action. After the liberation of Mariupol, at the end of 1944, the plant only had 70% of its production power, but it almost immediately started shipping armored steel to the war front. In 1954‚Äì1969 years the company experienced its second birth. The reconstruction of high furnaces was conducted at this time, three more high furnaces were built, as long as a martin workshop with the highest number of stoves in the world, an oxygen-converter workshop, squeezing-steel workshop 1150, workshops for hot and cold rolling, an agglomerative factory (the largest in Europe), a complex of workshops for auxiliary production. The first products in 1983 - strips for production of large diameter pipes - brought a thick-sheet workshop 3000, one of the most modern in Europe. The company got the powerful impulse of development in the last decade. The enterprise built several new facilities, including an electric-welded pipe and limekiln department, two machines for continuous casting of purveyances, setting for the complex lapping of steel and energetic block in a converter to the workshop, modernisation and reconstruction of equipment is conducted in most base workshops.

History The SM42 was the first Polish-designed heavier diesel locomotive and was the most in its country of origin. Introduction The technical documentation for this locomotive was developed in 1958-1962 by the state Central Construction Bureau of Railway Stock Industry (CBKPTK) in Pozna≈Ñ, as type 6D. The production was given over to the Fablok Locomotive Factory in Chrzan√≥w, where it was designated Ls800E (meaning an 800 HP diesel locomotive with electric transmission). The prototype was ready in December 1963. It was lent to the Polish State Railways (PKP), as the SM42-001, the class designation 'SM' meaning a diesel shunter locomotive, and was tested in Warsaw in 1964.Pokropi≈Ñski, B. (2009), pp.96-100. Two improved locomotives were built for the PKP in 1964, and twenty in 1965. In 1967, the locomotive entered serial production and 1,822 were built until production ceased in 1992. During the long production run, some minor improvements were incorporated into the design. The locomotives produced from 1972 onwards (so-called batch 2) had simplified chassis (starting from SM42-521, bu.no. 8499). The main buyer of Ls800 locomotives, which had priority in orders, were the Polish State Railways, which received 1157 locomotives. They were used for shunting, local freight traffic and local passenger traffic in warm months. 622 were made for the Polish industry, some in Ls800P variant with single steering only (they were designated by their users as Ls800 or SM42, with numbers above 2000). A variant of type 6D/SM42 locomotive was a type 101D locomotive, with steam heating for passenger trains. Further 268 locomotives of this variant were built and classified as PKP class SP42.Pokropi≈Ñski, B. (2009), p.110. Later modifications In 1972, a new version (6DM) was developed specifically for Moroccan railways (ONCFM). 37 were delivered as class DG 200 in 1973-1975. The main difference with respect to the original design was better anti-dust insulation of the machine compartment. Six similar locomotives, type 6DI, were built in 1982 for Dromex, a Polish building company operating in Iraq. In the years 1975-1977, forty locomotives were converted to SU42 (\\"diesel universal\\") class, with the addition of 500 V electric heating for passenger wagons. Due to withdrawal of such wagons, in 2000 these locomotives were reclassified back to SM42. Another 40 SU42 locomotives, with 3000 V heating, were converted in the years 1999-2000 from PKP class SP42. Nicknames This locomotive has also been referred to by the following nicknames: *Zebra or Stonka (eng. Colorado beetle) - from the livery *Wibrator (eng.

It is three miles from the southeast corner of Lough Neagh on the main road between Lurgan and Antrim and about 13 kilometres west of Lisburn. The village lies on the steep wooded slopes of Friar's Glen and is beside the now disused Lagan Navigational Canal. In the 2001 Census, Aghalee had a population of 774. Aghalee has several places of worship, a community hall, Orange Hall, GP Surgery, filling station and shop, a Pharmacy and fast food takeaway. The village is also home to a vocational training centre, a nursing home and a children's day nursery. Ulsterbus services link the village with Lisburn, Antrim, Lurgan and Belfast.  History  Lagan Navigation Canal (disused) at Broadwater, near Aghalee Much of the early development of Aghalee was due to its strategic location beside the Lagan Navigational Canal which opened at the end of the 18th century. The village became a distribution centre for the surrounding area and developed as an important lock station on the Lagan Navigation, as it was one of the last sizeable settlements before the canal entered Lough Neagh. While the canal operated, trade continued on a significant scale. When the canal finally ceased to operate in 1954, the area began to decline in commercial importance. The population of the settlement decreased considerably in the latter part of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century. The village retains many of the 18th century structures and buildings belonging to the canal. From the 1970s Aghalee developed as a commuter area for Belfast and Craigavon and this was accompanied by significant population growth. In recent times, development has occurred on the lands to the west of the village core.  2001 Census  Aghalee is classified as a Small Village or Hamlet.NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 774 people living in Aghalee.

It was constructed in 1907 and 1908, and was operated by the New Zealand Railways Department until its closure in 1962. Construction The Waikaka Branch was the last of the minor branches of northern Southland to be authorised,Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst, The Railways of New Zealand: A Journey Through History (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1991), 213. though proposals had existed for decades beforehand. Poor transportation access was causing farm values to depreciate while wagoning costs were prohibitive, and settlers petitioned the government for a railway line to improve their economic prospects. The town of Kelso had already been linked to the Dunedin-Invercargill portion of the Main South Line at Waipahi by the Tapanui Branch, but a prominent proposal supported another link, this time from Kelso via the Waikaka Valley to Gore on the Main South Line. In 1878, this line was approved by the government and an official survey of the route was anticipated in early 1880,\\"Mataura\\", Otago Witness 1474 (14 February 1880): 10. but governmental inaction meant that the proposal lapsed and by 1886, residents of the Waikaka Valley had lost hope that a railway would be built.\\"Kelso\\", Otago Witness 1816 (10 September 1886): 16. The prospect of a railway was not seriously revived until 1897 when a community financing initiative in the North Island was approved to construct a line from Paeroa to Waihi (later part of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway).David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 109. Pressure paid off in 1904 when a branch line to the village of Waikaka was included in the government's Railways Authorisation Act, but official procrastination meant construction did not commence. The through line from Gore to Kelso still had support; in February 1905, Southland business interests urged the government to begin construction of the Gore-Kelso line and to link the Tapanui Branch with the Roxburgh Branch, as trade that they felt should rightfully benefit Southland was instead benefitting Otago due to superior railway access to Dunedin.\\"Southland Railways\\", Otago Witness 2658 (22 February 1905): 15. No significant action was taken to achieve this proposal, but later in 1905, a company was established by local residents to advance half the construction costs of the approved branch to the government, and this led to the passage of the Waikaka Branch Railway Act. When the promised money eventuated, construction of the line commenced on 18 April 1907, with the first sod turned by the Acting Prime Minister, Joseph Ward.\\"Gore - Waikaka Railway\\", Hawera and Normanby Star 53(9318) [19 April 1907]: 7. The branch left the Main South Line just east of Gore at a locality called McNab. Locals under supervision rather than contractors or engineers built the line twenty-one kilometres up the valley to Waikaka, and it was completed in late 1908. On 26 November 1908, the line was handed over to the Railways Department and the official opening was held the following day. Stations The following stations were on the Waikaka Branch (in brackets is the distance from the junction in McNab):New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 29. *Howe (2.54 km) - also called Howes. *Willowbank (7.16 km) *Maitland (11.79 km) *Fleming (14.83 km) *Pullar (16.6 km) *Waikaka (20.82 km) - a small locomotive depot was located at the station. Operation The branch was a typical New Zealand rural branch servicing farms. No towns or major industries existed at any point along the line. Branches such as this were useful to open up internal New Zealand to commercial farming, and the Waikaka Branch provided local farmers with invaluable access to markets before the development of modern road transportation. A daily service carrying both passengers and freight, known as a mixed train, operated from the terminus to Gore and return. The valley of the branch directly paralleled the Pomahaka Valley that was followed by the Tapanui Branch, and they were sufficiently close that locomotive crews on one branch claimed that they could see the smoke from the steam locomotive of a train in the other valley. On 9 February 1931, regular passenger services were cancelled due to poor patronage and the locomotive depot in Waikaka was closed in an attempt to improve the branch's finances as it had been losing money for a few years. These measures temporarily improved its prospects and trains operated from Gore to Waikaka and return, but by 1950, although revenue had doubled, so had expenses. Improvements in quality and access to road transportation meant that the use of the railway by farmers decreased - by 1950, the train ran only thrice weekly, and not much later, this level of service was further reduced to twice weekly. These services were augmented by highly infrequent excursions, the most notable of which was chartered by the Waikaka Valley Presbyterian Church on 26 March 1962 to convey almost 800 passengers in 12 carriages and 2 vans to Racecourse station on the Wyndham Branch for a picnic near Wyndham. The motive power used on the service was typical of the latter decades of the branch: an A class locomotive on the service out of Waikaka, and an AB class locomotive on the return working.\\"The Waikaka Excursion\\", Yarn 99 (May 1962). The line would have been a candidate for closure sometime in the early 1950s like other similar branches in New Zealand, but due to the lack of bridges or tunnels, it was ideal for carrying large, heavy items for the construction of the Roxburgh Dam. This freight sustained the line into the 1960s, but upon completion of the dam, there was not sufficient traffic to justify the branch's continued existence and it was closed on 9 September 1962. The branch today Traces of the branch line's existence remain evident today. In Willowbank, a preserved windmill, wooden water tank, and a Historic Places plaque can be found at the site of the former yard. Stockyards and loading chutes can be found preserved in Fleming. The former railbed is well defined through the countryside for some of its length, and structures of obvious railway origin can be found in Waikaka, such as former Railways Department housing provided for staff based in Waikaka when its locomotive depot was operational.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 110.

Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is in the North York Moors national park due north of Pickering, off the A169 to Whitby. It has a station on the steam-operated North Yorkshire Moors Railway line. According to the 2011 UK census, Goathland parish had a population of 438, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 407. Goathland village is 500 feet above sea level and has a history extending from Viking times. The name Goathland is probably a corruption of 'good land'. Alternatively, it may come from 'Goda's land', Goda being an Old English personal name. In 1109, King Henry I granted land to Osmund the Priest and the brethren of the hermitage of Goathland, then called Godelandia, for the soul of his mother Queen Matilda, who had died in 1083. This is recorded in a charter held at Whitby Abbey.No. 396, Early Yorkshire Charters, William Farrer ed., 1914 The village was a spa town in the 19th century. There are many hotels and guest houses in the village. The largest, the Mallyan Spout Hotel, is named after a nearby waterfall. There is a caravan site, reached by driving along the track which is the site of the older railway route, 1835 to 1860. Much of the surrounding land is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster. The Duchy's tenants have a common right extending for hundreds of years to graze their black faced sheep on the village green and surrounding moorland.  Heartbeat connection  The village was the setting of the fictional village of Aidensfield in the Heartbeat television series set in the 1960s. Many landmarks from the series are recognisable, including the stores, garage/funeral directors, the public house and the railway station. The pub is called the Goathland Hotel, but in the series is the Aidensfield Arms. After filming interior shots in the hotel for some years, a replica of it was built in Yorkshire TV's Leeds studio.  North Yorkshire Moors Railway  Goathland railway station is on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The railway is run by a charitable trust with some paid staff but is mostly operated by volunteers, running nearly all the year including Christmas. It carries more than 250,000 passengers a year and is the second- longest preserved line in Britain. It links Grosmont in the north with Pickering in the south, along the route of the Whitby - Pickering line built by George Stephenson in 1835 and upgraded in 1865. From 2007 some trains on the railway were timetabled to run to Whitby and in March 2014 work began in Whitby station to replace a platform and allow more North Yorkshire Moors Railway services to be timetabled Whitby - Pickering. Goathland railway station was used as the location for Hogsmeade railway station in the Harry Potter films, and the line filmed for Harry's journey.

Butcher was a professional squash player based at the Conservative Club in London when he played in the first British Open final in December 1930. His opponent Charles Read, a former English professional champion, was designated open champion at the initiation of the event, which was a 'challenge' event without any preliminary rounds, with the final played under a best-of-three-legs format. Butcher defeated Read in the first match at the Queen's Club 9-6, 9-5, 9-5. He then won the second match at the Conservative Club 9-3, 9-5, 9-3 to claim the title and make the third match unnecessary. In 1932, Butcher successfully defended his title against Charles Arnold, winning the first match at the Conservative Club 9-0, 9-0, 9-0, and the second match at the Bath Club 9-3, 9-0, 9-5. Butcher was unsuccessful in his defence of the Championship in 1933 against Egyptian player F.D. Amr Bey and similarly unsuccessful in his challenge against Amr in 1935. Butcher also won the British Professional Championship in 1930, 1931 and 1932. Butcher was considered a very innovative player in his time. He deviated from the conventional up-and-down-the-wall style adopted by most players in his era, making full use of boasts (shots that come off a side wall before hitting the front wall), lobs, drop shots and reverse angles, as well as cultivating the serve. His lack of stamina during long matches was considered to be one of his main weaknesses, however, and this gave the athletic Amr Bey a key advantage over Butcher on the occasions they played. He was the first person to make an instructional squash video, which was filmed on the doubles court of St. John's Wood in 1938.

The name is the Romanian acronym for \\"Serviciul Mobil de Urgen»õƒÉ, Reanimare »ôi Descarcerare\\", which means Mobile Emergency Service for Resuscitation and Extrication. It was created and has been coordinated since its inception by doctor Raed Arafat. The first SMURD unit was created in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, a city in the center of Transylvania, in 1990. One of the notable co-founders is the Romanian Firefighter Lt. Col. Mircea Pintilie which coordonated the activity between the firebrigades from the three countries, Romania, Norway and Great Britain.SMURD. smurd.ro In October 1996, the service received legal recognition under the Military Firemen Corps law no.121. Until that date, it served as a national pilot center. Now SMURD is a complementary service, with bases covering many parts of the country, still expanding. It deals with the worst emergency cases, all in a very good collaboration with the regular Ambulance Service (Serviciul de Ambulan≈£ƒÉ). Also, HEMS (helicopter emergency medical system) was enforced in six cities (T√¢rgu Mure»ô, Bucharest, Ia≈üi, Arad, Craiova and Constan≈£a), while in other cities the system is only ambulance based. Depending on the situation, police and army helicopters are also being used. The emergency system used by this service is based on the European 112 emergency phone number, now also used in Romania for all the emergencies (police, firefighters, ambulance).  History  SMURD helicopter SMURD ambulances (I) SMURD ambulances (II) SMURD ambulances (III) With the guidance of the Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, in September 1990, an emergency system functional in other European countries was experimented. This system was based on the transfer of a full-equipped medical unit to the site where the critical patient was, in order to provide qualified emergency medical assistance. The unit is coordinated by a physician specialized in anaesthesiology, intensive care and emergency medicine. At this early stage, the new service, called SMUR or the Emergency and Resuscitation Mobile Service, was endowed with only one equipped intervention unit, which had no possibility of transporting the patient, the transport being left to be made by a vehicle belonging to the County Ambulance Service.  1991  In 1991, following the fall of Communism in Romania, SMUR received its first mobile resuscitation unit (donated from Germany). This unit brought a higher level of pre-hospital medical care, and easier one. Until October 1990, the new system has functioned entirely based on volunteer work. The SMUR mobile unit's drivers were students at the Faculty of Medicine, physicians or Red Cross volunteers from T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. After failed attempts of cooperation with several institutions, in October 1991 an experimental period of time started, placing SMUR under the operative coordination of the Mure≈ü Fire Department, which, at that time, was responsible for the employment of the drivers for the mobile unit, and to provide accommodation and training rooms for SMUR's medical staff. This experiment, which was to be a success and to become a permanent solution, was based on the models found in many countries in the world, where firemen are directly involved in providing of emergency medical assistance and first-aid. These models are functional in Germany, France, Luxembourg, the United States, Canada, Japan, etc. In this new functional structure, SMUR was guided by the Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic from the medical point of view and by the Fire Department from the operative point of view.  1992  In 1992, SMUR kept on progressing, concentrating on the training of the mostly volunteer personnel and on developing international relations with similar services from other countries. The first countries to establish a long term cooperation, even from 1992 were Great Britain and Norway. The Norwegian Red Cross from Sauda started their support by donating SMUR mobile units and emergency medical equipment and the Emergency Service of the Royal Hospital in Edinburgh and the Strathclyde Fire Brigade in Glasgow have started an intensive support program for the development of emergency medical assistance and for the training and endowment of firemen in new fields, such as extrication and chemical hazards. In November 1992, following a training period of 3 weeks, with trainers from Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland and the United States, an exercise was performed to which were invited to participate the representatives of several Ministries and institutions. Following this exercise, the Minister of Health declared, by the Decision No. 1094 of 5 November 1992, the new system functioning in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü as the National Pilot Centre. This new status was to protect the new model, in the years 1993‚Äì1997, against the high level of opposition and the attempts to shut it down. As a part of the training in 1992, the first laboratory for emergency training was donated by the Foundation for Open Society, United States.  1993  In 1993, after SMUR had functioned for about two years providing emergency assistance in pre-hospital, a great development phase started in May, with the support of the colleagues at the Emergency Service of the Royal Hospital of Edinburgh. This development was the creation of the Intensive Care Room at the Mure≈ü County Clinical Hospital, designed to continue the treatment of critical patients brought in by SMUR or arrived through other means, until their admission to the hospital's departments. The new Intensive Care Room staff members were the doctors, medical assistants and volunteers who worked in the pre-hospital emergency units. The new Intensive Care Room reduced the mortality within the Emergency Room of the Mure≈ü County Hospital by approximately 50%. Also in 1993, the Strathclyde Fire Brigade in Scotland has donated the first mobile extrication unit to the Mure≈ü Fire Department, training the personnel within the Fire Department for the efficient and accurate use of the equipment. The first intervention the unit responded to took place in exactly the same day as the donation ceremony. Starting 1993, the Resuscitation and Emergency Mobile Service (SMUR) has become the Emergency Mobile Service for Resuscitation and Extrication (SMURD). Also in 1993, the first services following the T√¢rgu Mure≈ü SMURD showed up at Oradea and Sibiu, adopting the functional mode of the T√¢rgu Mure≈ü system.  1994  1994 was a very important year in the history of the development of emergency medical assistance in Mure≈ü County and perhaps in the whole country. With the help of the Emergency Service of Edinburgh and of the London BBC, the first Emergency Department was built, following the models in Great Britain and the United States. The new department or \\"Emergency Service\\" was placed in the yard of the Mure≈ü County Clinical Hospital and started its activity on 31 July 1994. Building this Emergency Service took almost a month and gathered lots of working people, from Scotland and T√¢rgu Mure≈ü, from the Army, the Gendarmerie and the Fire Department, and from organizations and volunteers, all wanting to see the new service working as soon as possible. From the Fire Department point of view, 1994 has brought a new activity. The Scotland firemen endowed and trained the Mure≈ü firemen for chemical hazard interventions, creating the first operative unit of this kind in all the Fire Departments of Romania. Alongside the firemen, doctors from SMURD attended the training programs.  1995‚Äì1996  In 1995 and 1996 the system continued its development, especially in the field of training and professional growth of physicians and medical assistants coming from all corners of the country. In 1997 alone in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü approximately 250 doctors, medical assistants and firemen were trained, and in 1998 this number surpassed 300. In October 1996, the Military Fire Corps Law no. 121 was promulgated by the President. For the first time in Romania, in this law at articles 9 and 18.k it was established that Military Firemen have a duty to provide emergency medical assistance and extrication. This law has put the system within legal boundaries after an experimentation period of approximately 5 years. Consequently, the Emergency Mobile Service for Resuscitation and Extrication was named the Intervention Station for Emergency Medical Assistance and Extrication (SIAMUD). In Mure≈ü County, currently both names are in use, SMURD or SIAMUD.  1997  SMURD in action In 1997 and following a series of intensive training programs in the field of catastrophe medicine with the help of colleagues in France, the Fast Response Group was created; it includes a number of 25 people wearing pagers which allow their calling in at any time in case of serious accidents. In 1998 this group was called in for the intervention on multiple victims accidents. The training in this area is continued with the help of the French Embassy in Bucharest, which is financing an annual training program in catastrophe medicine. Also in 1997 a new joined dispatch was founded, working for both the County Ambulance Service and SMURD. It is located within the Emergency Department and is staffed by County Ambulance Service personnel with the support from SMURD.  1998  1998 was a very special year for SMURD T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. In June that year, the Fire Department received an intervention boat necessary for the drowning cases in the Mure≈ü River. Only in August the same year, the Firemen and SMURD had 6 interventions using that boat. In June 1998 a public fund-raising was organized, destined to raise funds for purchasing a new, fully equipped mobile intensive care unit. This fund-raising continued until December 1998 and was finalized with the acquisition of the most modern intensive care unit in Romania, for the price of DEM 183,000, fully equipped by Miesen, Germany. The entire amount collected was donated by the people and the companies in Mure≈ü County. The success of this project was and still is a measure of the community's perception of the SMURD activity. Today Starting with 2007 the service has been expanding step by step to cover the whole of Romania. As of today, the service is active on the entire national territory (together with the regular Ambulance Service). Every department now has its own SMURD service managed by the firefighting county services, integrated with the Ambulance County Services and other emergency services thanks to new integrated \\"112\\" dispatch county stations. As of today, there are 7 HEMS operating bases: * Bucharest * T√¢rgu Mure»ô * Ia»ôi * Arad * Craiova * Constan»õa * Gala»õi In the near future another HEMS base will open in the north-west region (Jibou city). All the HEMS bases are equipped with Eurocopter EC-135 helicopters. Other projects are the implementation of the Telemedicine system (already available in many regions) and an emergency airplane for long-distance patient transport. On 2 June 2016, a SMURD helicopter crashed near Harag√Æ»ô in south-west Moldova, near the Romanian border, killing all four crew members on board.In Memory of the ¬´SMURD¬ª Emergency Rescue Team Killed in Moldova in 2016. moldovastamps.org ReferencesExternal links *SMURD ‚Äì Official site *SMURD foundation Category:Air ambulance services Category:Aviation in Romania Category:Health in Romania Category:T√¢rgu Mure»ô ","title":"SMURD"},{"id":"3578268","text":"The Attack of the Giant Moussaka (; ; 1999), is a Greek science fiction parody film, produced, written and directed by Panos H.

Les Inconnus (\\"The Unknowns\\") are a French trio of humorists: Didier Bourdon, Bernard Campan and Pascal L√©gitimus. While their first successes were on stage, they are most famous for their satirical sketch comedy television show La T√©l√© des Inconnus, which premiered in 1990 and remained popular throughout the early 1990s. Following their television success, the group went on to produce music and movies, most of them written and directed by Bourdon and Campan. After the movie Les Trois Fr√®res in 1995, the trio encountered contract problems with their manager Paul Lederman, which caused the group to split up, though there have been several films released since then that have featured at least two former members together. History The comedy troupe that would become Les Inconnus was formed in 1984. At its founding, the group had five members (Didier Bourdon, Bernard Campan, Pascal L√©gitimus, Seymour Brussel, and Sma√Øn) and was known as \\"Les Cinq\\" (The Five). Les Cinq starred in the 1985 movie Le T√©l√©phone Sonne Toujours Deux Fois (\\"The Telephone Always Rings Twice\\"), but shortly afterward Sma√Øn left the group to pursue his career as a solo act. Down to four members, the group changed its name to \\"Les Quatre Quarts\\" (a pun in French: literally meaning \\"The Four Quarters,\\" it is also the word for pound cake). In 1986 they met a new manager, Paul Lederman, who began to lead the troupe to larger and larger venues. At about this time the group's name was changed to \\"Les Inconnus\\" (The Unknowns). After hosting a radio show on Europe 1 from 1987 to 1988, Les Inconnus lost another member, Seymour Brussel. They eventually reached national fame with their 1989 stage comic show \\"Au secours, tout va mieux!\\" (literally \\"Help, things are getting better!\\"). In 1990, the three remaining members of the group premiered their sketch comedy television show, \\"La T√©l√© des Inconnus\\". The show, which ran for two years on Antenne 2 (now France 2), was highly successful, and propelled the group to stardom throughout France. Their sketches parodied a number of French cultural icons, highly popular at the time, including musicians Richard Clayderman, Mano Negra, Indochine, Didier Barbelivien, Florent Pagny, and Patrick Bruel, as well as international stars like Sylvester Stallone (in the unlikely role of Jesus Christ in a mock film trailer), Jean-Claude Van Damme (a recurring character in unlikely roles like Jean Valjean from Les Mis√©rables or Vicomte de Valmont from Les liaisons dangereuses), Al Pacino, Robert de Niro; and television shows Club Doroth√©e, Bioman, Star Trek or Santa Barbara. They also satirized French politicians, police, trade unions, contemporary art, fashion design, advertising, various television programs, and society at large. The program won two 7 d'Or (the top French television award), and a video clip from the show, \\"Auteuil, Neuilly, Passy\\", won two Victoires de la Musique. Their most famous sketch is probably \\"T√©l√©magouilles\\" with its gimmick \\"St√©phanie de Monaco\\"; this sketch is a parody of most of TV games. In 1995, Les Inconnus made their first film in ten years, Les Trois Fr√®res (\\"The Three Brothers\\"). The film was highly successful, winning the C√©sar Award for best d√©but, but due to contract disputes with their manager Paul Lederman, the group was forced to disband after the film's release. Bourdon and Campan starred in two other movies together, Le Pari (\\"The Bet\\"), L'Extraterrestre (\\"The Extraterrestrial\\"), before L√©gitimus rejoined them for their final film together, Les Rois Mages (The Magi), in 2001. Only Bourdon and L√©gitimus starred in Madame Irma in 2006. They were reunited in 2014 for Les Trois Fr√®res: Le Retour, a sequel to the 1995 film, but it was a critical and commercial failure.

Incompatibilitas (a Latin term, meaning \\"incompatibility\\") was a principle instituted in the Kingdom of Poland (later, from 1569, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), which forbade an individual to hold two or more official administrative positions. The principle of incompatibilitas evolved in the 15th-16th centuries in response to a demand from middle and lesser nobility (Szlachta), and it was designed to curtail the sway of more powerful high nobility/aristocracy/plutocracy (the Magnates). The specific acts of law that constituted the incompatibilitas rule were bans on holding: * a district office simultaneously with a starosta's office (przywilej czerwi≈Ñski, 1422); * two separate district offices; * a voivode's office simultaneously with a starosta's office (przywilej nieszawski, 1454); * a kanclerz's (chancellor's) office simultaneously with a starosta's, voivode's or castellan's office; * a voivode's or castellan's office simultaneously with a starosta's office (1538); * two or more city starosta offices (starostwo grodowe) (1562 or 1563); * a voivode's and castellan's offices simultaneously with another ministerial office other than that of hetman (1565, as each of those offices, except that of hetman, granted its holder a seat in the Senate of Poland, a privy council rather than an upper chamber). Commonwealth ministers were the equivalents of modern central- government officials. There were 10 officials (5 for Poland, 5 for Lithuania): a Great Crown Marshal, Great Lithuanian Marshal, Great Crown Chancellor, Great Lithuanian Chancellor, Crown Deputy Chancellor, Lithuanian Deputy Chancellor, Great Crown Treasurer, Great Lithuanian Treasurer, Court Crown Marshal and Court Lithuanian Marshal. The Court Marshals were considered subordinate to the Great Marshals. Lithuanian ministers, while enjoying the same powers as Crown ministers, were considered to be lower in the hierarchy. Hetmans were also considered \\"ministers\\" but had no seat in the Senat.

The COL11A2 gene produces one component of this type of collagen, called the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. Type XI collagen adds structure and strength to the tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs and skin (the connective tissue). Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage as well as the fluid that fills the eyeball, the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus). Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and diameter of type II collagen fibrils. Type II collagen is an important component of the eye and mature cartilage tissue. The size and arrangement of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues. The pro-alpha2(XI) chain combines with pro-alpha1(XI) and pro-alpha1(II)collagen chains to form a procollagen molecule. These triple-stranded, ropelike procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes in the cell. Once processed, these procollagen molecules leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-linkages result in the formation of very strong mature type XI collagen fibers. The COL11A2 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 at position 21.3, from base pair 33,238,446 to base pair 33,268,222.  Function  This gene encodes one of the two alpha chains of type XI collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen. It is located on chromosome 6 very close to but separate from the gene for retinoid X receptor beta. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer but the third alpha chain is a post-translationally modified alpha 1 type II chain. Proteolytic processing of this type XI chain produces PARP, a proline/arginine-rich protein that is an amino terminal domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with type III Stickler syndrome, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED syndrome), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 13 deafness. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.  Clinical significance = Nonsyndromic deafness  Mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been shown to cause hearing loss without other signs or symptoms (nonsyndromic deafness autosomal dominant) in two large families. One family carries a mutation that substitutes the amino acid cysteine (a building block of proteins) for the amino acid arginine at position 549 (written as Arg549Cys) in the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen. A second family has a mutation that substitutes the amino acid glutamic acid for the amino acid glycine at position 323 (written as Gly323Glu) in this protein. These mutations prevent the normal assembly of type XI collagen. Type XI collagen plays an important role in the structure and function of the inner ear. When mutations in the COL11A2 gene affect the structure of collagen fibrils, hearing loss can result.  Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia  Approximately 10 mutations identified in the COL11A2 gene are responsible for otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED). Most of these mutations result in a complete lack of pro-alpha2(XI) chains, which leads to a loss of function of type XI collagen. Some mutations affect the production of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain and disrupt normal collagen assembly. Because this type of collagen is an important component of cartilage and other connective tissues, these mutations result in the characteristic signs and symptoms of OSMED.  Stickler syndrome Stickler syndrome (COL11A2): Stickler syndrome is a disorder that causes problems with skeletal development, vision, and hearing. Mutations in the COL11A2 gene cause a form of Stickler in which vision is not affected. COL11A2 mutations cause abnormal production of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain, part of type XI collagen. As a result, type XI collagen is impaired and cannot function properly, causing the skeletal and hearing problems characteristic of Stickler syndrome. The pro-alpha2(XI) chain, however, is not made in the eyes. Instead, another type of collagen chain replaces pro- alpha2(XI) to form type XI collagen in the vitreous of the eye. COL11A2 mutations, therefore, do not affect vision.  Weissenbacher-Zweym√ºller syndrome  At least one identified mutation in the COL11A2 gene is responsible for Weissenbacher-Zweym√ºller syndrome. This mutation causes the amino acid glycine to be replaced with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 955 in the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen (written as Gly955Glu). This mutation prevents collagen molecules from being assembled properly, which disrupts the structure of type XI collagen. These changes result in the characteristic signs and symptoms of Weissenbacher-Zweym√ºller syndrome.  Vasculitis  A link has been shown between ANCA-associated vasculitis and SNPs in the COL11A2 gene in a Genomewide Association Study. It is proposed that this association may be due to linkage disequilibrium between a SNP in the HLA-DP locus and SNPs in COL11A2. This is theorised as the SNP in the HLA molecule was found to be very strongly associated with these diseases with evidence for a single genetic association.

Biography  Sekeletu was a son of the King Sebetwane and Queen Setlutlu. He succeeded his half-sister Mamochisane, who had decided to step down from the throne. It was she who proclaimed him new ruler, against the ambitions of Sekeletu's half-brother Mpepe, who unsuccessfully tried to block him by insinuating that he was not the lawful son of Sebetwane, since Sekeletu's mother had been previously married to another chief. He appears to have been very young when he took power, as the explorer David Livingstone presumed on first meeting him in Linyati in 1853 that he was about 18 years old. Sekeletu's relations with the explorer appear to have been very good, as confirmed by the 27 Makololo that under their king's orders went with Livingstone with the goal of finding a road between Barotseland and the port of Luanda, capital of Portuguese West Africa. His relations with another group of European missionaries were not so good. Like Livingstone, these were members of the London Missionary Society. When they arrived in 1860, headed by Holloway Helmore, they were treated with hostility. Eight of the twelve members of the expedition died (Helmore included) in Barotseland, almost certainly poisoned by eating Sekeletu's gift of an ox. Roger and Isabella Price survived because they were ill with malaria and had no appetite. Two of Helmore's children also survived. Ironically David Livingstone had left supplies of quinine in the vicinity, but had neglected to tell anyone. Sekeletu arranged that the survivors' party be guided into tsetse fly country and abandoned. Isabella Price died and was buried on the plain of Mababe. Roger Price later learned that the Makololo guides had dug up her body and mutilated it. Though charged by Arthur Tidman, foreign secretary of the London Missionary Society, with being partly responsible for the tragedy, David Livingstone rejected the allegation and published his own version.'Footing with Sir Richard's Ghost' - Patricia Glyn (2006) Sekeletu eventually proved himself an unsuccessful ruler, generating discontent among the Lozi, the people who had formerly ruled the land. When he contracted leprosy, Sekeletu no longer trusted the Lozi whom he suspected of having bewitched him as a leper. Therefore, many Lozi were put to death. Due to this, a year after his death the Makololo's power crumbled and the Lozi regained self-rule. Sekeletu had two sons, Princes Litali and Sesane. Members of Sekeletu's tribe believed that their king has died from God's punishment. His uncle Mbololo later took the kingship.

Soderbergh also shot and edited the film under the pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard, taken from his father's given names and his mother's maiden name, respectively. The film was shot on high-definition video. Bubble is unusual in that it had no traditional script and used only non-professional actors recruited from the Parkersburg, West Virginia and Belpre, Ohio area, where the film was shot. The lead, Debbie Doebereiner, was found working the drive- through window in a Parkersburg KFC. All lines were improvised according to an outline written by screenwriter Coleman Hough, who previously teamed with Soderbergh on Full Frontal. Bubble was the first of six films Soderbergh planned to shoot and release in the same manner. The film was released simultaneously in movie theaters and on the cable/satellite TV network HDNet Movies on January 27, 2006; the DVD was released a few days later, on January 31. Bubble received a Best Director nomination for Soderbergh at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards. The score for the film was composed by Robert Pollard, an Ohio native. Plot In a town near the Ohio River, Martha (Debbie Doebereiner), a homely middle-aged single woman, works at a doll factory and cares for her elderly, disabled father. Martha regularly drives her younger co-worker, Kyle (Dustin James Ashley), to and from work. Kyle is an intensely shy, quiet young man in his early 20s, who suffers from social anxiety disorder and lives with his television-obsessed single mother. Martha, who appears to have no social outlets or friends outside of work, has become attached to Kyle, showing concern for his welfare, trying to draw him out, and telling him he is her \\"best friend\\". Although the withdrawn Kyle opens up a little bit to Martha, he does not act as interested in her as she is in him. In order to meet demand, the doll factory hires Rose (Misty Dawn Wilkins), an attractive young woman Kyle's age who is the single mother of a toddler. Kyle and Rose are mutually attracted to each other, and begin to spend time together during their breaks at work, to Martha's chagrin as she herself is pushed aside and unable to have her usual interactions with Kyle. Martha grudgingly agrees to drive Rose to her second job as a housekeeper for a wealthy client, but Martha becomes further irritated with Rose when Rose takes advantage of her client's absence to take a long bath in the client's Jacuzzi. Rose also claims that a watch she stole from her client was a gift. Martha complains to Kyle about Rose's behavior. Despite her dislike of Rose, Martha accepts the opportunity to earn some extra money by babysitting for Rose while Rose goes on a date. Martha only learns that Rose's date is Kyle when he arrives at Rose's home to pick her up, causing Martha to become upset. During their date, Rose and Kyle go to Kyle's house where Rose, unbeknownst to Kyle, steals money that he has been saving and hiding away in his bedroom. When Kyle drops Rose off, he decides not to go inside with her because he felt a \\"weird vibe\\" from Martha earlier. Right after Rose enters the house, her ex-boyfriend Jake appears and accuses Rose of stealing money and marijuana from his house. Rose and Jake have a heated argument in front of Martha. After Jake leaves, Martha asks Rose if he is the father of her child, and Rose angrily tells her to mind her own business. The next morning the police arrive at Rose's house after neighbors hear her child crying and call them. They find Rose dead of apparent strangulation, with no sign of forced entry. A detective questions both Jake and Kyle, who each claim to know nothing about the murder. Meanwhile, Martha pawns jewelry (which she says she inherited from family members) and spends the money on fishing equipment and a trip to the beauty parlor. She then takes the fishing equipment to Kyle's house and gives it to him as a gift; he tells her of Rose's murder and, apparently surprised by the news, she says she knows nothing. She is later questioned by a detective and maintains her innocence, even when he tells her that the fingerprints found on Rose's neck match her own. Martha is arrested for Rose's murder. Kyle visits Martha in prison. Martha pleads with Kyle to help her, swearing she did not murder Rose and doesn't know what happened, though she mentions a headache and Rose's rudeness. Kyle is skeptical of her story. Later, in her jail cell, Martha sees a bright light, followed by a vision of Rose's dead body and herself standing over Rose. Kyle's mother takes Rose's job at the doll factory and Kyle's humdrum life working two jobs continues as it did before. The DVD release of the film also contains a deleted scene in which Martha has a CAT scan revealing that she has a severely malignant tumor in her brain. The doctor explains that the tumor could cause blackouts and highly abnormal behavior. Reception On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71%, based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 6.29/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"This rigorously stripped down, seemingly mundane little film still manages to be engrossing and creepy.\\" Soderbergh was nominated for Best Director at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards for this movie.

It is situated on the A25 road between Downpatrick and Newry, about 0.8 kilometres to the east of Castlewellan and 17 kilometres to the south west of Downpatrick. It had a population of 593 in the 2001 Census. It originally developed as a mill village in the valley of the Clarkhill and Ballybannon rivers. Most people look beyond the village to neighbouring Castlewellan for the majority of their local services, as Annsborough is just a few rows of houses. The village has a post office and shop and a playing field. Annsborough Primary School first opened in 1835, making it one of the oldest functional schools in the country. It officially became integrated in 1997, after many years of unofficial integrated education. A variety of light industrial and commercial units provide small-scale local employment in former textile mill buildings in the centre of the village. The village's history and identity are closely linked to Castlewellan, and its distinctive character derives from its natural valley setting within the Mourne Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the well-landscaped former mill complex in the centre of the village. Culture The village is the home of the Annsborough Pipe Band. Currently competing in Grade 3A of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, the band has won three World Championships in 2004, 2005 and 2015.

Henry Carroll Timmonds (May 12, 1853 - July 4, 1913) was an American judge and state legislator. The oldest child of Dr. Landon Marion Timmonds and Jane Mandeville Tichenor, was born in Knoxville, Iowa, on May 12, 1853, less than a year after his parents moved there. Most of his life was spent in Missouri, growing up in Lamar and the general Barton County area where he was \\"Principal of Public Schools\\" for one term (at age 19 or 20), then marrying Katherine Faust in 1873 and moving to neighboring Cedar County, where he became editor (and printer) of the \\"Stockton Journal\\" from 1873 to 1878. Even prior to his marriage and work as a journalist, H. C. Timmonds (called \\"Carroll\\" by his friends) had been interested in the law, and had read law under a local Lamar attorney. He continued to study the subject while producing the newspaper and while Superintendent of Stockton Schools for two years. Finally, after studying under Judge D. P. Stratton, he was admitted to the Stockton bar in 1880, becoming a lawyer. (His third child, the first after his being admitted to the bar, was Reba Stratton Timmonds, presumably so named as to honor Judge Stratton.) After passing the bar, Henry Carroll Timmonds moved back to Lamar, and set up legal offices with several other local attorneys, becoming Prosecuting Attorney for Barton County for two terms. After a few years, he entered politics, running as a Democrat for the office of representative to the state legislature from Barton County, to which he was elected in 1887. He served in the thirty-fourth Missouri General Assembly, and was on the Judicial Committee. Several years after his career as a legislator ended he was elected Judge of the Twenty-sixth Judicial Circuit Court, a position he held for about five years. After that time he was usually called Judge Timmonds. During his years as a judge, Henry Carroll Timmonds tried one case which involved much local and even some national interest, one of the so-called \\"boodle\\" trials. These cases involved several state senators who had solicited \\"boodle\\" (bribe money) in exchange for their votes. Oddly, this was not contrary to any Missouri statute at the time. Judge Timmonds, though, found Senator W. P. Sullivan guilty under the common law, and the senator was convicted and fined, thus setting a significant precedent. Judge Timmonds moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1905, becoming a law partner of U. S. Senator William Warner. He was injured in a carriage accident that killed his wife, Katherine \\"Kate\\" Faust, in 1909, but remarried the next year, to Anastasia Murray. He died on July 4, 1913. {style=\\"background:transparent; color:black\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"230\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" cellpadding=10px cellspacing=0px +style=\\"background:transparent; color:black\\"Wife and daughter of H.

Irish Catholics also left the country to pursue military careers in the Flight of the Wild Geese. The first Irish Colleges were set up in Spain in the 1580s in Salamanca and Madrid under the supervision of the Jesuit priest James Archer. There were several early Irish Colleges in Southern Netherlands. St. Patrick Irish college of Douai was founded in 1603 by Christopher Cusack,Fr. Christopher Cusack by Pstrick M. Geoghegan, RIA / Cambridge Dictionary of Irish Biographywith the support of Philip III of Spain. The Irish College at Douai was integrated to the Faculty of Theology of the University of Douai in 1610. St Anthony's College, the Irish Franciscan College in Leuven, was co-founded in May 1607 by Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil (also known as Aodh Mac Aingil) and Flaithri √ì Maolconaire, Irish Franciscan, theologian and aide to Aodh Ruadh √ì Domhnaill. The College was founded under the patronage of Philip III of Spain. There was also an Irish Dominican College at Leuven from 1624 until 1797.Irish Students Leuven www.irishineeurope.com The Irish College in Paris was co-founded in 1605 by John Lee and John de l'Escalopier, President of the Parliament of Paris. More Colleges were established in Rome (1625), Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lille, Brussels, Antwerp and then Prague (1631).Anderson, Christopher, Historical Sketches of the Ancient Native Irish and Their Descendants (1830) p.118 Some of the Colleges fell out of use in the late 18th century as the Penal Laws against Roman Catholics in Ireland were relaxed. Irish colleges were important centres for the writing of Irish history and the preservation of Ireland‚Äôs rich cultural traditions. M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh was sent from an Irish college to Ireland to compile the Annals of the Four Masters, an important chronicle of Irish history. Within the colleges, printing press in the Irish language were established and a collection of the lives of Irish saints was produced. Irish colleges were also helpful for the Irish resistance during the Nine Years' War in Ireland and later exile on the European continent. On 16 October 1802, Irish colleges located in Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, Douai, Lille, Antwerp, Leuven and Paris were merged under a unique administration, alongside the Scottish College in Douai and Scots College in Paris. In 1951 The Salamanca Archive, documents relating to the Irish Colleges in Spain were given to the Irish Church and deposited in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.New Catalogue of Salamanca Papers, Maynooth College Archivium Hibernicum In the last decade, the Irish Government has financed the renovation of the premises of the Irish College in Paris which now serves as an Irish Cultural Centre and a residence for Irish students, writers and artists. The Pontifical Irish College in Rome continues to be used for the education and training of Roman Catholic clergy. In 1983 the Irish College in Leuven was made available by the Irish Franciscans for development as a secular resource. The Leuven Institute for Ireland in Europe is now located on the premises.

Bird's eye view from west, painted prior to partial demolition of 1785. The buildings to the east (left) of the tall slender octagonal tower adjacent to the porch were demolished in 1785 by Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757‚Äì1799) and the driveway from the gatehouse was built over their former location southwards 1/2 mile to New Shute House built by him 1787‚Äì89. St Michael's Church, Shute parish, is visible to the east (left) Old Shute House (known as Shute Barton between about 1789 and the 20th century), located at Shute, near Colyton, Axminster, Devon, is the remnant of a mediaeval manor house with Tudor additions, today in the ownership of the National Trust. It was given a Grade I listing on 14 December 1955. It is one of the most important non-fortified manor houses of the Middle Ages still in existence. It was built about 1380 as a hall house and was greatly expanded in the late 16th century and partly demolished in 1785. The original 14th-century house survives, although much altered. This article is based on the work of Bridie (1955), which has however been superseded as the standard work of reference on the architectural history of the building by the unpublished Exeter Archaeology Report of 2008 produced for the National Trust.Cooper, Nicholas; Mannez, Pru; Blaylock, Stuart, Shute Barton, Devon: Historic Building Analysis and Archaeological Survey 2008, Exeter Archaeology Report no. 08.80, produced for the National Trust This report draws on new evidence gained from the recently discovered survey of 1559 made by Sir William Petre, which lists each main room of the then existing house together with its contents. From this evidence a conjectural ground plan of the house pre-1785 was recently produced by Roger Waterhouse. Old Shute House, viewed from north, showing the addition (to the left with turret, north end facing viewer) built by Sir William Pole the Antiquary (1561‚Äì1635) in circa 1587‚Äì1600. The range behind to the right running perpendicular, i.e. to the west, is the original great hall of 1380. The now demolished porch stood adjacent on the east (left) of the turret, on the present driveway which leads onwards 1/2 mile to the south to New Shute HousePer Bridie, M.F., Thye Story of Shute, Axminster, 1955 Old Shute House, Devon, viewed from SE. The wall on the east (right) now shored up with buttresses formed the western wall of the 16th-century additions demolished in 1785 Plan of Old Shute House Description The original 1380 building was a simple parallelogram measuring externally 36 feet by 46 feet, containing a single large room, a great hall, extending up to the roof, lit by four 12 foot pointed-arched gothic windows, two on each of the long sides. The original entry door survives in the middle of the northern fa√ßade, but the two 12 foot flanking windows were later filled in, although their outlines are still visible in the stonework. The fireplace was at the western end and the dais on which was situated the lord's table was at the opposite eastern end, beyond which was the screens-passage leading to the domestic outbuildings. A private chamber for the lord's private occupation was built over the screens-passage, but extended partially into the great hall as a gallery, leaving most of it still open to the roof. This new chamber was reached via an octagonal tower added at the NE corner of the rectangular building, accessible from the dias, containing a circular staircase. The stone door-frame of the screens-passage door in the east wall leading from the great hall into the original out- buildings serving as kitchen, buttery and pantry survives, but now as an internal door as the Tudor additional wing was built onto the east wall of the 1380 great hall. At the west end of the great hall the great fireplace survives, spanning almost the whole width of the room, and containing a hearth 10 feet in depth. The external walls on either side of this huge hearth were strengthened by buttresses, still surviving, to counter the outward force exerted on the walls by the weight of the chimney breast. The fireplace is said to be the largest existing mediaeval one in Britain, with a span of 24 feet. The will dated 1407 of William Bonville, the original builder, mentions \\"ma salle (hall), ma chambre, panetrie (pantry for breadmaking), botellie (buttery for storage of wine) cusyne (kitchen) and pestrine (pastry room)\\"Bridie, p.30 At a later period a ceiling was inserted over the whole of the great hall to provide upper floor chambers, and even later a second ceiling was added to provide a middle floor of accommodation. Additional small windows were then required to provide light to the top floors. Thus the ancient arch-braced roof is no longer visible from the floor of the great hall. Modern horizontal pine tie-beams were later added to the arched roof timbers, which detract from the grandeur of the structure.Bridie, caption to image of roof timbers, p.31/31 In the Tudor age the house was greatly extended and more than doubled in size, due to the alterations of Cicely Bonville, Baroness Harington and Marchioness of Dorset (1460‚Äì1529), the great heiress of the Bonville estates. The Pole family also made some additions in the late 16th century. Descent of the manor=Bonville Bonville: Sable, six mullets argent pierced gules Source: Burke's General Armory 1884, p.99 The original hall-house was built in about 1380 by Sir William Bonville I (c.1332-1408), Sheriff of Somerset, Dorset and Devon. His Inquisition post mortem lists his vast land holdings in Cornwall, Wiltshire, Devon and Somerset, including Stapyldon and Sock Dennis (Somerset), West Kington (Wiltshire), Wiscombe and Southleigh and Meriet. Sir William Bonville I (d. 1408) married as his first wife Margaret d'Aumarle, the heiress of Meriet. By her he had his eldest son Sir John Bonville, who pre-deceased his father when Sir John died 21 October 1396. He had, however, married Elizabeth FitzRoger, the daughter and sole heiress of John (or Henry) FitzRoger of Chewton Mendip, Somerset, by whom he left on his death a four-year-old son and heir William Bonville, K.G., first Lord Bonville (1392‚Äì1461), whose summons to Parliament on 10 March 1449 made him 1st Baron Bonville. He was born and baptized at Shute on 31 August 1392, as his Proof of age inquisition held at Honiton in 1413 attests. He was appointed by the king a Knight of the Garter on 8 February 1461. During the Wars of the Roses, Lord Bonville formed a deep enmity with Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon (1414‚Äì1458), largely based on the wish of each man to be the pre-eminent power in Devon. Courtenay had as his secondary seat Colcombe Castle, only a few miles from Shute, and the proximity of their two estates served to fuel their enmity. They met decisively with their armed followers at the Battle of Clyst Heath, on 15 December 1455, at which Lord Bonville was defeated and after which the Earl sacked and pillaged Shute.Orme, Nicholas, Representation & Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages, published in Kain, Roger & Ravenhill, William, (eds.) Historical Atlas of South-West England, Exeter, 1999, pp. 141, 144 Lord Bonville witnessed the killing of both his son and grandson by Lancastrians on the same day at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, and was himself beheaded on 18 February 1461 after the Second Battle of St Albans. The sole survivor of the Bonville dynasty was his grandson's six-month-old infant daughter Cicely Bonville, Baroness Harington and Marchioness of Dorset (1460‚Äì1530). She was then heiress to one of the greatest estates in England and her valuable wardship was granted by King Edward IV to her mother and stepfather, Katherine Neville (sister of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, The King-Maker, and Sir William Hastings, KG, but on the condition that she would at the age of sixteen become the wife of Thomas Grey, the son of the King's wife Elizabeth Woodville, by her first husband Sir John Grey of Groby. Thus the king could reward his wife by enriching her son by an advantageous marriage and ennobling him as 1st Marquess of Dorset. Grey Arms of Grey: Barry of six argent and azureRobson, Thomas, The British Herald Cecily survived the Wars of the Roses and in the peaceful reign of the first Tudor king she set about extending Shute House from a mediaeval hall house into a grand Tudor residence. She lived much of her later life at Astley Castle in Astley, Warwickshire, the ancestral seat of the Grey family, where she was buried. Her great-grand-daughter and ultimate heiress was Lady Jane Grey, executed in 1554, upon which all the Bonville inheritance escheated to the crown. Petre Following the attainder and executions of Sir Henry Grey, 3rd Marquess of Dorset and his daughter Lady Jane Grey, Queen Mary granted the Bonville estates to Sir William Petre, her principal Secretary of State. Pole Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.497; Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.645 In 1560 at Colyford, Sir William Petre sold the \\"house, materials and furniture of Shute House\\" to William Pole, Esquire (1515‚Äì1587), for ¬£300. It was probably coincidental to the grant that the Poles were distant descendants of the brother of Sir William Bonville, the first builder of Shute.Bridie, p.79 Pole was Treasurer of the Inner Temple, a JP and was MP for Lyme Regis in 1545, Bridport in 1553 and for West Looe in 1559. He is buried in Colyton Church under a simple ledger-stone slab in the aisle with a much-worn inscription. In 1562 Pole acquired the lease for 1,200 years of a further eight score acres at Shute, for an annual rent of ¬£16.Bridie, p.80 His son Sir William Pole (1561‚Äì1635), the antiquary, who had retired by 1618 to nearby Colcombe Castle, wrote sometime after that date: \\"My father had the howse (of Shute) and park from Sir William Petre and dwelled there during his leif and left it unto me, and my eldest son John holdeth it from mee\\".Bridie, p.81 =Descent of Shute in Pole family= The descent of Shute from Sir William Pole the antiquary was as follows:Bridie, p.ii, pedigree of Pole *Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet (died 1658), MP, son and heir of the antiquarian, who married his step-sister Elizabeth How, daughter and heiress of Roger How of Crediton. He lived at Shute and at Bromley St Leonards, Middlesex. He and his wife are depicted in life-size effigies under an ornate canopy supported on Corinthian columns in Colyton Church. *Sir Courtenay Pole, 2nd Baronet (1618‚Äì1695), MP for Honiton, 2nd and eldest surviving son of the 1st baronet. His first name was in honour of the marriage of his father's sister to Francis Courtenay, de jure 4th Earl of Devon, of Powderham Castle. Two portraits of him exist at Antony House in Cornwall. Following the Restoration he purchased a painting of King Charles II by Lely now at Antony House. He married Urith Shapcote. *Sir John Pole, 3rd Baronet (1649‚Äì1714), MP, son of the 2nd baronet. He married Anne Morice. *Sir William Pole, 4th Baronet (1678‚Äì1741), Master of the Household to Queen Anne. His marble statue stands in Shute Church. He married Elizabeth Warry (died 1758). His younger brother was Rev. Carolus Pole (born 1686), Rector of St Breock,Vivian, p.143 who married Sarah Rashleigh, daughter of Jonathan Rashleigh (1642‚Äì1702) of Menabilly, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1686/7, and several times MP for Fowey, by his second wife Jane Carew, daughter of Sir John Carew, 3rd Baronet (1635‚Äì1692) of Antony in Cornwall. Sarah Rashleigh became the heiress of Antony and descendants of her marriage to Carolus Pole inherited Shute in 1926 on the death without progeny of Frederick Arundel de la Pole, 11th Baronet. *Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet (1732‚Äì1760), who married Elizabeth Mills (died 1758). *Sir John William de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757‚Äì1799), MP, who married Anne Templer (1758‚Äì1832), daughter of James Templer (died 1782) of Stover House, Teigngrace, near Newton Abbot. In 1785 he demolished the most easterly Tudor additions to Old Shute House and built between 1787 and 1789 a new Palladian mansion known as New Shute House about half a mile to the east of the old house, which thenceforth became the family seat. Old Shute House then became a \\"barton\\", the Devonshire and West-Country term for a home farm to the estate. It was thus either let to a farmer or allowed as free accommodation to the Pole's farm manager. *Sir William Templer-Pole, 7th Baronet (1782‚Äì1847), married twice, with issue from each marriage. *John G. Reeve de la Pole, 8th Baronet (1808‚Äì1874), son of the 7th baronet by his first wife Sophia-Ann, died without issue. *Sir William Edmund Pole, 9th Baronet (1816‚Äì1895), son of the 7th baronet by his second wife Charlotte Fraser. His wife was of the Talbot family. *Edmund Reginald de la Pole, 10th Baronet (1844‚Äì1912), son of the 9th baronet, died without issue. *Sir Frederick arundel de la Pole, 11th Baronet (1850‚Äì1926), died unmarried and without issue. He bequeathed Shute to his distant cousin: *Sir John Gawen Pole-Carew (1902‚Äì1993) of Antony House, Cornwall, who on becoming the 12th Baronet changed his name to Carew-Pole. He transferred to Antony House the Pole furnishings, paintings and papers from New Shute House, which he let to a girls' school between 1933 and 1974 in which year he sold it. He also donated Old Shute House to the National Trust in 1959, on the condition that it would remain tenanted by his cousin Christopher Pole-Carew (born 1931, descended from Carolus Pole, younger brother of the 4th baronet) who remained, with his wife Gillian Burton, tenant there until 2008.Bridie, Addendum to 1995 edition, by Christopher Pole-Carew National Trust Although it is now managed by the National Trust, the Pole-Carew family, descendants of the Poles, have the right to live there. The recent custodians, Christopher Pole-Carew and his wife Gillian, relinquished the role in 2008. The main part of the house opened as a holiday let in Spring 2011. The gatehouse is leased separately to the Landmark Trust who market it as a holiday let. Description by John Swete View from SW entitled \\"Old Shute House\\", watercolour by Rev. John Swete dated 29 January 1795. Devon Record Office 564M/F7/85 The Devon topographer Rev. John Swete passed by Shute on his excursion of 29 January 1795, and recorded the following in his \\"Journal\\", having just left Colyton:Travels in Georgian Devon, The Illustrated Journals of the Reverend John Swete, Vol.2, Gray, Todd (Ed.), Tiverton, 1998, pp.112-3 \\"I had now, by ascending somewhat of the hill, got in sight of the Old House of Shute, a good deal of which has been taken(-down). From the road it is seen as in the sketch (see at right), an embattled edifice of a castellated figure with projecting towers both in front and behind. A tower with pinnacles rear'd itself close at the back of the castle appearing as if it belonged to a church or chapel;\\" (i.e. St Michael's Church) \\"a fine relief was given to the whole of this pile by means of some noble trees that rose high behind it and over all was beheld (an) elevated hill.\\" He continues to relate the story of the armed encounter of Bonville and Courtenay at Clyst Heath in 1455, which he understood to have been a battle of single combat, adding Risdon's story of the gallantry displayed toward his opponent by Courtenay when Bonville accidentally dropped his sword whereupon the former stood still and cast away his sword also, and to end the contest the two \\"lovingly embraced one another\\". Modern historians relate the incident without any such niceties, and indeed so bitter remained Courtenay's hatred of Bonville that he it was who successfully urged the unwilling King Henry VI to execute him after the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461. After having set-out the descent of Shute to the Poles, Swete noted that Old Shute was becoming neglected: \\"Thus the two rival families of Colcombe and Shute being no more, the two seats acknowledg'd one gentleman as their lord. But in process of time instead of the families, the seats themselves became rivals to one another and, Shute getting the superiority by the translation of the Pole family thither, Colcombe Castle became deserted and mouldered into a ruin and now in its turn, by another removal of the family to the new house, Shute is experiencing the same fate\\". He finishes his account of his visit to Shute by regretting due to lack of time his not having made a sketch of Shute Gateway \\"Which is by far too remarkable and picturesque to be omitted\\", and hopes to return again for the purpose.

The series also featured many voices familiar to fans of Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons, as well as notable Capitol music artists, such as Stan Kenton. Sparky albums were originally released on standard shellac 10-inch 78 RPM records, usually with three discs in each album and sold in the book-like covers, whence the term ‚Äúalbum‚Äù originates. These six-sided record albums had a total playing time of about 20 minutes. In later years, the series was reissued on vinyl 78, 45, LP, and CD. Sparky‚Äôs Magic Piano was the most popular album in the series. It is one of the few children‚Äôs albums of the period to remain available. Therefore the original 78s have a relatively low collectors' value. However it is not easy to acquire a complete set of the original shellac records. The shellac records are distinguishable by their black Capitol labels. Vinyl 78 versions are more common, with purple Capitol labels and sometimes a ‚ÄúBozo Approved‚Äù logo in the corner of the album cover. The unusual popularity of Sparky‚Äôs Magic Piano can be attributed to the fact that the album is not only an excellent work of children‚Äôs fantasy; it also has a useful moral that was inspirational to any child practising a musical instrument or studying classical music. Thus the album is a practical teaching tool as well as entertainment. Because of the success of Sparky‚Äôs Magic Piano, two of the subsequent Sparky albums (Sparky's Music Mix-up and Sparky's Magic Baton) also involved talking musical instruments giving lessons for music students. Therefore the series seems to have taken a different direction to that which may have been originally intended. (The first album about talking trains was not musical, and was more dramatic than educational.) Sparky's Magic Piano plot summary Sparky is a young child who hates practising the piano. One day, when he expresses his dislike for practicing, the piano talks to him, and tells him that he will show him what it is like to play the piano well, and that all Sparky has to do is run his fingers over the keys, and the piano will play whatever Sparky chooses. Sparky then amazes his mother with his playing, and she calls his piano teacher. The two adults decide to book concerts across the country, with Sparky as a solo pianist. Sparky insists that he must take his own piano with him to all his concerts, and his mother agrees. However, the piano will only play for Sparky for a limited time, and during his biggest concert in New York, after he finishes his repertoire and the audience requests for an encore, time runs out. Sparky begs the piano to play, but it does not respond, and Sparky is reduced to banging helplessly on the keys. He hears his mother calling him, and he awakens and finds himself at home. It then becomes apparent to the listener, and to Sparky, that the entire experience was a dream. But it has given Sparky a new appreciation of the piano, and he vows to keep practising until he can play as well as he did in his dream.

The animated version was directed by Lee Mishkin and features an expanded story running 48 minutes. The pace of the story is greatly slowed: Sparky is portrayed with less innocence and he developed an ego from his success, which is why the piano refuses to continue playing for him here; he has acquired a dog named Beans; his father is given a much bigger role, being opposed to Sparky's music tour and fame due to his correct fears that Sparky would develop a selfish persona at such a young age from the experience; and a bumbling music critic has been added to the cast who is out to prove Sparky is a fraud. The voice cast includes Vincent Price, Coral Browne, Tony Curtis, Cloris Leachman, Josh Rodine, Mel Blanc, and William Schallert, with orchestration by Lalo Schifrin and piano music by Leonard Pennario. At the end of this version it also appears all to have been a dream, with the final voice over claiming \\"it wasn't a magic piano after all..\\" (after which the piano shows a face and winks to the audience) \\"or was it?\\"...

Life His life is only known from the information given in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, according to which he is sometimes called Dobroslav II in modern historiography. Dobroslav was the eldest of four sons of the Dioclean king Michael I and his second wife, a Greek. Dobroslav was about 25 years old at the death of his father, in ca. 1081. Although being the eldest son, Michael had chosen his favourite, Constantine Bodin, to succeed him. The Venetians had rescued Bodin in 1078 from Byzantine captivity. By 1085, Bodin and his brothers had suppressed a revolt by their cousins, the sons of Michael's brother Radoslav in the ≈æupa of Zeta, and Constantine Bodin ruled unchallenged until his death in 1101. Dobroslav succeeded as titular \\"King of Slavs\\". According to the Chronicle of Duklja, Dobroslav was selected by the people to become king after the death of Bodin. However, his reign was short as Vukan, Grand Prince of Serbia, along with the pretender to the Dioclean throne, Koƒçopar, attacked Duklja, defeating Dobroslav at the Battle of Moraƒça. Dobroslav was overthrown and was banished to inner Serbia. In the meantime, the army from inner Serbia, along with Koƒçopar and Vukan, took over Dioclea. Koƒçopar wasn't able to hold his position in Dioclea, and thus escaped to Zachumlia, where he died. Vladimir, Dobroslav's nephew, assumed the throne of Dioclea after Koƒçopar's death. Dobroslav was later released from prison in inner Serbia and returned to Dioclea. However, upon his arrival, Vladimir imprisoned him in Scutari where he was blinded and castrated on the orders of Bodin's widow, Queen Jaquinta. His last years were spent at the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Sv. Srƒëa i Vakha) on the Bojana river, where he was buried. He had no issue.

His assassin was Nathuram Godse, an advocate of Hindu nationalism, a member of the political party the Hindu Mahasabha, and a past member of the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Godse considered Gandhi to have been too accommodating to Muslims during the Partition of India of the previous year. Quote: \\"The apotheosis of this contrast is the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 by a militant Nathuram Godse, on the basis of his 'weak' accommodationist approach towards the new state of Pakistan.\\" (p. 544) Sometime after 5 PM, according to witnesses, Gandhi had reached the top of the steps leading to the raised lawn behind Birla House where he had been conducting multi-faith prayer meetings every evening. As Gandhi began to walk toward the dais, Godse stepped out from the crowd flanking Gandhi's path, and fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest and abdomen at point-blank range. Gandhi fell to the ground. He was carried back to his room in Birla House from which a representative emerged sometime later to announce his death. Godse was captured by members of the crowd and handed over to the police. The Gandhi murder trial opened in May 1948 in Delhi's historic Red Fort, with Godse the main defendant, and his collaborator Narayan Apte and six others as the co- defendants. Godse and Apte were sentenced to death on 8 November 1949. They were hanged in the Ambala jail on 15 November 1949. Preparations In early September 1947, Gandhi moved to Delhi to help stem the violent rioting there and in the neighboring province of East Punjab. The rioting had come in the wake of the partition of the British Indian empire, which had accompanied the creation of the new independent dominions of India and Pakistan, and involved large, chaotic transfers of population between them. Nathuram Vinayak Godse, and his assassination accomplices, were residents of the Deccan region. Godse had previously led a civil disobedience movement against Osman Ali Khan, the Muslim ruler of the princely Deccan region dominion of Hyderabad State in British India. Godse joined a protest march in 1938 in Hyderabad, where Hindus were being discriminated against, according to Fetherling. He was arrested for political crimes and served a prison sentence. Once he was out of prison, Godse continued his civil disobedience and worked as a journalist reporting the sufferings of Hindu refugees escaping from Pakistan, and during the various religious riots that erupted in the 1940s. According to Arvind Sharma, the concrete plans to assassinate Gandhi were initiated by Godse and his accomplices in 1948, after India and Pakistan had already started a war over Kashmir. The government of India withheld the money because Pakistan could use the money against them in war. But Gandhi opposed the decision and went on a fast-unto-death on 13January 1948 to pressure the Indian government to release the payment to Pakistan. The Indian government, yielding to Gandhi, reversed its decision. Godse and his colleagues interpreted this sequence of events to be a case of Mahatma Gandhi controlling power and hurting India. On the day Gandhi went on hunger strike, Godse and his colleagues began planning how to assassinate Gandhi. Nathuram Vinayak Godse and Narayan Apte purchased a Beretta M1934. Along with purchasing the pistol, Godse and his accomplices shadowed Gandhi's movements. Assassination=20 January 1948  Gandhi had initially been staying at the Balmiki Temple, near Gole Market in the northern part of New Delhi, and holding his prayer meetings there. When the temple was requisitioned for sheltering refugees of the partition he moved to Birla House, a large mansion on what was then Albuquerque Road in south- central New Delhi, not far from the diplomatic enclave. Gandhi was living in two unpretentious rooms in the left wing of Birla House, and conducting prayer meetings on a raised lawn behind the mansion. The first attempt to assassinate Gandhi at Birla House occurred on 20January 1948. According to Stanley Wolpert, Nathuram Godse and his colleagues followed Gandhi to a park where he was speaking. One of them threw a grenade away from the crowd. The loud explosion scared the crowd, creating a chaotic stampede of people. Gandhi was left alone on the speakers' platform. The original assassination plan was to throw a second grenade, after the crowds had run away, at the isolated Gandhi. But the alleged accomplice Digambar Badge lost his courage, did not throw the second grenade and ran away with the crowd. All of the assassination plotters ran away, except Madanlal Pahwa who was a Punjabi refugee of the Partition of India. He was arrested. Pahwa was released in 1964. 30 January 1948Manuben Gandhi= Manu (Mridula) Gandhi, called \\"Manuben\\" in Gujarati fashion, was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's great niece (more precisely, a first cousin twice removed). She had come to join Gandhi's entourage during his peace mission to Noakhali in East Bengal, which had been gripped by communal violence. Abha Chatterjee (Abhaben Chatterjee) was a girl adopted by the Gandhis who would later marry Gandhi's nephew, Kanu Gandhi. Both young women were walking with Gandhi when he was assassinated.Thrill of the chaste: The truth about Gandhi's sex life , The Independent, London, UK (2 January 2012) According to Last Glimpses Of Bapu, a memoir by Manuben Gandhi published in 1962, Mahatma Gandhi (Bapu) started the day in Birla House by listening to a recitation of the Bhagavad Gita. He then worked on a Congress constitution he wanted to publish in the Harijan, had his bath and massage at 8a.m., and reprimanded Manuben to take care of herself since her health was not what it should be for an 18-year-old. Gandhi, aged 78, was weighed after his bath and was . He then ate lunch with Pyarelalji discussing Noakhali riots. After lunch, states Manuben, Gandhi napped. After waking up, he had a meeting with Sardar Dada. Two Kathiawar leaders wanted to meet him, and when Manuben informed Gandhi that they wanted to meet him, Gandhi replied, \\"Tell them that, if I remain alive, they can talk to me after the prayer on my walk\\". According to Manuben's memoir, the meeting between Vallabhbhai Patel and Gandhi went past the scheduled time and Gandhi was about ten minutes late to the prayer meeting. He began his walk to the prayer location by walking with Manuben to his right and Abha to his left, holding onto them as walking sticks. A stout young man in khaki dress, wrote Manuben, pushed his way through the crowd bent over and with his hands folded. Manuben thought that the man wanted to touch Gandhi's feet. She pushed the man aside saying, \\"Bapu is already ten minutes late, why do you embarrass him\\". Godse pushed her aside so forcibly that she lost her balance and the rosary, notebook, and Gandhi's spitoon she was carrying, fell out of her hands. She recalled that as she bent to the ground to pick up the items she heard four shots, resounding booms, and she saw smoke everywhere. Gandhi's hands were folded, with his lips saying, \\"Hei Ra...ma! Hei Ra...!\\". Abhaben, wrote Manuben, had also fallen down and she saw the assassinated Gandhi in Abhaben's lap. The pistol shots had deafened her, wrote Manuben, the smoke was very thick, and the incident complete within 3 to 4minutes. A crowd of people rushed towards them, according to Manuben. The watch she was carrying showed 5:17p.m. and blood was everywhere on their white clothes. Manuben estimated that it took about ten minutes to carry Gandhi back into the house, and no doctor was available in the meanwhile. They only had a first aid box, but there was no medicine in it for treating Gandhi's wounds. According to Manuben, Gandhi had suffered profuse blood loss. Everyone was crying loudly. In the house, Bhai Saheb had phoned the hospital many times, but was unable to reach any help. He then went to Willingdon Hospital in person, but came back disappointed. Manuben and others read Gita as Gandhi's body lay in the room. Col. Bhargava arrived, and he pronounced Gandhi dead. =Herbert Reiner= According to several reports, while the attending crowd was still in shock, Gandhi's assassin Godse was seized by Herbert Reiner Jr, a 32-year-old, newly arrived vice-consul at the American embassy in Delhi. According to an obituary for Reiner published in May 2000 by The Los Angeles Times, Reiner's role was reported on the front pages of newspapers around the world,, Quote: \\" On Jan. 30, 1948, he went to a prayer meeting to catch a glimpse of Gandhi. It was to be Gandhi's last meeting. Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist enraged by Gandhi's overtures to Muslims, brushed past his aide and fired three shots at the great moral leader. Reiner seized him and swung him into the hands of the Indian police, an action captured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. According to , on January 30, 1948, Reiner had reached Birla House after work, arriving fifteen minutes before the scheduled start of the prayer meeting at 5 p.m., and finding himself in a relatively small crowd. Although there were some armed guards present, Reiner felt that the security measures were inadequate, especially in view of an attempted bomb explosion at the same location ten days before. By the time Gandhi and his small party reached the garden area a few minutes after five, the crowd had swelled to several hundred, which Reiner described as comprising \\"schoolboys, girls, sweepers, members of the armed services, businessmen, sadhus, holy men, and even vendors displaying pictures of 'Bapu'\\". At first, Reiner had been at some distance from the path leading to the dais, but he moved forward, explaining later, \\"An impulse to see more, and at a closer range, of this Indian leader impelled me to move away from the group in which I had been standing to the edge of the terrace steps\\". As Gandhi was walking briskly up the steps leading to the lawn, an unidentified man in the crowd spoke up, somewhat insolently in Reiner's recollection, \\"Gandhiji, you are late\\". Gandhi slowed down his pace, turned toward the man, and gave him an annoyed look, passing directly in front of Reiner at that moment. But no sooner had Gandhi reached the top of the steps, than another man, a stocky Indian man, in his 30s, and dressed in khaki clothes, stepped out from the crowd and into Gandhi's path. He soon fired several shots up close, at once felling Gandhi. A BBC correspondent Robert Stimson described what happened next in a radio report filed that night: \\"For a few seconds no one could believe what had happened; every one seemed dazed and numb. And then a young American who had come for prayers rushed forward and seized the shoulders of the man in the khaki coat. That broke the spell. ... Half a dozen people stooped to lift Gandhi. Others hurled themselves upon the attacker. ... He was overpowered and taken away\\". Others, as well, described how the crowd seemed paralyzed until Reiner's action. Robert Trumbull of The New York Times, who was an eyewitness, described Reiner's action in a front-page story on January31, 1948, Reiner too had noticed a man in khaki step into the path leading to the dais, but his further view was occluded by a party of associates following Gandhi. He soon heard sounds, though, which in his words were \\"not loud, not ringing, and not unlike the reports of damp firecrackers ...\\" and which for a moment made him wonder if some sort of celebration was underway. The details and the role of Reiner in seizing Godse vary by the source. According to Frank Allston, Reiner stated that According to Tunzelmann, Godse was seized and pummeled by Reiner. According to K. L. Gauba, Reiner was the \\"unsung hero\\" and had he not acted \\"Godse would probably have shot his way out\\". Reiner was standing in the front row, states Pramod Kapoor, and he seized and held Godse till the police arrived, but his name only appeared in some American newspapers. According to Bamzai and Damle, during the assassination trial, the government did not call to the stand American marine Herbert \\"Tom\\" Reiner who caught Godse or the nephew of then Congress minister Takthmal Jain of Madhya Bharat ministry (1948), as well as many others. =Other reports= According to other reports, Godse surrendered voluntarily and asked for the police.[a] , Quote: \\"he [Godse] made no attempt to run away and himself shouted for the police\\"; [b] . Quote: \\"Godse then calmly called for the police and turned himself in\\"; [c] . Quote: \\"Godse did not flee the scene, and he voluntarily surrendered himself to the police\\"; [d] ; [e] Yet other reports state he was rushed by the crowd, beaten, arrested, and taken to jail. According to some eyewitnesses and court proceedings, Nathuram Godse was seized immediately by witnesses and an Indian Air Force officer dispossessed him of the pistol. The crowd beat him to a bloodied state. The police wrested him loose from the angry crowd, took him to jail. A FIR was filed by Nandlal Mehta at the Tughlak Road police station at Delhi. The 31 January 1948 issue of The Guardian, a British newspaper, described Gandhi as walking from the \\"Birla House to the lawn where his evening prayer meetings were held\\". Gandhi was a bit late for the prayer, leaning on the shoulders of two grand-nieces. On his way, he was approached by a man [Godse] dressed in a khaki bush jacket and blue trousers. Godse greeted him with a Namaste, the customary Hindu salute. According to one version, stated The Guardian, Gandhi smiled back and spoke to Godse, then the assailant pulled out a pistol and fired three times, at point-blank range, into Gandhi's chest, stomach and groin. Gandhi died at 5:40pm, about half an hour after he was shot. According to The Guardian report, which did not mention Herbert Reiner Jr, Godse \\"fired a fourth shot, apparently in an effort to kill himself, but a Royal Indian Air Force sergeant standing alongside jolted his arm and wrenched the pistol away. The sergeant wanted to shoot the man but was stopped by the police. An infuriated crowd fell upon the man and beat him with sticks, but he was apprehended by the police and taken to a police station.\\"Assassination of Mr Gandhi , The Guardian (31 January 1949 Godse was questioned by reporters, who in English replied that he was not sorry to have killed Gandhi and awaited his day in court to explain his reasons. Vincent Sheean was another eyewitness and an American reporter who had covered World War II events. He went to India in 1947 and became a disciple of Gandhi. He was with the BBC reporter Bob Stimson in Birla House premises when Gandhi was assassinated. They stood next to each other by the corner of a wall. According to Sheean, Gandhi walked across the grass in their direction, leaning lightly \\"on two of the girls\\", and two or three others following them. Gandhi wrapped in a homespun shawl passed them by, states Sheean's eyewitness account, and climbed up four or five steps to the prayer ground. As usual, according to Sheean, \\"there was a clump of people, some of whom were standing and some of whom had gone on their knees or bent low before him. Bob and I turned to watch-we were perhaps ten feet away from the steps-but the clump of people cut off our view of the Mahatma now: he was so small\\". Then, states Sheean, he heard \\"four, dull, dark explosions\\". Sheean asked Stimson, \\"what's that?\\" Stimson replied, \\"I don't know\\". It was a confusing place, people were weeping and many things happening, wrote Sheean. \\"A doctor was found, the police took charge; the body of the Mahatma was carried away; the crowd melted, perhaps urged to do so by the police; I saw none of this.\\" Stimson filed a BBC report, then he and Sheean walked up and down the flower bed for a while. Sheean reported that he later met a \\"young American from the Embassy\\" who had never been to a prayer meeting before. Sheean did not take in anything the young American said about the scene, but a week later learned that \\"it was this young man who had captured the assassin, held him for the Indian police\\" and after turning the assassin over, it was this young American who searched the crowd for a doctor. He experienced a tribal pride, states Sheean, that even though he was paralyzed and helpless on the day of Gandhi's assassination, \\"one of his breed had been useful\\". According to Ashis Nandy, before firing the shots Godse \\"bowed down to Gandhi to show his respect for the services the Mahatma had rendered the country; he made no attempt to run away and himself shouted for the police\\". According to Pramod Das, Godse after firing the shots raised his hand with the gun, surrendered and called for the police. According to George Fetherling, Godse did not try to flee, he \\"stood silently waiting to be arrested but was not approached at first because he was still armed; at last a member of the Indian air force grabbed him by the wrist, and Godse released his weapon\\". Police, states Fetherling, then \\"quickly surrounded Godse to prevent the crowd from lynching him\\". According to Matt Doeden and others, \\"Godse did not flee the scene, and he voluntarily surrendered himself to the police\\". =Death= According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried back into the Birla House, into a bedroom, where he died about 30minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures. Motives During the subsequent trial, and in various witness accounts and books written since, the motivation of Godse has been summarized, speculated about and debated. Godse did not deny killing Gandhi, and made a long statement explaining his motivations for the assassination. Some of these motivations were: * Godse felt that the massacre and suffering caused during, and due to, the partition could have been avoided if Gandhi and the Indian government had acted to stop the killing of the minorities (Hindus and Sikhs) in West and East Pakistan. He stated Gandhi had not protested against these atrocities being suffered by Hindus in Pakistan and had instead resorted to fasts. In his court deposition, Godse said, \\"I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred ... if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan.'\\" * Godse called Gandhi subjective, someone who pretended to have a monopoly on truth. He stated that Gandhi thought of himself as the final judge of what is true or false, right or wrong, and the suffering of Hindus did not matter to him. Godse claimed that his group of volunteers and he were social workers who had worked across religious and caste boundaries for years to help their fellow Indians, and he was upset with Gandhi's actions and willingness to ignore non-Muslim interests and make concessions to Muslims. * Godse said that Gandhi exploited the feelings of tolerant Hindus with one-sided practices. Gandhi's recent prayer meetings in Hindu temples, said Godse, had started the practice of reading passages from the Quran, despite Hindus protesting this practice. However, according to Godse, Gandhi \\"dared not read the Gita in a mosque in the teeth of Muslim opposition\\" and \\"Gandhi knew what a terrible Muslim reaction would have been if he had done so\\". Godse alleged that Gandhi knew it is safe to trample on the tolerant Hindu. Godse wanted to show that a Hindu too can be intolerant. * Godse stated that Gandhi's fast to pressure the Indian government to release the final payment to Pakistan that it had previously frozen because of the war in Kashmir, and the Indian government's subsequent policy reversal, was proof that the Indian government reversed its decision to suit the feelings of Gandhi. India, said Godse, was not being run by the force of public opinion, but by Gandhi's whims. Godse added that he admired Gandhi for his lofty character, ceaseless work and asceticism, and Gandhi's formidable character meant that his influence outside of the due process would continue while he was alive. Gandhi had to be removed from the political stage, so that India can begin looking after its own interests as a nation, according to Godse. * Godse stated he did not oppose Gandhian ahimsa teachings, but Gandhi's talk of religious tolerance and nonviolence had already caused India to cede Pakistan to Muslims, uprooted millions of people from their home, caused immense violent loss of life and broken families. He believed that if Gandhi was not checked he would bring destruction and more massacres to Hindus. In Godse's opinion, \\"the only answer to violent aggression was violent self-defense\\". Godse stated that \\"Gandhi had betrayed his Hindu religion and culture by supporting Muslims at the expense of Hindus\\" because his lectures of ahimsa (non-violence) were directed at and accepted by the Hindu community only. Godse said, \\"I sat brooding intensely on the atrocities perpetrated on Hinduism and its dark and deadly future if left to face Islam (Pakistan) outside and Gandhi inside, and . . . I decided all of a sudden to take the extreme step against Gandhi\\". I did not hate Gandhi, I revered him because we both venerated much in Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture, we both were against superstitious aspects and the wrongs in Hinduism. Therefore I bowed before Gandhi when I met him, said Godse, then performed my moral duty and killed Gandhi. Trial and judgments The trial of persons accused of participation and complicity in the assassination at the Special Court in Red Fort Delhi on 27 May 1948. Front row, left to right: Nathuram Godse, Narayan Apte, and Vishnu Ramkrishna Karkare. Seated behind, left to right: Digambar Badge, Shankar Kistaiya, Veer Savarkar, Gopal Godse, and Dattatraya Sadashiv Parachure. The assassination was investigated, and many additional people were arrested, charged and tried in a lower court. The case and its appeal attracted considerable media attention, but Godse's statement in his defense to the court was banned immediately by the Indian government. Those convicted were either executed or served their complete sentences. Investigation and arrests Along with Nathuram Godse many other accomplices were arrested. They were all identified as prominent members of the Hindu Mahasabha ‚Äì an organization active in opposing the Muslim ruler of the princely state of Hyderabad State in the Deccan region, before the Indian Army forcibly removed the Nizam in Operation Polo in September 1948. Along with Godse and accomplices, police arrested the 65-year-old Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who they accused of being the mastermind behind the plot. =Arrested= The accused, their place of residence and occupational background were as follows: # Nathuram Vinayak Godse (Pune, Maharashtra; Member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, editor, journalist) # Narayan Apte (Pune, Maharashtra; formerly: British military service, teacher, newspaper manager) # Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (Mumbai, Maharashtra; Member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, author, lawyer, former president of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha) # Digambar Badge (Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; weapons merchant) # Shankar Kistayya (Pune, Maharashtra; rickshaw puller, domestic worker employed by Digambar Badge) # Dattatraya Parchure (Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh; medical service, care giver) # Vishnu Karkare (Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; orphan; odd jobs in hotels, musician in a traveling troupe, volunteer in relief efforts to religious riots (Noakhali), later restaurant owner) # Madanlal Pahwa (Ahmednagar refugee camp, Maharashtra; former British Indian army soldier, unemployed, Punjabi refugee who had migrated to India from Pakistan during the Partition.) # Gopal Godse (Pune, Maharashtra; brother of Nathuram Godse; storekeeper, merchant) Trial and sentencing: Lower Court The trial began on 27May 1948 and ran for eight months before Justice Atma Charan passed his final order on 10February 1949. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defense none. The court found all of the defendants except one guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others convicted for violation of the Explosive Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free due to lack of evidence. Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were sentenced to death by hanging and the remaining six (including Godse's brother, Gopal) were sentenced to life imprisonment. Appeal: High Court Of those found guilty, all except Godse appealed their conviction and sentence. Godse accepted his death sentence, but appealed the lower court ruling that found him guilty of conspiracy. Godse argued, in his limited appeal to the High Court, that there was no conspiracy, he alone was solely responsible for the assassination, witnesses saw only him kill Gandhi, that all co-accused were innocent and should be released. According to Markovitz, Godse's declarations and expressed motivations during the appeal have been analyzed in contrasting ways. For example, \\"while Robert Payne, in his detailed account of the trial, dwells on the irrational nature of his statement, Ashis Nandy underlines the deeply rational character of Godse's action, which, in his view, reflected the well-founded fears among upper-caste Hindus of Gandhi's message and its impact on Hindu society.\\" The appeal by the convicted men was heard from 2 May 1949, at Peterhoff, Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) which then housed the Punjab High Court. The High Court confirmed the findings and sentences of the lower court except in the cases of Dattatraya Parchure and Shankar Kistayya who were acquitted of all charges. Despite the Lower Court trial not commencing until five months after the assassination, and the trial itself lasting eight months, plus the appeals to the High Court not being completed until late in 1949, Professor Claude Markovits, a Senior Research Fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, wrote a 2004 book (The UnGandhian Gandhi: The Life and Afterlife of the Mahatma) in which he suggest that the trial and execution was rushed, attributing the haste to Vallabhbhai Patel's efforts \\"to avoid scrutiny for the failure to prevent the assassination.\\" Executions Godse and Apte were sentenced to death on 8November 1949. Pleas for commutation were made by Gandhi's two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, but these pleas were turned down by India's prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and the Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. Godse and Apte were hanged in Ambala jail on 15November 1949. According to the Almanac of World Crime, at the hanging Apte's neck broke and he died instantly, but \\"Godse died slowly by the rope\\"; instead of having his neck snap he choked \\"to death for fifteen minutes\\". Censorship and judge's comments The Government of India made the assassination trial public. It was widely followed until the day of Godse's statement. According to Awol Allo, the testimony of Nathuram Godse was \\"so persuasive\\" that the Indian government immediately banned it. Gopal Godse, a co-accused who was sentenced to life in prison, wrote a memoir which was published in 1967. It was immediately banned and circulating copies of it were seized by the Indian National Congress-led government because of fears that it promoted religious hatred between Hindus and Muslims in India. The complete Godse testimony and trial proceedings remained censored for nearly 30 years and were only published for the first time in 1977 after the Indian Congress Party lost power for the first time since Indian independence, and the new government lifted the censorship. G.D. Khosla, one of the judges who heard the assassination proceedings, later wrote of the Godse statement and the reception of his reasons for assassinating Gandhi by the audience in the court: Aftermath Funeral procession of Gandhi, passing the India Gate, Delhi Tributes After the assassination, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed the nation by radio: > Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is > darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say > it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is > no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him > again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for > advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for > me, but for millions and millions in this country.Jain, 1996, pp. 45‚Äì47. Gandhi's death was mourned around the world. Field Marshall Jan Smuts, former prime minister of South Africa, and once Gandhi's adversary, said, > \\"Gandhi was one of the great men of my time and my acquaintance with him > over a period of more than 30 years has only deepened my high respect for > him however much we differed in our views and methods. A prince among men > has passed away and we grieve with India in her irreparable loss.\\" The British prime minister Clement Attlee said in a radio address to the nation on the night of January 30, 1948: > Everyone will have learnt with profound horror of the brutal murder of Mr > Gandhi and I know that I am expressing the views of the British people in > offering to his fellow-countrymen our deep sympathy in the loss of their > greatest citizen. Mahatma Gandhi, as he was known in India, was one of the > outstanding figures in the world today, ... For a quarter of a century this > one man has been the major factor in every consideration of the Indian > problem. Leo Amery, the British secretary of state during the war said, > \\"It can be said that no one contributed more to the particular way in which > the charter of British rule in India has ended than Mahatma Gandhi himself. > His death comes at the close of a great chapter in world history. In the > mind of India, at least, he will always be identified with the opening of > the new chapter which, however troubled at the outset, we should all hope, > will develop in peace, concord and prosperity for India.\\" Lord Pethick-Lawrence, the British secretary of state in 1948 said: > What was the secret of his power over the hearts and minds of men and women? > In my opinion it was the fact that he voluntarily stripped himself of every > vestige of the privilege that he could have enjoyed on account of his birth, > means, personality and intellectual pre-eminence and took on himself the > status and infirmities of the ordinary man. When he was in South Africa as a > young man and opposed the treatment of his fellow-countrymen in that land, > he courted for himself the humiliation of the humblest Indian that he might > in his own person face the punishment meted out for disobedience.

He > never claimed to be any other than an ordinary man. He acknowledged his > liability to error and admitted that he had frequently-learnt by his > mistakes.

The New York Times in its editorial wrote: > \\"It is Gandhi the saint who will be remembered, not only on the plains and > in the hills of India, but all over the world.

Now he belongs to the ages.\\" Over two million people joined the five-mile long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla House, where he had been assassinated. Gandhi was cremated in a funeral pyre. Previous attempt in 1934 A prior, unsuccessful attempt, to assassinate Gandhi occurred on 25June 1934 at Pune. Gandhi was in Pune along with his wife, Kasturba Gandhi, to deliver a speech at Corporation Auditorium. They were travelling in a motorcade of two cars. The car in which the couple was travelling was delayed and the first car reached the auditorium. Just when the first car arrived at the auditorium, a bomb was thrown, which exploded near the car. This caused grievous injury to the Chief Officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation, two policemen and seven others. Nevertheless, no account or records of the investigation nor arrests made can be found. Gandhi's secretary, Pyarelal Nayyar, believed that the attempt failed due to lack of planning and co- ordination.Pyarelal Nayyar, Mahatma Gandhi ‚Äì The Last Phase, Navajivan, (1956). Legacy Gandhi's assassination dramatically changed the political landscape. Nehru became his political heir. According to Markovits, while Gandhi was alive, Pakistan's declaration that it was a \\"Muslim state\\" had led Indian groups to demand that India be declared a \\"Hindu state\\". Nehru used Gandhi's martyrdom as a political weapon to silence all advocates of Hindu nationalism as well as his political challengers. He linked Gandhi's assassination to the politics of hatred and ill-will. According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues called on Indians to honour Gandhi's memory and even more his ideals.Guha, Ramachandra (2007), India after Gandhi, Harper Collins, , pp. 37‚Äì40.Gopal, Sarvepalli (1979), Jawaharlal Nehru, Jonathan Cape, London, , pp. 16‚Äì17. Nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimize the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. For years after the assassination, states Markovits, \\"Gandhi's shadow loomed large over the political life of the new Indian Republic\\". The government quelled any opposition to its economic and social policies, despite this being contrary to Gandhi's ideas, by reconstructing Gandhi's image and ideals. In media Several books, plays and movies have been produced about the event. * May It Please Your Honor was published in 1977, containing Nathuram Godse's statement to the court, after the Indian Congress party lost power for the first time since Indian independence, and the new government lifted the censorship imposed since 1948 after gaining power in national elections. The text was republished in 1993 as Why I Assassinated Mahatma Gandhi?. * I, Nathuman Godse speaking is a play composed by Pradeep Dalvi based on the assassination trial. Locally produced as Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy, after seven sold-out shows it was banned in the State of Maharashtra in 1999 on directions from the then BJP led coalition government in Delhi. * Gandhi vs. Gandhi is a Marathi play that has been translated into several languages. Its primary plot is the relationship between Gandhi and his estranged son but it also deals briefly with the assassination. * Nine Hours to Rama is a 1963 British movie based on Stanley Wolpert's novel of the same name, which is a fictional account of the final nine hours leading up to Gandhi's assassination. * Gandhi and the Unspeakable: His Final Experiment with Truth by James Douglass is a non- fiction book that seeks to understand not only the facts of the murder but its importance in the larger struggle between non-violence and violence. * Hey Ram (2000) is a Tamil-Hindi bilingual film by Kamal Haasan about a fictitious plot to kill Gandhi by a man devastated by the partition riots and his change of heart even as the real-life plot succeeds. * In the 1982 film Gandhi the actor Harsh Nayyar portrayed Godse at the beginning and the end of the film.

Two well-known applets that use the shape extension are oclock, which is a simple round analog clock, and xeyes, which shows two googly eyes that follow the cursor on the screen as if they were watching it. Most X systems have one or the other (or both) in their standard installations. In addition, some window managers use the shape extension to draw non-rectangular icons.  Implementation  Applications can only create rectangular windows, but can then change their shape to be an arbitrary part of the original rectangle. The remaining area of the rectangle is not only transparent (shows what is below the window); rather, it is not part of the window at all. For example, if a window is shaped with a hole in the middle, not only the hole shows what is below the window, but a click in the hole is considered to be a click in what is below the window. A window having a rectangular outline but a hole in the middle. Applications create windows as usual (specifying width and height), but can then change the shape of a window to be a subset of the original area. by sending the X display server either a list of rectangles or a pixmap of color depth one (a black- and-white pixmap). More precisely, a client can request the rectangles or the pixmap to be set as the new shape, but also to be combined in various ways (e.g., intersected or added) with the old shape. A third way for changing the shape of a window is by using the current shape of a window or a part of it. The extension allows defining the shape of two separate regions: the clipping and the bounding regions. These two areas are defined even for windows not using the shape extension: the clipping region is the area that can be used for drawing, the bounding region is the total area covered by the window (that is, the clipping region plus the border). The shape extension allows defining two independent shapes for these two regions. Both the clipping and bounding are associated, in the shape extension, two areas: a default rectangular region and a possibly non-rectangular client region, defined and changed by the client as specified above. The effective region, which is the actual shape of the window, is the intersection of these two areas. This intersection is performed every time either region is changed: for example, if the client regions contains parts that are outside the default region but the default region is then enlarged, the effective region will include these parts.

Apart from this primary function, it also helps various government agencies like RBI, SEBI, MCA, CAG, IRDA, etc. in policy formulation. ICAI actively engages itself in aiding and advising economic policy formulation. For example, It has submitted its suggestions on the Companies Bill, 2009. It also examines the various taxation laws, rules, regulations, circulars, notifications, etc. which may be enacted or issued by the Government from time to time and to send suitable memoranda containing suggestions for improvements in the respective legislation. The government also takes the suggestions of ICAI as expert advice and considers it favorably. ICAI presented an approach paper on issues in implementing Goods and Service Tax in India to the Ministry of Finance. In response to this, Ministry of Finance has suggested that ICAI take a lead and help the government in implementing Goods and Services Tax (GST).  International affiliations  ICAI is a founder member of the International Federation of Accountants(IFAC), South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA), and Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) and International Innovation Network (IIN). ICAI is an Associate member of the Chartered Accountants Worldwide, Member of International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC).  Motto  New CA Logo for exclusive use by Chartered Accountants The motto of the ICAI is Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti (Sanskrit), which literally means \\"a person who is awake in those that sleep\\". It is a quotation from the Upanishads (Kathopanishad). It was given to the ICAI at the time of its formation in 1949 by Sri Aurobindo as a part of its emblem. CA. C. S. Shastri, a Chartered Accountant from Chennai went to Sri Aurobindo and requested him through a letter to give an emblem to the newly formed Institute of which he was an elected member from the Southern India. In reply to this request, Sri Aurobindo gave him the emblem with a Garuda, the mythical eagle in the center and a quotation from the Upanishad: Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti. The emblem along with the motto was placed at the first meeting of the Council of the Institute and was accepted amongst many other emblems placed by other members of the Council. Apart from its emblem, ICAI also has a separate logo for its members. As a part of a brand building exercise, ICAI introduced this separate new CA logo for the use of its members in 2007. The logo is free for use by all members of ICAI subject to certain conditions. The logo was launched by the then Minister of Corporate Affairs, Prem Chand Gupta at the occasion of the Chartered Accountant Day (1 July) in the presence of the then President of ICAI Sunil Talati. Members of ICAI cannot use the ICAI emblem, but they are encouraged to use the CA logo instead on their official stationery.  History  A 2018 stamp dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Government Diploma in Accountancy Certificate The Companies Act, 1913 passed in pre-independent India prescribed various books which had to be maintained by a Company registered under that Act. It also required the appointment of a formal Auditor with prescribed qualifications to audit such records. In order to act as an auditor, a person had to acquire a restricted certificate from the local government upon such conditions as may be prescribed. The holder of a restricted certificate was allowed to practice only within the province of an issue and in the language specified in the restricted certificate. In 1918 a course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics of Bombay (now known as Mumbai). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant of an unrestricted certificate. This certificate entitling the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India. Later on, the issue of restricted certificates was discontinued in the year 1920. In the year 1930, it was decided that the Government of India should maintain a register called the Register of Accountants. Any person whose name was entered in such register was called a Registered Accountant. Later on a board called the Indian Accountancy Board was established to advise the Governor General of India on accountancy and the qualifications for auditors. However it was felt that the accountancy profession was largely unregulated, and this caused much confusion as regards the qualifications of auditors. Hence in the year 1948, just after independence in 1947, an expert committee was created to look into the matter.Government of India Notification No.22-A(8)47 dated 1 May 1948. Copy of the notification available in page 28, July 2010 edition of The Chartered Accountant journal This expert committee recommended that a separate autonomous association of accountants should be formed to regulate the profession. The Government of India accepted the recommendation and passed the Chartered Accountants Act in 1949 even before India became a republic. Under section 3 of the said Act, ICAI is established as a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. Unlike most other commonwealth countries, the word chartered does not refer to a royal charter, since India is a republic. At the time of passing the Chartered Accountants Act, various titles used for similar professionals in other countries were considered, such as Certified Public Accountant. However, many accountants had already acquired membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and other Chartered Societies of Great Britain and were practicing as Chartered Accountants. This had created some sort of brand value. This designation inherited a public impression that Chartered Accountants had better qualifications than Registered Accountants. Hence the accountants were very stern in their stand that, the Indian accountancy professionals should be designated only as Chartered Accountants. After much debate in the Indian Constituent Assembly, the controversial term, chartered was accepted. When the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 came into force on 1 July 1949, the term Chartered Accountant superseded the title of Registered Accountant. This day is celebrated as Chartered Accountants day every year.  Membership  Members of the Institute are known as Chartered Accountants. Becoming a member requires passing the prescribed examinations, three years of practical training (known as articleship) and meeting other requirements under the Act and Regulations. A member of ICAI can use the title CA before his/her name. A member of ICAI may either be an Associate Chartered Accountant (A.C.A.) or a Fellow Chartered Accountant (F.C.A.) based on his experience. Further based on holding Certificate of Practice, they may also be classified as practicing and non-practicing Chartered Accountants. As of 1 April 2019, the Institute has 2,91,698 members out of which 1,92,857 are associates and 98,841 are fellows. The B.N. Chaturvedi family is credited to be the only family in India to be Chartered Accountants in five generations. CA G.P. Kapadia was the first person to get a membership certificate by the ICAI.  Associates and fellows  Any person who is granted membership of the Institute becomes an Associate Chartered Accountant and is entitled to use the letters \\"A.C.A\\" after his name. Generally, associates are members of the Institute with less than five years of membership after which they become entitled to apply for being a fellow member. Some associate members, particularly those not in practice, often voluntarily chose not to apply to be a fellow due to a variety of reasons. An associate member who has been in continuous practice in India or has worked for a commercial or government organization for at least five years and meets other conditions as prescribed can apply to the Institute to get designated as a \\"Fellow\\". A fellow Chartered Accountant is entitled to use the letters \\"F.C.A\\" before his name. Responsibilities and voting rights of both types of members remain the same but only fellows can be elected to the council and regional councils of ICAI. Fellows are perceived as enjoying a higher status due to their long professional experience.  Practicing Chartered Accountants  Any member wanting to engage in public practice has to first apply for and obtain a Certificate of Practice from the Council of ICAI.Section 6 of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 provides, \\"No member of the Institute shall be entitled to practice (whether in India or elsewhere) unless he has obtained from the Council a certificate of practice\\". Only members holding a Certificate of Practice may act as auditors or certify documents required by various tax and financial regulatory authorities in India. Once a member obtains a Certificate of Practice, his responsibility to the society increases manifold. The ethical principles applicable to a practicing CA provided in the first and second schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 are more rigorous than the ones applicable to non-practicing CAs or both. In India, an individual Chartered Accountant, a firm or a Limited Liability Partnership of Chartered Accountants can practice the profession of Chartered Accountancy.  Role of Chartered Accountants  Chartered Accountants enjoy a statutory monopoly in audit of financial statements under the Companies Act, 2013, Income Tax Act, 1961 and various other statutes in India.Section 226(1) of Companies Act, 2013 requires that an auditor be a Chartered Accountant. Financial statements audited by a chartered accountantchartered accountant are presumed to have been prepared according to GAAP in India (otherwise the audit report should be modified).ICAI has also issued Indian Accounting Standards which deal with current accounting situation.  Council of the institute  Map of India showing the jurisdictions of the five Regional Councils of ICAI The management of the affairs of the institute is undertaken by a council constituted under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. The council consists of 32 elected fellow members and up to 8 members nominated by the Government of India. The elected members of the council are elected under the single transferable vote system by the members of the institute. The council is re-elected every three years. The council elects two of its members to be president and vice-president who hold office for one year. The president is the chief executive authority of the council.Section 12(2) of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 provides, \\"The President shall be the chief executive Authority of the Council\\".  Regions and branches  ICAI has five regions : Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. As on 15th July 2019, ICAI have 164 Branches so far. Out of total 164 Branches, 99 branches are having their own premises which include 14 Branches (presently functioning from Rented Premises) who have procured land on which construction is either commenced or construction is under-way. 16 Branches (functioning from own premises) have procured land where either construction has started or construction is under-way. 51 Branches do not own either land or building.  Presidents  ICAI's first president was CA G.P. Kapadia (1949 to 1952). CA Atul K Gupta is the current president.CA Nihar Niranjan Jambusaria is the current vice president of the council, and will be the next president of the council after the vacation of office by the current president Atul K Gupta.  Code of ethics  The institute has a detailed code of ethics and actions in contravention of such code results in disciplinary action against the erring members. The institute publishes a members' handbook containing the Chartered Accountants Act 1949, Chartered Accountants Regulation 1988, Professional Opportunities for Members ‚Äì an Appraisal, Code of Ethics and Manual for members. These together form the basis of regulation of the profession. The Council also has a Peer Review Board that ensures that in carrying out their professional attestation services assignments, the members of the institute (a) comply with the Technical Standards laid down by the institute and (b) have in place proper systems (including documentation systems) for maintaining the quality of the attestation services work they perform.  Disciplinary process  The Disciplinary Directorate, the Board of Discipline, and the Disciplinary Committee form the foundation of the disciplinary process of the institute. These entities are quasi-judicial and have substantial powers like that of a Civil Court to summon and enforce attendance or require discovery and production of documents on affidavit or otherwise.Section 21C of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 The Disciplinary Directorate is headed by an officer designated as Director (Discipline). On receipt of any information or complaint that a member has allegedly engaged in any misconduct, the Director (Discipline) shall arrive at a prima facie opinion whether or not there is any misconduct. If the Director (Discipline) is of the opinion that the misconduct is covered by the items listed in the first schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, he shall refer the case to the Board of Discipline. If he is of the Opinion that the case is covered by the Second Schedule or both schedules of the CA Act, he will refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee. If the Board of Discipline finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members for up to three months or impose a fine up to 1,00,000/-. If the Disciplinary Committee finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members permanently or impose a fine up to 5,000/-. Any member aggrieved by any order may approach the Appellate Authority. It should be borne in mind that this disciplinary proceeding is not in lieu of or an alternative for criminal proceedings in a court. Criminal proceedings against a Chartered Accountant and disciplinary action by ICAI are two separate issues and one need not wait for another to be completed first.As decided in case of law: Talluri Srinivas Vs. The institute Of Chartered Accountants of India 2010 (174) DLT 537 by the Delhi High Court with reference to the Satyam Computer Services Limited scam  Actions  One of the public actions of The ICAI Disciplinary Committee in the 2009‚Äì2010 time period was proceedings for professional misconduct against two auditors from the firm Price Waterhouse partners for wrongly auditing and inflating the financial statements of Satyam Computer Services Limited. The Supreme Court of India (November 2010) rejected a plea by the two charged auditors to stay the proceedings by the ICAI Disciplinary committee. The court's order came in response to the pleas of the charged auditors seeking a stay on the disciplinary proceedings against them on the ground that it violated their fundamental right against self- incrimination under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India. Other publicized actions included, the SEBI referred case of a brokerage firm, Karvy, in which the internal auditors, Haribhakti & Co (an associate of BDO Global). were held guilty of negligence for failing to detect thousands of demat accounts being opened with the same address. The Committee has also taken action against members for alleged irregularities in the books of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra and the role played by their auditors. The names of the members found guilty of misconduct are published on ICAI's website. The ICAI website lists 35 as the number of cases in which inquiry was completed by the Disciplinary Committee in the past one year since February 2010. The list of members held guilty of professional or other misconduct is published periodically.  Request for more power  Many of the recent financial frauds and scams related to organizations that had multinational accounting firms as their auditors. These multinational firms cannot legally practice in India but they are practicing in India by surrogate means, operating through tie-ups with local firms, though the partners involved are from India, since only a member of the institute can be an auditor of an Indian entity. The example for this is an elaborate list, Price Waterhouse in case of Global Trust Bank Scam, again Price Waterhouse in Satyam Computer Services Limited scam, Ernst and Young in the Maytas case. ICAI lacks jurisdictional powers to punish these or for that matter any firm, as under its current regulations it only has the power to proceed against individual members. The institute has asked the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India to grant additional powers so that it may proceed against firms whose partners or employees are frequent offenders. ICAI also has sent a proposal to the Government of India to amend the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 in order to enable to it to impose a fine of 1,00,00,000/- on audit firms if they are found guilty of colluding with companies to commit a fraud.  Qualification  A person is eligible to apply for membership either by passing all three levels of examinations ( Foundation, Intermediate and Final ) prescribed by ICAI and completing three years of practical training or by availing themselves of exemptions under mutual recognition agreement (MRAs).  Examination  The ICAI has revised its Scheme of Education and Training in 2017. The scheme became applicable on 1st July 2017. The first examination under the New Scheme was held in May 2018. The ICAI allows Commerce graduates/post-graduates (with minimum 55% marks) or other graduates/post- graduates (with minimum 60% marks) and Intermediate level passed students of Institute of Company Secretaries of India and Institute of Cost Accountants of India to enter directly to its Intermediate Course. Students undergoing Practical training shall be required to do AICITSS during the last 2 years of Practical training but to complete the same to become eligible to appear in the Final Examination. ICAI also introduced the Accounting Technician Course.[42] Any person who passed Group-I of IPCC and completed one year of practical training under a member could apply for an Accounting Technician Certification. After obtaining the certificate the person could designate himself as an Accounting Technician. This Certification was introduced to help a large number of students who were unable to complete the CA Final Examinations and obtain membership. ICAI has entered into an agreement with Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), to help CA students acquire a Bachelor's degree and Master's Degree by writing 6 papers / 5 papers respectively. For example, a bachelor's degree in Commerce can be obtained from IGNOU with a major in Accounting and Finance provided the student is able to provide the grades received in CPT and IPCC and pass the term end examination conducted by IGNOU. Similarly based on the grades in Final would be taken for Masters. This initiative has helped a lot of students attain both the degrees without any duplication of subjects and credits.Prospectus. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI offers study materials and describes the syllabus in great detail via a prospectus. While ICAI claims that this study material on the website is sufficient for motivated students to study, most students opt to attend oral coaching classes or learn from e-learning portals.  Controversy  On 23 September 2019 chartered accountancy students organized massive protests named \\"Dear ICAI please change\\" at over 200 institute branches across India and on social media demanding among other things right to re-checking of CA exam answer sheets. At present as per CA regulations, re-checking of answer sheets are not allowed. Students were demanding this right since 2018. A protest was also called in December, 2018 but after assurance by the council and formation of a committee to review the examination process the protest was called off. The committee got defunct soon after students called off their protest, without holding any meeting or submitting any report. Students were able to gather support of many public figures which includes Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Past President of ICAI CA. N. D. Gupta, renowned expert of financial market CA. Motilal Oswal, CA. Mohandas Pai, CA. Raghav Chadha, etc on social media. Many students uploaded answer sheets on social media alleging gross errors in valuation. Even Multiple choice questions were wrongly checked. The institute said, it is in the process of implementing controls like digital evaluation, real-time elevator evaluation among other measures to improve the existing system. With each passing day, crowd was getting bigger as supporter from different parts of India started reaching Delhi to join the protest. Seeing no respite, the institute has communicated its intention to set up an independent committee to study the demands of the students. After formation of Independent committee, students called off their protest. President of the Institute Prafulla Chhajed was of opinion that changes, if implemented, could face many legal hurdles.  Membership through MRA  The second method of obtaining membership is through mutual recognition agreements or MRAs. ICAI has entered into MRAs with several institutes globally, of equivalent standing, to enable members of those institutes to acquire membership of ICAI and to enable the members of ICAI to gain membership of its counterpart in other countries. This is done by granting some exemptions in the regular scheme of examination and training. ICAI currently has MRAs with following professional accounting bodies: * Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (since 20 November 2008)ICAI Signed MoU with ICAEW, ICAI website * CPA Australia(originally signed in February 2009 and re-signed in September 2014) * CPA Canada * CPA Ireland * The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants * CPA Australia * Chartered Accountants New Zealand * National Board of Accountants & Auditors, Tanzania  * Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya ICAI is also in the process of negotiating MRAs with Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Certified General Accountants Association of Canada.  Technical co-operation agreements  The ICAI has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with professional accounting bodies of various countries. These MOUs aim at establishing mutual co-operation between the two institutions for the advancement of accounting knowledge, professional and intellectual development, advancing the interests of their respective members and positively contributing to the development of the accounting profession. Currently ICAI has MOUs with following professional accounting bodies: * Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan, Bhutan (signed on 22 November 2013) * The Vietnam Association of Certified Public Accountants, Vietnam * Higher Colleges of Technology, UAE (signed on 4 January 2011) * College of Banking and Financial Studies, Oman * Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal The MoUs with CPA Afghanistan and Saudi Organization for Certified Public Accountants (SOCPA) are in pipeline.  Placement  The Institute maintains a placement portal on its web site for qualified members and partially qualified students.Placement portal This is supplemented with campus placement events and advertising through its professional journals and website. In early 2010, the ICAI placed three of its freshly qualified Associates, at a record annual salary of US$ 260,000 each, at Singapore-based agriculture supply chain major Olam International.  Technical standards  ICAI formulates and issues technical standards to be followed by Chartered Accountants and others. Non-compliance of these standards by the members will lead to disciplinary action against them. The technical standards issued by ICAI include Accounting Standards, Engagement, and Quality Control Standards, Standards on Internal Audit, Corporate Affairs Standard, Accounting Standards for Local Bodies, etc.  Accounting Standards  , the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has issued 32 Accounting Standards. These are numbered AS-1 to AS-7 and AS-9 to AS-32 (AS-8 & AS-6 is no longer in force since it was merged with AS-26 and AS-10). Compliance with accounting standards issued by ICAI has become a statutory requirement with the notification of Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 by the Government of India.Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006. Mca.gov.in (27 March 2008). Retrieved on 2018-12-25. Before the constitution of the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAS), the institute was the sole accounting standard setter in India. However NACAS is not an independent body. It can only consider accounting standards recommended by ICAI and advise the Government of India to notify them under the Companies Act, 2013. Further, the Accounting Standards so notified are applicable only to companies registered under the companies act, 2013. For all other entities, the accounting standards issued the ICAI continue to apply. = Convergence with IFRS = The inception of the idea of convergence of Indian GAAP with IFRS was made by the Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh by committing in G20 to align Indian accounting standards with IFRS. As per the original roadmap for implementation of IFRS-converged Ind AS issued by the Government of India, initially, Ind AS were expected to be implemented from the year 2011. However, keeping in view the fact that certain issues including tax issues were still to be addressed, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs decided to postpone the date of implementation of Ind AS. For a smooth transition to IFRS, ICAI has taken up the matter of convergence with the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards and various regulators such as the RBI, SEBI and IRDA, CBDT. IASB, the issuer of IFRS, is also supporting the ICAI in its endeavors towards convergence. ICAI has revised/formulated Ind AS on the basis of the amendments and new IFRS issued by the IASB subsequent to February 2011. IFRS- converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) has been implemented in India in a phased manner from 1 April 2015 being the voluntary date of adoption of Ind AS. The mandatory application of Ind AS has been restricted to listed and unlisted companies with a net worth of Rs. 500 crore and above from the accounting year beginning on or after 1 April 2016. With effect on 1 April 2017, all listed companies and unlisted companies having a net worth of Rs. 250 crore and above would be required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the applicable Ind AS. Banks and NBFCs are also required to implement Ind AS on 1 April 2018 onwards based on the criteria of net worth. In order to ensure that these standards are implemented in the same spirit in which these have been formulated, ICAI has been providing guidance to members through its various initiatives such as the issuance of Educational Materials on Ind AS containing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). For addressing transition and implementation related queries clarifications on a timely basis are also being issued by the ICAI. Queries raised are also addressed through Support-desk for implementation of Ind AS. Apart from this, Certificate Course on Ind AS, In-house training programmes on Ind AS for corporate and regulatory bodies are also being organized to educate and train the members on these standards.  Engagement and Quality Control Standards  Engagement and Quality Control Standards comprises the following Standards: 1 Standards on Auditing (SAs), to be applied in the audit of historical financial information. 2 Standards on Review Engagements (SREs), to be applied in the review of historical financial information. 3 Standards on Assurance Engagements (SAEs), to be applied in assurance engagements, other than audits and reviews of historical financial information. 4 Standards on Related Services (SRSs), to be applied to engagements involving the application of agreed-upon procedures to information, compilation engagements, and other related services engagements, as may be specified by the ICAI. The aforesaid Standards are collectively known as Engagement Standards. 5\\\\. Standards on Quality Control (SQCs) ‚Äì These Standards are to be applied for all services covered by the Engagement Standards as described above. ICAI has issued 46 Engagement and Quality Control Standards (formerly known as Auditing and Assurance Standards) covering various topics relating to auditing and other engagements. These standards have been harmonized with the International Standards issued by the IAASB of the IFAC except for two standards i.e. ISA 600 and ISAE 3000.  Forensic Accounting and Investigation Standards (FAIS)  The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has constituted a committee to deliberate on FAIS, which are expected to be framed by the end of this year 2020. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India will be the first body in the accounting world to develop a full set of FAIS standards for forensic professionals and stakeholders, The proposed standards would help Forensic Accounting and Investigation professionals to conduct their examinations in a highly professional manner and collect evidences which may be subject to high level of scrutiny in a court of law.

The castle overlooks the sea at the head of Ballygally Bay. Now run as a hotel, it is the only 17th century building still used as a residence in Northern Ireland, and is reputed to be one of the most haunted places in all of Ulster. Features 250px The castle is described as \\"a living postcard‚Äîa charming, almost teal-colored Scottish baronial castle overlooking the sea in Northern Ireland.\\" It was strongly Scots influenced in style featuring corbelled cylindrical tourelles with conical roofs on top. It was built with high walls, steep roof, dormer windows and corner turrets. The walls are thick with loopholes for muskets. An open stream ran through the outer hall to provide water in case of siege. History The castle was built in 1625 by James Shaw, of Scotland, who had come to the area and rented the land from the Earl of Antrim for ¬£24 a year. Over the main entrance door to the castle, leading to the tower, is the Middle Scots inscription \\"Godis Providens is my Inheritans\\". The castle did come under attack, from the Irish garrison at Glenarm, several times during the rebellion of 1641 but each assault was unsuccessful. The castle was owned by the Shaw family until it passed into the hands of William Shaw in 1799. He sold the estate for ¬£15,400. In the 1950s the castle was bought by the carpet tycoon Cyril Lord and was extended and renovated. It is now owned and run by the Hastings Hotels Group. The bawn and walled garden are registered as Scheduled Historic Monuments at grid ref: D3725 0781.  Reputed hauntings  The castle is reputed to host a number of ghosts, the most active of which is the former resident, Lady Isobel Shaw, who has a habit of knocking the doors of the rooms and disappearing. She had reportedly fallen to her death from the window after her husband Lord James Shaw had locked her in her room and starved her. Madame Nixon is another ghost who lived in the hotel in the 19th century and can be heard walking around the hotel in her silk dress. The small room in the corner turret of the castle is known as \\"The Ghost Room\\" and is not used as a room in the hotel. In 2003, manager Olga Henry had said after spending some time in the hotel, \\"I'm sort of very skeptical about the whole supernatural thing and ghosts. But the more I stay here and work here, the more I think there's definitely something in this hotel.\\" According to Henry, one guest was staying in one of the rooms in the tower beneath the \\"Ghost Room\\" and in the middle of the night he awoke and thought he was at home and one of his children had laid a hand on his back. He woke up and said that he could a hear a child running about the room and laughing but nothing could be seen so he ran into the lobby in his boxers shorts in fright. In December 2003, Henry had set up the \\"Dungeon Room\\" in the tower as they were expecting guests and ordered the table neatly in preparation for meal. She locked the room and later checked up on it and the table was now a mess with unfolded napkins and glasses with an unusual scum around them were now arranged in a circle on the table. Mediums spending the night at the castle have often reported that they've detected more ghosts than there were guests actually staying at the hotel.

It was written by Willy Russell and first aired on 28 December 1977, at 9: 00 p.m. on BBC2.Date Confusion: The Willy Russell website gives the date of the original film as 1976, stating that it was repeated six weeks later as part of the Play For Today series. The repeat date is documented as 7 February 1978 and the Play of the Week series in which the film was originally shown did not begin until September 1977, so a first broadcast in December 1977 seems more likely. It was later converted into a full length stage musical. Origins and development The television play \\"Our Day Out\\" was commissioned by the BBC and first broadcast in December 1977 as part of the BBC's Play of the Week series. Due to popular demand, it was shown again in February 1978 as part of the BBC's Play for Today series and was also re-broadcast in 1979 and again in August 1990 and on BBC4 in 2008. Willy Russell had taught at Tiber street school, one of the locations used in the film and called on his experiences of school trips ‚Äî as a teacher and as a child ‚Äî when writing the screenplay, which he finished in five days. The film was shot on 16mm film by a first-time director in three weeks and features a largely untrained cast. The original television version was developed into a musical for the stage with songs by Willy Russell, Chris Mellor and Bob Eaton. This production, directed by Bob Eaton, was first performed at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool in 1983. Plot The film is about a school trip to Conwy Castle in North Wales. Mrs. Kay teaches a remedial class for illiterate children, called the \\"Progress Class.\\" The whole class‚Äîalong with Digga and Reilly, the slightly older class bullies who used to be in the Progress Class‚Äîare taken on a coach trip. In the original version, the headmaster, Mr Briggs makes the decision to go on the trip as an extra member of staff, emphasising his mistrust of the liberal values of Mrs Kay. In the shorter stage version, the Headteacher commissions Mr. Briggs, the authoritarian Deputy Headmaster, to supervise the trip. On the way to the Castle, the coach stops at a roadside cafe with a snack shop, where the students take advantage of the storekeepers' confusion to shoplift sweets and snacks, unbeknownst to the teachers supervising. It makes a second stop at Colwyn Bay Mountain Zoo, where the students enjoy the animals so much that they try to steal most of them. The zoo attendant discovers this just in time before the coach pulls out and makes them return the animals. When the coach finally reaches the Castle, the students race around exploring the grounds, cliffs and beach. Soon it's time to leave but one of the best-behaved students, Carol, is missing. A search ensues and Mr. Briggs finally finds Carol, who is depressed because she doesn't want to return to the bad conditions at her home. She wants a better life and wishes she lived in a nicer area, like that which surrounds the Castle. She becomes so upset that she threatens to jump off the cliff. Mr. Briggs, who up till this point has acted like a harsh disciplinarian, policing the students' bad behaviour and expressing doubts that they should even be allowed to have an outing, shows a more understanding side as he convinces Carol not to jump and to rejoin the rest of the group. At the suggestion of Mr Briggs, the coach makes one more stop at a fairground where the students have some more fun before returning home. Mr. Briggs joins the students on some of the rides, wears a funny hat and joins in with the sing-song on the journey home, all of which is photographed by Mrs. Kay. She comments on how she never knew he had a softer side and that he certainly wouldn't be able to get away from the fact now she had evidence. Not wanting to undermine his strict image, Mr. Briggs offers to develop the photos, as he is a keen amateur photographer. Once he returns to his car, he unravels the undeveloped film, exposing and ruining the photos of him clowning around with the students. Along the way, two young teachers, Susan and Colin, who are helping Mrs. Kay supervise, must also deal with the fact that Reilly has a crush on Susan, while two older girl-students have a crush on Colin. Susan and Colin solve their problem by subtly suggesting that Digga and Reilly turn their attentions to the two girls. Differences from play The most noticeable difference from the play was the omission of the characters John and Mac, who, in the play, are the shop owners in Wales who get robbed by the kids. In the movie they are replaced by two women. In the play, Mr Briggs doesn't have a soft side while in the movie he does. In the later musical, this soft side is maintained as he enjoys a day out at the fair with the students but sadly destroys the photographic evidence at the end by exposing the film to the light.

The property is in the ownership of the National Trust. It is visited by around 25,000 people per year. The house started as a small farmhouse in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was the property of the Napper family for centuries. It was given to the National Trust in 1954. The Arts and Crafts style garden is modeled on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse. House The original farmhouse which forms the basis of the current Tintinhull House was built of Hamstone 1630. It was reshaped and enlarged around 1722 when the west fa√ßade was added. The house was the property of the Napper family, who acquired the manor after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and also owned Tintinhull Court, and was passed down in the family until they sold it sometime after 1814. The Nappers let it to the Pitt family until the death of John Napper in 1791. It passed through several hands until 1835, when it was bought by Jeremiah Penny. In 1898 the then owner, Arthur Cobbett, added a single-storey extension to the east front before selling it to his tenant the botanist, Dr. S.J.M. Price. In 1933 it was bought by Phyllis Reiss and her husband, Capt. F.E. Reiss. The house includes several paintings from the National Trust's collection, including a painting of the front of the house by John S. Goodall. The house is a Grade I listed building and can be booked for holiday lets from the National trust. Garden Part of the garden The garden is laid out into areas separated by walls and hedges. The garden layout was developed in the early 20th century, by Dr. Price, including laying down triangular and diamond shaped flagstone paths. The ornamental domes of box were planted in the 1920s. The early landscaping was expanded and planted starting in 1933 by Phyllis Reiss in an Arts and Crafts \\"Hidcote\\" style. The garden is separated into \\"rooms\\" by Yew hedges and walls. The different areas include Eagle Court (the former courtyard), Middle Garden, Fountain Garden and Pool Garden. The pool garden is the site of a former tennis court. In 1954 Reiss gave the house and garden to the National Trust, but continued to live in the house and care for the garden until her death in 1961. From then on, the Trust let the house to a variety of tenants, including the garden designer and writer Penelope Hobhouse and her husband Prof John Malins from 1980 to 1993. The gardens are included in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and include small pools and an azelea garden.

Although the name suggests that it terminated in Tapanui, its furthest terminus was actually in Edievale. Construction of the line began in 1878 with the first section opened in 1880, and it operated until 1978, when it was destroyed by flooding from the Pomahaka River. Construction In the second half of the 19th century, farmers in the region desired a railway connection to enhance the value of their land and provide easier access to markets, and received support from interests in Dunedin, who, in the days before the abolition of provinces in 1876, feared a loss of trade to Invercargill. In 1877, district engineer W. N. Blair proposed a route to Central Otago via Tapanui, but this proved unpopular outside of Tapanui and its immediate surrounds. However, approval was granted for the construction of a branch line in the area and construction began in 1878, leaving the Main South Line at Waipahi, located 50 kilometres west of Balclutha. The first locomotive for the line was delivered on 8 July 1880 and the Public Works Department began operating trains to Tapanui three days later. The official opening ceremony in Tapanui was held on 24 November 1880, though the actual line, at 25.13 kilometres in length, was opened to a settlement just beyond Tapanui named Kelso on 1 December 1880. In this year, it was proposed to build a line westwards to the Waikaia area from Kelso, but the proposals came to nothing and the Waikaia Branch was built from Riversdale on the Waimea Plains Railway instead. An extension of 7.11 kilometres from Kelso to Heriot was opened on 1 April 1884. The local newspaper, the Tapanui Courier, believed that only a short tunnel and some clay cuttings in the Dunrobin Hills stood in the way of extending the railway line to the Clutha River and then on to Roxburgh. In 1900, the government chose to extend the railway from Heriot to Edievale pending a final decision on the route to Roxburgh, and this ten kilometre extension was opened on 18 February 1905, bringing the branch's total length to 42.3 kilometres. Edievale proved to be the final terminus when the line from Milton via Lawrence was extended to Roxburgh instead. Stations The following stations were located on the Tapanui Branch (in brackets is the distance in kilometres from the junction in Waipahi): *Conical Hill (7 km) *Pomahaka (13 km) *Glenkenich (17 km) *Tapanui (21 km) *Kelso (25 km) *Heriot (32 km) *Edievale (42 km) Operation In the early days, a mixed train operated from Edievale daily. These mixed trains connected with mainline expresses and local Invercargill-Clinton services at the junction in Waipahi. The line was indispensable before the expansion of decent road networks, but as improvements came in road transport in the 20th century, traffic began to decline. The Great Depression did not help the line's fortunes, with revenue dropping as fast as expenditure was rising in 1930. To save money, passenger services on the line were cancelled and replaced by buses, thus making the mixed trains goods-only, and the Edievale locomotive depot closed on 1 January 1934. The freight service was run when required, operating regularly on weekdays for many years, but it continued to lose money. The under-utilised section from Heriot to Edievale was closed on 1 January 1968 as it only saw 4,000 tonnes of traffic a year, but enough traffic existed to justify the existence of the rest of the line for a few more years, with tonnages varying between 30,000 and 60,000 tonnes in the 1970s. The freight carried at this time was mainly from the State Forest's Conical Hill Sawmill located nine kilometres up the line, and phosphate from the Southland Co-op Phosphate Co.'s works near Bluff to West Otago Transport in Heriot. In March 1969, trains were re-organised to operate from Gore, and the aged A class steam locomotives that typically ran trains on the branch were replaced by DJ class diesel-electric engines (steam locomotive power fully disappeared from New Zealand's railway system by the end of 1971). Catastrophe hit the line in mid-October 1978. Extremely severe flooding along the Pomahaka River demolished bridges and washed out the trackage in many places, and costly repairs would not have been economic. Formal closure was confirmed two months later in December. Before its closure in 1962, the Waikaka Branch ran in a valley parallel to that occupied by the Tapanui Branch, and trivia associated with operation of the lines is that locomotive crews in one valley claimed they were sometimes able to see smoke from a steam engine operating in the other valley. The branch today The railway goods shed at Kelso sits behind a monument to the Kelso flood. Relics of this branch survive today, though as time progresses, remnants of old railways deteriorate and in some cases disappear entirely, so what was previously evident may no longer exist. Bridges sans rails are believed to still exist in the early stages of the line, notably including a truss bridge across the Pomahaka River. The Tapanui railway station and yard were never in Tapanui township; they were situated approximately 2 km away in a field adjacent to the Station Rd level crossing. The Tapanui railway yard precinct remains obvious, as are the stands of macrocarpa trees that once defined its limits, although the station building is gone. The hump in Station Rd that was the level crossing and an old commercial building beside the level crossing also remain. Flooding almost entirely destroyed Kelso and it is now abandoned, though the railway's second goods shed still exists. On lower ground is the ruins of the town's former service station, with sombre viewing created by flood levels marked on the doors. There was \\"still plenty to see\\" in the 1990s, and \\"the flood markings alone are sobering\\". The large Heriot goods shed is understood to have been removed in the late 1990s.

It is a member municipality of the Central Kootenay Regional District. As of 2016, it had a population of 968. Kaslo was designated as a sawmill site in 1889, and expanded due to the silver boom of the late19th century. It retains much of the historic atmosphere from its earlier mining days. The town today relies mainly on the industries of forestry and tourism. History Kaslo, 1900 Kaslo was incorporated as a city on August 14, 1893, making it the oldest incorporated community in the Kootenays. It was an important centre for shipping and silver ore mining. After the silver rush Kaslo's fortunes faded but it was re-incorporated as a village on January 1, 1959. National Historic Sites Kaslo is home to two National Historic Sites of Canada: * The SS Moyie, which worked on Kootenay Lake from 1889 until 1957, found a permanent home on Front Street in Kaslo. Beautifully restored by the Kootenay Lake Historical Society, it is the oldest intact sternwheeler in the world and draws thousands of visitors every year. * Village Hall, built in 1898, is one of only two intact wooden municipal buildings that are still in use in Canada. Attractions * The Kaslo Jazz Etc. Festival, held every August long weekend in Kaslo Bay Park, is a music event which attracts international performers and draws large audiences. * The Kaslo Golf Club is a 9-hole course which plays as a 2,824-yard, men's par 35, women's par 37 course. Kaslo's Golf Club dates back to 1923, when locals invested and donated their efforts and created a 4-hole course. This makes it one of the oldest in British Columbia. A new timberframe clubhouse was built in 2007. Japanese internment In 1941, Kaslo was selected as one of many sites throughout BC for the internment of Japanese Canadians. Television Kaslo has been featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns (season 2, episode 2). Kaslo was also featured in the 1995 film Magic in the Water, starring Mark Harmon and Joshua Jackson,http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/magic-in-water/details as well as in Tougher Than It Looks, starring Glenn Erikson in 2017.

Influence  Lederer has often worked in the background, privately providing material for other performers and writers.

Randomizing functions are related to random number generators and hash functions, but have somewhat different requirements and uses, and often need specific algorithms. Uses Randomizing functions are used to turn algorithms that have good expected performance for random inputs, into algorithms that have the same performance for any input. For example, consider a sorting algorithm like quicksort, which has small expected running time when the input items are presented in random order, but is very slow when they are presented in certain unfavorable orders. A randomizing function from the integers 1 to n to the integers 1 to n can be used to rearrange the n input items in \\"random\\" order, before calling that algorithm. This modified (randomized) algorithm will have small expected running time, whatever the input order. Randomness In theory, randomization functions are assumed to be truly random, and yield an unpredictably different function every time the algorithm is executed. The randomization technique would not work if, at every execution of the algorithm, the randomization function always performed the same mapping, or a mapping entirely determined by some externally observable parameter (such as the program's startup time). With such a \\"pseudo-randomization\\" function, one could in principle construct a sequence of calls such that the function would always yield a \\"bad\\" case for the underlying deterministic algorithm. For that sequence of calls, the average cost would be closer to the worst-case cost, rather than the average cost for random inputs. In practice, however, the main concern is that some \\"bad\\" cases for the deterministic algorithm may occur in practice much more often than it would be predicted by chance. For example, in a naive variant of quicksort, the worst case is when the input items are already sorted ‚Äî which is a very common occurrence in many applications. For such algorithms, even a fixed pseudo-random permutation may be good enough. Even though the resulting \\"pseudo-randomized\\" algorithm would still have as many \\"bad\\" cases as the original, they will be certain peculiar orders that would be quite unlikely to arise in real applications. So, in practice one often uses randomization functions that are derived from pseudo-random number generators, preferably seeded with external \\"random\\" data such as the program's startup time. Uniformity The uniformity requirements for a randomizing function are usually much weaker than those of hash functions and pseudo-random generators. The minimum requirement is that it maps any input of the deterministic algorithm into a \\"good\\" input with a sufficiently high probability. (However, analysis is usually simpler if the randomizing function implements each possible mapping with uniform probability.)

Until 2018, it was an agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas. With the merger of FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it became a district. Before to 1973, it was part of FR Kohat. History The Orakzai tribes take their name, which literally means \\"the lost son\\" (Wrak Dzoy), from a romantic legend about their ancestor, Sikandar Shah, who was a prince from Iran, was exiled or lost, and after many adventures married and ruled in Tirah (you can say Orakzai is a Persian royal family). The tribal area now forming Orakzai Agency was previously included in Frontier Region Kohat district and remained as such until 30 November 1973. The Biland Khel or Boland Khel, a small pocket of about 6.5 square kilometres, is part of this agency and is two kilometres off Thall, bordering North Waziristan and Kurram agencies. Responding to a long-standing demand of the Orakzais, the then President of Pakistan announced the creation of Orakzai Agency on 3 November 1973 and was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1973. Before it was upgraded to agency status, this area was administered as a Frontier Region of the Kohat district by the Deputy Commissioner of Kohat. The Orakzai Agency consists of two sub- divisions: Upper sub-division and Lower sub-division. The Upper sub-division comprises two Tehsils, Upper Tehsil and Ismailzai Tehsil, and the Lower sub- division also has two Tehsils, Lower Tehsil and Central Tehsil. The land of the Orakzai tribes is between 33¬∞ -33' to 33¬∞ -54' north latitudes and 70¬∞ -36' to 71¬∞ -22' east longitudes. It is bounded in the north by Khyber Agency, in the east by FR Kohat, in the south by Kohat and Hangu districts, and in the west by Kurram Agency. The total area of the agency is 1,538 square kilometres. Certain Orakzai tribes like the Masozai and half the Lashkarzai find themselves in Kurram Agency for historical and administrative reasons. An ethnic Pashtun Bangash tribe, the Buland Khel or Beland Khil, is attached to the Orakzai agency also for administrative and historical reasons, although they live some distance from the agency between Thall and Bannu, North Waziristan. Then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto announced the creation of the agency at a grand tribal jirga at Samana (Orakzai), and it began functioning on 1 December 1973. Before this, the Orakzai tribes were part of the Kohat and Hangu Frontier region. The headquarters of the agency are at Hangu District, but tehsil-level headquarters are in Kalaya and Ghiljo Bazar. Geography The valley is flanked by mountain ranges 6,000 to high. Among the seven tribal agencies, Orakzai Agency is the second smallest in area after Bajaur Agency. It is bounded by Kurram Agency in the west, Khyber in the north, Kohat District on the south and Peshawar in the east. The whole of the territory of Orakzai agency is a mountainous tract dissected by numerous dry water courses, especially in the southwest part of the agency. The two major streams are the Mastura River and Khanki Toi River, both of which originate from the hills to west and run eastwards. Orakzai Agency is a hilly region with a fertile valley. The elevation of the hills varies from over in the west and to less than in east. Generally the elevation of the plain varies from 5,200 to above sea level. Important peaks are Sangla (6325 ft) and Chara Kandaco (5643 ft). The height of Kalaya and Sangla is nearly equal. Orakzai Agency is characterized by intensely cold winters and mild summers. December, January and February are the coldest months and snow falls in these months. Summers are mild and the maximum temperature does not go above 30 degrees Celsius. Surrounding mountains are covered by dense thick forests, which produce a cooling effect in summer. Due to the geographical position of Orakzai and its thick forest cover, it rains throughout the year. In winter, the precipitation is snowfall over the surrounding mountains and the valley. There is no rain gauge, but rainfall is estimated to be around per year. Tourism Nanawar cave is located in Mani Khel Dara Orakzai Tribal District. It is approx 200 Meters long cave with 2 entrances, and is home to thousands of bats & spiders. The cave traces its history back thousands of years with varying opinions and myths:- ‚Ä¢Thousands of years back, lava erupted here and it seems like a bubble trapped in lava which made this cave. ‚Ä¢Second opinion is that it is a lime stone cave which ended up on water channel beneath the surface in summer water. ‚Ä¢Other opinion of the historian is that the graves on the ground in the general area are not Muslim graves, and it is believed that this cave was used for meditation in Kanishka times 127 CE. ‚Ä¢The myth that its farther end is unexplored, seems false. It has a farther end with a graduated narrowing/ suffocating effects due to low oxygen. History of Nanawar Cave compiled by Zakir Ullah Khan. Administration Orakzai District is currently subdivided into four tehsils. * Central Orakzai Tehsil * Ismail Zai Tehsil * Lower Orakzai Tehsil * Upper Orakzai Tehsil Upper Orakzai Upper Orakzai is a National Assembly constituency in the Orakzai District. Some of main areas of Upper Orakzai include: * Ghiljo Bazar * Dabori * Sama Bazar * Ghotak Eisa khel * Mishti mela Upper Orakzai is the Sub-Division of Orakzai District. The main office are in Ghiljo Bazar. Upper Orakzai includes four big sections: Ali khel Mola Khel Mamozai Ali Sherzai Eisa khel Ahkhel Shikhan Lower Orakzai Lower Orakzai agency is subdivision. Headquarter is in kalaya town named Kalaya Headquarter, a populated area of Orakzai agency. The main sections are Sapoy,Bar Muhammad khel, Mani khel , Feroz khel,utman khel,Bezoti and stori khel  Education  According to Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 published by Alif Ailaan, Orakzai District ranks 125th in Pakistan in terms of primary school infrastructure while it ranks 132nd in Pakistan for middle school infrastructure. In terms of education score, Orakzai District stands at 103rd number in National Ranking. The retention score is 30.03 whereas the gender parity score is 63.14 from the available data. Lack of government schools and provision of teachers are among the main issues reported by the residents of Orakzai District using the Taleem Do! App. Culture Culture of the area is dominantly Pashtun, with people adhering strongly to the Pashtun code of conduct also known as \\"Pakhto or Pashtunwali\\". Religion is evident in their lifestyle. People are very much social and maintain Hujra culture. Hujra is a community centre, guest house, meeting place, court and shelter. People adhere strongly to the jirga system for peace and justice where saying of the respectable elders is observed. Pakhto or Pashtunwali\\". Talibanization and Army offensive Talibanization of the area started back in 2006 when sectarian violence was at a peak. In the beginning, the Taliban were welcome because no one knew their real intentions, they intermingled with the locals in the start and when they were in sufficient numbers, they started to dictate to the people. The local people found themselves helpless and were forced to obey. There are many incidents to cite. In Kalaya village, August 2013, an incident happened. The Taliban attacked and kidnapped 230 Orakzai people. Some of the old, young men, women and children were arrested. Taliban tortured a lot and martyred 80 innocent people. After one week the remaining people founded the Pakistan army's operation against Talibans. So many people were injured. Taliban destroyed whole Kalaya village and Orakzai's business. People migrated to different places and different countries to save their lives. After a humiliating defeat in Waziristan, the Taliban fled to Orakzai Agency. Very soon the area witnessed intense violence and the Army started an unannounced offensive (Orakzai and Kurram offensive). The army cut them in the west from the Kurram Agency, in the south from Kohat and in the east from Bara and started an attack. Locals supported the army to their capacity and soon they were forced to flee and evacuate the lower subdivision. Heavy damages were inflicted upon them in the upper subdivision also and their influence in the area reduced very much. This resulted in the mass evacuation of the IDPs towards Kohat and Hangu where they were given shelter in camps. The situation has defused greatly in Lower Orakzai division, but an army operation against Taliban militants continues in Central and Upper sub-divisions. Lower Orakzai Agency. Village Kalaya. It is a small village in the centre of Lower Orakzai Agency. People say it the Heart of Orakzai. A small village ‚Ä≥Terai‚Ä≥ situated in lower orakzai agency consider to be the first and ancestor of Orakzai people.

Players were drawn from the British Embassy \\"Ice Pirates\\" team and visiting friends who had not encountered broomball before. The broomsticks at the sides of the picture are simply for decoration. Moscow broomball is a sport similar to ice-hockey played by non-Russians in Moscow. It is known by its players simply as \\"broomball\\", but is called Moscow broomball elsewhere to distinguish it from the similar sport of the same name played in Canada. Pitch and equipment Moscow Broomball is played on a tarmac tennis court that has been flooded with water and allowed to freeze. Snow that falls on the court is pushed to the sides to create a bank that helps to contain the ball. Fenced tennis courts are preferred for the same reason, but not all courts in Moscow have this amenity. Goals of wood and wire-mesh are erected at each end of the court and a centre-spot for restarting after a goal is provided. The balls used in Moscow broomball are small soft plastic children's balls (\\"Disney balls\\"), slightly larger than a tennis ball. Players wear protective gear to cushion falls onto the ice, mostly equipment intended for ice hockey. Padded shorts, elbow pads and leg guards are vital and no one is allowed on the ice without a helmet. Leg length hockey socks are worn over the knee and leg guards to provide increased friction compared to the smooth plastic of the pads - without these a player on his knees will slide a long way. The whole ensemble is then fastened into place with liberal quantities of packing tape. An ice-hockey helmet with a face cage is also worn. Second in importance only to the knee pads are the broomball shoes. These are \\"sneaker\\" type shoes with thick soles of very soft rubber, to provide as much grip on smooth ice as possible (still not much!). These are obtained from suppliers in Canada catering to the \\"mainstream\\" variety of broomball played there. Finally, each player (with the exception of the goalkeeper) carries a stick. These are made locally from the straw brushes used by Moscow street-sweepers in summer, giving the sport its name. The straw brush is tightly packed and shaped before being wrapped in many layers of silver duct tape, forming a rigid club somewhat resembling a hockey stick. Broomball sticks are much shorter, however, and are wielded one-handed. A wrist loop is attached to avoid losing the stick. Broomball sticks vary quite widely in length and shape according to the user's preference (and to some degree his ability in shaping and taping the straw). Some have large flat heads almost like miniature ice-hockey sticks, while others are curved into hook-like shapes designed control the ball much like in ice or grass hockey. Game play Moscow Broomball follows the typical layout of a ball-and-goal game like football or hockey - get the ball into the opponents' goal - and there are few rules beyond that, other than for safety. Feet may be used to stop the ball but not to propel it (this rule is interpreted liberally) and other than that only the stick may be used. In most games using a hand to fish the ball out of the pitch-side snow bank is accepted after a couple of attempts to play it with the stick. Broomball is a contact sport. The player with the ball - or attempting to get it - may be tackled or barged; a common occurrence is for the tackling player to be sliding across the ice on his knees or chest and knock his opponent's legs from under him. Because of the low grip on the ice tackles do not need to be especially vicious to send players flying, to the delight of spectators. Players may hit the ball - with their short sticks wielded in one hand - from any position including face down on the ice. In fact, sliding prone with the stick held out in front is a fairly effective defensive manoeuvre. Goalkeepers do not use a stick, and must remain on their knees at all times. They are allowed to catch the ball in their hands (although ice hockey-style oversized gloves are not used) and throw it down the pitch. The lack of grip on the ice means that stopping and changing direction are extremely difficult. It is not uncommon for a player to fail to stop a ball that is passing only a few feet away, with plenty of warning, and instead to simply fall over as he struggles to start moving in that direction. Spectators agree that broomball is an extremely humorous sport to watch. Broomball matches are played in three twenty-minute \\"periods\\"; players change ends for each half, and again during a \\"quick change\\" ten minutes into the final twenty-minute half. Most teams maintain a tradition of drinking together after the game and sometimes at the breaks during friendly matches. Broomball teams consist of five players plus the goalkeeper. Substitution is allowed, but only at a natural break in the game - usually when the goalie has control of the ball and calls a change for their side. The opposition can also change at that time, but not initiate a change. Refereeing is performed by players from the league with three referees normally required. Organization Broomball in Moscow exists largely as a result of support by the embassies of several countries, particularly Britain and Germany, although foreign nationals in Moscow for commercial or other reasons now form the majority of most teams. There is a Moscow broomball league of 14 men's teams and seven women's, with matches held every winter from December/January onwards - as long as the ice outside holds. The season closes with a formal Broomball Ball event in celebration of the game, season and players. Russians Broomball has been played by expatriates in Moscow for several decades, but Russians have never been permitted to play. This is because non-Russians are almost invariably diplomatic or commercial personnel on a three-year posting - with the continual turnover of players on every that this implies, the standard of play remains fairly accessible and hence new arrivals in Moscow can quickly become valued team members. The league organisers fear that if Russians were allowed to play they would soon be able to field a team of players with years of experience and the teamwork developed by a consistent roster that would destroy the dynamics of the league. This issue is put to the vote each year. Abroad In 1989 the game was drifted to Finland with diplomats. In Finland the game gained expeditious growth in a few years and skill level was relatively high among Finnish players. At its best there were 14 active teams in the national league in the mid-90s. During that time a Finnish team travelled yearly to Moscow to battle for the world championship of Moscow Broomball being many years the winner. Unfortunately the game died down in Finland at the end of the 1990s and the last organized league was played in 2000. A similar version has also been continuously played at Michigan Technological University since the early 1990s on both outdoor and indoor rinks, with the rules differing in that official broomball shoes are illegal, but a regulation broomball is used. It is unknown whether this represents a growth of Moscow Broomball or whether it was a parallel evolution.

When the American Civil War occurred, Allegheny served the Union cause honorably, doing her part by supporting the Union Navy ‚Äî because of her large size and operational condition ‚Äî as a receiving ship. Allegheny was somewhat different from other gunboats of the time as she was propelled by two eight-bladed horizontal wheels invented by Lieutenant William W. Hunter. Eventually this design proved impractical, and Allegheny was rebuilt as a conventional screw steamer. Launched in Pennsylvania in 1847 Allegheny was laid down at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania sometime in 1844 prior to 11 November by Joseph Tomlinson and Company; built under the supervision of Lt. Hunter, launched on 22 February 1847; and commissioned the same day, Lt. Hunter in command. The naval steamer soon departed Pittsburgh and arrived at Memphis, Tennessee on 1 March. She remained there until her 3 June fitting out, and reached New Orleans, Louisiana on the 12th for more work before sailing for the east coast on 26 August. After her arrival at Norfolk, Virginia on 16 October, her wheels were modified by the removal of every other paddle, leaving each with four. South Atlantic operations On 26 February 1848, Allegheny departed Hampton Roads and headed south for service on the Brazil station. She served along the Atlantic Coast of South America until early autumn when the sloop of war arrived with orders sending the steamer to the Mediterranean Sea. European operations Earlier that year, the fall of Louis Philippe from the throne of France had triggered a series of revolutions which shook Europe for the remainder of the decade, and Allegheny was charged with showing the American flag and affording protection to American citizens during this time of unrest. However, repeated problems with her engines caused her to head home in June 1849; and she reached the Washington Navy Yard on 1 August. Design problems delay operations Following a fortnight's repairs, the ship sailed for the Mississippi passes to join the Home Squadron. However, continued failures with her propulsion system cut short her duty in the Gulf of Mexico; and she returned to Washington where she was placed in ordinary. In 1851, Allegheny was towed to Portsmouth, Virginia, where the firm of Mehaffy and Company removed her Hunter Wheels and rebuilt her as a screw steamer. She was slated to join Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition which sailed for the Far East in November 1852, but failed to pass sea trials and ‚Äî instead of helping to open Japan to the outside world ‚Äî was placed back in ordinary at Washington, D.C. Four years later, the ship was fitted out for service as a receiving ship; and she was taken to Baltimore, Maryland where she took up this new role. She was still there and, surprisingly, again under the command of her designer, William W. Hunter ‚Äî now a commander ‚Äî when the Civil War broke out in mid-April 1861. Civil War service President Abraham Lincoln answered the Southern attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, by calling out \\". . . the militia of the several states ... to suppress ...\\" the rebellion. This move alienated many undecided citizens of the border states, prompting Virginia to secede from the Union and pushing Maryland dangerously close to withdrawing. These developments left both Washington, D.C., the Federal capital, and Norfolk, Virginia, the home of the Nation's most important naval base, isolated and all but defenseless. Union ships trapped at Norfolk Moreover, several important American warships were then in the Norfolk Navy Yard in varying stages of disrepair. Wishing to withdraw these men-of-war to safer waters, the Navy Department scoured Northern coastal cities for seamen to reactivate and to man them so that they might be moved out of immediate danger of falling into Confederate hands. Thus, on 18 April, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wired Hunter to > . . . draft fifty recruits, in charge of two officers for the receiving ship > , at Norfolk, to be sent by this evening's boat. Hunter obtained the men; but, when he attempted to send them to Norfolk the following day, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company refused to embark them. This same day, 19 April, a violently pro-Southern mob in Baltimore, Maryland, attacked the 6th Massachusetts Regiment as it was moving between railroad stations on its journey to Washington to defend the Federal capital, thereafter known as the Baltimore riot of 1861. Scuttling Union ships at Norfolk On the next day, 20 April, since they were unable to man and move most of the Federal warships in the Norfolk Navy Yard, Federal naval authorities there abandoned, scuttled, or burned all but three of these desperately needed vessels as they put the torch to the yard and fled. The former ship of the line ‚Äî with no crew to get her underway ‚Äî was among the vessels which went up in flames and was burned to her waterline. Saving Allegheny from destruction The situation in Baltimore was so unstable that, on the 22nd, Welles ordered Hunter to hire a tugboat to assist Allegheny across the harbor to Fort McHenry where she would be moored under the protection of Federal guns. Once this had been accomplished, Hunter was to send the tug to Annapolis, Maryland under \\"... a trusty officer ...\\" to carry the men originally recruited for Pennsylvania and deliver them to the commanding officer of . That venerable and revered former frigate was then serving on the Severn River as a midshipmen schoolship. According to the Naval Academy historian, \\"Old Ironsides\\", as the veteran man-of-war was affectionately called, > ... was fast aground at high water, the only channel through which she could > be taken was narrow and difficult, and she was in easy range of any battery > which might be installed on the neighboring height. To make matters worse, almost no seamen were on board to man and refloat the frigate or to defend the ship from pro-Southern attackers, if it proved impossible to work her free. However, on the following day, when Hunter attempted to hire a tug to carry out this order, he learned that the city's mayor and board of police had issued an order forbidding the use of any steamers in Baltimore harbor \\"... without the permit of the board of police.\\" Hunter then immediately applied for such a permit, but his request was denied on the grounds that > . . . nothing would more certainly increase that excitement to an > uncontrollable pitch than any movement about the harbor and in the adjacent > waters at this moment of a steamboat in the service of the United States. Sometime between 23 and 26 April, Hunter ‚Äî who had been born in Louisiana ‚Äî resigned his commission as a commander in the United States Navy and joined the Confederacy. On the latter day, Welles ordered Cdr. Daniel B. Ridgely ‚Äî who had recently succeeded Hunter in command of Allegheny > . . . to get the steamer Allegheny out of the harbor of Baltimore . . . > [and] if it can be done, [to] employ a tug to tow her to Annapolis. If you > cannot procure a tug for this purpose, you will transfer the recruits by any > practical means to Annapolis, with orders to report to Capt. George S. > Blake. Allegheny escapes, reaches Annapolis On 1 May, Ridgely attempted to have Allegheny towed to Annapolis in compliance with his orders, but rough water and a useless rudder frustrated his plans. Instead, Allegheny moored at Fort McHenry. Ridgely transferred his recruits ‚Äî by then 70 in number ‚Äî to the lighthouse schooner for passage to Annapolis. Allegheny herself finally reached Annapolis on 3 May to be in position to help to protect that city which had become the principal port of debarkation for troops sent from the North to defend Washington. There she took over the defensive role formerly assigned Constitution which had recently sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, with the Naval Academy midshipmen. Service as a receiving ship During the ensuing month, she remained at Annapolis protecting the port and acting as the receiving ship at that port. Late in the year, after conditions in Maryland had stabilized, Allegheny returned to Baltimore where she resumed her duty as receiving ship. After continuing this service through the end of the Civil War, she was moved to Norfolk, Virginia in 1868. Post-war deactivation and sale She was sold at auction there on 15 May 1869 to a Sam Ward. No record of her subsequent career has been found.

Rather, the body of the book is composed of a series of independent works from various writers who each voice their critique on the various aspects of capitalism. Topics covered range from the African slave trade to the effects of globalization. An appendix provides an incomplete list of 20th century death tolls which editor Gilles Perrault attributes to the capitalist system. The list includes certain death tolls from the two World Wars, colonial wars, anticommunist campaigns and repressions, ethnic conflicts, and victims of famines or malnutrition; bringing the incomplete total to a 100 million deaths attributed to capitalism in the 20th century.

Unlike White Dwarf, which is dedicated to the three core systems of miniature wargaming produced by Games Workshop, BGiME was exclusively about The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. According to the magazine itself, as well as it was sold in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Malta and South Africa. It also became available, through their sponsors, in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Greece and Poland. The magazine became more popular than the publishers had anticipated, and the deadline was extended several times. Having completed the series of magazines relating to the films, it then went on to explore the rest of the Lord of the Rings universe, includes miniatures that were featured in The Lord of the Rings book but not the films. The last issue was Pack 91, featuring Sharkey from the Scouring of the Shire. Content Each pack came with a free Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game miniature, including some exclusive to the publication at the time. Exclusive miniatures were much sought after in countries where the magazine was not sold, and included H√°ma, Th√©odred and a much sought after conversion kit. However, these have become available as separate components on the Games Workshop website or as miniatures released with new supplements. The magazine itself featured five consistent parts: * Guide to Middle-earth, introducing the theme of the magazine from the works of Tolkien. * Playing the Game, introducing the full rules (including some exclusive ones) in installments. * Battle Game, featuring a themed battle that can be played using armies built up from previous packs. * Painting Workshop, a step-by-step guide to converting and painting the free miniature featured in the pack * Modelling Workshop, a full guide to building terrain and scenery for playing battle games on. * The content grew knowledge and skill over time, building on previous articles. This 'Hobby Arc' was devised by Design Manager, and series creator Rowland Cox.

Compact disc manufacturing is the process by which commercial compact discs (CDs) are replicated in mass quantities using a master version created from a source recording. This may be either in audio form (CD-Audio) or data form (CD-ROM). This process is used in the mastering of read-only compact discs. DVDs and Blu-rays use similar methods (see ). A CD can be used to store audio, video, and data in various standardized formats defined in the Rainbow Books. CDs are usually manufactured in a class 100 (ISO 5) or better clean room, to avoid contamination which would result in data corruption. They can be manufactured to strict manufacturing tolerances for only a few US cents per disk. Replication differs from duplication (i.e. burning used for CD-Rs and CD-RWs) as the pits and lands of a replicated CD are moulded into a CD blank, rather than being burn marks in a dye layer (in CD-Rs) or areas with changed physical characteristics (in CD-RWs). In addition, CD burners write data sequentially, while a CD pressing plant forms the entire disk in one physical stamping operation, similar to record pressing.  Premastering  All CDs are pressed from a digital data source, with the most common sources being low error-rate CD-Rs or files from an attached computer hard drive containing the finished data (e. g., music or computer data). Some CD pressing systems can use digital master tapes, either in Digital Audio Tape, Exabyte or Umatic formats. However such sources are suitable only for production of audio CDs due to error detection and correction issues. If the source is not a CD, the table of contents for the CD to be pressed must also be prepared and stored on the tape or hard drive. In all cases except CD-R sources, the tape must be uploaded to a media mastering system to create the TOC (Table Of Contents) for the CD. Creative processing of the mixed audio recordings often occurs in conventional CD premastering sessions. The term often used for this is \\"mastering,\\" but the official name, as explained in Bob Katz book, Mastering Audio, edition 1, page 18, is 'premastering' because there still has to be the creation of another disc carrying the premastered audio which supplies the work surface on which the metal master (stamper) will be electroformed. Mastering=Glass mastering Glass mastering is performed in a class 100 (ISO 5) or better clean room or a self-enclosed clean environment within the mastering system. Contaminants introduced during critical stages of manufacturing (e.g., dust, pollen, hair, or smoke) can cause sufficient errors to make a master unusable. Once successfully completed, a CD master will be less susceptible to the effects of these contaminants. During glass mastering, glass is used as a substrate to hold the CD master image while it is created and processed; hence the name. Glass substrates, noticeably larger than a CD, are round plates of glass approximately 240 mm in diameter and 6 mm thick. They often also have a small, steel hub on one side to facilitate handling. The substrates are created especially for CD mastering and one side is polished until it is extremely smooth. Even microscopic scratches in the glass will affect the quality of CDs pressed from the master image. The extra area on the substrate allows for easier handling of the glass master and reduces the risk of damage to the pit and land structure when the \\"father\\" stamper is removed from the glass substrate. Once the glass substrate is cleaned using detergents and ultrasonic baths, the glass is placed in a spin coater. The spin coater rinses the glass blank with a solvent and then applies either photoresist or dye- polymer depending on the mastering process. Rotation spreads photoresist or dye-polymer coating evenly across the surface of the glass. The substrate is removed and baked to dry the coating and the glass substrate is ready for mastering. Once the glass is ready for mastering, it is placed in a laser beam recorder (LBR). Most LBRs are capable of mastering at greater than 1x speed, but due to the weight of the glass substrate and the requirements of a CD master they are typically mastered at no greater than 8x playback speed. The LBR uses a laser to write the information, with a wavelength and final lens NA (numerical aperture) chosen to produce the required pit size on the master blank. For example, DVD pits are smaller than CD pits, so a shorter wavelength or higher NA (or both) is needed for DVD mastering. LBRs use one of two recording techniques; photoresist and non-photoresist mastering. Photoresist also comes in two variations; positive photoresist and negative photoresist.  Photoresist mastering  Photoresist mastering uses a light-sensitive material (a photoresist) to create the pits and lands on the CD master blank. The laser beam recorder uses a deep blue or ultraviolet laser to write the master. When exposed to the laser light, the photoresist undergoes a chemical reaction which either hardens it (in the case of negative photoresist) or to the contrary makes it more soluble (in the case of positive photoresist). The exposed area is then soaked in a developer solution which removes the exposed positive photoresist or the unexposed negative photoresist. Once the mastering is complete, the glass master is removed from the LBR and chemically 'developed'. Once developing is finished, the glass master is metalized to provide a surface for the stamper to be formed onto. It is then polished with lubrication and wiped down.  Non-photoresist or dye-polymer mastering  When a laser is used to record on the dye-polymer used in non-photoresist (NPR) mastering, the dye-polymer absorbs laser energy focused in a precise spot; this vapourises and forms a pit in the surface of the dye-polymer. This pit can be scanned by a red laser beam that follows the cutting beam, and the quality of the recording can be directly and immediately assessed; for instance, audio signals being recorded can also be played straight from the glass master in real time. The pit geometry and quality of the playback can all be adjusted while the CD is being mastered, as the blue writing laser and the red read laser are typically connected via a feedback system to optimise the recording. This allows the dye-polymer LBR to produce very consistent pits even if there are variations in the dye-polymer layer. Another advantage of this method is that pit depth variation can be programmed during recording to compensate for downstream characteristics of the local production process (e.g., marginal molding performance). This cannot be done with photoresist mastering because the pit depth is set by the PR coating thickness, whereas dye-polymer pits are cut into a coating thicker than the intended pits. This type of mastering is called Direct Read After Write (DRAW) and is the main advantage of some non-photoresist recording systems. Problems with the quality of the glass blank master, such as scratches, or an uneven dye-polymer coating, can be immediately detected. If required the mastering can be halted, saving time and increasing throughput. Post-mastering After mastering, the glass master is baked to harden the developed surface material to prepare it for metalisation. Metalisation is a critical step prior to electrogalvanic manufacture (electroplating). The developed glass master is placed in a vapour deposition metallizer which uses a combination of mechanical vacuum pumps and cryopumps to lower the total vapour pressure inside a chamber to a hard vacuum. A piece of nickel wire is then heated in a tungsten boat to white-hot temperature and the nickel vapour deposited onto the rotating glass master. The glass master is coated with the nickel vapour up to a typical thickness of around 400 nm. The finished glass masters are inspected for stains, pinholes or incomplete coverage of the nickel coating and passed to the next step in the mastering process.  Electroforming  compact disc replication process Electroforming occurs in \\"Matrix\\", the name used for the electroforming process area in many plants; it is also a class 100 (ISO 5) or better clean room. The data (music, computer data, etc.) on the metalised glass master is extremely easy to damage and must be transferred to a tougher form for use in the injection moulding equipment which actually produces the end-product optical disks. The metalised master is clamped in a conductive electrodeposition frame with the data side facing outwards and lowered into an electroforming tank. The specially prepared and controlled tank water contains a nickel salt solution (usually nickel sulfamate) at a particular concentration which may be adjusted slightly in different plants depending on the characteristics of the prior steps. The solution is carefully buffered to maintain its pH, and organic contaminants must be kept below one part in five million for good results. The bath is heated to approximately 50 ¬∞C. The glass master is rotated in the electroforming tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution over the surface of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodeposition directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition. The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ¬±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing rings and centre clamps. This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution. The current must start off quite low as the metallised layer is too thin to take large currents, and is increased steadily. As the thickness of the nickel on the glass \\"mistress\\" increases, the current can be increased. The full electroforming current density is very high with the full thickness of usually 0.3 mm taking approximately one hour. The part is removed from the tank and the metal layer carefully separated from the glass substrate. If plating occurs, the process must be begun anew, from the glass mastering phase. The metal part, now called a \\"father\\", has the desired data as a series of bumps rather than pits. The injection moulding process works better by flowing around high points rather than into pits on the metal surface. The father is washed with deionised water and other chemicals such as ammonical hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide or acetone to remove all trace of resist or other contaminants. The glass master can be sent for reclamation, cleaning and checking before reuse. If defects are detected, it will be discarded or repolished recycled. Once cleaned of any loose nickel and resist, the father surface is washed and the passivated, either electrically or chemically, which allows the next plated layer to separate from the father. This layer is an atomic layer of absorbed oxygen that does not alter the physical surface. The father is clamped back into a frame and returned to the plating tank. This time the metal part that is grown is the mirror image of the father and is called a \\"mother\\"; as this is now pits, it cannot be used for moulding. The mother-father sandwich is carefully separated and the mother is then washed, passivated and returned to the electroforming baths to have a mirror image produced on it called a son. Most moulded CDs are produced from sons. Mothers can be regrown from fathers if they become damaged, or a very long run. If handled correctly, there is no limit to the number of stampers that can be grown from a single mother before the quality of the stamper is reduced unacceptably. Fathers can be used as a stamper, directly, if a very fast turnaround is required, or if the yield is 100%, in which case the father would be wastefully stored. At the end of a run, the mother is certainly to be stored. A father, mother, and a collection of stampers (sometimes called \\"sons\\") are known collectively as a \\"family\\". Fathers and mothers are the same size as a glass substrate, typically 300 Œºm in thickness. Stampers do not require the extra space around the outside of the program area and they are punched to remove the excess nickel from outside and inside the information area in order to fit the mould of the injection moulding machine (IMM). The physical dimensions of the mould vary depending of the injection tooling being used.  Replication  CD moulding machines are specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per moulding line. Clear polycarbonate pellets are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into one end of the injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the injection chamber via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with heater bands ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is closed the screw moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds. The moulded \\"disc\\" (referred to as a 'green' disc, lacking final processing) is removed from the mould by vacuum handling; high-speed robot arms with vacuum suction caps. They are moved onto the finishing line infeed conveyor, or cooling station, in preparation for metallisation. At this point the discs are clear and contain all the digital information desired; however, they cannot be played because there is no reflective layer. The discs pass, one at a time, into the metallizer, a small chamber at approximately 10‚àí3 Torr (130 mPa) vacuum. The process is called 'sputtering'. The metallizer contains a metal \\"target\\" ‚Äì almost always an alloy of (mostly) aluminium and small amounts of other metals. There is a load-lock system (similar to an airlock) so the process chamber can be kept at high vacuum as the discs are exchanged. When the disc is rotated into the processing position by a swivel arm in the vacuum chamber, a small dose of argon gas is injected into the process chamber and a 700 volt DC electric current at up to 20 kW is applied to the target. This produces a plasma from the target, and the plasma vapour is deposited onto the disc; it is an anode-cathode transfer. The metal coats the data side of the disc (upper surface), covering the pit and lands. This metal layer is the reflective surface which can be seen on the reverse (non-label side) of a CD. This thin layer of metal is subject to corrosion from various contaminants and so is protected by a thin layer of lacquer. CDs are printed in waterless offset After metalisation, the discs pass on to a spin-coater, where UV curable lacquer is dispensed onto the newly metallized layer. By rapid spinning, the lacquer coats the entire disc with a very thin layer (approximately 5 to 10 Œºm). After the lacquer is applied, the discs pass under a high-intensity UV lamp which cures the lacquer rapidly. The lacquer also provides a surface for a label, generally screen printed or offset printed. The printing ink(s) must be chemically compatible with the lacquer used. Markers used by consumers to write on blank surfaces can lead to breaks in the protective lacquer layer, which may lead to corrosion of the reflective layer, and failure of the CD.  Testing  For quality control, both the stamper and the moulded discs are tested before a production run. Samples of the disc (test pressings) are taken during long production runs and tested for quality consistency. Pressed discs are analyzed on a signal analysis machine. The metal stamper can also be tested on a signal analysis machine which has been specially adapted (larger diameter, more fragile, ...). The machine will \\"play\\" the disc or stamper and measure various physical and electrical parameters. Errors can be introduced at every step of production, but the moulding process is the least subject to adjustment. Sources of errors are more readily identified and compensated for during mastering. If the errors are too severe then the stamper is rejected and a replacement installed. An experienced machine operator can interpret the report from the analysis system and optimise the moulding process to make a disc that meets the required Rainbow Book specification (e.g. Red Book for Audio from the Rainbow Books series). If no defects are found, the CD continues to printing so a label can be screen or offset printed on the top surface of the disc. Thereafter, discs are counted, packaged, and shipped.

His undemocratic appointment as vice-captain-cum-treasurer of the Australian cricket team in England in 1909 irrupted latent animus between the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket and its players. An unpopular choice, McAlister was forced to brood his way through the tour after player-appointed manager Frank Laver declined to assist him. Two years later, accordingly, the Board unilaterally repealed the players' informal right to choose their own manager. It was this which motivated the Big Six, supported by the South Australian Cricket Association and some disgruntled members of the Melbourne Cricket Club, to pull out of the 1912 Triangular Tournament.

In 2000, it won the Kodansha Manga Award for sh≈çjo. It was published in the United States by Del Rey Manga. Plot Ponta, the Koizumi family's labrador retriever puppy one day eats the 'talking bone' that the grandfather invented to allow an animal who licks it the power of speech. Instead of just being able to talk however, she transforms into a human girl. When she rushes out into traffic as a girl, she is saved by the most popular boy at school and falls in love with him. To be near him she enrolls in school and tries to learn how to live as a human. Characters ;Ponta Koizumi :The lead character of the series. She is sweet, innocent, and loyal. Ponta's feelings for Mirai could be described as love at first sight, at least on her part. Grandpa Koizumi's invention transformed her from a puppy into a small child that Mirai believes is feral. After saving her, Ponta returns the favor by upchucking the bone onto Mirai's clothes, resulting in her returning to her canine form. Some time later, Ponta has grown into a teenage dog, and finally sees Mirai again. Overjoyed, she follows him back to his house where she rediscovers the bone, and Mirai discovers her secret. He doesn't fully realize it, though, until about one chapter later. As Mirai's sweetie, Ponta has had no shortage of rivals battling for the love of Mirai. Despite these obstacles, not to mention her slow learning of human life, she and Mirai have remained true to each other. ;Mirai Iwaki :He is the object of Ponta's affection, and an all-around nice guy. Mirai was understandably frustrated when Ponta first became human, as it became his task to watch her at school so she didn't get in trouble. He even once snapped at her, causing her to believe that she was naughty. While they made up, it also showed Ponta that her actions do have consequences. Mirai is very patient, and while he would sometimes have reservations about dating Ponta's human side, loves her very much. ;Go Fujinaga :Fujinaga loves animals, but does not get along with humans as well. He doesn't like it when people abuse animals. When he first meets Ponta and Mirai, she had transformed back into a dog while she was wearing a kimono. Fujinaga later met the human Ponta in school, and fell for her instantly. He wrongly believed, however, since Mirai was also with Yuka Koizumi that he was cheating on her. Fujinaga tries to break them up, but since he has no real malice in him, he does not resort to cheap tricks. He discovers Ponta's secret in the 2nd volume, while trying (unsuccessfully) to take Ponta to a movie. ;Yuka Koizumi :Yuka is the granddaughter of the transformation bone's creator, Grandfather Koizumi. She is very sweet, but is also very sensitive. Yuka initially had a crush on Mirai, causing Ponta to fall into a deep depression, but later realized that her crush was only a crush, while what Ponta felt was true love. She later finds a nice boyfriend, and becomes a more minor character, showing up more in the manga when help is needed to find/conceal Ponta. ;Soichiro Koizumi :Brother to Yuka. He has been seen, not heard, after volume 1. ;Grandfather Ji Koizumi :Initially thought of by his family members as senile and crazy, after the evidence of the transformation bone's success his family just thinks he is crazy. He tries very hard to educate Ponta, and to teach her how humans act and interact within everyday life, which may stem from his career in education (he is the headmaster of the school his grandchildren, Mirai, and Ponta attend). All of these Koizumi-s, plus a mother and a father, live in a house next door to Mirai Iwaki. Most often, Ji Koizumi's character provides the comic relief. At several points, he is shown to be aware that he is in a manga, but when asked about it he brushes it off as unimportant. ;Hana Yamaguchi :Mirai's scheming ex-girlfriend. She would stoop to almost anything to regain Mirai, despite that she was the one who broke off the relationship. Hana wanted to become a celebrity, and she didn't want to have anything to distract her. She is very suspicious of Ponta, and began to investigate her in order to learn how to defeat her. Hana has a suspicion that the human and dog Pontas are the same, but doesn't believe that such a thing is possible.

Lib Tech produces snowboards, skateboards and now surf boards from their manufacturing base near Sequim, Washington in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.  History  Mike Olson built his first snowboard in 1977, and by 1984 had dropped out of Pacific Lutheran University, to begin making snowboards full- time.Kinmonth, John. \\"Mervin Manufacturing Shreds Up Snowboard Design\\",The Seattle Times, 2008-11-20. Retrieved on 2009-04-20. Mervin Manufacturing's headquarters were set up in an \\"old racehorse barn,\\" where Olson worked for two years, paying rent by mowing the lawn and cleaning the gutters for the barn's owner. Olson was quickly joined in his efforts by Pete Saari, and the two began churning out small orders for members of the nascent snowboard community.  Technology = Magne-Traction  Gravitating away from the long, smoothly curving sidewall and edge of a traditional snowboard, Lib Tech's Magne-Traction technology employs a \\"serrated\\" edge consisting of seven bumps in the side wall. According to Lib Tech's co-founder and VP of Marketing, Pete Saari: :\\"Magne-traction is 7 bumps or teeth along the length of your sidecut and edge each specifically sized and located to improve edge hold and focus control and power where you need it. The 3 largest most aggressive teeth are located between your feet adding control to the un- pressurable \\"dead zone\\" at and between your feet where your balance is centered. Smaller less aggressive teeth are located between your front foot and the contact area adding edge hold for turn initiation and control but keeping the tips and tails loose for catch-free freestyle.\\" Since its debut, Magne-Traction has been generally well received by both reviewers and the general snowboard community, winning more than 15 Transworld Good Wood Awards and over 20 Future magazine awards.  Banana Technology  The introduction of Lib Tech's Banana Technology marked yet another departure from orthodox snowboard design. Traditionally, snowboards are built with camber‚Äîthe gentle arch formed in between the board's contact points when placed on a flat surface. Camber geometry was first introduced for skis, which each have only one central area of pressure input (i.e., under the skier's boot). Snowboards, however, have two areas of pressure input (i.e., one under the front boot, and one under the back boot), leaving the rider unable to efficiently depress the center of the snowboard, an effect which Lib Tech's Pete Saari calls the \\"dead zone.\\" Banana Technology does away with this \\"dead zone\\" by reversing the snowboard's camber between the rider's feet; rather than arcing upward, like traditionally cambered boards, those with Banana Technology arc downwards, allowing the board to rest on its center when placed on a flat surface. As Saari puts it, \\"Banana Technology focuses edge pressure between your feet, bringing the dead zone to life. It adds catch free tips and tails for jibs, rails, and forgiving landings. It adds pre-bent rocker between your feet for edge hold and carving, and it adds tip and tail float in powder.\\" Banana Technology has been extremely well received by the snowboard community; in 2008, Banana Technology's inaugural year, Lib Tech experienced an 81% spike in sales. Boards equipped with Banana Technology have garnered Lib Tech a slew of awards: *Winner, 2009 Best of Test, Snowboarder Magazine (Skate Banana) *Winner, 2009 Good Wood Test, Transworld Snowboarding (Skate Banana) *Winner, 2009 Good Wood Test, Transworld Snowboarding (TRS BTX) *Winner, 2009 Women's Good Wood Test, Transworld Snowboarding (TRS BTX) *Tested Best, Men's Over $600, Future Snowboard Magazine (Cygnus X1 BTX) *Tested Best, Men's $400‚Äì599, Future Snowboard Magazine (TRS BTX) *Tested Best, Women's Over $400, Future Snowboard Magazine (TRS BTX) *2007 Innovation of the Year, SIA Snowpress Innovation Awards (Skate Banana) Banana Technology (BTX), like Magne-Traction before it, begins with the premise that a snowboard is not a ski. Banana Technology replaces camber with rocker \\"Banana\\" between your feet. When you stand on your board, pressure is now applied inward to the edge area at the between your feet. As your weight presses out the rocker, tips and tails still make full contact for control and stability but edge pressure is reduced in tip and tail allowing them to float, climb and deflect like never before. The Banana Technology flex pattern is slightly stiffened at the tip and tail to increase pop and stability on big landings. Magne-Traction is incorporated into the Banana Technology to improve edgehold and put even more control underfoot at your balance point. The end result is a board that is loose and catch-free, presses boxes, rails and jibs extremely well with the preset rocker, maintains pop with a stiffened tip and tail, and turns easily on hardpack and ice when the built-in rocker is put on edge. The built-in rocker curve makes the board float naturally in powder and the firm nose and tail prevent the board from folding in chunky conditions.

Repairing persistent pulls, drifts, shimmies & vibration . Retrieved 28 January 2014 (RFV) is a property of a tire that affects steering, traction, braking and load support. High values of RFV for a given tire reflect a high level of manufacturing variations in the tire structure that will impart ride disturbances into the vehicle in the vertical direction. RFV is measured according to processes specified by the ASTM International in ASTM F1806 ‚Äì Standard Practice for Tire Testing. Force Variation Axes Explanation RFV can best be explained by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns the tire, and the tire carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between the tire and the wheel we will see zero change as the tire turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as the tire turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of the tire, and variation in the elastomeric properties of the tire. Consider a good tire with RFV of . This tire will induce a 6-pound force upward into the vehicle every rotation. The frequency of the force will increase in direct proportion to rotating speed. Tire makers test tires at the point of manufacture to verify that the RFV is within allowable quality limits. Tires that exceed these limits may be scrapped or sold to markets that do not require stringent quality. Spring model RFV is often explained by modelling the tire as being a ring composed of short compression springs. As the tire turns a spring element makes contact with the road and is compressed. Stiff Spots in the Tire's Sidewall (Radial force variation) . Retrieved 28 January 2014 As the spring rotates out of the contact area it recovers to its original length. In practice, these springs have slight differences in their lengths and spring constants. These variations result in RFV. Tires are complex composite structures made of many different components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, body ply splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, curing press bead seating, shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things. Waveform analysis RFV is a complex waveform. It is expressed using several standard methods, including peak-to-peak, first harmonic, second harmonic, and higher-order harmonics. In production RFV testing these are reported as both magnitudes and angles.

Delmar is located six miles north of Natural Bridge, five miles south of Haleyville and 15 miles west of Double Springs, the county seat of what was once the \\"Free State of Winston.\\" Delmar has an elevation of 881 feet above sea level. Origins of the name \\"Delmar\\" Delmar was originally called \\"Frog Level.\\" Presumably, the community was called Frog Level because of the swampy land that existed around the area at the time. In the 19th century, the citizens of Frog Level asked the U. S. Postal Service to open a post office in their community, since the nearest post office was in Ark (where Needmore, Alabama is currently located). Their request was denied because there was another Frog Level, Alabama (now Fayette, Alabama) and it already had a post office. In order to get a post office, the citizens of the Frog Level in Winston County had to change their town's name. Around 1887, the town began to be known as \\"Delmar.\\" The exact origins of the name \\"Delmar\\" are unknown. A popular belief holds that a construction engineer with the railroad had a retired race horse by the name of \\"Delmar\\" or \\"Del Mar\\" (Spanish for \\"from the sea\\"). The horse was well known and loved by the community. When work on the railroad was completed around 1887, the community was renamed after the race horse. Another popular belief is that Delmar was named for a different reason. When you spell Delmar backwards, you get the name, \\"Ramled.\\" Many believe that this was named for all of the wild rams that were found in the Delmar woods in the late 19th century. Either way, no one is exactly sure how the name was formed. After notifying the U. S. Postal Service of its name change, Delmar's first post office was opened on September 1, 1887. Newton L. Powell was the first Postmaster of Delmar. The current post office building was erected in 1971, during the service of Postmaster Mrs. Martha Roberts Stewart. Today, the name of the town of Delmar is pronounced \\"Delmer.\\" 19th century history According to legend, Delmar was not always the sleepy little community it is today. During the Coal Mining boom of the 19th century, there were several saloons in Delmar. Reportedly, Delmar was as lively as a town out of the Wild West, complete with drunken bar room brawls. Byler Road was completed through Winston County in 1820. The historic highway, which ran through parts of what are today Delmar, Natural Bridge, Lynn, and Haleyville, connected the towns of northern Alabama with Tuscaloosa, which at the time was the capital of Alabama. When Alabama seceded from the Union in 1861, the people of Winston County did not want to fight their Northern or Southern brothers and wanted to remain neutral in the Civil War. They decided that if a state could secede from the nation, then a county could secede from a state, and formed \\"Free State of Winston.\\" The people of neighboring counties called the people of Winston County Tories (Northern sympathizers). During the closing phases of the Civil War, Union troops made their way through Winston County on parts of what today are Winston County Road 17. Union troops set up their camps on the side of the road. Today, the road is better known as \\"Yankee Trace Road.\\" After the Civil War, a rail line was built from Sheffield, Alabama to Delmar by the Northern Alabama Railroad. After several years, a rail line was built from Parrish, Alabama to Delmar. This allowed rail service from Birmingham to the Shoals area. Today, Norfolk Southern Railway still runs cargo trains through Delmar. 20th century and recent history In the late 1960s, Marshall Durbin built its regional headquarters in Delmar. On the night of April 3, 1974, Delmar was struck by a deadly tornado, as were communities in 12 other states and Canada during the 1974 Super Outbreak. Five people died in Delmar as a result of the tornado. Several homes and other structures were destroyed. Many homes that suffered little or no direct damage were without electricity, telephone, and water service for several days. In January 1993, the people of Delmar decided to establish a volunteer fire department for their community. Currently, the department has 30 firefighters, two pumpers and two tankers and a brush truck. The current Fire Chief is Keith Tolkacevic. In 1998, MSR Forest Products built a large plant in Delmar. Today, it employs over 100 people. On January 27, 2000, Delmar received its first visit from a U.S. Senator when Richard Shelby visited the small Winston County town. Like so many small towns and communities in Alabama, Delmar has experienced times of economic boom and bust over the past 100 years. Today, Delmar is experiencing somewhat of an economic upturn with several businesses opening in and around Delmar. Notable people Perhaps the most famous person from Delmar is Federal Judge Frank Johnson, Jr. Although Johnson was born in Delmar in 1918, he was reared and attended school in nearby Haleyville. He served in World War II, after which he began a law career. In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to a federal judgeship in Alabama. Almost immediately, Johnson was hearing important cases of the civil rights era. In a ruling involving the Montgomery bus boycott, he ruled that racial segregation of public transportation was illegal. Johnson often locked horns with Alabama Governor George Wallace over racial issues. In 1965, Johnson ordered Wallace to allow civil rights protesters to march from Selma to Montgomery. He was often targeted because of his rulings. In 1967, his mother's house was bombed. In July, 1999, at the age of 80, Johnson died at his Montgomery residence. He was buried in the Winston Memorial Cemetery near Haleyville. Churches There are five churches in the Delmar area: Delmar Baptist Church, Union Grove Baptist Church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, Bethel #2 Baptist Church, and Botush Freewill Baptist Church.

For just over one year beginning in May 1920, Narimanov headed the government of Soviet Azerbaijan. He was subsequently elected chairman of the Union Council of the Transcaucasian SFSR. He was also Party Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union from 30 December 1922 until the day of his death. In the realm of literature, Narimanov translated into Turkic Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector and wrote many plays, stories and novels, such as Bahadur and Sona (1896). He was also the author of the historical trilogy, Nadir-Shah (1899). One of the central districts and one of the busiest metro stations in Baku, together with a number of streets, parks and halls all over Azerbaijan, as well as Azerbaijan Medical University, are named after him. In the Lankaran region, there is a town named Narimanabad in his honor. There are also towns named after him in other post-Soviet states, mainly in Russia. Biography=Early years Nariman Narimanov was born on 14 April (2 April O.S.) 1870 in Tiflis, Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire into an ethnic Azerbaijani family. The Narimanov family were middle- class merchants and were able to send their son to the Gori Teachers Seminary, from which he graduated.George Jackson with Robert Devlin, \\"Narima Nejefoghi Narimanov\\" in Dictionary of the Russian Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 399-400. He went on to attend medical school at \\"Imperial Novorossiya University\\" (present-day \\"Odessa University\\"), graduating in 1908. As a young man, Narimanov gained notice as a writer in Azerbaijan even before the revolution of 1905-1907, publishing novels which advocated the abandonment of tired customs and religious superstitions. He simultaneously taught school in the village of Gizel-Adjal, Tiflis Province, where he became closely acquainted with the hard life of the local peasantry. Narimanov was one of the first activists of young Turkic literature. He translated into Turkic Gogol's Inspector and wrote many plays, stories and novels; the most well known among them being the novel, Bahadur and Sona (1896), and a historical trilogy, Nadir-shah (1899). During the 1905 Revolution, Narimanov joined the Bolshevik party, took an active part and led the student movement in Odessa. He subsequently became one of the organizers of the Social Democratic Party. For these activities, Narimanov was arrested in 1909 and sentenced to five years' internal exile in Astrakhan.

After the October Revolution of 1917, Nariman Narimanov became the chairman of the Azerbaijani social democratic political party, Hummet (Endeavor), the forerunner of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. He did not run for election on the Hummet slate, however, and was thus not a member of the Baku Soviet during the brief reign of the Baku Commune of 1918. He was appointed People's Commissar of National Economy by the Baku Soviet, however. Following the fall of the Baku Soviet, Narimanov managed to escape the city to Astrakhan, thereby avoiding the grim fate of the 26 Baku Commissars. He was there appointed chief of the Near East Division of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, later moving to a position as Deputy People's Commissar in the Commissariat of National Affairs. Narimanov was an advocate of national autonomy within a federated Soviet structure and is widely viewed as being instrumental in the July 1919 decision of the Politburo to recognize Azerbaijan as an independent Soviet Republic. In 1920, Narimanov was appointed the chairman of the Azerbaijani Revolutionary Committee (Azrevkom) and, shortly thereafter, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars' (Sovnarkom) of the Azerbaijani Soviet Republic. In April and May 1922, he took part in the Genoese Conference as a member of the Soviet delegation. In 1922, he was elected the chairman of the Union Council of the Transcaucasian Federation. On 30 December 1922, the first session of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR elected Narimanov as one of the four chairpersons of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR. In April 1923, Narimanov was elected as a candidate for the Central Committee of the RKP(b) (Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks). The charismatic moderate nationalist clashed with Joseph Stalin's close associate Sergo Ordzhonikidze, who led the Communist Party in Transcaucasia. As a result of this conflict, Ordzhonikidze had Narimanov transferred to posts in Moscow to remove him from the Caucasus. Death and legacy Narimanov died in bed of a heart attack on 19 March 1925. He was 54 years old at the time of his death. His remains were cremated and his ashes buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Leon Trotsky called his death the second biggest loss for the Eastern world after that of Lenin.Leon Trotsky on the memory of Myasnikov, Mogilevskogo, and Artabekova Sergo Ordzhonikidze described Narimanov as \\"the greatest representative of our party in the East\\".The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1939, p. 160. During the Ezhovshchina of the late 1930s, Narimanov was posthumously denounced along with all other members of Hummet for their alleged nationalism. This action was reversed after the liberalization which followed the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and Narimanov was again celebrated as a leading figure in the history of Azerbaijani communism, though in 1959, official CCCPSU policy was still to downplay Narimanov's role and stress that of Shaumian within the Azerbaijani context. It was only in 1972 that Narimanov was fully rehabilitated within his homeland.Jamil Hasanli, Khrushchev's Thaw and National Identity in Soviet Azerbaijan 1954-1959 p436] Narimanov was survived by his wife Gulsum and by his son Najaf, who joined the Red Army in 1938 and graduated from the Kiev Higher Military Radio-Technical Engineering School in 1940. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1942. During the Great Patriotic War, he was the commander of a tank division and took part in the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Dnieper before being killed in action near Volnovakha in Ukraine. * : Monuments in Baku, Ganja and Sumgayit, cinema, metro station, schools, raion, village streets in Baku also in Imishli (city) and Ganja, Azerbaijan Medical University, central park as well as villages of Narimanly in Shamkir and Geranboy and Narimankend in Bilasuvar, Gobustan, G…ôd…ôb…ôy and Sabirabad regions of Azerbaijan, Nariman Narimanov Stadium. * : a village in the village hall of Aleksichskom Khoiniki district, Gomel region. * : a street (changed its name into Kutaisi in 1932),Qori seminariyasƒ±nƒ±n Az…ôrbaycan ≈ü√∂b…ôsinin yaradƒ±cƒ±sƒ± a museum in Tbilisi (not active anymore), culture center, school, monument and street in Marneuli. * : Kostanay Airport (Narimanovka). * : Narimanov, Astrakhan Oblast, a khutor in Leninskoye Rural Settlement of Zimovnikovsky District of Rostov Oblast, a settlement in Nurlatsky District of the Republic of Tatarstan, a village in Narimanovsky Rural Okrug of Tyumensky District of Tyumen Oblast, raion in Baskhortostan, avenue and the area in Ulyanovsk, culture center in Shatura, streets in Volgograd, Chernyanka Belgorod regions, Kostroma and Moscow, street near railway of Voronezh.

In April 1835, Bull accompanied Moore on an expedition to the north of the Swan River.

In 1838 he was Government Resident at Bunbury, and he was a Member of the Executive Council in 1841. In 1848 he appointed agents to manage his affairs and apparently left the colony.

Stefan Daniel Patryk Liv (born Patryk ≈öli≈º; 21 December 1980 ‚Äì 7 September 2011) was a Swedish professional ice hockey goaltender. Liv played professionally in Sweden, North America and Russia. Liv played nine seasons for HV71 in the top-tier league in Sweden. He played one season in Detroit Red Wings organization without managing to make his debut in the NHL. He then returned to Europe and HV71. Upon his return, he played three seasons in Sweden, then moved to Russia in 2010. Stefan Liv was a member of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) when he died, along with the rest of the team in the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash. He was a member of several Swedish national teams, including the 2006 Olympic championship team. A street in J√∂nk√∂ping, named \\"Stefan Livs gata\\" (English: Stefan Liv's street), was named in his honor on 2 August 2013. Early life Liv was born in Gdynia, Poland, as Patryk ≈öli≈º, given to an orphanage in Gda≈Ñsk and adopted by a Swedish family around the age of two.

The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials said \\"everyone from the main roster was on the plane plus four players from the youth team.\\" As a result of Liv's death, the premier round games of the 2011‚Äì12 Elitserien season, between 13‚Äì15 September, began with a one-minute silence. In honour, his No. 1 jersey was retired and raised to the rafters by HV71 in Kinnarps Arena prior to HV71's home game against Timr√• IK on 10 January 2012. To remember Liv throughout the 2011‚Äì12 season, all player jerseys in HV71's team carried number 1 on the front. On 10 September 2011, over 10,000 fans of HV71 attended Kinnarps Arena, HV71's home arena, to honor Stefan Liv. In their 2011 season opener, each member of the Detroit Red Wings wore a patch bearing \\"BM*RS*SL\\" to honor the memories of Liv, Lokomotiv coach Brad McCrimmon, and defenseman Ruslan Salei.http://redwings.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=601633 Detroit goalie Jimmy Howard also paid a personal tribute to the three men on the back of his mask.http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2011/09/red_wings_goalie_jimmy_howard_5.html Liv and Howard had shared goaltending duties during Liv's season with the Grand Rapids Griffins.http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0026752007.html Liv's body was buried at the Sofiakyrkan church in J√∂nk√∂ping on 2 October 2011, with 120 friends and relatives arriving at the scene and leaving one rose flower each on Liv's coffin. From the 2012‚Äì13 season onward, the Swedish Hockey League's playoff MVP award is known as the Stefan Liv Memorial Trophy in honor of Liv. On 2 August 2013, a new street in J√∂nk√∂ping leading to Kinnarps Arena was named \\"Stefan Livs gata\\" (English: Stefan Liv's street).

Its highest point is about 270 metres above the Limmat and it is part of a chain of hills, such as K√§ferberg, Adlisberg, Forch and Pfannenstiel, between the Greifensee/Glattal and Lake Z√ºrich. It is a picturesque location, and the lower western side of the hill is now part of the residential district of Z√ºrich. The Z√ºrich Zoo and FIFA's headquarters are located on the Z√ºrichberg as well. There are grand mansions on the roads up the hill, and it is also the location of restaurants and hotels.

History The Severin company emerged from a blacksmith shop founded by Anton Severin in 1892. After the First World War, the Anton Severin Metallfabrik was founded. With the production of curtain rods, it was one of several companies in Sundern specialising in this area of metalware production. In December 1921 the Severin Elektroger√§te GmbH was founded as A. Severin & Co Company.https://www.companyhouse.de/Severin-Elektrogeraete-GmbH- Arnsberg In 1922, the production site was relocated within the town and the manufacturing of aluminium tableware started. A short time later this product range was abandoned, and the production of cake plates, coasters and glass plates became more important. Later serving trolleys were added as well. After the end of the Second World War the course of business remained rather modest. This changed after the currency reform; the company benefited from the increasing demand for consumer goods. In 1948 a new factory building was erected. Since 1952, Severin has been producing electrical appliances, mainly for the household. Between 1956 and 1962 the company expanded strongly and four factory halls were added. In 1962 a branch factory was built in Wenholthausen, which initially produced drying hoods and fan heaters, but later mainly focused coffee machines. In 1966 another factory was built in Wallen near Meschede. By 1967, the year of the 75th anniversary, 200 different types of small electrical appliances were produced. In order to produce plastic parts a plant was built in Berge near Meschede in 1977. The plants in Wallen and Wenholthausen were closed in later years. Today's structure The product range includes items such as coffee machines, water kettles, toasters, egg cookers, electrical grills and raclette grills, mixers, vacuum cleaners, hair and body care products. In total, more than 200 different electrical appliances are available in the product range. In 2011, the company had over 2,600 employees worldwide and is represented in over 80 countries. Severin has sales offices in France, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Poland. Production has been taking place in production plants located in Shenzhen, China, since 1995. Production in Sundern was subsequently discontinued in 2020.https://www.wp.de/staedte/sundern/severin-stellt-produktion-in-sundern- ein-id227056353.html In the summer of 2013, Severin reduced the number of employees in Sundern by 52 from 387 in 2012 to 335 due to low sales.https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/arnsberg/severin-kann-den-umsatz- wieder-steigern-id8979976.html In the 24 months to August 2014, Severin demonstrated innovative ability by launching over 60 new products and numerous patents.https://www.moebelkultur.de/news/vier-top-100-gewinner-arbeiten- zusammen/ In March 2015, the entrepreneurial family Knauf from Dortmund invested in Severin and acquired a 49% shareholding.https://www.derwesten.de/wirtschaft/knauf-familie- erwirbt-49-prozent-von-severin-id10447525.html On 1st May of 2018, the Knauf family took over 100% of the company shares.https://www.wp.de/staedte/sundern/ende-der-aera-schulte-bei-firma- severin-id213934493.html In spring 2020, the company launched a new, innovative electrical grill platform on the market, which was awarded the Kitchen Innovation Prize.https://www.moebelkultur.de/news/vom-verbraucher- ausgezeichnet/?type=RSS2  Literatur  * * ReferencesExternal links *SEVERIN's official website Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Home appliance manufacturers of Germany Category:Electronics companies established in 1892 Category:1892 establishments in Germany Category:German brands ","title":"Severin Elektro"},{"id":"3578921","text":"Ronto can refer to: * Ronto (Star Wars), a fictional creature in the Star Wars universe * Ront√≥, the Hungarian name for RontƒÉu village, S√¢nmartin Commune, Bihor County, Romania ","title":"Ronto"},{"id":"3578923","title":"List of Academy Award-winning films"},{"id":"3578948","text":"Hartlepool United mascot H'Angus. H'Angus the Monkey is the official mascot of Hartlepool United. The name \\"H'Angus\\" is a pun of the word hang and the name Angus, and is derived from the monkey hanger legend of Hartlepool. The mascot made his debut on 31 October 1999, during Hartlepool‚Äôs first round FA Cup victory over Millwall. People known to have played the role of H'Angus=James Auton The first person known to have \\"played\\" H'Angus was James Auton who was a big Hartlepool fan and who launched the character on TV show Soccer AM with guest Robbie Fowler on the show. Stuart Drummond Stuart Drummond was the second person to play him. Drummond became the most popular version of H'Angus with his outrageous antics. During an away against Scunthorpe United on 4 November 2000, H'Angus was famously thrown out for the first time in his career. A steward took offence at H'Angus standing up and leading the Hartlepool fans in song. H'Angus once again angered the stewards when he simulated sex on a female steward and he was promptly escorted away in front of a bemused set of away supporters. Drummond caused even more controversy during the first leg of Hartlepool's play-off match away to Blackpool on 13 May 2001, after he played with an inflated doll. H'Angus was once again escorted off by police but was released without charge. A police spokesman later claimed that H'Angus had been \\"drunk\\". =Drummond's mayoral election and subsequent re-elections= Drummond approached Hartlepool chairman Ken Hodcroft with an idea for some publicity and asked him to fund the ¬£500 deposit that would allow him to stand for election. Hodcroft accepted the proposal but wanted the club to stay out of politics so forced Drummond to make the agenda his own and separate from the club. Drummond ran for mayor under his own name, campaigning for \\"free bananas\\" for all schoolchildren. He campaigned both at matches, much to the bemusement of opposition fans, and also locally and away from the football pitch. On 2 May 2002, Drummond was elected the first directly elected mayor of Hartlepool. Drummond immediately decided to concentrate on politics and ceased being H'Angus; he was quoted as saying, \\"I am Stuart Drummond, I am the Mayor of Hartlepool, not the monkey.\\" Drummond was re-elected in 2005, more than doubling his vote (up to over 16,000) and increasing his majority to over 10,000. At the same time, turnout increased from 30% to 51%. On the night of the election count, he proposed to his girlfriend, Beccy Buttery, who accepted. In 2009, Drummond was re-elected for a third term. Ceri Anderson The departure of Drummond forced Hartlepool to hold auditions for a new person to take over the role of H'Angus. Dozens of fans applied for the auditions and they were cut down to six. The final six auditionees then had to wear the famous costume and perform for a half during Hartlepool‚Äôs pre-season friendlies. Student Ceri Anderson was deemed the \\"most monkey-like\\" and won the job as H'Angus. She had applied for the job after being encouraged by her 7-year-old son, Ralf. Anderson refused to enter the world of politics and is quoted as saying, \\"I came into the job because I'm a Hartlepool fan, not because I'm looking to start a career in politics.\\" Predecessor Stuart Drummond praised her for her performance as H‚ÄôAngus. Scott Llewellyn Scott Llewellyn was the next person to take the role. Since taking over as H'Angus, he has achieved a third-place finish in the WBX Mascot Grand National. He followed this by competing in the Great North Run, where he raised over ¬£555. Llewellyn aimed to lose weight in order to be a more energetic mascot and has won a competition to help him do so. Michael Evans Michael Evans is currently the man behind the monkey suit playing H'angus and has been in the role for 7 seasons. He has taken part in numerous challenges from doing the Great North Run and walking with Jeff Stelling, raising thousands of pounds for charities.

The film was directed by H. C. Potter and produced independently for Paramount Pictures by Boris Morros, with associate producers Robert Stillman and (uncredited) Fred Astaire.https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/27042 The film's copyright expired in 1967 and it is now in the public domain,page 89 with the result that, prior to its recent restoration, it tended to circulate in seriously degraded prints. Plot Danny O'Neill (Fred Astaire) and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are friends and rival trumpeters with \\"O'Neill's Perennials\\", a college band. Both have managed to prolong their college careers by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) catches Danny's and Hank's eyes. She serves them a notice for her boss, a debt collector, but the fast-talking O'Neill and Taylor soon have her working as their manager. Tired of losing gigs to the Perennials, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away to be his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaw's band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them fired. Ellen talks Shaw into letting rich wannabee musician J. Lester Chisholm (Charles Butterworth) back a concert. It looks like the jig is up when Hank pretends to be Ellen's jealous husband, and then her brother. Danny and Hank manage get Chisholm back on board, then get Shaw to agree to put Danny's song into the show. All they have to do is keep Chisholm and his mandolin (which he wants to play in the concert) away from Shaw until after the show; the solution is sleeping pills to knock Chisholm, and incidentally Hank, out. To Ellen's relief, Danny finally acts professionally, arranging his number for the show, which Shaw says \\"has really grown up into something special.\\" He hands the baton to Danny, who successfully dance-conducts his own composition.

Musical numbers Hermes Pan collaborated with Astaire on the choreography. * \\"Sugar\\": Astaire is shown leading a college band in a jazz standard by Marceo Pinkard. Astaire's trumpet playing is dubbed by Bobby Hackett, while Meredith's is dubbed by Shaw's bandsman Billy Butterfield. * \\"Everything's Jumping\\": A brief number for Artie Shaw and his band. * \\"I Ain't Hep To That Step But I'll Dig It\\": This comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Goddard was, according to Goddard - whose dance ability and experience was limited - done \\"just once, one Saturday morning ... I'm glad it was all right for I couldn't have done it again\\". It was the last of Astaire's duets to be filmed entirely in one take. The dance incorporates a new step, the \\"Dig It\\" which involved snapping both feet together and then hopping while keeping them together. The rest of the dance involves original use of partnered teetering, scooting and dodging steps with some jitterbugging thrown in. In his first film appearance, Hermes Pan can be seen as the clarinetist in the band (standing furthest back).John Franceschina, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire (Oxford University Press, 2012); * \\"Sweet Sue\\": Another Astaire (Hackett) and Meredith (Butterfield) mime routine, this time to a Victor Young standard. * \\"Love Of My Life\\": Johnny Mercer and Shaw wrote this song one day over lunch at Mercer's house, and when the excited Shaw wanted to show it to the studio, Mercer persuaded him to wait three weeks explaining: \\"If you tell them you just wrote it over lunch they won't think it's any good\\". It is delivered by Astaire to Goddard and garnered an Academy Award nomination for Best Song. * \\"Kamarinskaya\\": A brief comic number for Astaire, who plays a Russian doing a Moiseyev-style dance to the traditional Russian melody while singing a pseudo- Russian version of \\"Love Of My Life\\" in a thick accent. * \\"Poor Mr. Chisholm \\": Accompanying himself on the piano Astaire sings this folk-parody Mercer- Henighen number for Shaw's approval. * \\"Concerto for Clarinet\\": Like many jazzmen of his time - Benny Goodman, Paul Whiteman, Jimmy Dorsey and Duke Ellington among them - Shaw occasionally produced pieces with titles more commonly associated with classical music; Shaw, however was characteristically modest about this attractively episodic extended piece, composed especially for the film: \\"I never intended it for posterity ... It filled a spot in the picture\\". It features the string section - Shaw's \\"mice men\\" as he liked to call them, which he had just added to band - most famously in \\"Frenesi\\" - the year before. * \\"Hoe Down The Bayou/Poor Mr. Chisholm (dance)\\": Astaire \\"conducts\\" the band while performing a tap solo. The only number involving Astaire and Pan, possibly the most important choreographic collaboration in the history of filmed dance - was \\"Me And The Ghost Upstairs\\", which was cut from the final film, but is currently included in some regional DVD versions of the film. In it, Pan, shrouded in a sheet, creeps up on Astaire and begins to mimic him. The two then dance a riotous number involving Lindy lifts and jitterbugging. It is not really finished to Astaire's usual standards, and this, combined with the fact that the figure under the shroud is obviously male, wearing women's high heels, may have led to its deletion. Production In a 1968 interview, Astaire described this effort as \\"the worst film I ever made.\\" Astaire admitted that he was attracted to the film by the opportunity to \\"dance-conduct this real swingin' outfit\\". In an interview shortly before his death, Shaw admitted this film put him off acting. Astaire and Shaw shared a striking series of personality traits in common: an obsessive perfectionism and seemingly endless appetite for retakes, profound musicality and love of jazz, personal modesty and charm, and in a late interview Shaw expressed his opinion of Astaire: \\"Astaire really sweat - he toiled. He was a humorless Teutonic man, the opposite of his debonair image in top hat and tails. I liked him because he was an entertainer and an artist. There's a distinction between them. An artist is concerned only with what is acceptable to himself, where an entertainer strives to please the public. Astaire did both. Louis Armstrong was another one.\\"Interviewed in Fantle, Dave and Johnson, Tom. Reel to Real. Badger Books LLC, 2004, p.304.

The score for the song transcribed the Yiddish title as \\"'\\". The original Yiddish version of the song (in C minor) is a dialogue between two lovers. Five years after its 1932 composition, the song became a worldwide hit when recorded under a Germanized title as \\"'\\" by The Andrews Sisters in November 1937. Neil W. Levin, a scholar of Jewish music, has contended that \\"Bei Mir Bistu Shein\\" is \\"the world's best-known and longest-reigning Yiddish theater song of all time.\\" Echoing these sentiments, writer Stephen J. Whitfield has further posited that the song's popularity and influence in pre-war America epitomizes how \\"a minority [immigrant] culture\\" can transform the popular arts of a large democratic nation.  History = Yiddish original  Sholom Secunda was a cantor born in the Russian Empire in 1894. He immigrated to the United States as a boy in 1906. When composing tunes for Yiddish theater as a young man, Secunda purportedly spurned a youthful George Gershwin as a musical collaborator in favor of Jacob Jacobs, an \\"actor-director connected with the Parkway Theater.\\" Together, Secunda and lyricist Jacobs created \\"Bei Mir Bistu Shein\\" for a Yiddish operetta called I Would If I Could, written in 1932 by Abraham Blum. The plot of Blum's operetta was allegedly trite and underwhelming: The song itself featured only fleetingly in this original musical production and was performed as a lovers duet by Aaron Lebedeff and Lucy Levin. Nevertheless, the song became a well- known crowd-pleaser in Yiddish musical theater and at Jewish enclaves in the Catskills. It was a favorite among Jewish bandstands of the Second Avenue milieu. When I Would If I Could closed after one season, Secunda attempted to sell the publishing rights of the song. He flew by plane to California to sell the rights to the song to popular entertainer Eddie Cantor who demurred by saying: \\"I can't use it. It's too Jewish.\\" In dire financial straits, Secunda sold the rights in 1937 to the Kammen Music Company for a mere US $30, a modest sum which he split with his partner Jacobs. (In light of the later global success of the song, Secunda and Jacobs forfeited earning as much as $350,000 in royalties.)  English version  There are conflicting versions regarding the origins for the English version of the song. In one popular retelling, musician Sammy Cahn witnessed a spectacular performance of the song in Yiddish by African-American performers Johnnie and George at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York City. Jenny Grossinger, a Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel proprietor, claimed to have taught the song to Johnnie and George while they were performing at the resort. Upon seeing the enthusiastic audience response to the song, Cahn urged his employer to buy the rights so that he and frequent collaborator Saul Chaplin could rewrite the composition with English lyrics and alter the rhythm to be more typical of swing music. Cahn later was able to locate the sheet music in a Manhattan store in the Jewish Lower East Side. A competing origin story claims that bandleader Vic Schoen discovered Secunda's and Jacobs' catchy tune \\"in a collection of folk songs in a small shop in the lobby of a Yiddish theater on Second Avenue.\\" Schoen forwarded the memorable song to Lou Levy \\"who in turn gave it to Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin who wrote the lyrics for it.\\" Levy then persuaded the little-known Andrews Sisters to record the song as \\"Bei Mir Bist Du Sch√∂n\\" on November 24, 1937, for a flat fee of $50. The Andrews Sisters had initially attempted to record the song in Yiddish, but their Decca Records producer Jack Kapp stridently objected and insisted the trio record the song in American- vernacular English. Hitherto dismissed as mere imitators of the Boswell Sisters, the Andrews Sisters' cover of the Yiddish song ‚Äî \\"which the [three] girls harmonized to perfection\\" ‚Äî catapulted the relatively unknown trio to fame and became a tremendous hit for Kapp's Decca label. Within thirty days, a quarter of a million records had been sold, as well as two hundred thousand copies of the sheet music. Life magazine claimed that music stores were inundated by baffled customers trying to purchase a record which they misidentified as either \\"Buy a Beer, Mr. Shane,\\" or \\"My Mere Bits of Shame.\\"  Global phenomenon  The song quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Within thirty days of the Andrews Sisters' version of \\"Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen,\\" a number of other artists \\"recorded the songs in the hopes of cashing in on its popularity.\\" In December 1937, artists such as Belle Baker, Kate Smith, Benny Goodman (with Martha Tilton and Ziggy Elman), Ella Fitzgerald, the Barry Sisters, and Rudy Vall√©e, had all put out competing covers. Soon after, the song was featured in Hollywood films such as Love, Honor and Behave (1938) sung by ing√©nue Priscilla Lane, and Oscar Micheaux's American race film Swing (1938) sung by Cora Green. By the end of 1938‚Äîa mere year later‚ÄîGuy Lombardo, Greta Keller, Mieczyslaw Fogg, Slim Gaillard, Zarah Leander, Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, Eddie Rosner, Adrian Rollini,: \\"This was Rollini's final session at Decca and he used no clarinet this time. Bobby Hackett replaced McGhee; vocals were by Sonny Schuyler. 'Bei Mir Bist Du Sch√∂n' is one of Rollini's most swinging recordings.\\" Tommy Dorsey, and others had all recorded the song. From the 1940s to 1960s, additional covers were performed by a younger generation of artists which included Ramsey Lewis,Second Hand Songs - Medium: Ramsey Lewis and His Gentlemen of Swing - Ramsey Lewis and His Gentlemen of Swing Louis Prima (with Keely Smith), Dot Album Discography - Louis Prima and Keely Smith The Crew-Cuts, and June Christy.Capitol Records in the 2000 - 2499 series Over time, the song grossed approximately $3 million, with its original creators Secunda and Jacobs missing significant royalties. In February 1961, the copyright on the song expired, and the ownership reverted to Secunda and Jacobs, who signed a contract with Harms, Inc., securing proper royalties. That same year, Secunda and Jacobs developed a new musical around the song itself, eponymously titled Bay mir bistu sheyn. In the revamped 1961 musical, \\"a rabbi and his two sons and a matchmaker and his daughter. One of the rabbi's sons is in love with the matchmaker's daughter.\\" Their desired marriage eventually occurs, but not before the usual romantic misunderstandings and complexities. In his later years, shortly before his death, Secunda purportedly expressed dismay that he would be remembered solely for writing the song.  Other countries  Nazi Germany = In 1938, the song was a smash hit in Nazi Germany under its Germanized title \\"\\". According to contemporary journalist Michael Mok, the song was likewise immensely popular among the German diaspora in America where pro-Nazi sympathizers in Yorkville ale-houses often chorused the tune under the mistaken impression that it was \\"a Goebbels-approved\\" ballad. Initially assumed to be an uncontroversial song in a southern German dialect, an uproar occurred when its Jewish provenance was abruptly discovered and widely publicized by the press. Following this embarrassing discovery, as \\"any music by composers of Jewish ancestry was forbidden under the Nazi regime,\\" the song was promptly banned by state authorities in Germany. Later during World War II, an unusual exception to this ban occurred: Noticing that radio audiences wished to hear American jazz, the Nazis decided to exploit such music for their propaganda efforts. Accordingly, Charlie and his Orchestra ‚Äî a Nazi- sponsored German propaganda swing ensemble derisively nicknamed \\"Goebbels' band\\" ‚Äî recorded a state-approved anti-Semitic and anti-Bolshevik version of \\"Bei Mir Bist Du Sch√∂n.\\" This version was played by Nazi broadcasters in occupied countries. This Nazi propaganda version of the song was entitled \\"Anthem of the International Brotherhood of Bolsheviks\\" and has been credited by scholar √âlise Petit with increasing anti-Semitic sentiment amid the Holocaust. = Soviet Union = In 1943, a Russian-language song for the music was produced entitled \\"Baron von der Pshik\\" (\\"–ë–∞—Ä–æ–Ω —Ñ–æ–Ω –¥–µ—Ä –ü—à–∏–∫\\"). Presumably to avoid paying royalties, this version was falsely credited to a Soviet songwriter. It featured satirical anti-Nazi lyrics by Anatoli Fidrovsky, with music arrangement by Orest Kandat.Search results for \\"Kandat\\" at russian-records.com Initially it was recorded by the jazz orchestra (director Nikolay Minkh) of the Baltic Fleet Theatre, and later it was included into the repertoire of Leonid Utyosov's jazz orchestra.

While at the University of Oklahoma he helped win the 1985 NCAA National Championship. He also won the Lombardi Award in 1985 and was the 1985 UPI Lineman of the Year. Casillas was also part of the Dallas Cowboys back to back victories in Super Bowl XXVII and XXVIII, both against the Buffalo Bills. In 2004, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Early years Casillas was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on October 16, 1963. He attended Tulsa East Central High School where he was an All-State player. He had a difficult start to his college football career. As a redshirt freshman he suffered an ankle injury, contracted mononucleosis and was lost for the entire season. The next year, he played sparingly at defensive tackle, registering only 10 tackles. In 1984, Casillas was moved to nose guard and became a starter, receiving consensus All-American and first-team All-Conference honors. In 1985, he became only the second Sooner ever to win the Lombardi Award, which is given to the nation‚Äôs top lineman. He was named the UPI Lineman of the Year, the Big Eight Conference defensive player of the year, a consensus first team All-American and first team All-Conference. He ended his college career with 18 sacks and 213 career tackles in addition to graduating with Academic All-American honors in 1985, and a degree in public relations. In 2004, Casillas became the second Hispanic (his father is Mexican and his mother comes from Irish and Native American descent) to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The National Football Foundation named Casillas the College Defensive Player of the Decade for the 1980s. In 2008, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career=Atlanta Falcons Casillas was selected second overall in the 1986 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. The team was switching to a 3-4 defense, so they needed him to be their nose tackle, he responded by becoming a starter as a rookie and making 111 tackles and a sack. He also made the league's all-rookie team. The next year, he suffered a stress fracture of his left fibula and was placed on the injured reserve list. In the strike-shortened 1987 season, he played just nine games and had 72 tackles. During the 1988 preseason, he left camp for three weeks to get guidance from a psychologist, suffering he said, from the stress of playing in professional football. He returned to the team with a new attitude and in time to start the regular season, where he made 111 tackles and was named a Pro Bowl alternate. He exploded in 1989, becoming one of the best players at his position in the league with 152 tackles (still a team record for a defensive lineman) and was named second-team All-Pro and a Pro Bowl alternate. In 1990, he held out in a contract dispute from head coach Jerry Glanville's first Falcons training camp, causing him to lose his starting job to rookie Tory Epps. The problems escalated from there on, he eventually missed a 44-24 loss to the Los Angeles Rams after failing to catch the team flight. The Falcons suspended him for two weeks without pay. Between injuries and discipline incidents, he only played in nine games as a backup. At the start of the 1991 season, he announced he was retiring, so the Falcons traded him to the Dallas Cowboys for second, and eighth round draft choices in the 1992 NFL Draft. During his five-year span in Atlanta, Casillas had 478 tackles, the most ever by any Falcons defensive lineman and fourth best overall in franchise history. Dallas Cowboys (first stint) The Dallas Cowboys welcomed Casillas to training camp with the news that he would play left tackle in a 4-3 defense where the No. 1 overall draft pick Russell Maryland was also going to play. He eventually won the starting spot and became part of the best defense and the best defensive-line rotation in the NFL. His career was revived in Dallas as a specialist at stopping the run. He also was a part of back to back victories in Super Bowl XXVII and XXVIII against the Buffalo Bills two years in a row. Casillas left the team via free agency to join the Kansas City Chiefs for the 1994 season. Kansas City Chiefs He immediately started having problems with the Kansas City Chiefs in mini-camp, practicing only sporadically, saying that he had a problem with high blood pressure. On the eve of training camp, he told coach Marty Schottenheimer he was concerned about his health. Eventually, the Chiefs released him, forcing him to return his signing bonus. Their general manager, Carl Peterson, asked the league to investigate whether the Cowboys had tampered, after the Cowboys hired Barry Switzer (Casillas's former coach at Oklahoma). As part of Casillas's release from the Chiefs, he agreed that he would not sign in 1994 with any of the other AFC West divisional rivals or with the Dallas Cowboys. New York Jets In 1994, he signed with the New York Jets after a bizarre spring and summer in which he practiced only sporadically in minicamp with the Chiefs and was eventually released by the team. In the two years he spent with the team, he dealt with injuries that caused him to only start 16 games. He was waived on March 2, 1996. Dallas Cowboys (second stint) Casillas rejoined the Dallas Cowboys in a reserve role for the 1996 season, which was the only season in his career where he failed to record a sack. In 1997, he started 14 games in place of a suspended Leon Lett, matching his career high total of 3 sacks. He retired from professional football on February 25, 1998, after playing in the NFL for 12 seasons. Personal life Casillas was the host of \\"Casillas & Company\\"/\\"Casillas & Zack,\\" a sports talk show on Oklahoma City radio station 107.7 The Franchise KRXO from August 2013 until his departure from the station in November 2014.

The church's headquarters are at Zion City Moria in Limpopo Province, South Africa (Northern Transvaal). According to the 1996 South African Census, the church numbered 3.87 million members. By the 2001 South African Census, its membership had increased to 4.97 million members. The final number of ZCC members is most likely between 11 and 15 million, in total, according to figures provided by Neal Collins from The New Age and Alex Matlala from The Citizen. History After being educated at two Anglican missions, Engenas Lekganyane joined the Apostolic Faith Mission in Boksburg. He then joined the Zion Apostolic Church schism and eventually became a preacher of a congregation in his home village during late World War I.Lukhaimane, The Zion Christian Church of Ignatius Engenas Lekganyane, 1924 to 1948: An African Experiment with Christianity (MA Dissertation, University of the North, 1980), 15‚Äì22. After falling out with the ZAC leadership, Lekganyane went to Basutoland to join Edward Lion's Zion Apostolic Faith Mission\\"Who Was Engenas Lekganyane/\\" http://deanministries.page.tl/Who-Was-Engenas-Lekganyane.htm The ZCC was founded by Engenas Lekganyane after a revelation which Lekganyane is said to have received from God on the top of Mt Thabakgone, in 1924. Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 107 Lukhaimane, \\"Zion Christian Church,\\" 23-4. After splitting from Lion, Lekganyane used his home village of Thabakgone, near Polokwane (Pietersburg), as the headquarters, with about twenty initial congregations in the Northern Transvaal, the Witwatersrand, and Rhodesia. In 1930 Lekganyane began building a stone church there. After clashes with his chief, Lekganyane was expelled with his church still unfinished. Determined to obtain land, he eventually purchased three farms in the Polokwane area. Maclean Farm near Thabakgone would eventually be renamed as \\"Moria\\", the ZCC's headquarters. The ZCC was officially registered in 1962 after the government's reluctance to recognise one of the continent's largest and most influential churches. The early church was strongly influenced by the doctrines of the Christian Catholic Church of John Alexander Dowie, based in Zion, Illinois, in the United States of America, and by the teachings of the Pentecostal missionary John G. Lake, who began work in Johannesburg in 1908. Due to Lekganyane's attempts to appeal to migrant workers, the ZCC developed an international membership very early on which went on to set up many congregations in neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe. In the late 1930s migrant workers from Botswana also started ZCC chapters, although they faced considerable opposition from the authorities.6.Jump up ^ https://www.academia.edu/14338013/Engenas_Lekganyane_and_the_Early_ZCC_Oral_Texts_and_Documents Following Engenas Lekganyane's death in 1948, a major split in the church occurred. The church's large section of male migrant workers generally backed Engenas's oldest surviving son, the charismatic Edward Lekganyane, to succeed his father as the ZCC Bishop. The church's rural base, meanwhile, backed a younger son, Joseph, to assume church leadership. Although events are highly disputed, Engenas himself appears to have favoured Joseph ‚Äî who served as his father's adviser and chauffeur during the 1940s. According to some traditions, during Engenas Lekganyane's mourning period, Edward's supporters mobilised on the Witwatersrand and hired buses to take them to Moria. After arrival, this large, armed group was able to eject the pro-Joseph faction and take over the church's headquarters and infrastructure.Lukhaimane, \\"Zion Christian Church,\\" 98‚Äì101. Contemporary records relating to the event show that Edward was installed peacefully in Easter 1949 in a large ceremony by his uncle, Reuben. Other written reports from the following year indicate that strong opposition to his leadership had arisen among \\"most of the preachers\\" in the ZCC who were \\"shocked\\" by Edward: \\"they denied the son of the great Lekganyane, saying he was not leader of the church.\\"\\"Edward Lekganyane and the ZCC: Newspaper Articles in Naledi Ya Batswana,\\" 3‚Äì5. https://www.academia.edu/35243058/Edward_Lekganyane_and_the_ZCC_Newspaper_Articles_in_Naledi_ya_Batswana_1946-60Initially the two factions remained together, but Edward soon insisted that all members declare their loyalty in public, and this led to a permanent split. The ZCC continued under Edward's leadership, while Joseph seceded and formed the St. Engenas Zion Christian Church in 1949. The ZCC changed fairly dramatically following his son Edward Lekganyane's assumption of control of the church in April 1949. Edward was a highly educated, flamboyant figure who eventually obtained a degree at an Afrikaans divinity school.Hanekom, C., 1975. Krisis en Kultus : Geloofsopvattinge en seremonies binne 'n Swart Kerk, Academica: Kaapstad en Pretoria Under his leadership the all-male Mokhukhu organisation developed out of his core group of supporters. This group initially formed as a church choir. Wearing military-style khakis, police-style hats, and the Star badge, the Mokhukhu in each congregation engaged in dancing, singing, and praying three times a week according to a preset schedule.M. Ramogale and S. Galane, \\"Faith in Action: Mokhukhu of the Zion Christian Church.\\" http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/festival1997/faithin.htm An additional feature of Edward's control of the ZCC was the rapid growth of Zion City Moria as a pilgrimage site. Using the Boyne farm that his father had purchased in the 1940s, Edward instituted annual pilgrimages that have gone on to become massive southern African-wide events. Each year during Easter Holidays Church members bus en masse to Moria, Polokwane (Pietersburg) (several million members) to meet the Bishop and to pray for blessings.R. Muller, African Pilgrimage: Ritual Travel in South Africa's Christianity of Zion. London: Ashgate Press, 2013. Characteristics The church fuses African traditions and values with Christian faith. As opposed to the mainstream European churches, the church has sought independence and autonomy in terms of theological and dogmatic approach. According to the ZCC, scholars such as EK Lukhaimane, Hanekom, Kruger, Sundkler and Daneel did not understand the ZCC's approach to Christianity. Due to the apartheid education system in which Africans and their beliefs were rejected and mocked, they saw ZCC as a sect. This situation was exacerbated by the church's policy on secrecy, which limited its ability to publicise its activities. As a result, the ZCC maintains that much writing about it is inaccurate. The church still believes in prophecy, the power of healing and spiritual counselling, which did not resonate with the scientific perspectives of these academics. Instead of attempting to understand any therapeutic value these practices might hold, they dismissed them as mere superstitious rituals. The use of different mechanisms for faith-healing include the laying-on of hands, the use of holy water, drinking of blessed tea and coffee to the point of vomiting in the belief that it cleanses the drinkers from the bad spirits that reside in their stomachs and the wearing of blessed cords or cloth. *The colours of the church are green and yellow. Church uniforms differ according to the state and gender of members and occasions. Men wear khakis for dancing and green suits for church services. Young women wear blue for church services and khaki for choir practices. Elder women wear green and yellow regalia for church services. *As part of their everyday clothing, many ZCC members wear a badge or lapel pin, consisting of a swatch of green cloth and a metallic badge indicating the branch of the church to which they belong. *Because the church preaches the message of peace, they start their greetings with the words \\"kgotsong\\" or \\"kgotso a e be le lena/kgotso e be le lena\\" meaning \\"peace be unto you.\\" ZCC is about peace and respect and the love of God. *Women do not take part in Sunday service preaching. They, especially in ZCC Star, are allowed to preach during the women's services held every Wednesday. Members of the ZCC generally believe that: * A person is saved through baptism in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Christian Bible, Matt 28:19), by dipping him/her in water 3 times. * ZCC members pray to God in the name of Jesus Christ. Lekganyane is the leader. * Redemption is obtained through confession, repentance and prayer. * The bishop and ministers of the ZCC preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ as laid out in the bible. * The ZCC Church members have a strong belief in Prophets and Prophecies.

The Illyrian movement (, ) was a pan-South-Slavist cultural and political campaign with roots in the early modern period, and revived by a group of young Croatian intellectuals during the first half of the 19th century, around the years of 1835‚Äì1863 (there is some disagreement regarding the official dates from 1835 to 1870).Despalatovic, Elinor Murray. Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement. New York: East European Quarterly, 1975. This movement aimed to create a Croatian national establishment in Austria-Hungary through linguistic and ethnic unity, and through it lay the foundation for cultural and linguistic unification of all South Slavs under the revived umbrella term Illyrian. Aspects of the movement pertaining to the development of Croatian culture are considered in Croatian historiography to be part of the Croatian national revival (Hrvatski narodni preporod). Name In the 19th century, the name Illyrian was chosen by the members of the movement as a reference to the theory according to which South Slavs descend from ancient Illyrians. Fearing provincial particularism, reformers believed that the Illyrian name would make it easier to implement literary unity. Historical context In 19th-century Europe, liberalism and nationalism were ideologies which came to the forefront of political culture. In Central Europe, where the Habsburg Empire had long asserted control over a variety of ethnic and cultural groups, nationalism appeared in a standard format. The beginning of the 19th century \\"was the period when the smaller, mostly Slavic nationalities of the empire ‚Äì Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs ‚Äì remembered their historical traditions, revived their native languages as literary languages, reappropriated their traditions and folklore, in short reasserted their existence as nations.\\"Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions, 1848‚Äì1851. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. page 99. This revival of national heritage encompasses the Illyrian Movement in Croatia. In 1813, the bishop of Zagreb, Maksimilijan Vrhovac, issued a plea for the collection of \\"national treasures\\" (Poziv na sve duhovne pastire svoje biskupije), thereby heralding the national revival movement. Influenced by his father Josip, who was the first mayor in French controlled Karlovac and one of its first Freemasons, Juraj ≈†porer attempted to publish the first newspaper in the Illyrian language (). His project was aborted because of the complete lack of interest for a newspaper published in his native language. Just as Croatia felt nationalistic stirrings at this time, so did its larger neighbors, Hungary and Austria. Croats were uneasy with rising Hungarian nationalism, which pursued reduction of the Croatian autonomy and increased Magyarization. In order to preserve their autonomy, Croats pursued a deepening of their culture and a revival of their heritage. Members of the Illyrian movement were heavily influenced by the 1700 publication Croatia Rediviva.≈†i≈°iƒá, Hrvatska Historiografija pp. 46 In the beginning of the 1830s, a group of young Croatian writers initially led by Ljudevit Gaj gathered in Zagreb and established a movement for national renewal and unity of all South Slavs within the Habsburg Monarchy. The city of Zagreb had become an important center of political, economic, and cultural activity, so it was the center of the movement. Count Janko Dra≈°koviƒá published his Dissertation in 1832, a pamphlet that later came to be considered the political, economic, social and cultural program of the movement, as it promoted the native language as official, more autonomy from central government, and better education and enlightenment for the common people. Gaj served as the leader of the movement as a whole in the beginning for eight or nine years, at which point the leadership changed hands.Despalatovic, Elinor Murray. Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement. New York: East European Quarlerly, 1975 The greatest issue for Illyrians was the establishment of a standard language as a counter-weight to Hungarian, and the promotion of Croatian written literature and official culture. Illyrians envisioned a single literary language and orthography to serve as a means of cultural and national unification, paving the way for a general national revival. Illyrian language conceptions In 1830 Ljudevit Gaj published Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskoga pravopisanja (\\"Brief basics of the Croatian-Slavic orthography\\"), which was the first linguistic work to be published during the movement. In it he presented his proposal for a reform of the Illyrian alphabet, which included the introduction of diacritics. This was motivated by the alphabets of other Slavic peoples who wrote in the Latin script (Czechs, Slovaks and Poles), as well as by earlier domestic practices such as the alphabet used by Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá. After Vitezoviƒá's letters lÃÉ and √± Gaj introduced tilde as a diacritic in the letters cÃÉ, zÃÉ, sÃÉ, lÃÉ, √±, dÃÉ and gÃÉ. However, for tactical reasons that notation has not been thoroughly applied. Even though the alphabetic reform was originally intended for the speakers of the Kajkavian dialect, in his work Gaj put forward the idea of a common alphabet for all South Slavs using Latin script, which would lay the foundation for the common literary language. In 1835 Gaj started publishing Novine Horvatzke (\\"Croatian newspapers\\") and Danicza Horvatzka, Slavonzka i Dalmatinzka in Kajkavian and using old Kajkavian alphabet. But since the very beginning Gaj's magazines also contained pieces from older ≈†tokavian literature, namely Dubrovnikan, to pave the way for the introduction of a common literary language on ≈†tokavian basis. The tenth issue of his Danicza is already using the new alphabet and ≈†tokavian in some of the published pieces, and since the 29th issue the new alphabet is dominant. On December 5, 1835 Gaj published a Proclamation announcing the publication of Ilirske narodne novine (\\"Illyrian folk newspapers\\") and Danica ilirska, abandoning old alphabet and introducing the ≈†tokavian dialect. The terminological shift from \\"Croatian\\" to \\"Illyrian\\" more accurately reflected the ideological goals of the Illyrian movement, as well as the usage of the ≈†tokavian dialect which was at that period the most widely spoken dialect. Illyrians' goal was to make that language more accessible to the Kajkavian and ƒåakavian speakers. In that spirit, Gaj's 1835 Proclamation states: Beside the fundamental Illyirian ethnological notion of South Slavs as the descendants of ancient Illyrians, awareness of national distinctiveness was also present. Thus Gaj writes in 1839 in Danica: \\"Our intention is not to abolish individual names, but unify them under a general name, because each of the individual names carries its own individual history, which gathered together comprise a more general history of the Illyrian nation.\\"In original: Namƒõra na≈°a nije posebna imena ukinuti, nego ih samo pod skupnim imenom sjediniti, jer su sa svakim posebnim imenom skopƒçani posebni dogaƒëaji koji skupljeni ƒçine dogodov≈°tinu obƒáenite narodnosti ilirske. In an attempt to overcome regional fragmentation and achieve unification, followers of the movement promote Illyrian name, making concessions in language and orthography. Drawing on existing literary traditions in three different dialects, and in an attempt to ease the linguistic and cultural unification, Illyrians advocate the usage of some archaic forms in grammar, and some Kajkavian and ƒåakavian words. Such changes were hoped to be acceptable to everyone using the Illyrian language. Orthography and alphabet Acting on the intention of Illyrians to create a common literary language and orthography for all South Slavs, Gaj in his 1835 article Pravopisz abandons his original alphabet. Of letters with diacritics, only the letters ƒç, ≈æ, ≈° and ƒõ are retained.ƒõ was used to mark any of the possible reflexes of the Proto-Slavic yat sound. Due to printing difficulties, carons are used instead of tildes. Digraphs ljÃÅ, njÃÅ, djÃÅ and d≈æ are used instead of the former lÃÉ, √±, dÃÉ and gÃÉ, while what is today's ƒá is written as both ƒá and tjÃÅ. Letter jÃÅ is soon replaced by j. Digraphs with j were already known from Slavonian alphabet, which was the most widespread alphabet in pre-Illyrian times. The alphabet system introduced by Gaj was used until the late 19th century, when ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá finally introduced the letter ƒë for dj, and generalized the usage of ƒá, yielding the modern Croatian alphabet. With respect to a set of orthographic issues, Illyrians endorsed the so-called etymological (also called morphonological) orthography, spelling words according to their morphology and etymology. This was opposed to the contemporary phonological orthography \\"write as you speak, and speak as you write\\"In original: Pi≈°i kao ≈°to govori≈°, a ƒçitaj kako je napisano! advocated by Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá and his followers. Illyrians justified such spellings as being more comprehensible, easier to learn, and reflecting the orthographic practices of other Slavic peoples. They pitted Karad≈æiƒá's adage against their own: \\"speak for the ears, write for the eyes\\".In original: Govori za u≈°i, a pi≈°i za oƒçi! Language characteristics Gaj's main associates and followers were Vjekoslav Babukiƒá and Antun Ma≈æuraniƒá. In their linguistic manuals (Babukiƒá's 1836 Osnova slovnice slavjanske narƒõƒçja ilirskoga \\"The basics of Slavic grammar of the Illyrian dialect\\", extended edition as 1854 Slovnica ilirska \\"Illyrian grammar\\"; Ma≈æuraniƒá's 1839 Temelji ilirskoga i latinskoga jezika \\"The foundation of the Illyrian and Latin language\\") they were led by the ideological goals of the Illyrian movement, building upon the language supported by the movement's adherents, and which was later advocated by the so-called Zagreb Philological School. Two of the most important grammatical traits advocated by Illyrians were old inflectional endings for the dative, locative and instrumental plural of nouns, as well as the ending -ah in genitive plural of nouns, which earned them a derisive nickname \\"Ahavians\\" (ahavci). For example: * genitive plural: momakah, kraljah, selah, poljah, ≈æenah, kostih * dative plural: momkom, kraljem, selom, poljem, ≈æenam, kostim * locative plural: momcih, kraljih, selih, poljih, ≈æenah, kastih * instrumental plural: momci, kralji, seli, polji, ≈æenami, kostmi A different set of issues were involved in writing reflexes of the Proto-Slavic yat sound, as well as the syllabic /r/. All of the possible yat reflexes (i, e, je or ije, depending on the dialect) were covered by the letter ƒõ, which was derisively called \\"horned e\\" (rogato e). Initially it was suggested that everyone reads ƒõ according to their local pronunciation, though it would be preferable to publicly pronounce it as [je] or [ije]Babukiƒá 1836: \\"u ƒçitanju priuƒçavati se ilirski ƒõ razlo≈æno kao je izgovarati\\"Ma≈æuraniƒá 1839: \\"u ƒçitanju i u ≈°kolah ... kano i√© ili je izgovarati ga\\" For syllabic /r/ they were convinced that the pronunciation differs from non-syllabic /r/, so they introduced spelling of the accompanying vowel as well (√†r, √®r: e.g. k√†rv, d√®rvo). Impact As opposed to the alphabet which is in a slightly modified form used to this day for Croatian, grammatical and orthographic practices advocated by Illyrians provoked resentment and opposition by some contemporaries as well as by future generations of linguists. Illyrians were criticized from different points of view, and their practices were attacked more often individually rather than as a system, and had a different lifespan, eventually suffering the same fate: disappearance from the language. The so- called etymological orthography survived the longest, until the turn of the century. Cultural development The most influential writers within the movement were Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá and Petar Preradoviƒá.Eterovich, Francis H. and Christopher Spalatin, ed. Croatia: Land, People, Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964. Ma≈æuraniƒá contributed his epic Smrt Smail-age ƒåengiƒáa during this time, and Preradoviƒá published love lyrics. Other notable literary contributions were made by Antun Mihanoviƒá (notably Horvatska Domovina which later became Our Beautiful Homeland), Stanko Vraz (satiric lyrics), Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá (romantic lyrics), Dimitrija Demeter (prose, notably Grobniƒçko polje, and drama), Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski (prose), Antun Nemƒçiƒá (prose and itineraries). There was also the first notable itinerary Pogled u Bosnu by Matija Ma≈æuraniƒá. After the government allowed the publishing of newspapers in Croatian in 1834, the Gaj issued the first Croatian newspaper, \\"Novine hrvatsko-slavonsko-dalmatinske\\", in 1835, establishing Croatian journalism. The paper was edited by Ljudevit Gaj and it also had a literary magazine \\"Danica\\" attached, both of which printed in Gaj's \\"National print\\" (Narodna tiskara). Each issue of Danica began with the motto \\"people without a nation/Is like a body without bones.\\"Despalatoviƒá, Elinor Murray. Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement. East European Quarterly, 1975. These literary successes \\"ultimately won intellectual, linguistic, and educational...independence for Croatia.\\"Eterovich, Francis H. and Christopher Spalatin, ed. Croatia: Land, People, Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964. page 245. In 1836, the papers were renamed to use the Illyrian name (Ilirske novine, Danica ilirska). In 1838, Janko Dra≈°koviƒá helped found a reading room in Zagreb which served as a meeting place for the first \\"Illyrians\\". In another cultural success, in 1846 the composer Vatroslav Lisinski wrote the first opera in Croatian, \\"Ljubav i zloba\\" (Love and malice). The Illyrian movement, while concentrating on Croatian lands, was quite nationally inclusive, as it included many non-Croats. For example, Petar Preradoviƒá was an ethnic Serb, as was Josif Runjanin, Stanko Vraz was an ethnic Slovene, and Dimitrija Demetar was either ethnic Greek or Aromanian. Struggles In 1840, the Illyrian movement suffered an internal setback when Stanko Vraz, Joakim Rakovac and Ljudevit Vukotinoviƒá split off from the movement due to creative differences in poetry. In 1842 they started publishing their own literary newspaper named Kolo. Political disputes in the Croatian Sabor were so fierce they caused unrest in the streets of Zagreb. On July 29, 1845, violent clashes erupted at St. Marko's Square, the casualties of which were to become known as the \\"July victims\\". Notwithstanding these events, Hungarian officials were unable to crush the movement. Leaflet praising the Sabor of the Triune Kingdom for elevating the \\"people's language\\" to the \\"honor of diplomacy\\". Speaking in front of the Sabor on 23 October 1847, Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski advocated Croatian as the official language instead of Latin and the deputies subsequently voted unanimously in favor of said proposition. The movement practically ceased to exist due to the Revolutions of 1848. In 1849, the Emperor Francis Joseph imposed a new constitution, all political dissent was censored, and the Danica went out of print. Aftermath Vlaho Bukovac: Hrvatski narodni preporod, Curtain at HNK in Zagreb The movement's plea for unity among the Slavs, particularly South Slavs, also found supporters among prominent Serbs of the time, most notably Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá, the reformer of Serbian language. Ljudevit Gaj had, in fact, appealed to Serbia (along with Dalmatia and Russia) for moral and financial support given their ethnic and cultural connections. In 1850, a small group of Illyrian and Serbian representatives signed the \\"Vienna agreement\\" which in effect proclaimed the southern Shtokavian dialect to be the standard, common language of Serbs and Croats, with Serbian Cyrillic and Croatian Latin alphabet as equal letters. The agreement was the basis of standardizing the Serbo-Croatian language. Assessment and criticism The Illyrian movement was the first and most prominent Pan-Slavic movement in Croatian history. The Illyrian movement was successful in its goals for culture. \\"Where there was no precedent for nineteenth-century concepts like Czechoslovak or Illyrian nationhood these projects failed. Nationalism took hold insofar as it built on existing realities, historical, linguistic or social.\\"Ingrao, Charles W. The Habsburg Monarchy 1618‚Äì1815. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. page 110. The period of the Illyrian movement is today referred to as the \\"Croatian national revival\\". The movement formed the basis for a common Serbo-Croatian language, and it fostered support in Croatia for its ultimate goal of creating an Illyrian state, but the movement itself had failed to achieve that goal. Increasing Croatian nationalism shifted towards pan-Slavic ideals because the Croatian identity superseded the \\"Illyrian\\" hopes.

Characterized by their elongated maxillae, they were herbivorous and typically large in size. This family exhibited locomotive dynamism; there exists evidence for both bipedalism and quadrupedalism within iguanodontid species, supporting the idea that individual organisms were capable of both locomoting exclusively with their hind limbs and locomoting quadrupedally. Iguanodontids possess hoof-like second, third, and fourth digits, and in some cases, a specialized thumb spike and an opposable fifth digit. Their skull construction allows for a strong chewing mechanism called a transverse power stroke. This, paired with their bilateral dental occlusion, made them extremely effective as herbivores. Members of Iguanodontidae are thought to have had a diet that consisted of both gymnosperms and angiosperms, the latter of which co-evolved with the iguanodontids in the Cretaceous period. There is no consensus on the phylogeny of the group. Iguanodontidae is most frequently characterized as paraphyletic with respect to Hadrosauridae, although some researchers advocate for a monophyletic view of the family. Description=Skull and Mandible  The upper surface of a typical iguanodontid skull has a convex curve that extends from the snout to just past the orbit, where the skull flattens out to form a roughly level plane directly above the braincase. The antorbital fenestra, an opening in the skull anterior to the eye sockets, is reduced in size in iguanodontids. Their maxillae are roughly triangular, fairly flat, and sport thickened bony walls. An elongated maxilla is characteristic of the family. Iguanodontid dentaries are very long as well, and become increasingly thick towards the back of the skull. A pair of bony processes extending from the maxilla insert into the jugal and lacrimal, respectively. The iguanodontid jugal has particularly deep crevices that serve to mediate this contact. The lacrimal process constitutes the rostral margin of the reduced antorbital fenestra. Teeth Iguanodontids are generally limited to the possession of single replacement tooth at each position, although exceptions exist. The most primitive example bears positions for 13 maxillary and 14 dentary teeth. More derived forms have a larger number of positions per row. For example, I. bernissartensis is able to accommodate up to 29 maxillary and 25 dentary teeth. Iguanodontids exhibit contact between maxillary and dentary teeth upon closure of the jaw. They have a thick layer of enamel over the lip-facing (labial) surface of the crown, a robust primary ridge beginning at the base of the crown, and a denticulate margin. Most members of the family have maxillary tooth crowns lanceolate in shape. The labial surface of the teeth has some grooves, while the tongue-facing (lingual) surface is smooth. Iguanodontids have lost their premaxillary teeth. Manus and Pes Iguanodon hand with spike The second, third, and fourth digits of the iguanodontid forelimb are close together. In some cases, it is possible that digits three and four were bound into a single structure by layers of skin, a specialized adaptation for quadruped locomotion. In addition, the wrist bones are fused into a block, and the thumb bones are fused into a spike-like point. In Iguanodon, the fifth digit is long, flexible, and opposable. On the hind limb, digits two, three, and four are wide and short, with blunt claws that resemble hooves. Body All of the cervical vertebrae have ribs attached. The initial set are linear; the rest are two-headed. Tendons along the neural arches were ossified, limiting mobility in the backbone in exchange for reinforcement. A similar ossification is seen in the tail. Iguanodontids have a rod-shaped pubis that extends parallel to the ischium. The paired sternal bones are often hatchet- shaped. The humerus has a shallow curve, in contrast to the straight ulna and radius. The ilium is thinner at the anterior end than it is at the posterior. Evidence suggests that these dinosaurs do not have plated, armored skin. Classification In the past, Iguanodontidae became a waste-basket for any ornithopod that did not belong in either Camptosauridae, Hadrosauridae, or the now defunct Hypsilophodontidae. A number of studies suggest that Iguanodontidae as traditionally defined is paraphyletic with respect to Hadrosauridae. That is, iguanodontids represent successive steps in the acquisition of advanced hadrosaurian characteristics, and in this view cannot be defined as a single distinct clade. Nevertheless, some researchers have found support for a monophyletic Iguanodontidae consisting of a handful of genera.Godefroit P, Escuilli√© F, Bolotsky YL, Lauters P. 2012. A new basal hadrosauroid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Kazakhstan. In: Godefroit P, ed. Bernissart dinosaurs and Early Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 335‚Äì358. Some other studies, however, fail to recover the group. The left cladogram was recovered in a 2015 analysis that supports a monophyletic Iguanodontidae, whereas the right cladogram from 2012 study finds the group to be paraphyletic: { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\" align=\\"left\\" width=\\"100%\\"align=\\"right\\" width=\\"50%\\"  } Palaeobiology=Locomotion Mantellisaurus in quadrupedal posture Fossilized footprints provide evidence for both quadrupedality and bipedality within iguanodontids. It is thought that iguanodontids were primarily quadrupedal but could optionally walk on two limbs. The ossification of tendons along the neural arches may have played a role in facilitating the dynamic pedality of iguanodontids, as the ossified tendons could help withstand the additional stress incurred on the backbone by standing upright. Some research suggests that organism size plays a role in the determination of pedality, where larger organisms are more likely to choose to walk on all fours than their smaller counterparts. Diet Iguanodontids are low-browsing herbivores that fed extensively on gymnosperms like ferns and horsetails, especially during the early Cretaceous period. These dinosaurs were very effective as herbivores due in part to their combination of bilateral dental occlusion with the transverse power stroke of their chewing mechanism. Additionally, iguanodontids lack a rigid secondary palate, which helps to mitigate torsional stresses during occlusion, a feature that enhanced their ability to break down plant matter. Additionally, the iguanodontids co-evolved with the radiation of angiosperms in the Cretaceous period. Angiosperms typically develop more rapidly and lower to the ground than gymnosperms; their proliferation provided a wealth of easily accessible food for the members of Iguanodontidae.

Sebald Beham (1500‚Äì1550) was a German painter and printmaker, mainly known for his very small engravings. Born in Nuremberg, he spent the later part of his career in Frankfurt. He was one of the most important of the \\"Little Masters\\", the group of German artists making prints in the generation after D√ºrer. His name is often given as Hans Sebald Beham, although there is no documentary evidence that he ever used this additional forename. He produced approximately 252 engravings, 18 etchings and 1500 woodcuts, including woodcut book illustrations. He worked extensively on tiny, highly detailed, engravings, many as small as postage stamps, placing him in the German printmaking school known as the \\"Little Masters\\" from the size of their prints. These works he printed and published himself, while his much larger woodcuts were mostly commissioned work. The engravings found a ready market among German bourgeois collectors. He also made prints for use as playing cards and wallpaper. His engravings cover a range of subjects, but he is especially known for scenes of peasant life, and scenes from classical myth or history, both often with an erotic element. His early work was done under the shadow of D√ºrer, who was still working in Nuremberg, and one early woodcut \\"Head of Christ\\", to which the \\"AD\\" monogram was added in the second state (though probably not by Beham), was long misattributed to D√ºrer by Adam Bartsch and others. He also borrowed from his brother Barthel's rather more original works. In his later work he boldly re-interpreted many of D√ºrer's most famous prints in works such as his Melancholia of 1539, exploiting the difference in scale between his work and the original. His dark backgrounds may have been inspired by Italian Niello prints.  Life  Charitatis, undated but with the early monogram 'HSP' Beham was born in Nuremberg. Nothing is known of his parents. His brother Bartel Beham, two years his junior, was also an artist. His training is undocumented. In 1521 he is recorded as a Malergeselle (\\"journeyman painter\\"), and by 1525 he was master of his own workshop in Nuremberg. In January 1525, along with his brother and Georg Pencz, he was banished from Nuremberg, accused of heresy, blasphemy and not recognising the authority of the City council. The three thus became known as \\"godless painters\\". The accusations against Beham were connected with his Lutheran beliefs, the city authorities then being Catholic, although they adopted Lutheranism as the city's official religion only two months later. The three artists were soon allowed to return to Nuremberg, but in 1528 Beham hurriedly left the city once more, following the threat of legal action over his treatise on the proportions of the horse which was regarded as having been plagiarised from an unpublished manuscript by Albrecht D√ºrer, who had recently died. He then spent time working in various German cities; his woodcuts were published at Ingolstadt between 1527 and 1530, and in the latter year he was in Munich, where he recorded the triumphal entry of Emperor Charles V in a woodcut entitled The Military Display, 10 June 1530. He lived mostly in Frankfurt from 1532, becoming a citizen there in 1540, and remaining until his death ten years later. Until about 1532 his prints were monogrammed 'HSP', reflecting the Nuremberg pronunciation of his surname: Peham. After this date, by which time he had established himself in Frankfurt, his monogram became \\"HSB\\". This monogram has often led to his name being given as \\"Hans Sebald Beham\\", but there is no documentary evidence for this additional forename, the \\"H\\" in the monogram probably representing the second syllable of his surname. He is known to have married twice. A pair of models for medals, designed by Matthes Gebel and dating from 1540, shows Beham and his wife Anna. In 1549, by then a widower, Beham married Elizabeth Wolf, the daughter of a shoemaker from B√ºdingen. He is not to be confused with his contemporary Hans Beham (or Behem or B√∂hm), also of Nuremberg, who cast the \\"Sigismund\\" bell (Zygmunt) at the Wawel castle in Poland for the Sigismund I the Old.Guss-im-wandel-der-zeit.de  Other work  Death and the Standing Nude, 1547, 75 x 48 mm Beham is best known as a prolific printmaker, but also painted, designed stained glass, and wrote two successful illustrated books, manuals for artists. Paintings He is known to have designed stained glass in Nuremberg. His only known panel painting, however, is a tabletop painted with scenes from the life of King David, now in the Louvre. This was done following his move to Frankfurt, for Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg. He also painted miniatures for a prayer-book for Albrecht, now in the collection of the Hofbibliothek, Ashaffenburg. Some coats of arms, painted on vellum for newly ennobled patrons, survive in the city archives in Frankfurt. Artists' manuals The book on the proportions of the horse, for which he was briefly exiled in 1528 following accusations of plagiarism, was an artists' manual, which he later followed with one on the human figure. These publications were simplified borrowings of D√ºrer's works on the subjects, but rather easier to use (and cheaper), and thus had a long- lasting success.

He was a three-year starter at Arizona State University from 1980 to 1982. In 1981, he earned honorable mention All-Pac-10 honors. In 1982, he became the catalyst of the Sun Devils' No. 1 ranked defense (228.9 yards/game). He collected 95 tackles, four sacks, four pass deflections, and forced two fumbles during his senior season, where he earned All-Pac-10, honorable-mention to the All-American Associated Press and Sporting News teams. He played in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game and in the Senior Bowl. On October 22, 1994, he was inducted into the Arizona State Hall of Fame, as arguably one of the greatest defensive linemen to wear a Sun Devil uniform, finishing with 20 career sacks. He also was inducted into the Arizona State Football Ring of Honor and the Fiesta Bowl Hall of Fame, after dominating a 1983 Fiesta Bowl victory, earning defensive player of the game in a 32‚Äì21 win over University of Oklahoma. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys He was selected in the first round (23rd overall) of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He was also selected by the Arizona Wranglers in the 1983 USFL Territorial Draft. He was a backup defensive end as a rookie. In 1984, he replaced Harvey Martin at the right defensive end position, registering 82 tackles to go along with 11.5 sacks, ranking second on the team and in the top 15 among sack league leaders. In 1985, he was second on the team with 12 sacks and in the top ten among league leaders. His most memorable game was against the Washington Redskins on November 10, 1985, when he tallied 11 tackles and sacked quarterback Joe Theismann a franchise record 5 times, tying Bob Lilly‚Äôs 19-year-old mark. Against the New York Giants, he intercepted a Phil Simms pass that was batted down by Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown, making a critical play in a win that helped clinched the NFC East title. In 1986, he led the team with a career- high 14 sacks (seventh among league leaders). Jeffcoat maintained a high level of play through the Cowboys difficult years of the late '80s. His best season came in 1989, when he finished with a career-high 100 tackles, a career-high 42 quarterback pressures, 11.5 sacks (led team and top 12 among league leaders) and a career-high three fumble recoveries. During the 1992 season his role was reduced to a situational pass-rusher, after Tony Tolbert took over the left defensive end position and the team traded for Charles Haley to make him the right defensive end. Even with fewer opportunities, he managed to lead the team with 10.5 sacks (top 15 among league leaders) and six tackles for loss, during the team's drive towards winning Super Bowl XXVII. His repertoire of pass rushing moves and effort, allowed him to remain an effective player through the 1994 season, while playing mostly on passing situations. Jeffcoat left via free agency in 1995, after playing 12 seasons and never missing a game with the Cowboys. He finished with 698 tackles, 94.5 sacks and 149 quarterback pressures. He also accomplished five seasons with 70 or more tackles and five seasons with 10 or more sacks, leaving as the franchise official career sack leader (the NFL didn't start recognizing quarterback sacks as a stat until 1982). Buffalo Bills On February 22, 1995, he was signed as a free agent by the Buffalo Bills. He had a streak of 224 consecutive games played, before being sidelined on September 21 and eventually being placed on the injured reserve list on December 12, 1997. Jeffcoat retired after playing 15 seasons, with 102.5 sacks, 745 tackles, 194 quarterback pressures, 2 interceptions, 11 fumble recoveries and 2 touchdowns. At the time he ranked among the NFL's top-15 career leaders in sacks and his 227 games, placed him among the top 30 players in NFL history in games played. He was nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2008 although he was never selected to a Pro Bowl. Coaching career After his retirement in 1997, he spent seven seasons (1998‚Äì2005) as the Cowboys' defensive ends assistant coach. Jeffcoat spent his last five seasons in the organization as the defensive ends coach after two years as the club's assistant defensive line coach. On January 28, 2008, Jeffcoat was hired to join Kevin Sumlin's staff at the University of Houston as defensive line coach. Prior to arriving in Houston, Jeffcoat was in private business in the Dallas area for two years. From 2011 to 2012, Jeffcoat coached the San Jose State defensive line. In January 2013, he joined the University of Colorado Buffaloes as defensive line coach under recently hired head coach Mike MacIntyre. In November 2018, Jeffcoat was hired by Steve Spurrier as defensive line coach for the Orlando Apollos of the Alliance of American Football. In June 2019, Jeffcoat was hired by Bob Stoops as defensive line coach for the Dallas Renegades of the new XFL. Personal life Jeffcoat and his wife, Tammy, live in Frisco, Texas, with their four children: twins Jackson and Jacqueline, Jaren, and Jasmine. Jacqueline was a top 2010 class basketball center recruit for the University of Oklahoma, while Jackson played in the NFL for the Washington Redskins. He currently owns an Allstate insurance agency.

At the end of the Edo period, Ueda Castle was home to a cadet branch of the Matsudaira clan, daimy≈ç of Ueda Domain, but the castle is better known for its association with the Sengoku period Sanada clan. It was also called or .  Situation  plan of Ueda Castle Ueda Castle is located on a hill overlooking a branch of the Chikuma River at the northeast edge of the Nagano plain, which forms part of its southern defences and acts as a moat. The Central Bailey (Hon-Maru) [1] originally had seven two-story yagura, but no donjon and was protected by a moat as well as stone ramparts. The Central Bailey is also surrounded by a Second Bailey (Ni-no-Maru) [2], also with moats and earthen ramparts. The adjacent Third Bailey (San-no-maru) [3], had additional yagura, of which only the foundation bases remain, and contained the main residence of the daimy≈ç [R] (which was also protected by a moat), gardens [G] and work area [A], and the main gate (≈åtemon) of the castle [H]. Most of the area of the former Third Bailey is now occupied by the Ueda High School.  History  During the Sengoku period, the area around Ueda was under the control of the Sanada clan, a minor local warlord in the service of the Takeda clan. After the fall of the Takeda clan to the combined forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the Sanada switched side with bewildering rapidity between the Uesugi clan, the Later H≈çj≈ç clan, Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi in an effort to preserve their territory and independence. Ueda Castle was constructed in 1583 by Sanada Masayuki with the assistance of his then-ally, Tokugawa Ieyasu as a stronghold against Uesugi Kagekatsu; however it came under attack by the Tokugawa in 1585 after Masayuki switched sides again join the Uesugi. The greatly outnumbered Sanada defeated the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle at Kami River, which greatly enhanced Sanada Masayuki‚Äôs reputation. However, under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Sanada were forced to submit fealty to Tokugawa Ieyasu and Sanada Masayuki's first son, Sanada Nobuyuki, was married to Komatsuhime, an adopted daughter of Ieyasu; while the second son, Sanada Yukimura (Nobushige), was married to Chikurin-in, an adopted daughter of Hideyoshi. After the death of Hideyoshi, the Tokugawa ordered the Sanada to participate in their invasion of Aizu against the Uesugi clan. Sanada Nobuyuki chose to remain on the Tokugawa side, while Sanada Masayuki and his younger son, Sanada Yukimura chose to join the Toyotomi armies under Ishida Mitsunari against the Tokugawa. This led to the Siege of Ueda in 1600, a side battle to the Battle of Sekigahara. The army of Tokugawa Hidetada, while on their way to Sekigahara was ordered to reduce Ueda Castle along the away. Again, the greatly outnumbered Sanada forces inflicted severe casualties on the Tokugawa and delayed Hidetada so long that he was forced to break off the siege and arrived at Sekigahara too late to make a contribution to the battle. After the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Sanada Masayuki submitted to Tokugawa Ieyasu, but was dispossessed and Ueda Castle was partially demolished. Sanada Nobuyuki was made daimy≈ç of Ueda Domain, and returned to build a residence in the former San-no-maru area. He was transferred to nearby Matsushiro Domain in 1622, and replaced by the Sengoku clan, who rebuilt parts of the Main Bailey and Second Bailey from 1628, but the donjon was not restored. The Sengoku were in turn replaced by a branch of the Matsudaira clan in 1706, who remained in control of the castle until the end of the Edo period. Following the Meiji restoration and the abolition of the han system, the castle was dismantled, leaving only the stone ramparts and one yagura. The site was made into a public park, with two Shinto shrines (one dedicated to the Sanada clan, and the other to the war dead), and a local history museum. In 1949, two yagura were reconstructed, and in the 1990s one of the gates was rebuilt. The area was designated a National Historic Site of Japan by the Japanese government in 1934. Ueda Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

The Marine Corps' role in small wars has a long and complex history. During the early years of the 20th century, the Corps was widely viewed as the nation's overseas police and initial response force. Moreover, the actual execution of these roles were a natural adjunct of the Corps' officially directed mission of sea-based power projection, in turn buttressed by its fundamental expeditionary operational character; i.e., the availability for \\"sudden and immediate call\\". As a result of this \\"natural fit\\" and the experience of a series of guerrilla wars and military interventions in Central America and the Caribbean from the late 1890s through the early 1930s, loosely known as the Banana Wars, the Marine Corps began to systematically analyze the character and requirements of operations short of war proper, or \\"Small Wars\\". Major Samuel M. Harrington of the Marine Corps Schools delivered a formal report The Strategy and Tactics of Small Wars in 1921. In addition, Major C. J. Miller wrote a 154-page report on the 2nd Marine Brigade's operations in the Dominican Republic titled Diplomacy and Spurs in the Dominican Republic in 1923. Versions of these and other reports were serialized in The Marine Corps Gazette and additional articles on the subject appeared in The Marine Corps Gazette and the Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute. The results of these efforts were encapsulated in the manual Small Wars Operations in 1935. For the 1940 revision, it was renamed The Small Wars Manual (SWM). A classic of military science, it remains relevant today as the foundation of much current thinking and doctrine. It was encouraged reading by James Mattis for the 1st Marine Division in preparation for the Corps's return to the Iraq War as an occupation force. Chapters I. Introduction II. Organization III.

It is also known as pandan chiffon. The cake is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, China, and also the Netherlands, especially among the Indo community, due to its historical colonial ties with Indonesia. Ingredients The cake shares common ingredients with other cakes, which includes flour, eggs, butter or margarine, and sugar. However, the distinct ingredient is the use of pandan leaf, which give the cake its distinct green colouration. The cakes are light green in tone due to the chlorophyll in the leaf juice. It sometimes contains green food colouring to further enhance its colouration. The cakes are not always made with the leaf juice, as they can be flavoured with Pandanus extract, in which case colouring is only added if a green colouration is desired. Pandan leaf, the green juice acquired from this leaf is used as colouring and flavouring agent in pandan cake. The original pandan cake common in Indonesia, the Netherlands and Singapore are usually soft sponge cake akin to light and fluffy chiffon cake, made without any additional coating or frosting. The other variant are actually derived from other cake recipe with similarity only in the usage of green pandan flavouring extract. In the Philippines, pandan cakes are rarely made with pandan alone, but are made as a buko pandan cake (or coconut pandan cake), from \\"buko pandan\\", a traditional pairing of young coconut (buko) and pandan flavours used in various desserts. Philippine pandan cakes generally have strips of coconut meat and/or macapuno as toppings or fillings as a result. In contrast, pandan cakes in neighboring countries are traditionally served plain. History and origin In Southeast Asia, cake-making techniques were brought into the region through European colonization. In the past, Indonesia was a Dutch colony, whilst Malaysia and Singapore were British possessions, and the Philippines was a Spanish colony. Naturally, the European colonists brought their cuisine along with them, with the most obvious impact occurring in bread, cake and pastry-making techniques. In Southeast Asian cuisine, the pandan leaf is a favourite flavouring agent used to give off a pleasant aroma, and added to various dishes ranging from fragrant coconut rice, traditional cakes, to sweet desserts and drinks. It was the fusion of European cake-making techniques with locally grown ingredients that created the pandan-flavoured cake. In 2017 CNN named Pandan Cake as the national cake of Singapore and Malaysia. This has led to a reaction in Indonesia that regarded the pandan cake, locally known as kue bolu pandan as theirs. In Singapore pandan cake was popularized especially by one of the popular bakery in the city; Bengawan Solo, a cake shop owned by a Singaporean citizen of Indonesian origin. Green pandan is also used as flavouring and colouring agent in other Dutch- Indonesian cake spekkoek (lapis legit) sold in an Indo (Eurasian) shop in Amsterdam. According to CNN Indonesia however, this cake is originated from Indonesia, which can be traced to the cake-making technique of the colonial Dutch people in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) during colonial era. The colonial Dutch and Indos people combined the cake-making technique from Europe with the available local ingredients found in the Indies, in this instance the pandan leaf as flavouring and colouring agent. This cake is also known as pandan cake in Dutch, and is quite popular in the Netherlands due to their historical link to Indonesia. Other than made as chiffon pandan cake, pandan leaf is also used as green colouring and flavouring in Dutch-Indonesian favourite pandan spekkoek or lapis legit (layered cake), which demonstrate the prominence of pandan leaf in Dutch-Indonesian cake and pastry making.

Whilst it is not one of the largest lakes on the island (around 1.8 acres), its claim to fame is the group of over 150 Iron Age metal objects discovered there in 1942, apparently placed in the lake as votive offerings. These finds are considered to be one of the most important collections of La T√®ne style metalwork discovered in the British Isles, and the most important in Wales. Archaeological Site \\"Crescentic bronze plaque\\" in the shape of a gold lunula, with triskele-like decoration The discovery was made by William Owen Roberts, head groundsman of RAF Valley, when ground was being cleared for a runway extension. This involved spreading peat over the sandy ground, and the items were discovered during the extraction of peat from the Cors yr Ynys bog on the southern margin of Llyn Cerrig Bach. The first object to be found was an iron gang chain, used for slaves. This was caught up in the teeth of a harrow and was not at first identified as being ancient. It was attached to a tractor and used to pull lorries out of the mud. Despite its age, the chain performed this function well. The slave chain is over 3 metres long, with five neck-rings to hold five captives, and weighs 6.66 kilograms.Gang Chain (Slave Chain) , NOW Cyril Fox argued that the chain was evidence of Druids. Fox, writing at a time when all religions, Christian and pre-Christian alike, were widely regarded by scholars as being antithetical to rational thought and science, based his conclusions on Tacitus who described the Druids as cruel and hated. Fox argued the chain was used to transport persons for ceremonial human sacrifice. Once the chain had been identified, a search of the area produced a large number of other objects, mainly of iron but some of bronze or copper alloy. A total of 181 artefacts are known to have been recovered, described by the National Museum as including: \\"seven swords, six spearheads, fragments of a shield, part of a bronze trumpet, [one further gang chain], fragments of iron wagon tyres and horse gear. In addition, blacksmith's tools, fragments of two cauldrons, iron bars for trading and animal bones were also found.\\" Llyn Cerrig Bach in 2010, view from the roadside Many of these items had been deliberately broken and are thought to have been placed in the lake as votive offerings. Some of the items appear to have been of local manufacture, a few were manufactured in Ireland, but many originate from southern England, suggesting that the fame of Llyn Cerrig Bach as a holy site may have spread well beyond the immediate area. However it is also possible that they were traded or plunder captured in warfare by the local tribes. No direct Roman influence can be seen on any of the objects found. A recent re-assessment of the objects now sees them as a collection of different offerings deposited over a long period from about 300 BC to 100 AD, rather than a single group deposited together, as was previously thought. Most of the items found at Llyn Cerrig Bach can usually be seen in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, which holds all but four of the objects discovered,National Museum although until November 2012 most have been loaned to the Oriel Ynys M√¥n museum in Anglesey.Llyn Cerrig Bach treasures to be exhibited at Oriel Ynys M√¥n.

The script was conceived and written by Bertolt Brecht. He also directed the concluding scene: a political debate between strangers on a train about the world coffee market. The rest of the film was directed by Slatan Dudow. The film music was composed by Hanns Eisler. Kuhle Wampe itself was a tent camp on the M√ºggelsee in Berlin. Wampe is Berlin dialect for \\"stomach\\", so the title could be rendered \\"Empty Stomach\\". The film was banned in Germany in 1932 due to the accusations that it depicted the president, the legal system, and religion in a negative light but, following protests, the ban was lifted for a recut version. The film remained unseen for many years. However, a restored print is now available and a video was released by the British Film Institute in 1999, along with a documentary video essay on the original film by Andrew Hoellering, son of the film's producer George Hoellering.  Synopsis  Kuhle Wampe takes place in early-1930s Berlin. The film begins with a montage of newspaper headlines describing steadily-rising unemployment figures; followed by scenes of a young man looking for work in the city and the family discussing the unpaid back rent. Then the young man, brother of the protagonist Anni, removes his wristwatch and commits suicide by defenestration. Shortly thereafter, they are evicted from their apartment. Now homeless, the family moves into a garden colony of sorts with the name \\"Kuhle Wampe\\". Anni, the family's daughter and the only family member who still has a job, becomes pregnant and then engaged to her boyfriend, Fritz, who complains that their marriage was forced on him because of her pregnancy. Anni leaves Fritz and moves to her friend Gerda's apartment. She later finds herself in a worker's sporting event where she meets Fritz, who has recently lost his job, and they reunite. The climactic scene (written by Brecht) depicts an impromptu political debate. On their return home by train, Anni, Fritz and other workers argue with middle-class, wealthy passengers about the worldwide financial crisis. One of the workers notes that the well-off will not change the world, to which one of the wealthy asks quizzically, \\"Who else, then, can change the world?\\" Gerda replies, \\"Those who don‚Äôt like it.\\" The film ends with the singing of the Solidarity Song, with lyrics by Brecht and music from Hanns Eisler.

Hives was born in Reading, Berkshire. During the Second World War he was closely involved with the design of the Merlin engine as well as numerous later Rolls-Royce jet engines. He began his working life in a local garage. However, in 1903 he got a job working at C.S. Rolls' car company, after fixing Rolls' car. Achievements After becoming a chief test driver in 1908, he led the RR team in the Austrian Alpine Trial in 1913. During the First World War the company designed its first aero-engine, the Eagle, and Hives developed it successfully; by 1916 he was Head of the Experimental Department.Pugh 2000, p. 109. In 1919 the Eagle powered the twin- engined Vickers Vimy bomber on the first direct flight across the Atlantic. Other notable engines were later developed under Hives' lead. Of these the Buzzard was the most important, leading to the ‚ÄòR‚Äô series, which powered the Supermarine S.6 seaplanes that won the Schneider Trophy in 1929 and 1931 for Rolls-Royce, and most importantly the famous Merlin engine. In 1936 he became the general works manager of the factory and a year later was elected to the board. He lived at 37, St. Chads Rd., Derby until around 1937, then at 'Hazeldene', Duffield.Watson W.R. 1991, p. 140. In 1937, thinking war would soon be inevitable, he prepared the firm for a massive production increase in Merlin engines by splitting facilities between engineering and production. As the Merlin powered Hurricanes and Spitfires, this was a decision of vital strategic significance when war did come. It was thanks to Hives that a total of a hundred and sixty thousand Merlins were produced by 1945. In 1941 Hives quickly decided 'to go all out for the gas turbine‚Äô, ensuring the company‚Äôs leading role in developing jet engines for civil and military aviation.Pugh 2000, p. 287. Vice Chief of Air Staff Sir Wilfrid Freeman, one of the masterminds behind the dramatic advances in British aircraft production before and during World War 2, paid tribute to Hives's dedication in a letter to his wife: Hives became managing director in 1946 and chairman of Rolls-Royce from 1950 till 1957. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1943 Birthday Honours and on 7 July 1950 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hives, of Duffield in the County of Derby. He played a critical role in the UK Nuclear Submarine programme. When the highly irascible but utterly pivotal Admiral Rickover visited the UK in 1957 to inspect the British nuclear design team at Rolls Royce, Rickover was \\"at his obnoxious worst\\". After one particularly difficult morning he was introduced to Lord Hives. His son, Pilot Officer Edward Ernest Hives, was killed in action flying with RAF Coastal Command in October 1940.Watson W.R. 1991, p. 140. He retired in 1957 and died in April 1965, aged 79. He was succeeded in the barony by his son John. His younger daughter, Philippa Hives, married Judge Alexander Morrison in 1978. References=NotesBibliography *Lumsden, Alec.

The progenitor of this Acadian family was one Jean Pitre, b: Abt. 1636;1671 census of Acadia d: Abt. 1689 Port Royal, Acadia.Dictionnaire Genealogique Des Familles Acadiennes by Stephen A. White Jean Pitre arrived in Port Royal, Acadia, around 1659 during the English occupation of Acadia from 1654-1667. Around 1664, he married Marie Pesselet, the daughter of Isaac Pesselet and Barbe Bajolet. They had nine children: Marie (1666), Catherine (1668), Claude (1670), Marc (1674), Pierre (1677), Jean (1680), Francois (1682), Marguerite (1684), Jeanne (1686). The first Jean Pitre was a \\"taillandier\\" (maker of tools and implements). His widow remarried Fran√ßois Robin. In the Declarations of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, his grandson claimed Jean Pitre's origin as being Flemish. However, this evaluation has not currently been investigated by professional Acadian genealogists; and the name is still recognized as being of French colonist origin. The surname's pronunciation is not clear. It can vary from the official French-accent with (peter). To the English version of (pye-ter) and (peetree), other common pronunciations are (pit) and (pete). The Pitre surname now extends through the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as many American border states; and an overwhelmingly-large colossal Cajun French presence in the U.S. state of Louisiana. However, Pitres of French ancestry also migrated to Puerto Rico. The first documented Pitres were two brothers (Marcellino Pitre = Martin Pitre, Saturnino Pitre = Francisco Pitre) who settled and according to the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, \\"Those who immigrated to Puerto Rico were given free land and a \\"Letter of Domicile\\" with the condition that they swore loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. After residing in the island for five years the settlers were granted a \\"Letter of Naturalization\\" which made them Spanish subjects.\\" Approximately nine thousand people share this surname. Famous Pitres include actress Louise Pitre, who is best known for her role as Donna Sheridan in the ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia!, earning her a 2002 Tony Award nomination; Cajun music pioneer Austin Pitre; heavy metal musician Audie Pitre, Hall of Fame ice hockey player Didier Pitre; filmmaker Glen Pitre and his younger brother, former Louisiana State Representative Loulan Pitre, Jr., who represented a district in Lafourche Parish, where both were born. Pitre is one of the many common surnames among the Cajun French ethnicity of Louisiana, along with Guidry and Trahan, with the most common being Fontenot.

History Estimated size of juvenile South Dakota specimen (blue) and the Stokesosaurus holotype (orange), compared to a human. Life reconstruction of Stokesosaurus clevelandi. From 1960 onwards Utah geologist William Lee Stokes and his assistant James H. Madsen excavated thousands of disarticulated Allosaurus bones at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County, Utah. During the early 1970s, Madsen began to catalogue these finds in detail, discovering that some remains represented species new to science. In 1974 Madsen named and described the type species Stokesosaurus clevelandi. Its generic name honours Stokes. The specific name refers to the town of Cleveland, Utah. The holotype (UMNH 2938, also known as UMNH VP 7473 and formerly known as UUVP 2938) was uncovered in the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation dating from the early Tithonian stage, about 150 million years old. It consists of a left ilium or hip bone, belonging to a juvenile individual. Madsen also assigned a paratype, UUVP 2320, a 50% larger right ilium. Additionally he referred a right premaxilla, UUVP 2999. However, this was in 2005 referred to Tanycolagreus.K. Carpenter, C.A. Miles, and K.C. Cloward, 2005, \\"New small theropod from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming\\", In: K. Carpenter (ed.), The Carnivorous Dinosaurs. Indiana University Press, Bloomington pp. 23-48 Stokesosaurus and Tanycolagreus are about the same size, and it is possible that the latter is a junior synonym of the former. However, the ilium (the best and perhaps only known element of Stokesosaurus) of Tanycolagreus has never been recovered, making direct comparison difficult.Foster, J. (2007). Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. 389pp. In 1976 Peter Malcolm Galton considered Stokesosaurus to be a second species of the British possible early tyrannosauroid Iliosuchus, that he named as Iliosuchus clevelandi. This has found no acceptance among other researchers; in 1980 Galton himself withdrew his opinion. Illustration of the ilia of the South Dakota juvenile specimen (top) and Stokesosaurus (bottom). Some later finds were referred to Stokesosaurus. This included some ischia and tail vertebrae in 1991, and a partial braincase in 1998. Another, very small ilium referred to Stokesosaurus, found in South Dakota, is lost but may actually belong to the related Aviatyrannis. More fragmentary remains possibly referable to Stokesosaurus have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 2 of the Morrison Formation, dated to the late Kimmeridgian age, about 152 million years ago.Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). \\"Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.\\" Pp. 77‚Äì114 in Gillette, D.D.

(2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. A second species, Stokesosaurus langhami, was described by Roger Benson in 2008 based on a partial skeleton from England. However, further study showed that this species should be referred to a new genus, which was named Juratyrant in 2012. Benson and Stephen Brusatte concluded that not a single bone had been justifiably referred to Stokesosaurus, and that not even the paratype could be safely assigned, leaving the holotype ilium as the only known fossil of the taxon. In addition, many traits initially believed to unite Stokesosaurus clevelandi and Juratyrant langhami under one genus could not be conclusively disproven to exist on other tyrannosauroids. In fact, one of the traits, a posterodorsally inclined ridge on the lateral side of the ilium, was found on the undescribed left ilium of the holotype of Eotyrannus. This leaves only a single autapomorphy of Stokesosaurus which is not present in Juratyrant or other tyrannosauroids: a swollen rim around the articular surface of the pubic peduncle. The holotype ilium is long, indicating a small individual. Madsen in 1974 estimated that the adult body length was about . In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at and the weight at .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 100 Classification In 1974 Madsen assigned Stokesosaurus to the Tyrannosauridae. However, modern cladistic analyses indicate a more basal position. In 2012 the study by Brusatte and Benson recovered Stokesosaurus as a basal member of the Tyrannosauroidea, and closely related to Eotyrannus and Juratyrant. Below is a 2013 cladogram by Loewen et al. that places Stokesosaurus and Juratyrant as derived members of Proceratosauridae, due to sharing with Sinotyrannus a narrow preacetabular notch. Many basal tyrannosauroids have incomplete or unknown ilia and this trait may be more widespread than currently known. Various traits support the argument that Sinotyrannus is a proceratosaurid. However, a 2016 analysis utilizing both parsimonious and Bayesian phylogeny placed Stokesosaurus and Juratyrant as tyrannosauroids slightly more advanced than Proceratosauridae and Dilong. In addition, Eotyrannus is recovered as a sister taxon of these genera in the parsimonious phylogeny. Paleoecology=Habitat The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil- collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Paleofauna The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as Camarasaurus, Barosaurus, Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus. Dinosaurs that lived alongside Stokesosaurus included the herbivorous ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Stegosaurus and Othnielosaurus. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods Saurophaganax, Torvosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Marshosaurus, Ornitholestes andFoster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. Allosaurus, which accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other animals that shared this paleoenvironment included bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Examples of early mammals present in this region, were docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.

The photo was taken on Tingh√∫sv√∏llur in T√≥rshavn. Sunleif Rasmussen (born March 19, 1961 in Sandur in the Faroe Islands) is the foremost Faroese composer of classical music. Biography Rasmussen studied in Norway, then returned to T√≥rshavn in the Faroes as a music teacher and jazz pianist. From 1990 to 1995 he studied musical composition at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen under Ib N√∏rholm and electronic music under Ivar Frounberg. In 1992 he received grants from the Leonie Sonning Foundation and the Danish Composer's Society. He also became familiar with spectral music, which has its roots at the IRCAM in Paris, and the work of composers such as Tristan Murail. Rasmussen has produced a number of works combining electronic and acoustic instruments, some produced in co-operation with DIEM (the Danish Institute for Electro-Acoustic Music). In 1997, he was awarded a three-year grant from the Danish State Arts Foundation. In 2002, he won the Nordic Council Music Prize for his Symphony no. 1 - \\"Oceanic Days\\", which, in the NOMUS committee description: \\"derives its inspiration from Faroese nature and from age-old Faroese hymns, from which Rasmussen has created a work of comprehensive dimensions. It radiates a natural artistic integrity, combining tightness and structure with lyric feeling.\\" In 2004, he was visiting composer at the prestigious Korsholm Festival in Finland, while in 2010, he received the Faroese Cultural Prize from the Faroese Department of Culture. In 2013, he participated in the residency and concert series Other Minds in San Francisco. Music Rasmussen speaking at a pre-concert panel discussion at Other Minds 18 in 2013 Rasmussen‚Äôs music always has a natural complexity, combining his jazz background with a rich tradition of Faroese folk music and electroacoustic and spectral music. He transforms folk music themes using spectral and serial techniques, using intervals in the original melody to generate rhythmic segments and harmonic overtone spectra to determine the melodic and timbral material; the result is an abstraction from Faroese traditional music, even though none of the original melodies can be discerned in the finished composition. He also draws much inspiration from the Faroese author and artist William Heinesen (1900-1991), using both the text and the mood of Heinesen's poetry in his music. The result is highly evocative, beautiful, and not difficult to listen to. The power and complexity of his music often reflects nature, shimmering with energy and movement.

This species is resident in Australia, where it is one of the more common buttonquails. The species is found in grassland habitats. The female is an unmarked pale colour below, and straw-brown above with white streaking; the male is similar but less neatly marked. The species has a large pale bill, and pale eye.  Description and field identification  The little buttonquail is a small reddish brown bird with thin white stripes on its upper parts with a blue-grey beak, pink legs and feet, and pale eyes. The female is both larger and more brightly coloured than the male. The little buttonquail is easily distinguishable from other small quail. When flying, by its distinctly reddish or pinkish toned upperbody and the contrasting tones between parts of its wings. While superficially resembling the true quails of the genus Coturnix, the little buttonquail differ by lacking a hind toe and a crop. The females also possess a unique vocal organ created by an enlarged trachea and inflatable bulb in the esophagus. This is used to produce a booming call. The call patterns of the Little Button quail mainly consists of two key sounds, a loud booming ‚Äúoo-ah‚Äù or ‚Äúcoo-oo usually sounded at night. When startled, the little buttonquail has a large squeaking call, composed of a few ‚Äúchip chip- chip‚Äù sounds.  Diet  As an omnivore, the little buttonquail will eat seeds, native grasses, insects and small frogs.  Distribution and habitat  Little buttonquail are found over most of arid and semi arid Australia, excluding Tasmania, Western Australia. (Kinberlys), Northern territory (Arnhem land) and Northern Queensland (Cape York peninsula), due to its preferred habitat of grasslands and woodlands of tropical and temperate regions. The little button quail is found extensively throughout south and western Australia and in abundance in much of the Northern Territory. The little button quail seems to be extremely rare in areas of higher altitude or coastal regions and is mainly found in the inland regions of all states. However, only one specimen has ever been found in Tasmania.  Reproduction and nesting  Unusually the female little buttonquail is the brighter coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship and button quails are polyandrous, with the females circulating amongst the males and aggressively expelling all females from her territory. The little buttonquail can breed year round and have multiple clutches of eggs, with Spring and Autumn usually the most productive. Breeding prevalence seem to be largely dependent on seasonal suitability with optimum breeding conditions being after consistent heavy rain. The little button quail nests on the ground in sheltered areas such as small shrubs or overhanging grasses. The actual nest is formed by quail nesting pairs scratching to create a little dent before being lined with small sticks or fine grass. Incubation is carried out by the male bird, who also does all the brooding and feeding of the chicks. The eggs are generally an off white colour with dark brown markings and incubation is generally between 12‚Äì14 days with chicks becoming independent within 3‚Äì4 weeks of hatching. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship. Unusually, the buttonquails are polyandrous, with the females circulating among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but only the male incubates the eggs and tends the young. The eggs hatch after an incubation period of 12 or 13 days, and the young are able to fly within two weeks of hatching.  Conservation  The conservation status of a species indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become extinct in the near future. Factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status. The number of individuals remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats. Endemic to Australia the little buttonquail has an extremely large range with populations spread widely across mainland Australia. Therefore, this species is not classified as vulnerable under the conservation status: ‚ÄòExtent of occurrence criterion‚Äô, despite the fact that the little buttonquail population in general appears to be decreasing. Such an enormous species population is unable to attain vulnerability status in regards to the population trend or population size criterion. However, there is evidence that the frequency of human interaction within their environment is causing vulnerability within populations.

Scott Fitzgerald; \\"Three Sisters\\" is about the play of the same name by Anton Chekhov; \\"Lucy\\" is an amalgamation of three of the Lucy poems by William Wordsworth; \\"Timewatching\\" is inspired by the popular song \\"When I Fall In Love\\"; \\"Death of a Supernaturalist\\" is preceded by a quote from A Room with a View by E. M. Forster, spoken by Julian Sands and Daniel Day-Lewis and sampled from the Merchant-Ivory film of the same name. More playfully, \\"Festive Road\\" is a tribute to the children's television programme Mr Benn Track listing All songs written and arranged by Neil Hannon; additional lyrics on \\"Lucy\\" by William Wordsworth.

Therapy? In 1989, while playing drums in a punk covers band at a charity gig in Jordanstown, Ewing met Andy Cairns and subsequently formed Therapy? with Cairns on guitar and Michael McKeegan on bass. Ewing and Cairns would share lead vocal duties. In his near seven-year spell with the million selling outfit, Ewing recorded three full- length albums, two mini-albums and numerous EP's (as well as featuring heavily on two compilation albums and a box set following his departure) before leaving the band in January 1996. The official Therapy? press release stated: : Therapy? have parted company with drummer Fyfe Ewing. The split is totally amicable, Ewing being unable to cope with the rigours of touring. With Therapy? about to embark on a 5 month US tour to coincide with the release of \\"Infernal Love\\" in America, a parting of ways was mutually agreed\\". Divers Ewing had meanwhile moved from Belfast to Brighton, England. He played for a short time in a band called \\"Divers\\", along with Rory Myers (guitar/vocals), Jon Hardy (bass) and for a short while Simon Robinson (Guitars), though Robinson proceeded to quit in early 1998, before Ewing drummed on and produced the three track EP \\"Little Less Nothing,\\" released on Track Records. Although the single received favourable reviews in the press, gaining 'Single of the Week' in Kerrang! magazine, Ewing left the band shortly afterwards. In 2006, Jon Hardy confirmed that Fyfe had recently jammed with the band but that it was just for fun, and not anything official. Score In 2000, Ewing traveled to New York City to record an album with Brighton based hard rock band \\"Score\\". The band included Lee Malin (vocals), James O'Brien (guitar) and Carlos Fortin (bass). The album was produced by Fred Durst and mixed by Rick Rubin for Durst's Flawless Records. The album remains unreleased. Other In 2007, Ewing placed a classified advert to the online musicians marketplace, Musolist, offering his services as a recording and/or touring drummer. In 2008, Ewing travelled to Belfast to play drums on singer-songwriter Robyn G. Shiels new material. The long delayed album \\"The Blood of the Innocents\\" was finally released on 'No Dancing Records' in April 2014. In September 2011, Ginger of The Wildhearts confirmed that Ewing had agreed to drum on 10 tracks for his forthcoming triple album. 555% was released in February 2012. High quality photographs taken by Ewing during the recording process were later published in Rock Sound magazine. In August 2016, UK indie label Wallcreeper Records uploaded a photo of Ewing preparing a new album with Steve Nolan, formally of Northern Irish band InDust. At the same time, a short Electronic live album was uploaded to an official 'NolanEwing' Bandcamp page, recorded in London in 2003 Movie soundtracks In 1998, Ewing and co-writer Steve Nolan (formally of Northern Irish band \\"In Dust\\") provided the score music for the Northern Irish short independent film \\"Charming Celia,\\" by director David Starkey, a comedy drama that was first broadcast on RT√â television on 29 July 1998. In 2002, Ewing provided the score music for the UK short independent film \\"Cry\\" by horror director Steven Sheil. He followed this up with another short film, the documentary \\"Love Takes\\" by Jeanie Finlay. Although all these films lasted only 10 minutes each, Fyfe managed to showcase his drum n' bass talents in each. More recently, Ewing, along with Steve Nolan, has written and performed bespoke music for the soundtrack of the IFC feature documentary movie \\"Goth Cruise\\", again directed by Jeanie Finlay. The movie premiered on IFC (USA), 27 November 2008. The movie's website (now defunct) stated: :Bespoke music written and performed by Fyfe Ewing and Steve Nolan is suitably brooding\\".

Renaissance=England Thomas Tallis set the first lesson, and second lesson, of Tenebrae on Maundy Thursday between 1560, and 1569: \\"when the practice of making musical settings of the Holy Week readings from the Book of Jeremiah enjoyed a brief and distinguished flowering in England (the practice had developed on the continent during the early 15th century)\\".Paul Doe and David Allinson. \\"Tallis, Thomas.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 18 Jul. 2014. The lessons are drawn from Lamentations (Lam. 1, vv.1-2, and Lam. 1, vv.3-5). These famous and notably expressive settings are both a 5 for ATTBB and employ a sophisticatedly imitative texture. Tallis like many other composers included the following text: * the announcements Incipit Lamentatio Ieremiae Prophetae (\\"Here begins the Lamentation of Jeremiah the Prophet\\"), and De Lamentatione Ieremiae Prophetae (\\"From the Lamentation of Jeremiah the Prophet\\"); * the Hebrew letters ALEPH, BETH, GIMEL, DALETH, and HE, that headed each verse in the Vulgate; and, * the concluding refrain Ierusalem, Ierusalem, convertere ad Dominum Deum tuum (\\"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return unto the Lord thy God\\"). Tallis's inclusion of the refrain emphasises the sombre and melancholy effect of the music. The Latin Vulgate Bible of Tallis's day considered the Hebrew letters integral to the text, although most English translations of the Bible omit them. The Vulgate indicates 'He' for verse 5 facti sunt hostes, and Heth for verse 8 peccatum peccavit Hierusalem; the Maundy Thursday Tenebrae lessons do not go as far as verse 8; but the use of 'Heth' for verse 5 by Tallis may indicate only its inclusion in contemporary liturgy. Tallis's settings happen to use successive verses, but the pieces are in fact independent even though performers generally sing both settings together. Composers have been free to use whatever verses they wish, since the liturgical role of the text is somewhat loose; this accounts for the wide variety of texts that appear in these pieces. William Byrd's early setting of 1563 is rarely performed despite his later popularity and importance. A voice part is missing from the majority of the work as found in the only copy of the lost original manuscript and so performance editions require substantial reconstruction. Robert White (1538-1574), a Catholic composer from East Anglia, set the Lamentations twice: a 5, and a 6. Another English setting of the Renaissance is that by Osbert Parsley (1511-1585). European Renaissance Most of the continental composers of the Renaissance composed polyphonic settings of the text for use in the liturgy, including Antoine Brumel, Thomas Crecquillon, Costanzo Festa, Marbrianus de Orto, Victoria, Palestrina, Francisco Guerrero, Francisco de Pe√±alosa, Ferrabosco the Elder, Alonso Lobo, Morales, Pierre de la Rue, Jean Mouton, Bernhard Ycart, Tinctoris, Johannes de Quadris, Bartolomeo Tromboncino, Gaspar, Francesco d‚ÄôAna, Erasmus Lapicida, Antoine de F√©vin, Alexander Agricola, Jacques Arcadelt and Lassus (1584). Of the more obscure composers here, some of these, along with others by even shadowier composers, survive in Petrucci's 1506 two volumes of collected Lamentations and the 1532 anthology edition by Carpentras. Baroque Le√ßons de t√©n√®bres are a French chamber solo style most famously represented by the lessons and responsories of Marc-Antoine Charpentier, and the Le√ßons de t√©n√®bres of Nicolas Bernier, Jean Gilles, Michel Richard Delalande, Michel Lambert, Fran√ßois Couperin. The high baroque Central European style also includes choral and orchestral settings of lamentations by composers such as Jan Dismas Zelenka. Modern Contemporary settings include those by Igor Stravinsky (his Threni), Edward Bairstow, Alberto Ginastera, Ernst Krenek and Leonard Bernstein (his Jeremiah Symphony, which contains Hebrew text in the final movement). Matthew Hunter, a viola soloist at the Berlin Philarmonic, set the Tallis Lamentations to be played by an ensemble of Stradivari violins, violas and violoncellos. The arrangement is for two antiphonally set string quintets. The group plays this piece only a couple of times every two years, when they can get the instruments together.Matthew Hunter Clamavi de Profundis has set Lamentations 1:10-14 and 2:12-15 to music, in Latin.

Ibn Nusayr was known to his followers as a representative (Bab) of al‚ÄêAskari and of the twelfth Twelver Imam, Hujjat- Allah al-Mahdi during the Minor Occultation. A rival of his in claiming to be the bƒÅb (door) to the Imams was Abu Yaqub Ishaq, founder of the Ishaqiyya. The followers of Ibn Nusayr are known as the NusayrisEncyclopedia Iranica, \\"NO·π¢AYRIS\\" () or, since the 1920s, the Alawis (). Nusayr was an Arab from the northern tribe of Banu Numayr, although it has also been mentioned that he was of Persian origin but was associated with the Arab al-Namir tribe. Schisms After the death of al‚ÄêAskari the Shia community was faced with the issue of who the Imam's successor was, some saying that al‚ÄêAskari left a son, Hujjat- Allah al-Mahdi, who communicated with the Shias through the Four Deputies. Ibn Nusayr claimed to have been intimate with the tenth and eleventh Imams, and upon hearing of the news of the hidden son attempted to claim that he was a representative of the hidden Imam. His claim was rejected by the mainstream Shias, and Nusayr was later excommunicated by Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman, the official second deputy of the hidden Imam. Nusayr was also prone to these antics earlier in his career when he claimed al‚ÄêHadi was in fact divine and that he had been sent by al‚ÄêHadi as a prophet, because of this he was officially 'cursed' by the Shia community. The second 'curse' was when he claimed to be the gate (bab) of al‚ÄêAskari. At any rate the gist is that Nusayr laid claim to being the most intimate of intimates of the tenth and eleventh Imams. The death of al‚ÄêAskari and the confusion as to his successor produced a schism in which Nusayr was officially banished from the Shia community. The mainstream (Twelver) Shias therefore were headed by the Four Deputies, whereas the Nusayris (Alawites) went underground. Nusayr's excommunication from the Shia community and his conflict with the official representatives of the hidden Imam was probably representative of the tension produced by Askari's death. Without a successor, there were only two routes: the Babs (intimates of the Imams who claimed to know their will) and the Wukala (representatives). Nusayr did not lay claim to being the bab of both Imams, per se, rather he claimed to be the bab of al‚ÄêHadi, and during the lifetime of al‚ÄêAskari, his ism. The doctrine of the ma'na, ism and bab is a Nusayri doctrine. Obviously, Nusayr's ambition was to present himself as being intimate with the hidden Imam (in a way trying to \\"catch that wave\\") however this did not work out. This is important to note, because if al‚ÄêAskari did not leave a son, then the true successors to the Shia community would have been the bƒÅbs of the Imams, and not an invisible son of questionable historicity, to whom is attributed divine powers and unnaturally long lifespan. Seen in this way, it might be said that prior to the extreme‚Äêmoderate Shia split, the entire Shia community was one, but upon the death of al‚ÄêAskari (the ten previous imams having been legitimate), the Alawite doctrine was exiled with Nusayr and his followers into Syria and Turkey, where the abdal are predicted to reside.

Doyle (born 1953) is an American scientist who received his Ph.D. from the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. He has worked at the SETI Institute since 1987 where he is a principal investigator and astrophysicist. His main area of study has been the formation and detection of extrasolar planets, but he has also worked on communications theory. In particular he has written on how patterns in animal communication relate to humans with an emphasis on cetaceans. He grew up on a dairy farm in Cambria, California and therefore, didn't have much access to information about stars. But by reading books at the local library, Doyle was able to develop his knowledge in astronomy, and eventually obtain his Bachelor's and Master's of Science degrees in astronomy from San Diego State University. His first job was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as an imaging engineer, where he was in charge of analyzing pictures of Jupiter and Saturn sent from the spacecraft Voyager. He moved to Heidelberg, Germany, to help analyze images of Halley's Comet. He got his doctorate in Astrophysics at the University of Heidelberg. In May 2005, he appeared on a National Geographic Channel special titled Extraterrestrial. He also appeared in the episode \\"Will We Survive First Contact,\\" of The Science Channel series titled Morgan Freeman's Through the Wormhole. Doyle is currently seeking to compare dolphin whistles and baby babble in an attempt to make predictions about extraterrestrial communications. He believes that by measuring the complexity of communications for different species on Earth, we could get a good indication of how advanced an extraterrestrial signal is using an application of Zipf's law. His study determined that babies babble over 800 different sounds with the same amount of frequency as dolphins. As they grow older, those sounds decrease to around 50 and become more repetitious. The study found that baby dolphins develop similarly in regards to their whistling. Doyle is faculty at Principia College and the founding Director of Principia College's Institute for the Metaphysics of Physics, founded in 2014.

Like other Georgian manor homes, Frescati had a simple design on the outside, in contrast with an elaborate interior Frescati (sometimes misspelled 'Frascati') was an estate situated in Blackrock, Dublin, between the mountains and the sea. During the eighteenth century, Blackrock was favoured with the well-to-do of Ireland and grew into a fashionable seaside resort. The gentry of smog-ridden Dublin advanced into the area to embrace the sea air. It was around this period that a number of marine villas were built around Blackrock ‚Äì including Maretimo, Carysfort, Lios an Uisce, Sans Souci and others. Frescati House was built in 1739 for the family of John Hely Hutchinson, the Provost of Trinity College. Pearson, P (2001). \\"Between the Mountains and the Sea\\" D√∫n Laoghaire Rathdown County, The O'Brien Press The Duchess In the 1750s, Hely-Hutchinson sold the house to the FitzGeralds, Ireland's largest landowners, who owned land throughout Leinster. Frescati became one of their three principal residences alongside Leinster House in Dublin and Carton House in County Kildare. They spent much time in Frescati, especially in the summer. When the Duchess of Leinster, Emily FitzGerald saw Frescati, she is said to have \\"fallen in love with it\\". Enlargement and improvement Unlike Kildare House and Carton House, the Fitzgeralds did not commission Frescati House, but bought it and improved it; in the 1760s, they extended and enhanced it. They are said to have spent ¬£85,000 on the house (equivalent to many millions of euro in 2016 terms). It tripled in size and received flanking wings and bay windows to take advantage of its sea views. It was at this time that the house was given its name, Frescati, a deliberate corruption of the Italian resort of Frascati. Architecture and landscape Unlike some other great houses, its exterior was austere and not adorned with pediments or pilasters. For some, this gave it a noble simplicity. For others, it seemed unremarkable and undermined the case for preservation. Its exterior contrasted with a richly ornate and well- proportioned interior. The interior had carved marble chimneypieces, many elaborate ceilings and plasterwork of a high quality. There was a book room, a classical stone staircase with medallioned walls and a circular room with a groined ceiling. In the long parlour there was a painted ceiling by Riley, a student of Joshua Reynolds. Frescati even had its own theatre with Corinthian columns. Jacob Smith, who also worked at Carton and Russborough, landscaped and devised the large formal gardens filled with rare plants and shrubs. The house stood well back from the road on several acres of woods and parkland, and the Priory Stream passed through its grounds. There was also a small seawater pool in the garden. The gateway stood close to where the entrance to the Blackrock Shopping Centre stands today and its lands stretched back to where Sydney Avenue is now located. Lord Edward FitzGerald It was the favourite place of residence of Lord Edward FitzGerald, a prominent commander of the United Irishmen. He was Emily's son and had spent much of his childhood here. Emily was careful of her children's health, so they spent most of their time in Blackrock and were educated there. Emily was a strong devotee of Jean- Jacques Rousseau's Emile, which preached the importance of practical lessons from the real world rather than rigid book learning. Emily decided that Blackrock would be the best place to practice the Rousseau ideals of education on her children. The Duchess, who was no stranger to extravagance, invited Rousseau himself to Frescati to be her children's tutor. He declined, so Emily hired a Scottish tutor instead. The tutor, named William Ogilvie, was told to bring Emile to life in Blackrock. She later shocked and scandalised her family by marrying Ogilvie six weeks after her husband's death. Lord Edward married his wife Pamela in Tournai in December 1792. After spending some time in Hamburg, the couple came to Frescati in 1793. The couple rarely had a permanent home during their time together, due to Lord Edward FitzGerald's involvement with the United Irishmen. Pamela, believed by some to be the illegitimate daughter of Duke of Orleans,https://www.libraryireland.com/biography/LordEdwardFitzGerald.php was described as \\"elegant and engaging in the highest degree\\" and of \\"judicious taste in her remarks and curiosities\\". Frescati House served as the venue for some United Irishmen meetings. Thomas Paine, the author of The Rights of Man visited Lord Edward in Frescati House. Lord Cloncurry, who lived nearby in Maretimo, was also a frequent visitor to the house. A passage from a letter FitzGerald wrote to his mother in 1793 reads: > Wife and I are come to settle here. We came last night, got up to a > delightful spring day, and we are now enjoying the little book room, with > the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. > The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open > the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower- > pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; > and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am > sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine > weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati > give me. When he returned to the house in 1797, he wrote: > I can‚Äôt tell you how pleased I was to see this place again. In a moment one > goes over the years; every shrub, every turn, every peep of the house has a > little history in it. The weather is delightful and the place looks > beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a thousand pretty sheltered > spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, > the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the > villainy and tyranny going on in it. It was as a result of a meeting at Frescati on 24 February 1798, that Fitzgerald‚Äôs revolutionary plans were betrayed by Thomas Reynolds. By March 1798, the United Irishmen had been infiltrated by spies. At this time, members of the Leinster committee were arrested. Lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped and went on the run. However an informer, attracted by the ¬£1000 reward, was responsible for Fitzgerald‚Äôs arrest in Dublin's Thomas Street on the 19 May. He shot one of his attackers, in his attempt to escape, but he received a gunshot wound in the process. He died later from his untreated injuries in Newgate Prison on 4 June. Pembroke Place, a terrace built by Reverend Craig Victorian era Frescati House in the late 1800s Later, the house was owned briefly by Sir Henry Cavendish, Receiver-General for Ireland. For a time, it housed Reverend Craig's boys' school which began in 1804. This school prepared students for Trinity College, Dublin, and emphasised anti-Papist (anti- Catholic) values, much the opposite of what Lord Edward believed. Several notable fireplace pieces were removed at this time. According to Gerald Campbell's book Edward and Pamela Fitzgerald Lady Campbell (their daughter) traced two of them to houses in Merrion Square. The five stables (which were situated before the bend of what is now Frescati Park) were converted into houses. The Craig family sold the house in the 1850s. Early 20th century and development In the 20th century, residential developments were built on the estate of Frescati, such as Frescati Park. Frescati Park partly incorporated Stable Lane, and the stable-houses were demolished to make way for it. It was built on woodland around Frescati, and comprised houses with bow windows, mirroring those of Frescati. When Lisalea House was demolished, its lands were incorporated into the Frescati Estate. Beginning of the end Frescati's demise began in the late sixties, when it was acquired from the McKinleys. The grounds of the Frescati remained substantial. In the late 1960s, D√∫n Laoghaire Corporation acquired lands at Frescati to build a bypass. Even after land had been acquired for the Blackrock dual carriageway, the house retained at least . At the same time, Frescati and its lands were rezoned for commercial development. This meant a high financial potential for the lands. By 1970, Frescati was owned by \\"Frescati Estates Limited\\", a company controlled by the directors and owners of Roches Stores. They sought planning permission to have it demolished. Permission was granted, subject to permission being granted for whatever was to be built on the site. A department store, an office block, a hotel and a car park were planned for the site. Frescati boarded up after purchase by Board of Roches Stores Struggle to preserve Frescati When the proposals became public in 1971, there were objections by conservationists. A meeting called to discuss the future Frescati in Blackrock Town Hall was well attended. Several groups emerged in opposition to its demolition. Some locals formed an organisation called the Frescati Preservation Society. Desmond FitzGerald acted as the chairman, and Marie Avis Walker championed the cause in her role as secretary. Roches Stores were prepared only to retain a single stuccoed ceiling, which was to be kept in a memorial hall attached to the store. Local politicians joined the \\"Save Frescati\\" bandwagon as the house's welfare became a major issue with conservationists. Since permission to demolish the house had already been granted on the condition that permission was granted for whatever was planned for the site, the campaign focused its efforts on preventing this planning permission from being granted. Roches threatened to sue D√∫n Laoghaire Corporation for ¬£1.3 million, a large amount at the time, despite legal opinion that such a claim could never be substantiated. However, they said that they would withdraw this claim if they were allowed to knock down the wings. D√∫n Laoghaire Corporation submitted a proposal for opinion that they could demolish the wings and integrate the Pillar room into the part that was to be retained. This was rejected by the conservationists. Several groups in favour of conservation including An Taisce, Bord F√°ilte, the National Monuments Advisory Council, the Old Dublin Society, the Arts Council, and the Irish Georgian Society, signed a formal objection rejecting any proposition on the part of D√∫n Laoghaire Corporation to permit the demolition of any part of Frescati. Several companies offered to buy the house and promised to develop the lands while preserving Frescati. One of these companies wanted to erect a residential development in the remaining land which integrated a restored Frescati. All of these offers were refused. Conservationists feared that Roches Stores would attempt to demolish the house illegally. When locals noticed a truck load of masonry from the house, they alerted Dublin Corporation who sent a housing inspector. Having gained access to the house, they found the architect of the shopping centre with some workmen and that some floors had been removed. The architect claimed that they were \\"just lifting floorboards and joists\\". There was no apparent reason why they would need to carry out such a job on the house. In any case, they were not permitted to carry out any works of this kind on the house. The housing inspector pointed this out. Preserving Frescati proved an uphill battle. The campaign continued, involving lengthy court battles and petitions. A historian in Trinity College prepared a thesis for a Master's degree based on the Frescati situation. She was asked in court how she felt about the possible destruction of Frescati's wings. \\"Bluntly,\\" she replied, \\"it's vandalism. What else could one say of the destruction of good things left by our ancestors which are built to last?‚Äù A petition was presented in court with thousands of signatures from Ireland and abroad. It was argued that Frescati was structurally sound but that much work needed to be done inside. Mariga Guinness of the Irish Georgian Society said that she had several inquiries from people who wanted to live in Frescati. She added that she had seen buildings such as the British Embassy and Holy Cross, which were in a much worse state of repair, restored. Marie Avis Walker exploited a legal loophole, which had first been exposed by somebody who had applied for permission to build \\"a small cabin of clay and wattles made, nine bean rows, and a hive for honey bee\\" on the Isle of Innisfree earlier in the 1970s. This application was rejected in a decision by Sligo County Council, which claimed that it would hinder public amenities. When Marie Avis Walker made use of the loophole, she was more successful. She was granted planning permission for a shopping centre in which Frescati was retained in its entirety. The developers were concerned that she was able to do this, even though she was not the owner of the land. The law was changed as a direct result of this, and it is not possible now to seek planning permission for land which you do not own. This event was important for another reason: though Marie Avis Walker proved that the shopping centre and Frescati House could co-exist, Roches rejected the possibility, and in doing so demonstrated their opposition to preserving Frescati. As the dispute continued, the house was deteriorating rapidly. Valuable interior fittings such as chimney-pieces were removed. Lead was stolen from the roof, which led to damage of the plasterwork. Roches Stores were reluctant to spend money protecting a building they wanted demolished. The Corporation was partly to blame, as they did not properly replace the wall that they had demolished to facilitate the new road. This left the grounds of Frescati open and no action was taken against the people who were damaging the building. No repairs were carried out on the house and it became derelict. The worsening condition of the house was one of the factors which made its ultimate destruction unavoidable. In the early eighties, An Bord Plean√°la finally granted permission for its wings to be demolished. In 1981, it was stripped of its wings. These constituted seventy percent of the house. The essential conditions that called for the restoration of the rest of the house were subsequently ignored. When the wings were demolished, nothing was done to prop up the remainder of the house. Despite this, the building was still structurally safe. The Corporation had argued that the proposed development was unsuitable for the area. Once Roches had completed their Department Store, the conservationists had no legal leg to stand on, since permission to demolish the house was effective once permission to develop the site had been granted. They became unwilling to negotiate with the conservationists. Roches declared that Frescati was beyond restoration. Marie Avis Walker pointed out that the British Embassy building in Merrion Square, which had been gutted by fire, had been restored. The end At this stage, it was clear that the attempt to preserve Frescati was being lost. In 1982, the Corporation tried to get an injunction in the High Court to compel Roches Stores to restore the remainder of the house as per the planning conditions. The judge, Mr. Justice O'Hanlon criticised both sides for the situation that had been allowed to develop. The Corporation had failed both to ensure that the vacant building was kept in proper repair and to enforce the law on Roches Stores. They hadn't taken effective action over the developers' refusal to abide by undertakings they had given to retain the one house and to spend ¬£20,000 on essential repairs. Mr. Justice O'Hanlon concluded that the situation had gone beyond the point of no return, and that it was not feasible at this stage to restore Frescati. A quote from the final judgement reads: > It appears to me that the developers have been completely indifferent to, or > perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the > building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. I feel the developers > have shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from > their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; > but I feel the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising > whatever statutory powers were open to them to cope with the situation. On 4 November 1983, in the early hours of the morning the shell of Frescati was razed to the ground, ending a campaign which had lasted almost thirteen years. Two JCBs completed the job quietly, and not a single protester turned up to hamper the demolition, though some came to observe the demolition. Some of the bamboo, which was planted in 1784 by Lord Edward from shoots he brought back from St. Lucia in the Caribbean, was still there. Souvenir hunters came to scour the rubble, which was left in situ until ten o'clock in the morning. Then the remains were collected into lorries and dumped in Ringsend. Frescati's end was summarised in a letter by Aidan Kelly, which appeared in the Irish Independent: > Softly, well before the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the > grey fa√ßade. A lone rook stirred in the tall beeches nearby, troubled by the > relentless purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains > of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night > breeze. A mighty arm nudged the building. There was no crash, not even a > rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to > thud in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.

Aftermath The boulder which Roches Stores erected after they demolished Frescati Since Frescati's demolition, Roches Stores has ceased to exist. The store tripled in size and became known as the Frascati Shopping Centre. A new shopping centre was built opposite the site of Frescati, and it opened just two years later. By way of compensation for the loss of Frescati, Frescati Estates Limited agreed to endow a scholarship at University College Dublin in perpetuity to the sum of ¬£50,000, to be known as the Lord Edward Fitzgerald Memorial Fund. Roches Stores placed a granite boulder bearing a bronze plaque beside the entrance. The plaque commemorates Lord Edward FitzGerald, though the inscription contains factual inaccuracies, and it mentions that he \\"lived in Frascati [sic] House\\". The boulder stands to the right of the pedestrian entrance to the Shopping Centre today, but hedges are often grown in front of it, making it barely visible to passers by. The Priory (or Frescati in this vicinity) Stream is now culverted under the car park but visible again as it passes a neighbouring apartment development and then passes under the main road to emerge again in Blackrock Park. In time of threat from unexpected raids by the Crown Militia from Dublin Castle, the course of the stream could well have formed an escape route. The original tunnel which Emily had built to carry seawater to Frescati remains to this day; its whereabouts secret, and it has been blocked off. One may notice stray cut-granite blocks which look out of place in the car park. These once belonged to the house. The remnants of Frescati are scattered now and hard to trace. The cast-iron railings were stolen, but a few fragments of plasterwork remain in safe-keeping by the conservationists. Ironically for the conservationists, more of the house would have survived if Roches had been allowed go ahead with the demolition in 1971. The stuccoed ceiling which they originally offered to retain is now destroyed. Due to conservationist pressure, a nearby house, St Helen's, was declared a national monument. The house has since been refurbished as the five-star Radisson Blu Hotel. The lessons learned from Frescati have been used elsewhere. Hundreds of houses in the area were listed for preservation immediately after Frescati was demolished as a direct reaction. The Frescati case was considered in the final stages of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998 and buildings with cultural importance are now afforded greater protection through the act as a result. The large degree of neglect that Frescati suffered was a key tactic of the developers. Legislation was later introduced in which owners of historic buildings can be punished by a prison term or a fine of up to ¬£1 million for negligence. This legislation was exercised when Archer's Garage in the southern city centre, a listed building, was demolished illegally - the developers agreed to rebuild, and did so. Blackrock after Frescati Blackrock is an upmarket residential area. The pressure for development land in Blackrock has resulted in the demolition of a number of old houses; Maretimo, Dawson Court, The Grove, Mount Merrion House, The Elms, Laural Hill, Fitzwilliam Lodge, Talbot Lodge, Frescati Lodge, Woodville, Carysfort Lodge, Avoca House, Lisalea, Ardlui, Linden Castle and Yankee Terrace (a street of around ten tiny 19th-century cottages). None of these constitutes a loss on the scale of Frescati. Blackrock has changed much since the demise of Frescati. The Blackrock bypass has altered the character of the area. There is a vibrant atmosphere in the village, which is dominated by caf√©s, pubs, and boutiques. Frescati was the last building of significance connected with the 1798 Rising. Blackrock's ongoing metamorphosis has been described by its longtime resident, the comedian Rosaleen Linehan. In her own words: ‚ÄúLong live Blackrock. Nostalgia is self-perpetuating. No doubt in forty years' time people will be regretting the loss of the Roches Centre with all its outlets and its replacement with a fake version of Frescati House.\\" See also * St. Helen's, Booterstown References Category:Houses completed in 1739 Category:Houses in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown Category:Blackrock, Dublin Category:FitzGerald dynasty Category:History of County Dublin Category:1739 establishments in Ireland ","title":"Frescati House"},{"id":"3579278","text":"The city of Rome, founded in a strategic location among a war-like people (the Etruscans), needed to concern itself with military activity from the start. As Rome grew, its military needs changed. This article covers the military establishment of the Roman kingdom up to about 300BC. Initial army Rome was probably founded as a compromise between Etruscan residents of the area and Italic tribes nearby. The kings were Etruscan. Their language was still spoken by noble families in the early empire, although sources tell us it was dying out. Under the first king, Romulus, society consisted of gentes, or clans, arranged in 80 curiae and three tribes. From them were selected 8000 pedites (infantry) and 800 celeres (cavalry) of gentes-connected men. The decimal scheme seems already to have existed: one unit of fast troops for every 10 of foot. Greek hoplite The Etruscans were heavily influenced by Greek culture, which can be viewed as dominating the eastern Mediterranean. At first, under the Etruscan Kings, the massive Greek phalanx was the most desired battle formation. Early Roman soldiers hence must have looked much like Greek hoplites. However, for the military in ancient Rome, the armor and weapons they had at their disposal was dictated by social class. Reforms of Servius Tullius A key moment in Roman history was the introduction of the census (the counting of the people) under Servius Tullius. He had found that the aristocratic organization now did not provide enough men for defense against the hill tribes, and, consequently, he accepted non-aristocrats into the state and reorganized society on the basis of wealth, determined at the census. Citizens were graded into six classes by property assessment. From them were recruited militias according to the equipment they could afford and the needs of the state. From the wealthiest classes were recruited the heavily armed infantry, equipped like the Greek hoplite warrior with helmet, round shield (clipeus), greaves and breastplate, all of bronze, and carrying a spear (hasta) and sword (not the gladius). In battle, they followed the principle of \\"two forward, one back.\\" The first and second acies, or lines of battle, composed of principes and hastati, were forward; the triarii or \\"third rank\\", containing the veterani, or \\"old ones\\", was held in reserve. From the name, hastati, one can deduce that the hasta, a thrusting spear, was the weapon of choice. Triarii were equipped with a long spear, or pike, a shield and heavy armor. The remaining class or classes (rorarii) were lightly armed with the javelin (verutum). They were no doubt used for skirmishing, to disrupt the enemy ranks before the main battle. The officers as well as the cavalry were either not in the six classes or were of the first class. The question remains open. If the nobility were above the six, they were drawn from the senatorial rank or rank of equestrians (equites), also known as knights. Cavalry remained an aristocratic arm up to the introduction of motorized warfare. Reforms of Camillus All in all the Roman army consisted of 18 centuries of equites, 82 centuries of the first class (of which 2 centuries were engineers), 20 centuries each of the second, third and fourth classes and 32 centuries of the fifth class (of which 2 centuries were trumpeters). Even these measures were inadequate to the challenges Rome was to face. They went to war with the Hernici, Volsci and Latini (Italics), undertook the reduction of Etruria and endured an invasion of Gauls under Brennus. Into the gap stepped one of the great generals Rome seemed able to produce at critical moments: Marcus Furius Camillus. He held various offices, such as interrex and dictator, but was never king himself. In the early fourth century BC, Rome suffered its greatest humiliation when Po valley Celts under Brennus sacked Rome itself. The Romans wanted to abandon the city and resettle at Veii (an Etruscan city), but Camillus prevented it. If Rome was to re-establish her authority over central Italy and be prepared to meet any similar disasters in future, some reorganization was needed. These changes were traditionally believed to have been the work of Camillus, but according to another theory, they were introduced gradually during the second half of the fourth century BC. Italy was not governed by city states like Greece, where armies met on large plains, deemed suitable by both sides, to reach a decision. Far more it was a collection of hill tribes using the difficult terrain to their advantage. Something altogether more flexible was needed to combat such foes than the unwieldy, slow-moving phalanx. The legio, or \\"levy\\", was introduced at this time, with a structure of manipuli (\\"handsful\\"). The infantry adopted a looser fighting formation distinct from the earlier tightly packed hoplite shield wall, and soldiers began to carry javelins. In this formation, the Romans became more like their Gallic adversaries than Greek hoplites. Conscription When it was time to draft additional soldiers into the military, they would look to their citizens for assistance in the defense of Rome. In the writings of Polybius it was in the natural order of a Roman citizen to fight in the military. However, the military was divided by class and wealth. The poorer citizens made up most of the light infantry (velites) of the legion. The higher class equites were drafted into the cavalry because they could afford a horse. Organization The Roman army was divided into 30 legions. Each legion was made up of about 4000 to 5000 legionaries. Each legion was made up of 10 cohorts, each cohort consisting of 480 legionaries. A cohort was made up of six groups (centuries) of 80 men. Each century was led by a centurion and was further divided into eight groups called contubernia. While in this stretch the centurion, was stead to lead 100 legionaries. Centurions have been thought to lead from the writings of Polybius the centuries, and have been keen in the Roman military stance of tactics, leadership and knowledge of their troops. The centurion was a key part of the Roman military because he provided leadership to the troops that were divided among cohorts and legions, however it gave them the morale for each to be a decisive point in their ranks because of the centurion. Non-citizens could fight for Rome as well; however, they were paid less and were not given the best armor and weaponry. These soldiers were called auxiliaries. Framework for combat That there are multiple degrees of influence on this subject it is based on the individual soldier to the legion then also compared to the ways of combat being in melee or by ranged combat each being in a different respect. For individual experience it is framed as for legionaries that you will be very aggressive and fight for a time of 15 to 20 minutes and trying to stay alive while doing this and going to rest and let the for the formations re-rank and let them rest; which is an achievement that is very worthy to fight hand to hand in combat with more than likely overwhelming odds and trying to stay alive while still fighting and keeping a line in the battlefield is quite a feat. However ranged combat would be common in the legion, however it isn't truly elaborated on. See also *Military history of ancient Rome References J. (2013). James.

Early life Toyota City, Aichi PrefectureÔºâ Sakakibara Yasumasa was born in the year Tenmon-17 (1548), the second son of Sakakibara Nagamasa, in the Ueno district of Mikawa Province. The Sakakibara were hereditary retainers of the Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) clan, classified as fudai. However, they did not serve the clan directly, but instead served one of its senior retainers, which at that time was Sakai Tadanao (which classified the Sakakibara as baishin, or \\"rear vassals\\"). The young Yasumasa interacted with Matsudaira Motoyasu (later Tokugawa Ieyasu) often from a young age, and was soon appointed his page. Due to his valor in the suppression of the Ikk≈ç-ikki uprising in Mikawa, he was allowed to use the \\"yasu\\" from Ieyasu's name. At this time, he unseated his brother and became head of the Sakakibara clan. There are two explanations for this. One is that his brother had been an ally of the Ikko Ikki rebels, and the other is that his brother was a retainer of Ieyasu's son Matsudaira Nobuyasu, who was implicated in what was most probably a non-existent treason plot against Oda Nobunaga. Service under Ieyasu Gusoku Style Armor With black lacing, Edo period, 17th century, Important Cultural Property, Tokyo National Museum In Eiroku-9 (1566), at age 19, Yasumasa had his coming-of- age ritual, and soon after, he and Honda Tadakatsu were made hatamoto by Ieyasu, and each granted command of 50 cavalrymen. From that point on, they would function as Ieyasu's hatamoto unit commanders. Yasumasa battled at Anegawa in 1570, Mikatagahara in 1573, along with the Nagashino in 1575. When Ieyasu chose to defy Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Yasumasa still served under Ieyasu, suggesting the region of Komaki would be suitable for the ensuing campaign. Yasumasa was given the title of \\"'Shikibu-Sh≈ç'\\", when accompanying Ieyasu to Osaka to meet with Hideyoshi. After the Tokugawa moved to the Kant≈ç region, he was to have a team responsible for the allocation of fiefs. While Ieyasu was serving as one of Hideyoshi's staff in Ky≈´sh≈´, Yasumasa was to supervise Kant≈ç, as one of the chief administrators. Later life Yasumasa's tomb in Tatebayashi Yasumasa received the 100,000 koku fief of Tatebayashi han following the Tokugawa victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, which remained in the family for a few generations. Yasumasa himself died in 1606, at the age of 59, and is buried at Zendoji Temple in Tatebayashi, where his grave still stands.

He is the founder and president of the African American Environmentalist Association and the Center for Environment, Commerce & Energy. He was listed by Ebony (magazine) in 2012 as one of America's top 100 most influential African Americans.died May, 14, 2019 Norris McDonald, a leading black environmentalist, is the founder and president of the African American Environmental Association (AAEA), an organization dedicated to protecting the environment, enhancing human, animal and plant ecologies, and increasing African American participation in the environmental movement. Norris McDonald was born to parents Sandy Norris McDonald Sr. and Katie Louvina Best in 1958 in Thomasville, North Carolina. Norris McDonald Sr. was a high school principal and Katie Louvina Best worked for the local public school system. She died of breast cancer at the age of 26. McDonald attended Wake Forest University where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1977. After college, McDonald moved to Washington, D.C. hoping to find a job as a Congressional staffer. Instead, he was hired as a staffer at the Environmental Policy Institute in 1979 (now called Friends of the Earth) where he worked for the next seven years. McDonald‚Äôs primary duties included media relations, public education, researching, lobbying, and fund raising. During this time, McDonald was introduced to environmental issues across the nation. He also noticed that there were no black professionals working for environmental groups in the Washington, D.C. area. The absence of black professionals in those organizations inspired him to create the AAEA in 1985. McDonald led the new organization in what would soon be known as urban environmentalism. The organization promoted recycling, cleaning storm drains, weatherizing, and climate-auditing homes in working-class neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. The Association‚Äôs activities usually created the first interest in environmental concerns in the capital‚Äôs inner city neighborhoods. The Association also started a minority environmental internship program in 1989 which placed black college students as interns at several national environmental groups. Many of the first interns from AAEA moved on to work permanently with national environmental organizations and in federal agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Some have become environmental lawyers..\\"./ Norris describes himself as a \\"black conservative environmentalist\\". He believes the close ties of the black and environmental movements to the Democratic party are inefficient, arguing that \\"This leaves the communities out in the cold whenever the Republican Party wins.\\". The AAEA has also sponsored creek walks, tours of inner city toxic waste sites, power plants, drinking-water plants, sewage treatment plants, and conservation farms, all with the idea of bringing together mostly white environmentalists with black inner city residents. The AAEA has also lobbied Congress and various state and local agencies to promote protection of the environment. McDonald himself has traveled to countries all over the world, including China and France, to tour nuclear power plants and examine alternate models for keeping the air clean and reducing global warming. Because of his work in environmentalism, Norris McDonald has received various awards including the Environment Magazine Award in 1991, the Conservation award from the National Wildlife Federation in 1997, and the Green Room Energy and Environmental Leadership Award in 2012. In December 2012 he was named one of Ebony magazine‚Äôs Power 100, meaning one of the most influential African Americans in the nation. McDonald was married to Kim-Lee Hawkins in 1991. They divorced in 1994.

The system offers instrumented detection at ranges on the order of and has a wide variety of interference and clutter rejection systems. The system was originally developed as part of the \\"Seek Igloo\\" effort to replace the older radar systems of the DEW line with designs that could be operated remotely and require much less maintenance as part of DEW's replacement, the American-Canadian North Warning System (NWS). Implementation of the NWS resulted in a reduction in operations and maintenance spending by up to 50% compared to previous systems. GE made a number of modifications to the basic design to better tailor it to different roles. To fill a need for the US Marine Corps, GE developed the transportable AN/TPS-59, and later combined design elements to produce the smaller AN/TPS-77 which is even more mobile, requiring only one prime mover in some deployment scenarios. FPS-117s, modified with input from Siemens for German service are known as the RRP-117, while the TPS-77s in service with the RAF are known as the AMES Type 92. An even smaller version was introduced by Lockheed Martin as the TPS-77 MRR. Description=Development of array antennas A key problem for radar systems of the 1950s was the introduction of the carcinotron, a microwave- producing tube that could be rapidly tuned across a wide bandwidth. Scanning rapidly, it appeared to be a constant radiator across an entire band, creating a powerful form of barrage jamming. To overcome this form of jamming, radars of the era were extremely powerful; the AMES Type 85 of the Royal Air Force sent out pulses of at least 8 MW in an effort to overcome the jammer's signal. Systems of such power have a number of practical downsides; cooling such a system is not a small endeavour, and the physical size of the transmitter tubes precludes it from being even partially mobile. During the 1950s, variations on the array antenna were being actively explored by many designers. In these systems, a large number of small antennas work together to produce a single output beam. By introducing small delays, using devices known as phase shifters, the output of the beam could be steered electronically. This offered the possibility of rapid scanning without mechanical movement, which made the systems much easier to produce in a mobile form. The original Marconi Martello offered the same detection capability as the Type 85 from a \\"transportable\\" design using six prime movers. Most early phased array systems used a single transmitter tube, but experiments where every antenna elements had their own transmitter, were underway. In these \\"active array\\" systems, one could use the individual transmitters to produce multiple beams pointing in different directions, which would allow, for instance, some beams to continually track targets while others continued to scan the sky. However, such systems were extremely expensive until the introduction of solid-state transmitter modules. While solid-state systems reduced the price of an antenna array, they did not offer nearly the same power output, even in aggregate. In previous designs, radars typically sent out extremely powerful but very short pulses of signal. The signals were short in time in order to provide reasonable range resolution. Given that the solid-state systems could not reach these power levels, longer pulses would have to be used so the total energy reflected from the target was similar. To regain range resolution, the relatively new technique of pulse compression was widely introduced. By the late 1970s all of these technologies were maturing, and the possibility of fully active radars at reasonable price points emerged for the first time. Seek Igloo The DEW line system across northern Canada and Alaska was built in the 1950s using 1950s-era AN/FPS-19 radars. These used two 500 kW magnetrons on huge always-turning parabolic antenna systems and rooms filled with tube-based electronics to drive them. The systems required constant maintenance by on-site staff and was enormously expensive to operate. Desiring a much simpler, and less-costly, system, in 1977 the Rome Air Development Center (RADC) began the \\"Seek Igloo\\" project to find a replacement for the FPS-19 that would require less power and would run for extended times without maintenance. In 1980, General Electric won the contest with their GE-592 design, and the final design was accepted by RADC on 30 September 1983 and passed acceptance tests that year. Seek Igloo was officially concerned only with the radars in the Alaska area, while Seek Frost addressed the rest of the DEW line. However, the term is widely used to describe the entire development project. Seek Frost also included the shorter-ranged AN/FPS-124 as a gap filler, which was not needed in the Alaska area. North Warning System and others Conversations among NORAD commands about the DEW line had been ongoing for some time, and the Canadian Air Force was aware of the plans to convert to the new radars. As part of the 24-hour whirlwind Shamrock Summit in 1984, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and US President Ronald Reagan signed an agreement to create the North Warning System to replace DEW. Implementation of the North Warning System has resulted in a reduction in operations and maintenance (O&M;) spending by up to 50% compared to DEW. Shortly thereafter, the Air Force purchased another FPS-117 to replace the aging AN/FPS-67 radar at Berlin Tempelhof Airport. During this time, the Royal Air Force had grown concerned about the vulnerability of their Linesman/Mediator radar network. Designed in the era of the hydrogen bomb, the system was entirely unhardened as it was believed such efforts would be futile against multi-megaton attacks. As the strategic balanced changed and conventional attacks became more likely, Linesman appeared trivially easy to defeat. The RAF planned to replace Linesman with the IUKADGE network using the Marconi Martello radars, but as this system dragged on they eventually purchased two AN/FPS-117 as well. Further sales soon followed, and the system remains in production . Over 120 examples have been produced and are operated by 15 countries. AN/TPS-59 AN/TPS-59. The individual transmitter/receiver modules are easily seen in this image. As the first FPS-117 systems were being tested, the US Marine Corps sent out a tender for a air-warning radar with long range and good jamming rejection. In contrast to the Air Force, the Marines required that the system be \\"transportable\\", that is, capable of being moved between locations. GE won the contract with a modified version of the FPS-117, the TPS-59. The TPS-59 was essentially a cut- down version of the FPS-117 split up into several components. The main antenna was mounted on a custom trailer and offloaded at the operational site and then raised and leveled using hydraulic jacks. The remainder of the system was packed into a series of ISO containers that could be carried by any semi- trailer. The first example entered service in 1985. In the 1990s, the Marines sent out another contract for upgrades to their MIM-23 Hawk missile systems to allow them to attack short-range ballistic missiles. The TPS-59(V)3 modified the existing TPS-59 radar sets to provide much higher altitude coverage, up to 500,000 ft. AN/TPS-77 A further version of the series was introduced as the TPS-117, soon renamed TPS-77. This is a further cut-down of the original design, producing a smaller antenna. Combined with modern electronics, the system is now transportable by a single custom prime mover vehicle. This system has replaced most other radars in the UK's network. Description The AESA principle uses active transmitters in each individual antenna in the 44-by-32 antenna array. The transmitters have relatively low individual power, and the combined power of the entire array is about 25 kW, compared to the multi-megawatt transmitters found in earlier radar designs. To compensate for the lower power, much longer pulses are used. To extract accurate range information, the receivers employ pulse compression. The system design includes a redundant architecture with computer software remote controlled and monitored operations to minimize manning requirements. It is typically also equipped with an identification friend or foe system using a second antenna on top. The system is a low power (~20 kW), long range (200-250 nautical miles), L-band pencil beam, search radar with solid-state transmitters. System design includes a redundant architecture with computer software remote controlled and monitored operations to minimize manning requirements. It is typically also equipped with an identification friend or foe system using a second antenna on top. The Air Force and the FAA also operate a limited number of AN/FPS-117 radars within the continental United States. The AN/FPS-117 radar is capable of randomly hopping among 18 channels in the 1215-1400 MHz band. Originally selected for the Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO project, the radar was also picked to replace the United States Air Force's AN/FPS-67 radar at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport and was commissioned at Tempelhof in July 1984. The AN/TPS-77 is a version of the same radar mounted on a transportable platform. This is currently the main radar used by the Royal Air Force. The RRP-117 version is a model which is being supplied to Germany with an offset input from Siemens in fixed-site applications. In 2011, Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract to upgrade the radars to extend their operational lives through 2025.\\"Lockheed Martin to Modernize 29 U.S. Air Force Early Warning Long-Range Surveillance Radars.\\" Lockheed Martin, 7 November 2011.

Its name comes from the word tanggal meaning to remove or take off, because its form is that of a floating disembodied woman's head with its trailing organs still attached. From afar, it twinkles like a ball of flame, providing an explanation for the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon. The penanggalan exists by different names in every country of Southeast Asia. It is known as balan-balan in Sabah, leyak in Bali, kuyang in Kalimantan, palasik in West Sumatra, kra-sue in Thailand, kasu in Laos, ahp in Cambodia, and manananggal in the Philippines. Though commonly referred to in its native languages as a ghost, the penanggalan cannot be readily classified as a classical undead being. Rather, it is a witch that developed the ability to take such a form through meditation in a vat of vinegar. The creature is, for all intents and purposes, a living human being during daytime or at any time when it does not detach itself from its body.  Nature  Penanggalan In Malaysian folklore, penanggal are mortal women who practice black magic. To become a penanggal, a woman must meditate during a ritual bath in vinegar, with her whole body submerged except for the head. Only active in penanggal form at night, the creature regularly soaks its organs in vinegar to shrink them for easy entry back into her body. The penanggal thus carries an odor of vinegar wherever she flies, and returns to her body during the daytime, passing as an ordinary woman. However, a penanggal can always be told from an ordinary woman by the smell of vinegar. The penanggal was also mentioned in Hikayat Abdullah, written in 1845, much to the amusement of Sir Stamford Raffles.Hikayat Abdullah Modern urban legends offer alternative views of the penanggal. This includes being the result of a curse, or the breaking of a demonic pact. One story tells of a young woman who was taking a ritual bath in a tub that once held vinegar. While bathing herself and in a state of concentration or meditation, a man entered the room without warning and startled her. The woman was so shocked that she jerked her head up to look, moving so quickly as to sever her head from her body, her organs and entrails pulling out of the neck opening. Enraged by what the man had done, she flew after him, a vicious head trailing organs and dripping venom. Her empty body was left behind in the vat.  Victims  The penanggalans victims are traditionally pregnant women and young children. As traditional Malay dwellings were stilt-houses, the penanggal hides under the stilts of the house and uses its long tongue to lap up the blood of the new mother. Those whose blood the penanggalan feeds upon contract a wasting disease that is almost inescapably fatal. Furthermore, even if the penanggalan is not successful in her attempt to feed, anyone who is brushed by the dripping entrails will suffer painful open sores that won't heal without a bomoh's help. The most common protection against a penanggal attack is to scatter the thorny leaves of any of the subspecies of a local plant known as mengkuang, which has sharp thorny leaves and would either trap or injure the exposed lungs, stomach and intestines of the penanggal as it flies in search of its prey. These thorns, on the vine, can also be looped around the windows of a house in order to snare the trailing organs. This is commonly done when a woman has just given birth. The shards of glass glued to the top of the walls around a house serve the same purpose, in addition to protecting against thieves. As an extra precaution, the pregnant woman can keep scissors or betel nut cutters under her pillow, as the penanggalan is afraid of these items. Once the penanggal leaves its body and is safely away, it may be permanently destroyed by either pouring pieces of broken glass into the empty neck cavity, which will sever the internal organs of the penanggal when it reattaches to the body; or by sanctifying the body and then destroying it by cremation or by somehow preventing the penanggal from reattaching to its body upon sunrise. Another non-lethal way to get rid of penanggalan is to turn over the body, so that when the head attached back it will be attached reverse side, thereby revealing to everyone what she really is.The Vampire Book: Vampires in Malaysia Hantu Penanggalan/Balan-balan  Differences from manananggal  Unlike the Filipino manananggal, all penanggal are females and there is no variation in Malaysian folklore to suggest a penanggal to be male. Another notable difference between them is that a penanggal detaches only her head with her lungs, stomach and intestines attached while leaving the body before coming back and soaking her innards in a prepared container filled with vinegar to fit back into the body. Also, the manananggal is usually described as having a normal human head. While the penanggal is often described the same way, some also have fangs. Modern depictions commonly give it two fangs like a European vampire, but traditional descriptions have the fangs as more rakshasa-like.  In popular culture  The penanggalan was listed as a monster in the 1981 Dungeons & Dragons rulebook Fiend Folio. In Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others comics, Hellboy travels to Malaysia in 1958 where a village devoid of Bomoh shaman has fallen victim to a demonic penanggalan. In the 2016 Image Comic Cry Havoc a character named Sri reveals that she is a penanggalan and describes how her head detaches from her body and \\"slithers around like an electric eel\\". The miniature game Malifaux by Wyrd Miniatures contains a character Yin the Penangalan. Penanggalans are enemies in the 2019 video game Indivisible, where they attack by spitting bile.

With 66 trails,http://www.skisolitude.com/community/ and vertical, Solitude is one of the smaller ski resorts near Salt Lake City, along with its neighbor Brighton. It is a family-oriented mountain, with a wider range of beginner and intermediate slopes than other nearby ski resorts; 50% of its slopes are graded \\"beginner\\" or \\"intermediate,\\" the highest such ratio in the Salt Lake City area. Solitude was one of the first major US resorts to adopt an RFID lift ticket system, allowing lift lines to move more efficiently while reducing \\"lift poaching\\". It was followed by Alta Ski Area in 2007. Solitude is adjacent to Brighton Ski Resort near the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Solitude and Brighton offer a common \\"Solbright Pass\\" which provides access to both resorts for a nominal surcharge. The Mountain Most of Solitude's trails descend from a ridge (Eagle Ridge trail) which runs parallel with The Big Cottonwood Canyon Scenic Byway as it rises up the center of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Two lifts‚Äîquad chairs Powder Horn II and Eagle Express‚Äîrun to the top of Eagle Ridge, while quads Apex Express and Moonbeam Express feed the intermediate and beginner terrain (respectively) immediately below it. The back of Eagle Ridge drops into Honeycomb Canyon, a long valley with most of the resort's bowl skiing. Honeycomb Canyon is primarily accessed by the Summit Express lift, which runs behind Eagle Ridge to the mountain's summit; return access from the bottom of Honeycomb Canyon is also available via the Honeycomb Return quad. The Summit Express lift also provides access to adjacent Brighton Ski Resort. Two more lifts, Link double and Sunrise triple, provide dedicated skiing areas for beginners. History Solitude was first developed for skiing by Moab, Utah, uranium tycoon Robert M. Barrett. Barrett decided to start his own ski resort after being denied the use of the restrooms at Alta, which were reserved for Alta guests only. He started construction at Solitude in 1956, having bought all the land in Big Cottonwood Canyon, the next canyon over from Alta. The resort opened for business one year later, and passed through ownership changes until it was acquired by a business group led by Gary DeSeelhorst in 1977. DeSeelhorst became the resort's sole owner in 1986 and implemented an aggressive renovation project, including the 1989 construction of Utah's first express quad chairlift, Eagle Express. Accommodations upgrades in this period included the construction of the Creekside lodge in 1995. On October 3, 2014, Deer Valley Resort announced that they had entered into an agreement to buy Solitude from the DeSeelhorst family and took over operation of the resort on May 1, 2015.http://blog.deervalley.com/skiing/deer-valley-resorts-purchase-of- solitude-mountain-resort-official During the summer of 2015 under the new leadership of Deer Valley Resort, Doppelmayr constructed a new high speed detachable quad to replace the existing Summit double chairlift, with a new alignment. The new Summit Express lift, combined with a new access trail from the top of the Apex Express lift, decreases the travel time to Honeycomb Canyon. In August 2017, parent resort Deer Valley was acquired by Alterra Mountain Company. Solitude continued to be owned by the former Deer Valley ownership for one more season until it was announced on June 20, 2018 that Solitude had agreed to be sold to Alterra. Solitude is the host for the snowboardcross and ski cross events for the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2019. Solitude will be the first resort in Utah to implement basic parking fees. Visitors will be charged as much as $20 per day to park beginning November 23, 2019. Solitude Nordic Center Solitude Resort also operates a nordic center. The Solitude Nordic Center, nestled between the Solitude and Brighton ski areas, offers a variety of nordic sport opportunities, including snowshoeing, skate and classic cross-country skiing. The site's 13 cross-country skiing trails cover twelve miles (almost 20 km) evenly divided between \\"easiest\\" and \\"moderately difficult\\", including a long loop of two miles (3 km). Six snowshoe trails cover six miles (ten kilometers). Instruction and training workshops are offered.

Published since 1984, it is the world's leading magazine on that subject.Garden Trains Association website: gardentrains.org Each issue features hobby news, product reviews, how-to articles, featured railroads from around the world, photo galleries, and much more. Publication is slated to cease after the Fall 2020 issue. Garden Railways magazine began publication in 1984 by Sidestreet Bannerworks. The magazine evolved from the company's newsletter, the Sidestreet Banner, which dealt primarily with the small scale live-steam locomotives that the company was importing at that time. Marc Horovitz was the Editor and Barbara Horovitz the Horticultural Editor. Garden Railways' first issue The first issues of Garden Railways were published in black-and-white. Text was generated on a typewriter. In 1985, a primitive IBM computer and a daisy-wheel printer were acquired, which allowed text to be printed out in justified columns. These columns, printed out in strips, were then pasted up by hand in the old-fashioned way. Petria MacDonnell joined GR's staff at the beginning of 1986 as the magazine's first gardening editor, later succeeded by Chip Rosenblum, Barbara Abler, and Don Parker. Among the regular contributors in the magazine's early years was Peter Jones, who had a column in every issue until his death in 2009. The magazine continued to grow, becoming an international publication with contributors from all over the world. In August 1985, Garden Railways, along with the Denver Garden Railway Society, sponsored the first ever Garden Railway Convention, in Denver, Colorado. The National Garden Railway Conventions continue today, though they are events hosted by local clubs and are no longer affiliated with Garden Railways magazine. The May‚ÄìJune 1986 issue of GR was the first that appeared with an arched title on the cover, which became a trademark of the magazine. With the November‚ÄìDecember 1986 issue, Garden Railways appeared with its first full- color cover. After that, color was gradually incorporated into the inside of the magazine, too. In 1996, Garden Railways was sold to Kalmbach Publishing Company in Wisconsin. Marc Horovitz remained as editor of the magazine in Denver while Barb Horovitz, the magazine's former Horticultural Editor, retired the following year. Pat Hayward was Horticultural Editor from 1997-2008. Nancy Norris joined the staff in 2008 and remains the current Horticultural Editor. Rene Schweitzer, the magazine's production editor, joined the staff in 1998 and remains there today. Marc Horovitz stepped down as editor in October 2018 and Kent Johnson became editor in November 2018. In October 2019, Kent was promoted to Producer of MR Video Plus, and Hal Miller became editor. Cody Grivno and Dana Kawala, both from Model Railroader magazine, help the staff by writing in-house product reviews and offering technical support. On July 15th, 2020 it was announced that the magazine would cease publication after the Fall 2020 issue. Some aspects of the magazine will move to Model Railroader. The magazine's content Garden Railways' Summer 2019 issue Garden Railways is published quarterly. Each issue contains hobby- related articles on a variety of subjects, including featured garden railroads, how-to projects, landscaping and gardening, photo galleries, and more. Each issue includes new product information and reviews of products relating to large-scale trains, such as locomotives, rolling stock, sound systems, books, and more. Regular departments include \\"Garden railway basics,\\" aimed at beginners; \\"Plant portraits,\\" a featured miniature plant targeted toward railroad gardeners; \\"Greening your railway,\\" a gardening/hardscaping column; \\"One-page project\\", where readers share a short how-to project.

Such patterns also are known as \\"pollen guides\\" and \\"honey guides\\", though some authorities argue for the abandonment of such terms in favour of floral guides (see for example Dinkel & LunauDinkel T., Lunau K.: How drone flies (Eristalis tenax L., Syrphidae, Diptera) use floral guides to locate food sources. Journal of Insect Physiology Volume 47, Issue 10, September 2001, Pages 1111-1118). These patterns are sometimes visible to humans; for instance, the Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria genistifolia) has yellow flowers with orange nectar guides. However, in some plants, such as sunflowers, they are visible only when viewed in ultraviolet light. Under ultraviolet, the flowers have a darker center, where the nectaries are located, and often specific patterns upon the petals as well. This is believed to make the flowers more attractive to pollinators such as honey bees and other insects that can see ultraviolet. This page on butterflies shows an animated comparison of black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) flowers in visible and UV light. The ultraviolet color, invisible to humans, has been referred to as bee violet, and mixtures of greenish (yellow) wavelengths (roughly 540 nmBriscoe, Adriana D.; Chittka, Lars. The Evolution of Color Vision in Insects. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2001. 46:471‚Äì510) with ultraviolet are called bee purple by analogy with purple in human vision.

The younger brother of Hans Sebald Beham, he was born into a family of artists in Nuremberg. Learning his art from his elder brother, and Albrecht D√ºrer, he was particularly active as an engraver during the 1520s, creating tiny works of magnificent detail, positioning him in the German printmaking school known as the \\"Little Masters\\". He was also fascinated with antiquity and may have worked with Marcantonio Raimondi in Bologna and Rome at some time in his career. In 1525, along with his brother and Georg Pencz, the so-called \\"godless painters\\", he was banished from Lutheran Nuremberg for asserting his disbelief in baptism, Christ, or transubstantiation. Although later pardoned, he moved to Catholic Munich to work for the Bavarian dukes William IV and Ludwig X. Whilst there, his exceptional talent established him as one of Germany's principal portrait painters, favoured by distinguished patrons such as Emperor Charles V. According to Joachim von Sandrart, he died in Italy during a trip under the patronage of Duke William.

It is owned and operated by Boyne Resorts. Description Brighton Ski Resort was the first ski resort in Utah, and one of the first in the United States. Brighton was started in 1936 when members of the Alpine Ski Club built a rope tow from wire and an old elevator motor. The resort was named for Thomas W. Brighton, who is credited with constructing the first buildings in the area. In 1943, Zane Doyle and Willard Jensen purchased the T-bar from K Smith. In 1954 when there was talk of expansion, Willard insisted that going out on a limb to build a double chair lift instead of another T-bar was worth the risk. Those important changes were able to come about when in 1955 Zane‚Äôs brother-in-law, Dean L Jensen sold his Idaho business and joined Willard and Zane to build the first double chair lift, Mt Majestic, which was constructed parallel to the old T-bar. Mary Lift was installed in 1959 and in 1963 the trio bought out Brighton Recreation Company, which owned Millicent Lift, and Brighton Ski Bowl was off and running. The Doyle and Jensen ski operation became successful and was owned and operated by Willard, his son Dean and grandson, Gilbert Jensen; Zane and his sons Michael and Randy Doyle. Boyne Resorts purchased the resort in 1986. Boyne sold Brighton to CNL Lifestyle in 2007, but continued to operate the property under a lease.CNL INCOME PROPERTIES ACQUIRES BRIGHTON SKI RESORT CNL sold the property to Och-Ziff Capital Management in 2016. Boyne Resorts repurchased the resort in May 2018 from Och-Ziff Capital Management. Brighton claims to be a \\"no-frills\\" resort whose sole business is to provide skiers and snowboarders with top-notch trails. While it does provide lodging, dining, and shopping, the extent of the facilities does not make Brighton what is typically seen as a destination ski resort. Most Brighton skiers and riders are Utah locals. Most visitors do not stay at Brighton-run lodging; many visitors stay in the greater Salt Lake area, many of whom also plan trips to other area ski resorts. Brighton is also known for its extensive backcountry access, visitors can purchase single ride lift tickets to reach the backcountry access gates at the top of the resort. Although the terrain inbounds at Brighton can rival that of the backcountry, Brighton is known for its cliffs, chutes, bowls and natural features. Brighton was voted to have the 2nd best snow in North America, losing the top spot to its neighbor Snowbird Ski & Summer Resort.http://snowboarding.transworld.net/1000162429/resorts/resort- poll-2012-top-10-best-snow/2/ Brighton is on public lands; all of the resort's land is part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, meaning the whole resort is open to the public year-round, though tickets must be purchased to use the lifts. Brighton is a local favorite. The resort offers a variety of special deals throughout the year that allow locals to ski cheaply. Generally, during the first Wednesdays in December, the resort offers a promotion called \\"Quad Wednesdays\\" where, if one brings an item to contribute to a local charity, one gets his or her lift ticket for one fourth the cost of a regular-priced ticket. Brighton is adjacent to Solitude Mountain Resort, and the two ski areas offer a common \\"Solbright Pass\\" which provides access to both resorts for a nominal surcharge. Transit between the two mountains is provided from Solitude to Brighton via the Solbright run off the Summit Express on Solitude, or via the Evergreen trail off the Milly Express on Brighton. Brighton has some of the most extensive night skiing in the Western U.S., with over , three lifts, and its main mountain terrain park. Night-skiing occurs from 4:00 to 9:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday, from early December through early April. Brighton is closed for night skiing on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year‚Äôs Eve. Trivia The Disney Channel Original Movie, Johnny Tsunami, was filmed at Brighton Ski Resort.

The magazine lasted 136 issues from 1989 to 2000. The magazine was formed when, in the wake of selling ACE to EMAP, Future split the dual-format title ST/Amiga Format into two separate publications (the other being ST Format). At the height of its success the magazines sold over 170,000 copies per month, topping 200,000 with its most successful ever issue. History A cover disk featuring game and animation demos. Amiga Format can be thought of the \\"mother\\" or \\"big sister\\" magazine of Amiga Power, which it both predated and outlived. Whereas Amiga Power was strictly games-only, Amiga Format covered all aspects of Amiga computers, both hardware and software, both application and gaming uses. A further spin-off was Amiga Shopper, which dealt purely with the hardware and \\"serious\\" software side of the Amiga scene. The magazine was published on a monthly basis and offered various multi-issue tutorials on different application software, such as C programming or LightWave graphics rendering. The last tutorial was cut short in the middle because of the cancellation of the magazine. Amiga Format pioneered the concept of putting complete application software on a magazine coverdisk as a response to a moratorium on complete games titles being cover-mounted. Amiga Format was the second-to-last regularly issued print magazine about the Amiga in the United Kingdom. The last was Amiga Active, which ran for 26 issues from October 1999, although Amiga Format was the only such magazine after CU Amiga Magazine's closure in October 1998 until the launch of Amiga Active. Regular features=Reader Games A notable regular feature in the later stage of the magazine (introduced by then-editor Nick Veitch) was Readers' Games. Here readers of the magazine could send in games they had programmed themselves, and the magazine staff would then publish a brief review of them. In the CD- ROM edition of the magazine, all the Readers' Games were also included on the covermount CD-ROM. Most of the games were written in AMOS BASIC or Blitz BASIC. In one issue a competition was run to find the best game developed by a reader using a previously covermounted version of Blitz BASIC. A game called Total Wormage was entered by Andy Davidson. Although Total Wormage was disqualified as it was not submitted with working source code, Acid Software introduced Andy Davidson to Team17 at ECTS show in the same year which was the beginning of the legendary Worms. Emulators While the continuing uncertainty about the Amiga platform's future slowed software development, there was an increase in the interest surrounding emulation software. Longtime contributor Simon Goodwin contributed one of the longest running series to the magazine, which broke down emulators by target platform and went through the mechanics of getting them working Just the FAQs Introduced in issue 129 and continuing until the final issue, Just the FAQs consisted of a single page each month containing an interview with a prominent figure in the Amiga community, with the exception of the January 2000 issue (published in December 1999), which instead explained the limited effects the Year 2000 problem would have on the Amiga.Olaf Barthel, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, January 2000 (issue 132), 86 Interviews were conducted with Chris Wiles (managing director of Active Technologies), Neil Bothwick (founder of the Wirenet ISP), Alan Redhouse (of Eyetech), Wolf Dietrich (head of Phase 5 Digital Products), Andrew Elia (of AmigaSoc), and Ben Hermans (of Hyperion Entertainment).Chris Wiles, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, November 1999 (issue 129), 92Neil Bothwick, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, December 1999 (issue 130), 92Alan Redhouse, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, Christmas 1999 (issue 131), 86Wolf Dietrich, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, February 2000 (issue 133), 86Andrew Elia, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, March 2000 (issue 134), 78Ben Hermans, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, April 2000 (issue 135), 78 In the final issue, a special interview was conducted with Eric Schwartz's cartoon character Sabrina.Eric Schwartz, \\"Just the FAQs\\", Amiga Format, May 2000 (issue 136), 78 Backstage Backstage was a four-page newsletter sent to subscribers with each issue. The tone of the newsletter was less formal than that of the magazine, and it would often provide behind-the-scenes information on the activities of prominent members of the Amiga Format staff. Backstage also gave details of the contents of the Subscribers' Superdisk (an extra floppy disk sent to subscribers, whose contents were also stored in a password-protected archive on the cover CD), and featured special offers for subscribers.

During the winter months, a skating rink was built next to the community centre, so that the washrooms could serve double duty as space for people to put their skates. The community centre itself was small, consisting of a main hall that was used for events, along with a small kitchen and storage room. In later years, two trailers were parked near the building to add extra room. The centre and the park were both removed to allow for construction of the school in the late 1980s. In 1985, overcrowding of schools in growing communities such as Bridlewood, prompted the school board to call for a new elementary school in the area, which was realized in 1988.  Programs  Bridlewood C.E.S. has a computer lab, a gym, and a library with a collection of over 29 500 books. Bridlewood also supports a Special Support Unit, a Gifted class, an ESL class, a Dual diagnosis class, and an after school daycare. Bridlewood is the home of a pilot case for restorative justice program to prevent bullying.  Music  The school is notable for its Senior Band led by grade 7/8 music teacher, Mr. Williamson. Since 1987, the Senior Band has made an annual trip to Toronto to participate in competitive performances at Canada's Wonderland and to visit attractions such as Niagara Falls, Marineland of Canada, and Clifton Hill.  High voltage transmission line controversy  In 1986, community activist Judy Hunter started a campaign against Ontario Hydro constructing high-voltage power lines through Bridlewood over concerns that its electromagnetic field would pose health risks such as increasing rates of cancer to the students at Bridlewood Community Elementary School. Hunter's campaign lost an appeal to the cabinet of Ontario in 1986 and failed to get a court injunction blocking construction of the lines in 1988. On December 14, 1989, Charles Caccia, the Liberal MP for Davenport brought up the issue in the House of Commons when he presented a motion urging the government of Brian Mulroney to investigate the health effects of electromagnetic fields from high voltage transmission lines. The campaign against the powerlines ended in the 1990s.

Richardson and then a draftsman with Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge. Howard completed many notable projects and was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1901. Career After practicing in New York, Howard moved to California in 1901 to execute the Hearst Plan as the supervising architect of the Master Plan for the University of California, Berkeley campus, and for founding the University of California's architecture program. Among his most famous buildings are the Campanile, California Memorial Stadium, Sather Gate, and the Hearst Greek Theatre, all located at Berkeley. The Electric Tower at the Pan-American Exposition Howard also designed the centerpiece of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the Electric Tower, several buildings at the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition in Seattle, and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. Some of his works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In 1910 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

Also known as the Sky Island Scenic Byway, the Mount Lemmon Highway and Arizona Forest Highway 39, the Catalina Highway is the only paved roadway providing access to the resort village of Summerhaven as well as various recreational and scientific facilities located near the summit of Mount Lemmon. Ascending from the desert floor in Tucson to near the summit of Mount Lemmon, the short highway gains over , showcasing a variety of climates ranging from lowland desert to alpine forests. The name sky island comes from the analogy of these mountains being like islands of forest in a sea of desert. It is designated as a scenic byway by the National Scenic Byways Program. and an Arizona Scenic Road by the Federal Highway Administration.  Route description  The Catalina Highway traverses the rugged terrain of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The Catalina Highway begins at its intersection with Tanque Verde Road in northeast Tucson, traversing the unincorporated community of Tanque Verde before crossing into the Coronado National Forest. At this point, the roadway officially becomes the General Hitchcock Highway (Arizona Forest Highway 39), although many maps reflect the common usage of \\"Catalina Highway\\" to refer to the entire roadway. From the boundary with the National Forest, the highway takes a winding route through the Santa Catalina Mountains by way of Molino Canyon. Due to the rapid gain in elevation there are numerous switchbacks, but the road follows a generally northward direction until reaching Forest Road 9 and Rose Canyon Lake, after which it begins traveling in a generally northwestern direction to the village of Summerhaven. The final segment of the road, sometimes signed as Ski Run Road, heads east to the Mount Lemmon Ski Valley and ultimately approaches its final terminus near the summit of Mount Lemmon.  History  Gordon Hirabayashi, seen here in 1986, was one of many Japanese-Americans forced to work on the highway's construction. Construction on the Catalina Highway began in 1933, owing in large part to the efforts of Frank Harris Hitchcock, former Postmaster General of the United States. In order to create a route to the popular destinations at the summit of Mount Lemmon, Hitchcock spearheaded the effort to bring together the funds and resources to construct an improved road to Summerhaven and nearby facilities. As a part of the effort, a federal prison camp was established at the foot of the mountains specifically to supply labor for the construction of the highway. During World War II, the camp was converted into an internment camp named the Catalina Honor Camp, and the internees were forced to work on construction of the roadway. One of the Japanese American prisoners at the camp, Gordon Hirabayashi, was later honored in 1999 when the site of the Honor Camp was converted into the Gordon Hirabayashi Recreation Area. The highway would not be completed until 1950, 17 years after it began. Upon its completion, the highway was named after Hitchcock, who had died in 1935. The original paved road was narrow, in places had little or no shoulder, featured vertical drop-offs near the road, and was bumpy along most of its length due to years of patchwork repairs. It was long regarded as \\"one of the most dangerous roads in Pima County.\\" In 1988, the Federal Lands Highway program began a series of seven projects aimed at significantly improving the roadway, with the assistance of the US Forest Service and Pima County. The projects were aimed at improving the quality of the roadway and increasing safety for travelers, while minimizing the impact on the visual aspects and natural beauty of the surrounding mountains. The final project was completed in 2007, at a cost of $15 million, and the road is now much wider and features adequate shoulders, passing areas, and extensive guard rails. The roadway was awarded with the Arizona Engineering Excellence Grand Award for Context Sensitive Design in 2005 for minimizing damage to existing terrain and pinnacles and careful preservation of the delicate environment.  Tourism  The Catalina Highway is a common destination for motorcyclists. The Catalina Highway provides the only paved access to attractions on Mount Lemmon and the Santa Catalina Mountains, and has become a popular destination for tourism in the region. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the Catalina Highway is traveled over by more than one million visitors every year. Among the many recreational opportunities in the Coronado National Forest, through which the highway travels, are numerous campgrounds and picnic sites, multi-use trails, and scenic views. The Mount Lemmon Ski Valley, located at the summit of the highway, operates a ski slope during the winter months and remains open during the summer, offering summer \\"sky rides\\" on the ski lift. It is billed as the southernmost ski resort in the continental United States. In addition to the numerous recreational activities the highway offers access to, the highway's status as a Scenic Drive is a draw in and of itself. The Forest Service describes the drive as a biological and ecological tour from Mexico to Canada in only 27 miles. Over the length of the drive, visitors will encounter saguaro cacti, mesquite trees, and cholla plants of the Sonoran Desert, pass through stands of oak, juniper, and pinyon pine, enter pine forests and then finally stands of fir and aspen on the cooler, north-facing slopes at the end of the highway. The scenic vistas afforded along the highway, along with the terrain, make it a common destination for leisure travel and motorcycling. The route is also popular with bicycling enthusiasts, providing a significant challenge of skill. Local cycling organizations regularly organize rides consisting of 200 or more riders along the highway to the summit of the mountain. October 2010 saw the inaugural running of the Mount Lemmon Marathon which saw nearly 800 participants finish the race from near the start of the highway up to Summerhaven.

It follows an university lecturer Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln) who becomes involved in a series of supernatural events surrounding medium Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp). The series aired on ITV for two seasons from 24 September 2005 to 11 November 2006.Delgado, Tony, \\"ITV axes 'Afterlife' after two series\\" Digital Spy, 18 June 2007. Plot The main characters of the programme are the psychic Alison Mundy (played by Lesley Sharp) and the academic who becomes involved with her due to his skeptical interest in the paranormal, Dr Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln). Set in Bristol, each of the six one-hour episodes of the first series sees Alison become involved in the appearance of a spirit and attempting to discover why it has come back to haunt the living. Robert becomes involved in the first episode, when Alison first moves to Bristol and her activities inadvertently result in the suicide of one of his students. Following this, Robert decides to study Alison for a book. Alison's interest in Robert stems from her ability to see the spirit of his young son, whom Robert cannot see. Throughout the series a recurring theme is Alison's attempt to have Robert fully come to terms with the death of his son so that the boy's spirit can be eased and he can fully move on. In the first series it is learnt that Alison was seriously injured in a train crash several years before. The other survivors of the train crash seek her out to contact their own lost loved ones in the final episode of the first series, almost causing Alison's own death. Later, in the second series, it is established that Alison had these powers since she was little, the first 'ghost' she saw was her grandfather. During the second series, Robert is diagnosed with cancer. He dies in the series finale, after having spent much of the series helping Alison to overcome mental problems brought about by the ghost of her mother. He also reconciles her with her father.

Volk also wrote five of the six episodes of the first series, the exception being the fifth episode which was scripted by Charlie Fletcher. The producer was Murray Ferguson, and the directors were Maurice Phillips (episodes 1 & 2), Charles Beeson (episodes 3 & 6) and Martyn Friend (episodes 4 & 5). The second series was directed by Charles Beeson, Martyn Friend and Ashley Pearce. The episodes were written by Stephen Volk, Mark Greig, Guy Burt and Mike Cullen. The music for both series was composed by Edmund Butt. Volk had originally conceived the series during the mid-1990s according to SFX magazine, when \\"ITV was fleetingly interested in producing a homegrown supernatural series because of The X-Files' success [in the UK].\\"\\"Ghost Watching: Afterlife is about to bring the supernatural to ITV...\\", SFX, Issue dated March 2005 The series remained unmade until Clerkenwell Films became interested, as did Lesley Sharp, the actress being very keen to star in the series. \\"She absolutely loved it and actually pestered ITV relentlessly, asking 'When are you gonna commission this series?' Eventually they did,\\" Volk told SFX. Following the success of the first series, a second run was commissioned, beginning on 16 September 2006 on ITV in the UK.\\"SF TV Round-Up...\\", SFX, Issue dated December 2005 The first run has been released on DVD in the UK, including audio commentaries from the cast and crew. The first series began a repeat run on ITV in the UK on Sunday evenings from 9pm from 23 July, although this was quickly abandoned and the repeats moved across to the digital television channel ITV3. Critical reception Previewing the first episode as one of \\"Today's Choices\\" for its day of transmission in the Radio Times listings magazine, television critic Alison Graham praised Afterlife as \\"[A] highly- promising mystery series... a taut and snappy spine-tingler, even if it does use some old-hat shocker techniques such as creaking floorboards, darkness, inexplicable noises and unexpected taps on the shoulder.\\"Graham, Alison, \\"Today's Choices: Afterlife\\", Radio Times, volume 326, number 4252, issue dated 24‚Äì30 September 2005, page 60 Reviewing the same episode for The Guardian newspaper two days after its broadcast, critic Rupert Smith was also impressed: \\"What looked like being a deeply depressing hour was instantly enlivened by the appearance of Lesley Sharp, who has become in recent years television's favourite Everywoman... At last I can put my hand on my heart and give an unqualified cheer to a new primetime British drama series. Afterlife was scary without being over-gruesome, it kept a straight face while gleefully narrating a plot of pure old-fashioned hokum and it starred actors who are constantly, entirely watchable... Afterlife took the best bits of The X-Files, Jonathan Creek and, yes, Most Haunted, and turned them into terrific television.\\"Smith, Rupert, \\"The weekend's TV\\" The Guardian, Monday 26 September 2005 The response remained positive through to the end of the series, with all subsequent episodes also being included in \\"Today's Choices\\" in the Radio Times. Previewing the sixth episode, Alison Graham was again positive, describing the series as a whole as having been \\"[A] consistently high-quality supernatural drama.\\"Graham, Alison, \\"Today's Choices: Afterlife\\", Radio Times, volume 327, number 4257, issue dated 29 October ‚Äì 4 November 2005, page 68 Afterlife was also a success for ITV in terms of viewing figures.

The hall opened in July, 2004 with a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 8 by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. In that year the orchestra, previously without a permanent home, took up residence. Well known for its acoustics, the hall has seen concerts by Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic and Riccardo Muti and the Vienna Philharmonic. The bell to announce the imminent start of a concert at the hall is a recording of the bell at Salzburg Cathedral. T≈çhoku earthquake and 2-year closure of hall Despite being over three hundred kilometres from the epicentre, the hall was greatly damaged in the March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. The ceiling collapsed. Much of the acoustical paneling and related material was destroyed. Ruptures to the automatic fire-sprinkler system caused widespread water damage. As a result, the hall was closed. Performances during much of 2011 were cancelled. Those sufficiently far into the future at the time of the disaster were rescheduled for other Kawasaki and neighboring-city venues, still under the auspices of Muza Kawasaki Symphony Hall. A plan for repair and reconstruction was established. Funds were secured, partly from government sources. A fund- raising concert at the Salzburger Festspiele with Anna Netrebko, Piotr Beczala, and Ivor Bolton conducting the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg helped raise additional money. The restored hall is expected to open on 1 April 2013.

Publication history Soglow's character first appeared on June 7, 1930 in The New Yorker and soon showed signs of becoming a successful strip. The Little King began publications in comic book issues from 1933, was licensed for a 1933-34 series of animated cartoons by Van Beuren Studios and featured in advertising campaigns for Standard Oil from The Comics Journal #286 and Royal Pudding (1955). It became evident early on that William Randolph Hearst was determined to add The Little King to his King Features Syndicate newspaper strips, but he was hindered by Soglow's contractual obligations with The New Yorker. While seeing out the final period of the contract, Soglow produced a placeholder strip for King Features, The Ambassador, quite similar to The Little King in characters, style and story situations. One week after its final publication in The New Yorker, The Little King resumed as a King Features Sunday strip, on September 9, 1934. Otto Soglow's The Little King (1939) The strip continued a successful run with several more animated cartoon appearances and advertising campaigns,Gallery of classic graphic design featuring The Little King as spokesman for Royal Gelatine and Pudding and Soglow was awarded the 1966 National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award for the strip. The Little King ran until Soglow's death in 1975. The final strip ran on July 20, 1975. Format The strip is notable for having virtually no dialogue; the title character never speaks. The Ambassador was nearly identical in format, and the main characters of the two strips were similar. When The Ambassador gave way for The Little King in 1934, the reader could not be certain if it was the Little King who had arrived into Hearst syndication or the Ambassador who had removed some disguise. The Little King (mustachioed, bearded, and clad in velvet and ermine) was small of stature, but as wide as he was tall. He was a childlike, cheerful fellow who lived to have fun. The final panel of the comic strip often showed His Majesty pursuing a hobby, playing a children's game, flirting with a pretty woman, or otherwise enjoying himself in an unkingly fashion while neglecting his \\"official\\" duties. Animated theatrical shorts All cartoon shorts were produced by Van Beuren Studios except where otherwise noted. All of the theatrical shorts were released to DVD by Thunderbean Animation.Thunderbean Animation As in the comic strips, the Little King never speaks in the 1933 and 1934 shorts except for a brief sequence in \\"Marching Along\\" (1933). 1933 *A.M. to P.M.

Donovan played Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899‚Äì1902), and Detroit Tigers (1903‚Äì1912). In 1901, he led the National League with 25 wins. He later helped Detroit win three consecutive American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. In 1907, he compiled a 25‚Äì4 record with a 2.12 earned run average (ERA). In 18 major league seasons, Donovan appeared in 378 games as a pitcher and compiled a 186‚Äì139 win‚Äìloss record with 289 complete games and a 2.69 ERA in 2,964‚Öî innings pitched. Donovan was also a better than average hitting pitcher, posting a .193 batting average (251-for-1,302) scoring 142 runs with 7 home runs, 94 RBI and drawing 77 bases on balls. After retiring as a player, Donovan served as a manager and coach. He was the player-manager of the Providence Grays in 1913 and 1914, leading the club to the International League pennant in 1914 with help from rookie pitcher Babe Ruth. He next served as player-manager of the New York Yankees from 1915 to 1917. He served as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers in 1918 and managed the Jersey City Skeeters in 1919 and 1920. He managed the Philadelphia Phillies for the first half of the 1921 season and then concluded his career as manager of the Hartford Eastern League team in 1922 and 1923. He died in a train crash in December 1923 while traveling to baseball's winter meetings. Early life Donovan was born in 1876 in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The family moved to Philadelphia when Donovan was a baby. Donovan began playing baseball in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park and became a member of the Park Sparrows baseball team. Professional baseball player=Washington Senators (1898) Donovan made his major league debut at age 21 with the Washington Senators on April 22, 1898. That year, he appeared in 20 games as an outfielder, 17 as a pitcher, and one game each as a shortstop and second baseman. As a pitcher, he compiled a 1‚Äì6 record with a 4.30 earned run average (ERA). He did not fare well at the plate either, compiling a .165 batting average in 103 at bats. \\"Wild Bill\\" By 1898, Donovan had earned the nickname \\"Wild Bill\\" for his lack of control. On June 3, one of his pitches hit Dummy Hoy in the ribs causing several hemorrhages. In his first six games, he reportedly \\"came within an ace of killing a man in each game\\". After a relief appearance in early July, a sports writer expressed surprise that \\"'Wild Bill' Donovan went to the slab and finished the game without killing a soul.\\" Later in his career, Donovan's control improved. Former umpire Billy Evans later wrote that the nickname was somewhat ironic because \\"control was Donovan's greatest asset\\" in the last ten years of his pitching career. Yet, the dangerous image conjured up by the nickname worked in Donovan's favor, as noted by Evans: \\"Realizing the value of psychology, [Donovan] made use of the fear that the name 'Wild Bill' carried to every American League batsman. Few hitters hugged the plate with Donovan pitching, and at opportune moment Bill would cut loose with a wild pitch that would heighten the fear.\\" Brooklyn Superbas (1899‚Äì1902) Donovan began the 1899 season in the minor leagues with the Richmond Champions of the Atlantic League. He compiled a 17‚Äì4 record in 22 games for Richmond. On July 27, 1899, he was purchased by the Brooklyn Superbas for $500. He appeared in only five games for Brooklyn in 1899, compiling a 1‚Äì2 record. In 1900, he spent most of the season with the Hartford Indians of the Eastern League. He appeared in 40 games and compiled a 25‚Äì14 record with a 3.81 ERA in 347 innings pitched. With a strong showing in Hartford, Donovan returned to Brooklyn and had one of the best seasons of his career. During the 1901 season, he appeared in 45 games, 38 as a starter, threw 36 complete games, and compiled a 25‚Äì15 record with a 2.77 ERA in 351 innings pitched. He led the National Leagues with 25 wins and 45 pitching appearances and ranked second with 226 strikeouts. He also led the league with 152 walks. In 1902, Donovan returned to Brooklyn and appeared in 35 games, 33 as a starter, threw 30 complete games, and compiled a 17‚Äì15 record with a 2.78 ERA. Detroit Tigers (1903‚Äì12) Donovan in 1910 Prior to the 1903 season, Donovan jumped to the Detroit Tigers of the American League. The move prompted litigation over Donovan's right to sign with the Tigers, with a resolution being reached allowing Donovan to join the Tigers. Donovan started 34 games for the Tigers in 1903 and led the American League with 34 complete games. He also ranked among the league's leaders with 187 strikeouts (second), a 7.0 wins above replacement rating for pitchers (third), and a 2.29 ERA (ninth). Donovan continued as a workhouse for the Tigers, appearing in 34 games in 1904 and 1905 and 25 games in 1906 while compiling ERAs of 2.46, 2.60 and 3.15. On May 7, 1906, Donovan accomplished a rare feat when he stole second base, third, and on the front end of a double steal, took home in the fifth inning of an 8‚Äì3 victory over Cleveland. He also hit a triple in the same game. In 1907, Donovan emerged as one of the best pitchers in the game while leading Detroit to the American League pennant. He appeared in 32 games and compiled a 25‚Äì4 record with a 2.19 ERA. His winning percentage of .862 led the American League. On September 30, 1907, with the Tigers and Athletics competing for the American League pennant, the two contenders met before a record crowd in Philadelphia. Donovan, who had defeated the Athletics three days earlier, was called on to clinch the pennant for the Tigers. Donovan pitched all 17 innings in the clinching game, holding Philadelphia scoreless for the final 10 innings until the game was called as a tie due to darkness. Donovan started Game 1 of the 1907 World Series, and the Tigers led in the ninth inning with two outs and Chicago's Harry Steinfeldt on third base; Chicago pinch hitter Del Howard swung on a third strike that should have ended the game, but Detroit's catcher Boss Schmidt \\"missed the ball, which got by him to the crowd,\\" allowing Steinfeldt to score the tying run. After Schmidt's error, Donovan held the Cubs scoreless for another four innings, but the game ended in a tie after 13 innings. In 1908, Donovan appeared in 29 games and compiled an 18‚Äì7 record with a 2.08 ERA. And in 1909, he appeared in 24 games and compiled an 8‚Äì7 record with a 2.31 ERA. The Tigers won three consecutive American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. In three World Series, Donovan appeared in six games, all as a starter, pitched five complete games, and compiled a 1‚Äì4 record with a 2.88 ERA. Donovan continued to pitch well in 1910, compiling a 17-7 record with a 2.44 ERA. However, in 1911, Donovan appeared in only 20 games (his fewest since 1900), and his ERA increased to 3.31 (his highest since 1900). In 1912, he started only one game (allowing one run in five innings on May 30) and made two relief appearances, compiling a 1-0 record and allowing one earned run in 10 innings pitched. Managerial and coaching career=Providence (1912‚Äì14) In August 1912, Donovan was assigned to become the manager for the Providence Grays, which was under common ownership with the Tigers. In 1913, the Grays finished with a 69‚Äì80 record. In 1914, Donovan turned the club around, leading the Grays to a 95‚Äì59 record and the International League pennant. Donovan also appeared in 20 games for the Grays from 1912 to 1914, compiling a 5‚Äì4 record. Donovan managed rookie pitcher Babe Ruth for the final month of the 1914 season. Ruth won 10 of the 11 games in which he pitched for Donovan's Providence team. New York Yankees (1915‚Äì17) J.P. Michel, Jacob Ruppert and Donovan in 1915 In December 1914, at baseball's winter meetings in Chicago, Donovan was hired by the New York Yankees' new owner Jacob Ruppert as the club's new manager. Donovan took over a Yankees team that lacked stars and finished with a 70‚Äì84 record in 1914. The Yankees compiled a 69‚Äì83 record in their first year under Donovan, but improved to 80‚Äì74 in 1916 ‚Äì the club's first winning record since 1910. In 1917, the Yankees lost multiple players to injury and regressed to 70‚Äì84. After the 1917 season, the Yankees hired Miller Huggins to replace Donovan as manager. Owner Ruppert later said of Donovan: \\"He was a wonderful fellow and great leader. . . . I still think that barring injuries and hard luck Bill Donovan would have brought the Yankees their first pennant. The hardest thing I ever had to do was release him.\\" During his 1915 and 1916 seasons, Donovan also appeared in 10 games as a pitcher for the Yankees, compiling a 0‚Äì3 record with a 4.67 ERA in 34-2/3 innings pitched. Detroit Tigers (1918) In February 1918, Donovan returned to the Tigers as a pitching coach and scout. At the time of his hiring, the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Donovan will be welcomed in Detroit. A more popular player never represented Detroit than the \\"Smiler\\" and his friends here are legion.\\" The 1918 Detroit Tigers finished 20 games out of first place. On the last day of the 1918 season, Donovan, at age 41, went to the mound for a final game as the club's starting pitcher. Facing off against Eddie Cicotte of the Chicago White Sox, Donovan pitched five innings, gave up only one run, and won his 185th major league game. Jersey City (1919‚Äì20) Donovan was hired as the manager of the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League. He was the manager of the Jersey City team in both 1919 and 1920. Philadelphia Phillies (1921) In December 1920, Donovan was hired as the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies had finished in last place in the National League in 1920, and team owner William Baker stated he was turning over full control of the team for rebuilding by Donovan. On August 9, 1921, Donovan was dismissed as the Phillies' manager. The dismissal was reportedly based on Baker's suspicion that Donovan had some knowledge of the Chicago White Sox' attempt to throw the 1919 World Series. Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis later vindicated Donovan of any wrongdoing and ordered Baker to send Donovan a letter of apology.Legends of the Game at www.deadball.com Hartford (1922‚Äì23) In December 1921, Donovan was hired as the manager of the New Haven Eastern League baseball club. Donovan's former Detroit teammate Ty Cobb was a co-owner of the New Haven club. Donovan led New Haven to the Eastern League pennant in 1922 and returned as manager for a second season in 1923. Family and death Donovan married Nellie Stephen in 1905. They were divorced in 1915. In December 1923, Donovan was killed in a train wreck while traveling on the 20th Century Limited to attend baseball's winter meetings in Chicago. The train wrecked in Forsyth, New York, killing a total of nine persons. Donovan was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

Humes Japanese Stroll Garden Pathway at the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden One of the moss-covered stone lanterns at the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden The John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden is a Japanese garden in Mill Neck, New York, providing a retreat for passive recreation and contemplation. History Upon return from a trip to Kyoto, Japan in 1960, John Portner Humes, a lawyer then ambassador, began work on a Japanese garden. As a lawyer Humes worked for Mitsubishi and traveled to Japan for business. The garden was designed between 1962-1965 by Douglas and Jone DeFaya who used Japanese shrubs, trees and ground cover as well as symbolic placement of stones. The focal point of the garden is an imported tea house, in the design of the Ashikaga period, that was acquired in 1962. The sandalwood tea house was prefabricated in Taiwan and featured straw matting and rice paper door panels. The garden was two-acres in size. Humes was the U.S. ambassador to Austria from Oct. 29, 1969 to March 6, 1975. While the Humes family was living in Austria, the garden fell into disrepair and on their return, a landscape architect, Stephen Morrell, was hired full-time in 1982 to restore and enlarge the garden. Not only did Humes wish to restore the garden but he also wanted to open it to the public. Morrell, a graduate of the New York Botanical Garden School of Horticulture, was sent on study trips twice to Japan by the Humes' Of special interest in the garden are the winding stepping-stone walkways and gravel paths, stone lanterns, bamboo groves, a variety of mosses and a waterfall emptying into a koi pond. The bamboo is used for fences, for bottom of the tea house and as a water pipe. Japanese maples were planted as well as other Japanese trees, shrubs and groundcovers. In addition, there are more than 11 species of moss. Moving through the garden, where the views, textures and balance of elements have been planned following Japanese aesthetic principles, visitors experience a walking meditation inducing inner peace. Stepping stones are used to control the rate at which one moves through the garden, encouraging moment-to-moment reflection. These stones, placed by the DeFayas, are local rocks with irregular shapes and varying sizes. Two paths connect the pond and tea house to the rest of the garden, one of them created on a declining hill. The garden suggests a hillside landscape beside the sea, where gravel paths represent streams that form pools and cascades, eventually flowing into the ocean represented by a pond. North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary In 1980 it was donated to the North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary, and opened to the public in 1985. In 1993 the Garden Conservancy assumed management of the garden. The Conservancy hired the Long Island-based landscape design firm of Emile Kreye & Sons, Inc. to do restoration work on the pond, create a waterfall that flows into the pond and erect an eight foot high rock ridge. Other repair work included replacing a barrier wall. The garden was increased from 2 acres to 7 acres in 2009. Craftsman Peter Wechsler created a new red cedar entrance gate for the garden in 2000 and also restored the garden's tea house in 2012. The Stroll Garden ran into financial problems in 2014 after the Garden Conservancy ended its management of the Stroll Garden at the end of 2013. It was operated by the Humes Japanese Garden Foundation until 2017 when The North Shore Land Alliance officially acquired the property on May 23, 2017. The North Shore Land Alliance is a not-for-profit land trust focusing on the North Shore of Long Island. The Garden is part of a conservation corridor owned by the North Shore Land Alliance that covers over 150 acres in the middle of the Beaver Brook watershed. The Land Alliance previously acquired the other portion of the Humes property in 2015. After being closed for most of 2016 and 2017, the Stroll Garden reopened for three days a week in November 2017 and closed after the first freeze. In 2018, the Stroll Garden was open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays and 1-5 p.m. on Sundays. Opening day was May 12, 2018 and it closed for the season on Oct. 28, 2018. There were over 700 visitors to the garden in 2018. A major improvement to the property in 2018 was the installation of a 6-foot high deer fence to allow for the regrowth of vegetation that had been damaged by deer browse. It was funded by the New York State Conservation Partnership Program and private donations.  References  See also  * List of botanical gardens in the United States  External links  * John P.

Life He was born into a wealthy peasant family of Rippweiler, Luxembourg. After completing his gymnasium studies brilliantly, he went to Rome where from 1847 to 1854, as a student of the Collegium Germanicum, he laid the foundation of his ascetic life and, as a pupil of the Gregorian University, under the guidance of distinguished scholars (Antonio Ballerini, Johann Baptist Franzelin, Carlo Passaglia, Giovanni Perrone, Francis Xavier Patrizi, Clement Schrader and Camillo Tarquini), prepared the way for his subsequent scholarly career. When he left Rome in 1854, he took with him, in addition to the double doctorate of theology and Canon law, two mementoes which lasted throughout his life: his grey hair and a disease of the heart, possibly the result of his experiences in Rome in the revolutionary year 1848-9. From 1853 to 1858 he labored in his own country as chaplain and parish priest, and during this time made his first literary attempts. In March, 1858, he entered the Austrian Province of the Society of Jesus and, in the autumn of 1859, was summoned by his superiors to Innsbruck to fill the chair of canon law in the theological faculty, which Emperor Francis Joseph I had shortly before entrusted to the Austrian Jesuits. Nilles lectured throughout his life ‚Äî after 1898 usually to the North American theologians, to whom he gave special instructions on canonical conditions in their country, for which task no one was better qualified than he. His Commentaria in Concilium Baltimorense tertium (1884‚Äì90) and his short essay, Tolerari potest, gained him a wide reputation. Martin Blum enumerates in his by no means complete bibliography fifty-seven works, of which the two principal are: De rationibus festorum sacratissimi Cordis Jesu et purissimi Cordis Mariae libri quatuor (2 vols., 5th ed., Innsbruck, 1885) and Kalendarium manuale utriusque Ecclesiae orientalis et occidentalis (2 vols., 2nd ed., Innsbruck, 1896). Through the latter work he became widely known in the world of scholars. In particular Protestants and Orthodox Russians expressed themselves in terms of the highest praise for the Kalendarium or Heortologion. Professor Adolf von Harnack of Berlin wrote of it in the Theologische Literaturzeitung (XXI, 1896, 350-2): > \\"I have . . . frequently made use of the work . . . and it has always proved > a reliable guide. whose information was derived from original sources. There > is scarcely another scholar as well versed as the author in the feasts of > Catholicism. His knowledge is based not only on his own observations, but on > books periodicals, papers, and calendars of the past and present. The Feasts > of Catholicism! The title is self-explanatory; yet, though the basis of > these ordinances is uniform, the details are of infinite variety, since the > work treats not only of the Latin but also of the Eastern Rites. The latter, > it is well known, are divided into Greek, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian ...\\" Of the second volume Harnack wrote (ibid., XXXIII, 1898, 112 sq.): > \\"Facts which elsewhere would have to be sought under difficulties are here > marshaled in lucid order, and a very carefully arranged index facilitates > inquiry. Apart from the principal aim of the work, it offers valuable > information concerning recent Eastern Catholic ecclesiastical history, also > authorities and literature useful to the historian of liturgy and creeds. > ... His arduous and disinterested toil will be rewarded by the general > gratitude, and his work will long prove useful not only to every theologian > 'utriusque', but also 'cuiusque ecclesiae'\\". The Romanian Academy in Bucharest awarded a prize to this work. Soon after the appearance of the second edition of the \\"Kalendarium\\", the Russian Holy Synod issued from the synodal printing office in Moscow a \\"Festbilderatlas\\" intended to a certain extent as the official Orthodox illustrations for the work. Nilles was not only a distinguished university professor, but also a director of ecclesiastical students. For fifteen years (1860‚Äì75) he presided over the theological seminary of Innsbruck, an international institution where young men from all parts of Europe and the United States were trained for the priesthood.

It was fought on 3 August 1530 between the city of Florence and the army of the Holy Roman Empire. The Imperial forces were led by Philibert of Ch√¢lon, Prince of Orange, with reinforcements under Fabrizio Maramaldo arriving later in the battle. The Florentine forces were led by the florentine commissary Francesco Ferruccio. At first the Florentines drove back the Imperial army, despite being outnumbered. In the process, the Prince of Orange was fatally shot in the chest by two arquebus balls. However, when Maramaldo arrived with 2,000 troops the tide was reversed. After being wounded and captured, Ferruccio was executed personally by Maramaldo. Ferrucci's last response to his murderer, tu uccidi un uomo morto (you are killing a dead man) led him to long lasting fame and to become one of the major icons of the Italian risorgimento. In contrast, Maramaldo's behavior, echoed by several historical reports, gave his name a shameful reputation, and in modern Italian maramaldo means cowardly murderer.

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 1,748. History The village was named in the early 13th century by the local landowner, who gave the township his first name of Richard, to distinguish it from neighbouring Heath Charnock. The village is situated on the A49 road which leads from Preston to Wigan. The manor house Park Hall dates from the 10th century. It was the home of Henry de Lea, who was beheaded with Adam Banastre on Leyland Moor in 1315, after the abortive Banastre Rebellion. Local amenities Charnock Richard Pasture is just off Freemans Lane, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Charnock Richard services probably the area's most famous landmark, is a motorway service station, between Junctions 27 and 28 of the M6 Motorway. It was the first service station on the M6 Motorway when it opened in 1963, and is operated by Welcome Break. Right next to the service station, stands the now derelict Camelot Theme Park, with the ‚ÄúKnightmare Roller Coaster‚Äù still visible from the motorway. The park closed in November 2012, due to a lack of visitors and financial problems. The site has become a famous spot to explore for ‚Äúurban explorers‚Äù. Christ Church, a church of the Church of England, was built in 1860. Sport The village football club Charnock Richard FC plays at Mossie Close and currently competes in the North West Counties League. In June 2007, the club began work on re developing its ground to bring it up from West Lancashire League standards up to the higher standard required for the North West Counties League and for the higher Northern Premier League. The first phase included a new pitch, largely enclosed with a spectators' stand, at a cost of about ¬£60,000; the second phase will include new changing rooms and ultimately the ground will have a capacity of between 400 and 500. These improvements helped the club join the North West Counties League in 2016, from the West Lancashire League. The club then saw success, progressing to the North West Counties Premier Division in 2017. This was due to them finishing second in the First Division, thus gaining promotion at the first time of asking. Charnock Richard Golf Club, which opened in 1994, is a parkland golf course on the main A49 Preston Road and is set in .

Close to the border with County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland, the village is about 20 km southwest of Dungannon, and 7 km southeast of Ballygawley. It is situated in the historic barony of Dungannon Lower and the civil parish of Carnteel. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 801. History Much of the town was built in the 18th Century by Acheson Moore, the local landlord. Because he backed the Jacobite cause, he planted his estate in the shape of a thistle and planned out the town on the edge of it. Unable to rename it \\"Mooretown\\", he had to settle for naming the main street \\"Moore Street\\", and the side streets Sydney, Lettice, and Henrietta (now Ravella Road), after his three wives. Aughnacloy served as an important staging post on the road to Derry. However, lacking large-scale industry, it started to wane in the late 19th century. Aughnacloy Catholic church Aughnacloy Presbyterian church The old railway station The Troubles On 20 January 1974, Cormac McCabe (42), the first Headmaster of Aughnacloy Secondary School and a Captain in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), was shot dead by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). His corpse was found in a field near Aughnacloy. On 6 July 1977, David Morrow (37) a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer, was killed by the IRA while sitting in a stationary RUC patrol car in Aughnacloy. In 1988, Aidan McAnespie, a Catholic civilian, was killed, in contested circumstances, by a bullet from a general purpose machine-gun held by a British Army soldier at Aughnacloy. In June 2008, the Police Service of Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team published its findings on the case in a report. In the fatal shooting the soldier claimed that his hands were wet, causing him to accidentally fire the machine-gun. The report called this the \\"least likely version\\" of what happened.

Avrakotos was little known to the public until the book Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History, by George Crile, was published in 2003. The book, which portrays U.S. involvement in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War as a partnership between Avrakotos and Texas Congressman Charles Wilson, was the basis of the film Charlie Wilson's War, released in 2007, in which Avrakotos is portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Biography and career Avrakotos was born in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, the son of a Greek American soft drink manufacturer, from the island of Lemnos. He briefly worked at Jones and Laughlin Steel mill in Aliquippa before graduating valedictorian from Aliquippa High School in 1955. He initially attended college at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, but left after two years due to a strain on family finances. He found work at a local steel mill. He would also sell beer and cigarettes to bars frequented by immigrants from eastern and central Europe. He returned to college at the University of Pittsburgh, where he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics. He joined the CIA in 1962 and, because of his fluency in Greek, was assigned to take part in an anti-communist mission in Greece. He was also assigned duty in the CIA's Langley, Virginia, headquarters. Avrakotos was number four in the hierarchy of the CIA station in Athens in 1974 (Stacy Hulse was the chief and Ron Estes his deputy). Estes and Avrakotos met with Greece's dictator at the time, Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis, formally Chief of Military Police, to warn him against the escalation of tension with Archbishop Makarios because of the danger of a Turkish reaction. These documented meetings happened on 7 and 20 June 1974. Nevertheless, Makarios, then President of Cyprus, decided to end the Greek junta's constant interventionism against his young republic, thus directly and publicly confronting Ioannidis. Makarios seemed determined to expel all Greek military personnel from Cyprus. So Ioannidis proceeded into a spectacular coup d'√©tat against Makarios, bombarding the Presidential Residence in Nicosia, in order to kill Makarios. Ioannidis died in 2010 and Avrakotos in 2005, neither having revealed anything about their interaction in 1974. Neither did the other Greek-American CIA officer, Peter Koromilas, who died in 2007. According to the book Charlie Wilson's War, Avrakotos unofficially advised his associates in the Junta to assassinate Andreas Papandreou. In the 1980s while at Langley, Avrakotos led Operation Cyclone, the largest covert operation in the CIA's history. Through intermediaries, mostly Zia ul-Haq's ISI in Pakistan, the CIA armed Afghanistan's Mujahideen during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Avrakotos eventually met congressman Charlie Wilson of Texas's 2nd congressional district. Together they collaborated to massively increase funding for the rebels, and together helped persuade officials from Egypt, Pakistan, China, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere to increase support for the cause. Avrakotos also plucked Michael G. Vickers from obscurity in the CIA's paramilitary group to revamp the strategy for the Mujahideen. Vickers urged them to drop the Enfield Rifle in favor of a mix of weapons like the AK-47, and to introduce new tactics, training, and logistics. In 1985 Avrakotos a group within the government, including Oliver North, Bud McFarlane, certain members of the National Security Council, and others, attempting to run the Iran arms-for-hostages trade using the CIA. He told his superior Clair George that the Iran Contra trade was a disaster in the making, as he did not trust Manucher Ghorbanifar or the Israelis pushing the scheme, and he viewed the people like North as the \\"lunatic fringe\\" who had earlier tried to bring bizarre ideas into the Afghan war. Avrakotos also warned George that the scheme was illegal and wrote a notable memo distributed within the CIA to that effect. According to author George Crile, the bureaucracy punished Avrakotos for his dissent and then banished him to a do-nothing job with little responsibility, just as his greatest success, the Afghan program, was showing results. Avrakotos was reassigned \\"just as the Stinger antiaircraft missile launchers downed the first Soviet gunships\\" and after a brief role in an African assignment, he retired from the CIA in 1989. Gust's predictions about Iran‚ÄìContra were accurate, as the Iran‚ÄìContra affair resulted in numerous prosecutions of government officials and years of congressional hearings and controversy. Avrakotos then worked for TRW in Rome and for News Corp., for which he began a business intelligence newsletter, working in Rome and McLean, Virginia. He returned to the CIA as a contractor from 1997 until 2003. Avrakotos died of a stroke in 2005. In popular culture Avrakotos was portrayed in the 2007 film Charlie Wilson's War by Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Avrakotos.

He was the son of Thomas Prendergast (d. 1725) of Croane, County Limerick, and Eleanor Condon, daughter of Daniel Condon. Little is known of his early life. His family suffered greatly under Oliver Cromwell, and he is thought to have grown up in poverty. Jonathan Swift, who detested him, called him the son of a cottager who narrowly escaped being hanged for stealing cows. However his friends esteemed him as a man of honour and ability. On 15 July 1699 he was created a baronet, of Gort, in the County of Galway. On 10 August 1697 he married Penelope Cadogan (d. 1746), sister of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, and daughter of Henry Cadogan and Bridget Waller. On his death at the Battle of Malplaquet he was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas Prendergast, 2nd Baronet. He received his baronetage for informing King William III of the Jacobite plot to ambush the King's coach at Turnham Green. The plot had been conceived by Sir George Barclay, who landed at Romney in January 1696 intent upon assassinating the King. Prendergast was called upon on Thursday 13 February 1696 by Captain George Porter, one of the forty-odd conspirators, to stop the coach on Saturday 15 February. However, on the Friday he went to Whitehall and informed the Earl of Portland on the conspiracy. A man named Fisher had already reported the planned assassination but the plot was taken seriously only after Prendergast's account. It was made known on the Saturday morning that the King would not be driving to Richmond, and so the plotters postponed the assassination until the following Saturday 21 February. Another informer, De La Rue, revealed the plot but the King wanted confirmation from Prendergast, whom he felt he could trust and rely on. On the morning of the plot, the conspirators heard that guards had been dispatched but soon most of them had been rounded up and were eventually charged, thanks mainly to the testimonies of Prendergast. He was rewarded with a grant from the Treasury and the Gort Estate in County Galway, which was confiscated from the O'Shaughnessy family. This, and his marriage to Penelope Cadogan, enabled his family's fortunes to grow. He became a Member of Parliament for Monaghan Borough in 1703 and rose to the rank of Brigadier-General, seeing action at the Battle of Oudenarde and finally being killed at the Battle of Malplaquet on 11 September 1709 whilst leading his regiment against the French troops at Blaregnies. Fighting against him at both of the latter battles was William O'Shaughnessy who comes from the same O'Shaughnessy family whose ancestral lands of the Gort Estate in County Galway that Thomas Prendergast had stolen from. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Thomas. His widow was greatly troubled in her later years by a protracted lawsuit with the Butler family of Ballyline over the right to certain lands in County Galway. They also had three daughters: Elizabeth, who married Charles Smyth, Anne, who married Samuel Hobson of Muckridge House, Youghal, and Juliana, who married Chaworth Brabazon, 6th Earl of Meath. Jonathan Swift, a bitter personal enemy of the younger Thomas, extended his hatred to the elder: \\"him who shamed our isle, traitor, assassin and informer vile\\". This appears to be a garbled reference to the Assassination Plot. References * *Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage - Gort.

He was also a lawyer and a bureaucrat and the father of four daughters. Biography Mombrizio was descended from a noble but not very wealthy family of Milan, and studied the Latin and Greek classics at Ferrara, with zeal and success. Later he became a teacher of Latin at Milan, and was highly esteemed, not only for his extensive knowledge and his literary works, but also for his earnest religious life, as may be gleaned from the letters of his contemporaries. He suffered many misfortunes, which, however, did not affect his industry. Mombrizio's literary importance lies especially in his editions of ancient writings.

It is referred to by the common names Bossier's glory-of-the-snow or Lucile's glory-of-the-snow, and is a bulbous perennial from western Turkey that flowers in early spring. After flowering, it goes into dormancy until the next spring. The Latin name is in honour of Lucile, the wife of the Swiss botanist Pierre Edmond Boissier. It belongs to a group of Scilla species that were formerly put in a separate genus, Chionodoxa, and may now be treated as Scilla sect. Chionodoxa. Description Like all members of the former genus Chionodoxa, the bases of the stamens are flattened and closely clustered in the middle of the flower. In other species of Scilla, the stamens are not flattened or clustered together. Each bulb produces two leaves, up to 8 cm long and 2 cm wide, and at most one flowering stem, up to 10 cm long. The flowers are produced in a loose pyramidal raceme, with 2‚Äì3 flowers per stem, which face upwards. Each flower is up to 3.5 cm across. The base of each tepal is white (as are the stamen filaments), producing a white 'eye'. The outer part of the tepals is violet-blue. The species can be distinguished from the commonest species grown in gardens, S. forbesii, by the much smaller number of slightly larger flowers per stem. Distribution Scilla luciliae is native to western Turkey. It has a restricted distribution in the Mahmut Mountain in ƒ∞zmir Province. Cultivation Scilla luciliae has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, confirmed in 2017.

It is about southeast of Chorley and about northwest of Bolton. Rivington is a rural area consisting primarily of agricultural grazing land, moorland, with hill summits including Rivington Pike and Winter Hill within the West Pennine Moors. The area has a thriving tourist industry centred around reservoirs created to serve Liverpool in the Victorian era and Lever Park created as a public park by William Lever at the turn of the 20th century, with two ancient barns, a replica of Liverpool Castle and open countryside. Rivington and its village had a population of 109 at the 2011 Census. History=Toponymy Rivington The name Rivington is made up of three elements: riv is from the Old English hrƒìof meaning rough or rugged; ing is a place name forming suffix that seems to have crept in over the years; the last is the Old English t≈´n meaning a farmstead, estate or settlement. Together they indicate a farmstead or settlement at the rough or rugged place. Another suggestion is a place at the rowan trees. Rivington was recorded in many ways in earlier centuries, Rowinton, Rawinton, and Revington were used in 1202; Ruhwinton in 1212, Riuiton in 1226, Rowynton and Rouynton in 1278, Roynton in 1332, Rouyngton in 1400, Revyngton although rare, and Rovington and Ryvington from the 16th century. Early history A Neolithic or Bronze Age stone, with a cup and ring mark dating from between 2000 and 3000 BC, was found near the Lower Rivington Reservoir in 1999. It is possible that settlements have existed in the area around Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963‚Äì64. It is possible that the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names. Manor Rivington Hall The majority share of seven-eights of the manor was originally held by the Pilkington family of Lancashire. This share had reduced to five- eights when they sold Rivington Hall in 1611 to their relations Robert Lever and Thomas Breres. A quarter was owned by the Lathoms and an eighth by the Shaws. In 1765 the Shaws and their relations the Roscoes inherited the one- eight share. The Pilkington share had passed through the female line to the Crompton family after the purchase in 1729 by John Andrews of Little Lever of the Breres' share of the manor. The Cromptons remained resident until 1910 as part of an agreement of sale to W. H. Lever in 1900. Lever sold Rivington Hall and its land to Liverpool Corporation completing in 1905, he and his heirs retain a perpetual interest preventing any buildings being erected except for farms and the supply of water. He retained a residence on the hillside, shooting rights and use of Rivington Hall as a Museum of Lever Park until his death in 1925. Industry From 1850 until the completion of the Rivington Reservoir Scheme inhabitants formed businesses providing for its large number of workers. As the Lower Rivington Reservoir was completed the tourist industry was born and has since been dominant alongside farming. Prior to this Rivington was a rural village built around what is now the village green. Its inhabitants were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms. The textile industry was a secondary form of income until the industrial revolution, alongside farming. Textile bleaching took place on the River Douglas at Knoll Wood contaminating the water supply; this was closed and demolished in 1868 by Liverpool Corporation though the remnants of its dam still remain. The Cottage Industry of Handloom weaving and use of the Putting-out system was common in the 18th to early 19th century, Samuel Oldknow was a prominent local figure, his family grave being at the Unitarian Chapel. Income was also generated from the quarries, coal mining was on a small scale at Rivington Moor. Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal for local use. A water mill and kiln was mentioned in a deed of 1544 and sale agreement of Rivington Hall in 1611, use of a kiln would have been part of the agricultural milling process. This confirms use of land for arable farming in combination with grazing, the latter is now dominant. A commercial slaughter house was located at the New Hall Barn until its demolition along with the house in 1905, its remains are still present. The area of the Rivington Unitarian Chapel is named Mill Hill on the 1848 OS map and extended to Croft Bridge, crossing Hall Brook. The Victorian 'School Houses' became known as Mill Hill cottages. Mill Dam wood is at the rear of the Vicarage, a pond existed there prior to the reservoir construction, on the water course is a ruin that could be a past water wheel house and dam, a short distance down stream was a smithy located in the area of what is now the village hall. Reservoirs Upper Rivington Reservoir with Winter Hill and Rivington Pike Rivington was dramatically changed by the construction of the Rivington Reservoir Chain, part of the 10,000 acre Rivington watershed, built to provide Liverpool with a safe, clean water supply. Nine properties in the valley were demolished before construction work began. The Rivington Pike Scheme, still in use today, was undertaken by Thomas Hawksley between 1850 and 1857, requiring Liverpool Corporation to purchase large areas of occupied land within the Rivington valley. The scheme was to construct five reservoirs and a water treatment works at the south end of Lower Rivington with a pipeline to storage reservoirs at Prescot. Water from two higher level reservoirs, Rake Brook and Lower Roddlesworth, was carried south in the Goit, a man-made channel connecting them to the lower reservoirs. In 1900 Liverpool Corporation attempted to acquire the entire area of Rivington to safeguard its water supply, and proposed demolishing the entire village. The Act of Parliament known as the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 protected some buildings but others were left vulnerable. The Act allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase properties in the west of the village, including the Black-a-Moors Head public house (known locally as the 'Black Lad') and New Hall, which were demolished between 1902 and 1905. The result was the small settlement that has remained largely unchanged since then. Governance Rivington was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors, in the Salford hundred in Lancashire. It became part of the Chorley Poor Law Union, formed in 1837, and took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. The parish had an unusual method of deciding their Mayor until the mid 19th century. The person was selected according to how quickly they got drunk on the eve of the annual event known as 'Club Day' when a day of heavy drinking commenced and villagers dressed in fancy dress, going from house to house banging on doors till the early hours of the morning to collect funds for the 'dignity of the office'. In 1866 Rivington became a civil parish. It was part of the Chorley Rural Sanitary District from 1875 to 1894, and part of Chorley Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Since 1974 Rivington has been a civil parish of the Borough of Chorley, which comprises 47 councillors each elected for four-year terms to represent wards in the borough. Rivington is part of the Heath Charnock and Rivington ward. Chorley is part of the Lancashire County Council created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 and reconstituted under the Local Government Act 1972. Rivington is part of the Chorley Rural East ward. Rivington is part of the Chorley parliamentary constituency, which elected Lindsay Hoyle as Member of Parliament for the Labour party at the 2010 General Election. Geography Rivington is situated on the moorland fringe between the high moorland of the West Pennine Moors and the fields below. The landscape is characterised by marginal pastures with isolated farmsteads, reservoirs and disused mines and quarries scattered across the hillsides. There is an extensive network of footpaths providing public access. The reservoir valleys are dominated by expanses of water and the Victorian gothic architecture of the dams and embankments surrounded by woodland. To the east of Rivington is Rivington Pike and to the west the flatter land of the Lancashire Plain. Rivington is north of Horwich and Bolton and to the south of Anglezarke Moor and Yarrow Reservoir. To the west of the village is the wide shallow valley containing the Anglezarke, Upper and Lower Rivington reservoirs. The village is accessed from the west by a road on top of the long Horrobin Embankment, a dam that separates the Upper and Lower Rivington reservoirs. The River Douglas has its source on Winter Hill, and flows in a southwest direction forming part of the southern boundary. The River Yarrow has its source on Anglezarke Moor and forms the northern boundary. The area of the township is , the reservoirs and filter beds occupy . The underlying geology is Millstone Grit overlaid with coal measures. Gritstone was quarried for building stone in the area. Around Rivington are chalybeate springs and in Dean Wood is a waterfall with a descent of . Demography In 2001, 144 people lived in Rivington, 63 males and 81 females. There were 48 households, of which 34 lived in detached houses and 14 in terraced or semi-detached properties. Most households, 60%, were owner-occupied; the remainder were privately rented. The mean age of the population was 53.4 years. In 2001 most of those employed, 47, worked in the service industries. Ten worked in extractive and manufacturing industries, and three males were unemployed. The average distance travelled to work by employed persons was . Population change=Economy Tourist Information Centre In the 19th century, farming was reduced with the construction of the reservoirs. The Industrial Revolution ended the viability of cottage industries such as weaving, small mines closed and the long term population decreased as the Water Authority cleared land in the reservoirs catchment area to protect the water supply, some properties had inadequate sewer treatment facilities and many lacked piped water, farms and other properties were hence taken over and demolished, prior to the reservoirs lower Rivington was fenced off and closed to the public. The area saw the arrival of a large workforce during reservoir construction, the reservoir chain created a tourist industry, with day-trippers from the dark factories to middle class in visiting in wonder at the new water works scheme. The water scheme resulted in a two Hotels and busy public houses and Tea Rooms the area was thriving with offshoot businesses including a wash house at Rivington Hall supplied by Leverhulmes father, James Lever. The reservoirs led to increasing visitor numbers, this continued and increased further with the opening of Lever Park in 1904, this brought money into the area. Agriculture, mainly sheep farming, continues. Today the area has a thriving tourist industry and a number of Tea Houses, although the Hotel and Public House in the village were demolished visitors are attracted to honeypot sites such as Lever Park and Rivington Pike, making tourism the most significant source of income in the area. Go Ape operates an outdoor activity centre at Great House Barn. Rivington Hall Barn and other sites host private and corporate events. Transport Rivington is to the east to the M61 motorway, which connects the M6 and Preston to the north with the M60 and the Greater Manchester conurbation to the south. The nearest access is at Junction 6. The village is accessed by minor roads from Horwich to the south and Adlington to the west. A winding road to the north passes through Anglezarke and a road over the moors to the east leads to Belmont. The nearest places with regular bus services are Horwich to the south and Adlington to the west, which are served by buses between Bolton and Chorley or Preston. The arrival of the Manchester and Bolton Railway's extension to Preston and opening of Blackrod railway station in 1841 brought visitors to the area. The line remains open with stations at Blackrod and Horwich Parkway giving access to Bolton, Manchester, Chorley and Preston. Education Rivington Primary School Rivington Grammar School's charter was granted to Bishop James Pilkington by Queen Elizabeth I in 1566. The school opened in 1575 and was rebuilt in 1714. Blackrod Grammar School, founded in 1568, merged with it in 1875. In 1882 Rivington & Blackrod Grammar School opened on a site at the south of the township, close to the boundary with Horwich. The school is now Rivington and Blackrod High School, a specialist technology college, focusing on design and technology, mathematics and science. Year Seven pupils occupy the former Horwich County Secondary School. The old grammar school building in the village centre is now occupied by Rivington Foundation Primary School. Religion Rivington Church Rivington was a chapelry in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors until it became a parish in its own right. Rivington Church is an active Anglican place of worship holding service each Sunday. The Church is built on the site of an earlier chapel that was named in a deed by Margaret Pilkington and her son Robert in 1476. The chapelry covered Rivington and the surrounding areas of Anglezarke, Hemshaws and Foulds and was recognised in the Royal patent founding Rivington School in 1566. In 1628 a chapel was built \\"upon a little toft and quillet of land\\" by the local population and divine service was celebrated \\"for many years of antiquity\\". The early-16th-century chapel was rebuilt in 1666 and altered and restored in 1861. The church is a small plain building built in sandstone with a bell turret. It is an Anglican church and unusual in that it is not dedicated to a saint or martyr, but referred to as Rivington Church. Rivington Unitarian Chapel is an active place of worship holding regular services on the first and third Sunday of each month in addition to baptisms, weddings and blessings. The Chapel was built with a bellcote of local stone in 1703. Founded as a Presbyterian church and became Unitarian in the late 18th century. The chapel, which retains its box pews, was restored in 1990. Landmarks The most prominent of all buildings in Rivington is on the skyline at the summit of Rivington Pike, the tower. There are twenty eight listed buildings within Rivington. Outside the village centre landmarks include Rivington Hall and its adjacent Hall Barn. At Lever Park on the bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir is a replica of Liverpool Castle, Great House Barn, serving Tea's and snacks and Great House Farm information centre providing information on the area. On the hillside the former Bungalow Grounds contain eleven listed structures, being remains of its garden features, its most prominent feature visible on the skyline being the Pigeon Tower. Within the village buildings with listed status are Wilkinson's and cottage attached to right, Rivington School, Rivington Church and the Unitarian Chapel, the two latter being active places of worship. Fisher house operated as a Temperance Hotel in the Victorian era, it is now a secluded private residence. The village stocks are a feature on Rivington village green, inscribed \\"T W 1719\\" on the stone base. New Hall Barn, opposite the Chapel received planning consent in 2015 to be converted to a four bedroom house. New Hall was a former dwelling and named in deeds of the Pilkington family in 1544 on their land named Ferneley in their possession from at least 1336 and was retained by them at the sale of Rivington Hall in 1611. The house house had a date stone of 1642 and was demolished in the early 20th century after being purchased by Liverpool Corporation, an adjoining barn had been left standing and its site and this barn became part of Bradleys Farm. The barn obsolete after the 1980s and had been left to go to a ruin by its owners United Utilities. Near Horrobin Embankment, Horrobin Lane which passes between the Lower and Upper Rivington reservoirs is a car park, this was the former site of the Black O'Moors Hotel and Bowling Green Public House, adjacent is Rivington Bowling Club, Bowling Green and Club House, operating as a Tea Room from 11am. Little Lake District Rivington Lakes, by Frederick William Hulme 1872 'The Little Lake District' was born in the mid Victorian era when visitor numbers continued to increase, from working classes escaping the gloomy mills on days off to the middle classes aided by a new railway at Blackrod in 1841, close to Horwich Vale. Visitor numbers further increased with a rapid increase in population at Horwich and with the arrival of the Horwich Railway Works and a railway station there, within walking distance. The area attracted well known landscape artists. The open countryside and moorland had become a public asset the working classes especially wanted to preserve access to and was the site of the Winter Hill mass trespass in 1896. Leverhulme who in 1902 bought a significant amount of land at Rivington also supported open access to the fields and moorland. Leverhulme was prompted to intervene in 1900 on learning the Cromptons, owners of Rivington Hall were to sell. He was fond of the area that he got to know well as a boy and a place he and his wife frequently visited whilst courting, he had a keen interest in its history, he sponsored and contributed to the book titled 'A Short History of Rivington' published in 1904. Lever Park A replica of Liverpool Castle in Lever Park A plan of Liverpool Castle made by 19thC historian Edward Cox. Lever Park is a public park created by the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 now owned by United Utilities, it is a designed landscape adjacent to the Lower Rivington Reservoir and behind Rivington and Blackrod High School toward Rivington Hall Barn created from farm land once belonging to The Crosses Farm, Great House Farm and Rivington Hall. The park is named after William Lever, Lord Leverhulme, who bought the land in 1900, in 1901 he proposed the creation of a public park of on land he then owned as a gift to the people of his native Bolton. Leverhulme sold the remaining areas outside the park to Liverpool Corporation in 1905 with a covenant on the land preventing building without his or his heirs consent, other than by farms and for operation of the water works. Under the terms of a Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 the act also enabled him to continue plans proposed to Bolton Council in 1901 for a public park to be completed at his own expense. The act also obliged Liverpool Corporation and its successors to maintain and keep open the park for the \\"free and uninterrupted enjoyment of the people of his native town of Bolton\\". Two pillars commemorating the gift of Leverhulme mark the entry to the area named Lever park and are located at the junction of Scholes Bank and Lever Park Avenue, Horwich, inscribed with the words ‚ÄúWilliam Hesketh Lever 1st Viscount Leverhulme. Lever Park the gift of William Hesketh Lever 1st Viscount Leverhulme born at 6 Wood Street, Bolton, September 19, 1851 died at Hampstead, London, May 7, 1925. For the benefit of the citizens of his native town and neighbourhood by act of parliament in 1902 the ownership and care of the park were vested in the Corporation of the City of Liverpool‚Äù. The park opened in 1904 and contained a boating lake, a zoo, tree-lined avenues and a network of footpaths. A dedication ceremony took place to dedicate the park to the people of Bolton on 10 October 1911. =Rivington Castle= Leverhulme commenced the build of a folly, named Rivington Castle in 1911, a scale replica of Liverpool Castle at Coblowe Hillock near the Lower Rivington Reservoir, grade 2 listed since 1967. The build commenced 1912 with clearance of the land and digging foundations, with the first foundation stone laid in 1913 and ended on Leverhulmes death in 1925. The structure has been altered a number of times with the demolition of a stone spiral staircase leading to the 'Great Hall' and stone steps that led to the keep, known as 'The Great Tower', a ledge remains. The castle walls were altered by rebuilding to an angular style at the north wall and near the Keep, stonework was also removed from the wall of the Prison tower as it joins the ante-chapel, the work was undertaken in 2012 as part of safety work in an effort to stop visitors climbing. Leverhulmes Former Gardens The Pigeon Tower, Rivington On the hillside of Rivington Pike was an area created as gardens to serve a former Bungalow demolished in 1948 belonging to Leverhulme. The site has surviving stone structures that formed part of the Italian style gardens designed by Thomas Mawson between 1905 and 1922, its design features in his book 'The Art and Craft of Garden Making', published 1912. The area is now woodland with remains including foundations of the bungalow, a number of stone summer houses, footpaths, steps, bridges, three ponds, streams and the restored Pigeon Tower. A Japanese style gardens was added in 1923, its features have since been lost, its pond remains. Further down the hillside a section was built as a man made ravine and woodland. Roynton Cottage built on the hillside by 1902 was a prefabricated wooden structure, destroyed 1913 in an arson attack by suffragette, Edith Rigby. Its replacement was built of stone in 1914 and named The Bungalow. After Lever's death The Bungalow and grounds were purchased by the Bolton brewer, John Magee he was resident from 1925 until his death in 1939, after which his executor offered the property to Bolton Council who turned it down. Liverpool Corporation bought the property in late 1939 shortly before the start of the Second World War during which the Bungalow and Grounds were used by the military, after the war proposals were put forward for use other than as a dwelling, the Corporation refused and announced demolition in 1947, the demolition went ahead in 1948. The grounds were subsequently left to neglect, remaining structures became dilapidated and became listed to prevent demolition. In 1974 the park and gardens passed to the North West Water Authority from Liverpool Corporation, and to United Utilities on privatisation. Bolton Conservation Volunteers cleared overgrowth and maintained paths for decades from them first coming into existence in 1976. Free Music festivals were held in the Bungalow Grounds in 1976 and 1977, without the consent of the landowner. All Rhododendron was removed from the gardens in 2006 after Ramorum Disease was found at the site. The ownership of the site transferred by way of a lease to Rivington Heritage Trust in 2016. Rivington Heritage Trust Rivington Heritage Trust, a body set up in 1997 by United Utilities in order to obtain ¬£15 million in funding for 'Blue Planet Park' had its plans rejected for funding by the Millennium Commission for plans which would have seen them take over all of Lever Park and Rivington Pike, plans were opposed by six regional MPs and were met with huge local opposition. Amongst issues raised by the public were fears that Music festivals would be held at the Rivington Terraced Gardens and the public would be charged admission, the water company assured the public that would never happen, since grant funding was gained in 2016 there have been open air music festivals held within the former gardens with over 2000 in attendance and a variety of other themed events are held, admission charged by buying a ticket. They also produce and sell Gin online. The music festival is to be extended to a two-day event by 2020. Den Dover was the Constituency Member of parliament serving for the Conservatives, then in government and raised concerns that the bill presented to parliament would give the water company too much power, he feared public access could be restricted and fee's for entry charged. He opposed the plans and the Water company were forced to withdraw their bill in parliament in July 1997, known as the Lever Park Act, where it met with opposition. The trust abandoned the plans by 1998 after considerable local opposition. A plan to proceed gradually was formed with an aim to obtain grant funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, funded in 2013 by a ¬£60,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund. In 2016 the trust and Groundwork Cheshire Lancashire and Merseyside gained a grant of ¬£3.4 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund to conserve and repair the Rivington Terraced Gardens and remaining Grade II listed structures. A lease of 50 years was also agreed by United Utilities to the Rivington Heritage Trust in the same year. In the main the unskilled clearance work has been undertaken by unpaid volunteers. Notable Campaigns Rivington Moor was the site of a mass trespass of 10,000 people who descended on the area toward Winter Hill in 1896 after the Smithills Hall land owner blocked off the route from Halliwell to Winter Hill and onto Rivington Moor. The demonstration is commemorated by a memorial stone on Coal Pit Lane, below Smithills Moor. Leverhulme was also concerned that access to the fields and moorland of Rivington was becoming more restricted. On the land Leverhulme donated to create Lever Park it is protected under statutory powers within the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 ensuring \\"free and uninterrupted enjoyment\\". The area is popular with walkers, cyclists and horse riders with footpaths , bridleways and roads providing access to the park, hillside and surrounding moorland. Rivington moor, Winter Hill, Rivington Pike, Brown Hill and the former Japanese and Kitchen Gardens within the Bungalow Grounds are part of an extensive area of open access land recorded at Lancashire County Council and has a right to roam protected by the statutory powers in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Lever Park came under threat after water supplies and land forming the catchment area had been moved out of public ownership and were transferred to private corporations in the Water privatisation in England and Wales, this was followed by a significant increase in use of gates and fences with stiles on footpaths and bridleways appearing from 1989, in response at Rivington 3000 local campaigners demonstrated and took a pledge to protect the area from then on after attending a meeting of opponents to the bill, organised as a rally at Rivington, led by the Ramblers Association in association with the Open Spaces Society and attended by Ann Taylor MP; mountaineer Chris Bonington; Ramblers‚Äô chairman Chris Hall; the leader of Lancashire County Council, Louise Ellman, and Kinder Scout trespass veteran Benny Rothman, Lever Park was again under threat in a further attempt by the water company supported by Horwich Town Council who attempted to remove statutory protection through a parliamentary act in 1997, they were met with considerable local opposition and the act of parliament was blocked a cross party group of six regional Conservative and Labour MPs Terry Lewis, Tom Sackville, Peter Thurnham, Andrew Bennett and Gerald Kaufman and was opposed by the local MP, Den Dover. Roynton Road =Rights of Way= There is a public footpath and a bridleway from Lever Park to Rivington Pike and Terraced Gardens. The public footpath number 82 runs through the gardens from the Ravine via the former Japanese and Kitchen Gardens, which is also an area of open access land with a right to roam, passing upward past the Great Lawn and an area of Bilberries part of the West Pennine Moors SSSI, toward the site of the former Bungalow and landmark Pigeon Tower then heading to Rivington Pike via Belmont Road. The bridleway number 98 is from Lever Park, passing Higher Knoll Farm toward Rivington Pike via Belmont Road. There are a network of roads that provide access to Rivington recorded on the National Street Gazetteer. Access to the park is by vehicle through Lever Park is via Rivington Lane, (USRN 7401372) the former roads in Lever park are gated and are now bridleways and a network of public footpaths. Toward Rivington Pike the old coach road is Belmont Road (USRN 7400767) and is an open public road from Horwich, the road becomes rougher and less maintained the further up the hill it climbs in the direction of the Pigeon Tower, where it splits. The descending road there leads to Lower House car park but the roads surface is washed away and not maintained, the route leading to Rivington Rd and the moorland is gated. Roynton Road (USRN: 7400820) provides access to the hillside and the Terraced Gardens from Lever Park and Sheep House Lane, from the direction of Chorley, Belmont and Horwich, the route has gates. Sport The Rivington Pike Fell Race has been held on Easter Saturday since 1892. The fell race originally started from the Horwich railway works, but since 1930 from the park entrance at Lever Park Avenue. It attracts around 400 runners. The course is long and has a ascent. The area around Rivington and Anglezarke was the location for the 2002 Commonwealth Games mountain biking competition. The area is well used by hikers and hillwalkers. The Holcombe Hunt meets each year at Rivington Hall Barn. Culture Phoebe Hesketh, lived at Fisher House in the village where she wrote several volumes of poetry and two partly autobiographical books Rivington: the story of a village and Rivington: village of the mountain ash. She also wrote a biography, My Aunt Edith about Edith Rigby the suffragette. The artist Alfred East stayed at Roynton Cottage in summer 1909. Lever commissioned a series of paintings of the surrounding landscape, the reservoirs, country park, village and the pike. Lever gave 15 of them to Bolton Art Gallery and others to Bolton School, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Lady Lever Art Gallery at Port Sunlight. East gave two water colours, A glimpse of Rivington Water and In Rivington Park to Kettering Museum and Art Gallery. The gallery acquired an oil painting [From] Rivington Pike that East exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1913 in the 1960s. The Bolton Museum and Masonic Lodge, Ridgmont House, Horwich hold a painting titled \\"Rivington Lakes\\" dated 1872 and with a variation titled Rivington Valley (1857) held at Walker Art Gallery, by Frederick William Hulme.

The Bramble Bank, otherwise known simply as \\"The Brambles\\" is an arrowhead-shaped sandbar in the central Solent which is uncovered at low water spring tides. At other times it presents either a significant navigational hazard or a useful escape from the strong Solent tides. The bank is moving very slowly westward, but is roughly equidistant between the entrance to Southampton Water in the north and the mouth of the River Medina in the south. It is marked at its southeastern limit by the Brambles post sea mark and on its western limit by the West Knoll buoy. The Brambles post has comprehensive weather and sea state monitoring equipment which is relayed in realtime to a website. The sandbar is known for the annual cricket match held there, when the Royal Southern Yacht Club (RSrnYC) play the Island Sailing Club. Cricket match Each year, the Royal Southern Yacht Club (RSrnYC) and the Island Sailing Club meet on the sandbar for a game of cricket. The match takes place when the bank is exposed but never lasts very long before the tide returns. The undulating surface with large puddles ensures it is more a social occasion than a serious cricket match, and the scoring reflects this - the victor of the game is pre-determined, and the two clubs simply take it in turns to \\"win\\" the match, regardless of play. The first match is said to have been played in the 1950s at the behest of pioneering British boatmaker Uffa Fox. The Brambles cricket match has been described as \\"quintessentially English\\" and has even drawn the attention of a House of Commons Standing Committee, when it was mentioned as a light-hearted example of an event which falls geographically between the boundaries of two different licensing authorities. Accidents beached on the bank in 2015 On Tuesday 11 November 2008, on approaching Southampton Docks for her last visit prior to retirement, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 ran aground on the Bramble Bank at approximately 0530 hrs. She required four tugs to pull her clear on the rising tide and arrived in Southampton approximately 90 minutes late. On 3 January 2015 the car transporter was beached on the bank after developing a list. A 200-metre maritime exclusion zone was put into in place around the ship until the salvage operation took place, and airspace below 2,000 ft was also closed to aircraft within . She was refloated on the rising tide on 7 January 2015, and was towed 2 miles east of the bank and moored between East Cowes and Lee on the Solent to await further salvage operations. Shortly before 10pm on 13 February 2016 the container ship APL Vanda ran aground on the bank. Several tugs and crew from Calshot lifeboat station attended and, within a couple of hours, the ship was refloated on the rising tide. In popular culture Bramble Bank is shown and labelled on maps of the Solent in Ship Simulator 2008 and Ship Simulator Extremes, but doesn't pose any threat to the player due to an absence of low tide in those games.

Peter and Paul on Logan Square. He also designed the Academy of Music at Broad and Locust Streets. LeBrun later moved to New York City, where he established the firm Napoleon LeBrun & Sons, which designed numerous notable buildings. Life and career=In Philadelphia LeBrun was a son of the Napoleonic ambassador to the United States who, after the downfall of that regime, remained in the United States and settled in Philadelphia. LeBrun's early architectural training began at the age of 15 when he was placed in the offices of Thomas Ustick Walter in Philadelphia;Hansen, Laura. \\"Fire Hook & Ladder Company No. 14 Designation Report\\" New York Landmarks Preservation Commission (June 17, 1997) Walter later became architect of the United States Capitol. After six years with Walter, LeBrun left to set up his own office in 1841, eventually receiving as his major commissions the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul (1846‚Äì1864) and the Academy of Music (1857). As a young man in his twenties, LeBrun found opportunity in the booming industrial development of the Schuylkill Valley of Pennsylvania in the 1840s. His other early work includes the original version of Trinity Episcopal Church, Pottsville (1847), still standing though much altered by later revisions. His design for the church led to the commission for the Schuylkill County Prison (1851)\\"A Walking TYour of Pottsville, Pennsylvania\\" when the county seat moved from Orwigsburg to Pottsville. He also designed the first Columbia County Courthouse in Bloomsburg and the 1854 Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown. Although both were later extensively redesigned and expanded, the notable marble facade of the Montgomery County Courthouse remains his outward and identifying creation. In Philadelphia, LeBrun was known for his many churches, including not only St. Augustine's and the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul, but also St. Patrick's Catholic Church (1841) on 20th Street and the Episcopal Church of the Epiphany (1848) on 17th Street, now St. John Chrysostom Albanian Orthodox Church.St. John Chrysostom Albanian Orthodox Church website In 1859, he was commissioned to design the Gardel Monument in Mount Vernon Cemetery. In New York City In 1864, LeBrun relocated his office and family to New York City, establishing his reputation there with the Masonic Temple (1870) on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, designed in the Second Empire style; in 1911 the Temple was torn down to be replaced with the current Masonic Building designed by Harry P. Knowles. In 1870, LeBrun's son, Pierre, joined the firm, which became \\"Napoleon LeBrun & Son\\" in 1880, and in 1892 \\"Napoleon LeBrun & Sons\\" after his younger son Michel also joined. As in Philadelphia, LeBrun and his firm, often with Pierre as the lead architect, designed numerous churches in New York City, including the Roman Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist (1872) on West 31st Street and the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin (1894‚Äì1895) on West 46th Street in the Theater District neighborhood. St Mary's was the first church in the world to be designed with a concealed steel skeleton, for this reason it was known in its early days as the \\"Chicago Church\\", after the Chicago school of architecture, which was largely responsible for the use of steel skeletons in skyscraper construction. Other ecclesiastical commissions included the Seventh Presbyterian Church (1842, demolished), the Scots (or Second) Presbyterian Church (1843, no longer extant), the Church of St. Peter the Apostle (German Catholic) on 5th Street (1843, no longer extant), the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Nativity (1844, demolished 2013), the Lombard-style Church of the Epiphany (1869‚Äì1870, burned down),Dunlap, p. 65 and St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on East 12th Street, for which LeBrun designed a French Gothic sanctuary in 1871 which sat behind the original 1847 facade; in 2006 everything but that facade was demolished - it now stands freely in front of a college dormitory built on the site of the sanctuary.Dunlap, p. 191 His office is also responsible for the current St. Michael's Church (34th Street, Manhattan) church, rectory, convent, and school (1904‚Äì1907), which incorporate elements of an earlier church by Lawrence J. O'Connor which was demolished for the construction of the North River Tunnels and Pennsylvania Station.Church of St. Michael Centennial Book (1957) LeBrun designed his first building for the Fire Department of New York in 1880, and the firm continued to work for the Department, designing over 40 buildings, including fire houses, a fire pier and a warehouse. It was also instrumental in designing some of the earliest skyscrapers, including the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower and the Home Life Building. Death LeBrun died in 1901 in New York City, and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

She screams loudly, but Lorne calms her, explaining that his race can survive decapitation if the rest of the body remains intact. Silas is pleased to hear that Cordelia is angry and plans to have his guards get the heads of Wesley and Gunn to add to the Princess's collection. Silas tells the captain of the guards to go after the humans and to kill the \\"bloodsucker\\" Angel. After talking with one of the servants about these other \\"cows\\"‚Äîhumans‚Äîrunning free, Silas blows up the cow's head with a handheld device. He has a similar, but larger machine that can take care of all the cows. Wesley and Gunn wait to have their heads chopped off by the rebels. Before it can happen, guards attack the camp. After the battle, Gunn and Wesley convince the rebels that they are not enemies. Freed, they discuss their plans to find Angel and get home. Wesley offers suggestions for attacking the castle and unintentionally becomes their leader. Angel wakes to a pseudo-oatmeal breakfast made by Fred at her cave. Angel and Fred discuss the words she's written on the walls of the caves, and Angel suspects she's unknowingly been opening the portals in Pylea. They are attacked by castle guards; Angel is speared repeatedly but fights off the demon change until Fred knocks the captain out with a rock. Fred takes care of Angel's wounds while the captain sits in the corner, tied up. The captain tells of plans to kill Cordelia after she mates with the Groosalugg, and that Lorne is already dead. Angel goes to find his friends, and Fred goes with him to lead the way. At the castle, Cordelia summons a servant to show her to the mutilation chamber, where Lorne's body is, but the servant cannot. Instead, Cordelia requests the girl's clothes. Disguised as a servant, Cordelia makes her way into the mutilation chamber and finds body parts strewn about wearing Lorne's clothes. Groosalugg shows up and says he hid Lorne's body and put the clothes on another body to fool the guards. Lorne's body is waiting with his family to be reattached. Groosalugg reveals to Cordelia that during their mating, he would take her visions from her. He also tells her that as a pure human, \\"you were not meant to carry such a burden.\\" Cordelia explains that she uses her visions to fight evil and she doesn't want to give them up. Before they can talk further, she has a vision of Angel's demon fighting the Groosalugg. Angel and Fred arrive at the rebel camp, offering their assistance to the efforts. Landok arrives with Lorne's head in a large basket, explaining that he was bringing it home to the body. Later, Wesley tells Angel he must challenge and kill the Groosalugg. Angel explains that the reason he fired the gang months ago was because he felt the darkness rising in him and he didn't want them to witness it. The demon he changes into is the darkness personified and he's afraid to change into because he doesn't think he can come back to human after it. Wesley has confidence that he can; he's strong enough to do whatever is necessary. Everyone disperses from the camp to prepare for the attack. Angel plants a torch in the ground and calls out to the Groosalugg for battle. Silas, who had been demanding that Cordelia get on with the \\"com-shuk\\" drags the Groosalugg outside to face Angel, lying to him about Angel to make him angry. Led by Wesley and Gunn, the rebels attack, many of whom get killed in the process. Silas attacks Cordelia, blaming her for all the problems of their land, but she decapitates him just before he triggers the device to kill all human slaves. Groosalugg and Angel fight, Angel struggling to stay human, but eventually turning into the demon. just as the demon is about to kill the Groosalugg, Angel's human side regains control. He tells the Groosalugg they need to find another way. The Groosalugg continues fighting. Cordelia arrives and stops the fight by confessing her love for the Groosalugg. The next day, Lorne, his head reattached, says goodbye to his family. Lorne is glad he came back to find out he doesn't belong; as they walk away, he starts to sing. Cordelia's last act as princess is to make a new law abolishing slavery, after which she appoints Groosalugg the ruler of Pylea. With Fred's help, they all return home to LA as Angel's car lands in the middle of Caritas. Far happier than they were before they left, the gang return to the hotel. However, when Angel opens the door he finds Willow waiting for them. Her look tells them it's bad news and he knows, \\"It's Buffy.\\" Production To get the effect of Lorne's detached head, Andy Hallett's body was digitally removed from many scenes. In other situations, an animatronic radio-controlled head was used. Alyson Hannigan's name was placed at the end credits to keep her appearance as a surprise. Arc significance * Crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The team returns home to the Hyperion to find Willow, who reveals that Buffy died in \\"The Gift\\". Angel will travel to Sri Lanka to reflect on the tragedy, as seen in the next season's opener. * The Groosalugg's comment to Cordelia about a pure human not being able to \\"carry the burden\\" of the visions and her statements that they are getting worse help lay the foundation for the later discovery that the visions will kill her, and the decisions she will have to face. * When Cordelia originally received the power to have visions from Doyle, she tried to pass them on to anyone available, including Wesley when he first arrived in Los Angeles.

To Jonathan Swift, who detested him, he was \\"Noisy Tom\\". He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, and his wife Penelope Cadogan, sister of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1709. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Clonmel (1727‚Äì1760) and to the British House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Chichester (1733‚Äì1734). His father was a Roman Catholic, but young Thomas for the sake of his career was obliged to join the Church of Ireland. Despite his nominal Protestantism he was noted for his anti-clerical views, and this earned him the enmity of Swift, who mocked him as \\"Noisy Tom\\". Swift also vilified the elder Sir Thomas, describing him as a traitor, informer and assassin. These charges have no foundation, and seem to be a garbled reference to the elder Sir Thomas's role in uncovering the Assassination Plot of 1696, which was admittedly very advantageous to the Prendergast family. In 1754 the younger Sir Thomas was made Custos Rotulorum and Governor of County Galway. He was Postmaster General for Ireland and a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. In 1739 he married Anne, daughter of Sir Griffith Williams, 6th Baronet of the Williams-Bulkeley baronets of Penrhyn and Catherine Anwyl, but they had no children. After Sir Thomas's death, his widow married his cousin, Terence Prendergast, causing a minor scandal. The baronetcy expired but Prendergast's estates were inherited by his nephew, John Prendergast-Smyth, 1st Viscount Gort, the son of his sister Elizabeth and her husband Charles Smyth. Spurrell, J.C., In Search of Thomas Smyth, Mayor of Limerick, Irish Family History, Vol. 25 (2009) At the time of his death he was apparently expecting to be raised to the peerage as Viscount Clonmel.

Its title derives from a line from the W. B. Yeats poem \\"The Second Coming\\". Plot synopsis A man tries to get his stalled car started while his family waits in the car. Connor appears by the car and warns them of danger just before a tow truck arrives with a vampire driving it. The vampire attacks, but Connor intervenes and kills it. Connor breaks into the hotel through a window just in time to see Angel and friends arrive home and spot Cordelia in the lobby. They try to approach her, but she doesn't remember anything about them or herself. Angel tries to remind Cordelia about who she is, but she is scared and doesn't know what to believe. Lorne approaches the hotel from outside, but Angel sends Gunn to intercept him before Cordelia can see him and be frightened. Angel panics with Fred in the office about how they're going to handle Cordelia's lack of memory while Cordy panics herself in the lobby because of everyone's strange behavior. The phone rings and they let the machine get it until the message reveals more than Cordelia needs to hear and Fred quickly picks it up. Without saying much, she then runs off to get Gunn and prevent a demon from bearing its spawn. Angel takes Cordelia upstairs to one of the rooms where all of her stuff has been stored from her apartment. Cordy looks through some of the boxes as Angel again tries to convince her that she's safe and with friends. After changing into more comfortable clothes, Cordelia nervously practices saying her name in front of a mirror and then reads the eerie messages left in her high school yearbook and searches through pictures of herself from over the years. Cordelia wanders through the halls of the hotel and follows the sound of singing to Lorne's room where he's listening to a client sing. She doesn't see much and heads downstairs to the lobby. Angel removes several jars of blood from the counter before she can see them, but she finds a drop of blood left behind and starts to worry. Gunn and Fred return covered in purple demon goo and talking about killing the demon babies, unaware that Cordelia is hiding behind the counter. She pops up and runs out into the garden only to be jumped by a couple of evil lawyers. She fights them off with Angel's help and then vocalizes her suspicions that she's a spy and they want something from her. Angel denies that and tries to calm her down without revealing the truth to her. Back in her room, Cordelia asks about a picture of her, she wonders if she was a nun, handing him a handful of crucifixes she found in her boxes. Angel vamps out at the burning contact and Cordelia again runs away and into Lorne down in the lobby. She's fed up and wants to know the truth, but when the gang finally tells her everything, she has a hard time believing it. Cordelia sings rather badly so Lorne can read her future but the singing sends Lorne running off to his room without much of an explanation. Angel follows after in search of answers and frustrated, Cordelia takes off on her own, despite Gunn and Fred's attempts to stay with her. Angel desperately tries to get answers from Lorne about his reading of Cordelia, but Lorne is tightlipped. He does reveal that something horrible and evil is coming and it seriously freaked him out. Lilah lies in bed with Wesley and talk about Angel before Wesley conversationally mentions that they're in a \\"relationship\\" and has to pay Lilah a dollar because he lost a bet. Cordelia searches for Angel in the hotel, but instead finds Lorne's client‚Äîa large mouthed human-eating demon‚Äîin one of the halls. She runs from it and is rescued by Connor, who stabs the demon and then takes a willing Cordelia with him to somewhere safer. Angel, Gunn and Fred look at the dead human-eating demon while Lorne updates them on the horrific things he saw when reading Cordelia. Angel and the others set out to find Cordelia. At some sort of a warehouse, Connor and Cordelia talk and bond as Connor leads her to the place he calls home. He's brutally honest with her about everything and Cordelia appreciates his candor. While sleeping at Wesley's, Lilah gets a call on her cell phone about Cordelia's return and rushes off, leaving an eavesdropping Wesley alone. Cordelia tries to sleep, but she can't with so many pieces missing from her puzzle. Connor tries to comfort her and remind her of the few things he knew about her. She recognizes his loneliness that somewhat matches her own. As Angel updates the others on his failure to locate Cordelia, Wesley arrives with some answers. He reveals that Cordelia's with Connor but that Wolfram and Hart are planning to go after her again for the knowledge she may have about the Powers. Connor sleeps next to Cordelia with his hand inappropriately placed on her chest but moves it to quiet her as someone breaks into the room. More men attack and Cordelia and Connor are forced to fight them off as best as they can. Lilah watches the proceedings from the roof on a video feed as the gang arrive and help fight off the Wolfram and Hart minions. After the bad guys are defeated, Angel tries to get Cordelia to return with him, but she chooses to stay with Connor because Connor was truthful with her. Although her choice hurts them, Angel and the others leave. Wesley finds the dollar bill Lilah left behind on the floor of his bedroom and realizes something. Back at the hotel, they hear a noise in the office that distracts them. They find Lorne tied up in the office, a bad wound on his forehead. He reveals that Wolfram and Hart used a special burrowing demon to sneak into his head and steal the knowledge Lorne had about Cordelia. It was all a trap to get Lorne alone and vulnerable. Wesley shows up at Lilah's door and gets upset with her because she tricked him into luring Angel away from Lorne. She reminds him it was just part of her job and that she spared Lorne's life because he was Wesley's friend. Cordelia sleeps while Connor watches over her, while at the hotel, Angel stares out into the night and longingly back at his empty bed.

Although its editors are not affiliated with any particular institute or traditionalist group, the paper is sympathetic to Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the Society of St. Pius X. Founded in 1968, it is the oldest Traditionalist Catholic newspaper in the United States. The Remnant is said to strive to adhere to Catholic teaching in every aspect of its journalism. The name The Remnant is a reference to the remnant of Isaiah and the belief that only a remnant of Catholics holding to the traditional teachings and practice of the Church remain after the sweeping changes brought by the Second Vatican Council. History The Remnant traces its roots back to The Wanderer, the \\"parent paper\\" of The Remnant and the oldest Catholic weekly newspaper in the United States. The Remnant was a result of a dispute between Walter Matt, the editor of The Wanderer who served the paper for over thirty years, and his brother Alphonse Matt. Walter Matt opposed the changes within the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council; Alphonse Matt supported them. Walter Matt left The Wanderer, which remained under Alphonse, to start The Remnant in 1967. The paper has described itself as the flagship of the traditional Catholic movement in the United States. The Remnant is now edited by Walter Matt's youngest son, Michael J. Matt. Notable traditionalists who have written for the paper include Thomas Woods, Christopher Ferrara, John C. Rao, and Michael Davies. From 2005 to 2013, The Remnant was a very vigorous defender of the pontificate of Benedict XVI as its writers believe he has vindicated them on issues that have divided them from other Traditionalists and from conservative Catholics associated with The Wanderer, EWTN, and Catholic Answers. Under the current pontificate of Pope Francis, the newspaper has heavily criticized his policies.  Additional projects  * After producing daily video updates from Rome after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI and the conclave which ultimately elected Pope Francis, The Remnant began producing video commentary and events coverage under the title of Remnant TV. Remnant TV releases weekly talk show styled YouTube videos in three series: Remnant TV Forum, Remnant Special Report, and The Remnant Underground. Michael Matt is the host and principal commentator; regular guests include contributors to the Remnant, and other Catholic commentators. * The Remnant has hosted and organized tours and pilgrimages to the Holy Land and throughout Europe under the name \\"Remnant Tours\\". It has also organized the United States Chapter of the three-day Chartres Pilgrimage, a seventy-mile walking pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres during Pentecost weekend. * Remnant Press publishes Traditionalist Catholic works, such as Dietrich von Hildebrand.

Gwen Raiden returns to ask Gunn to help her rescue a young girl from a wealthy and powerful tycoon. Meanwhile, Angel and the rest of his team are researching Cordelia‚Äôs sudden pregnancy.

She is planning a heist, ostensibly to rescue a young girl, Lisa, from a tycoon who kidnapped her from the head of a company over a business deal gone bad. She enlists the help of Gunn, someone suave enough for the job. They arrive by limo at the tycoon's compound, dressed in formal wear for a dinner party. After some difficulty, Gunn gains entrance by speaking Japanese and charming the host, Takeshi Morimoto. It soon becomes apparent to Gunn that Gwen has tricked him: Instead of a kidnapped girl, Gwen is after a high-tech military device titled L.I.S.A. which will enable Gwen to control her electrical powers and touch other people. Gunn is caught in the ruse taking the daughter of Morimoto, though he is able to fight his way free. He finds Gwen after the distraction he had created for her, but they are cornered by Morimoto and his men. Gwen sends a shock of electricity through them all, and Gunn and Gwen escape back to her place. They test the device, a prototype that regulates components of the body for the purpose of stealth, on Gwen. It enters her system through her bare back, and they both realize it works. With relief, the two kiss. Without much human contact in all her years and knowing that L.I.S.A. is only a prototype, Gwen is reluctant to let things continue, but Gunn convinces her otherwise, and they continue to kiss and it is implied that they have sex. Meanwhile, at the hotel, the gang reels from the shock of Cordelia's very sudden pregnancy. Connor is still agitated by the situation, and Cordelia continues to manipulate his feelings about their family. She explains that she may ask him to do other things before the baby arrives, but there will be a good reason for them all. Fred and Wesley research and talk about the strange relationship between Cordelia and Connor. At the office, Angel tries to remember an ancient code from Lilah's book that may tell them something about the Master. Cordelia tries to disguise her displeasure that they could be getting crucial information about her and attempts to spill coffee on the paper, but Angel's not-so-accurate memory of the text saves her the trouble. Lorne returns with news that he has information on a ritual that can be performed to restore his empathic powers and that he has to go off on his own to do it. In an empty building, Lorne prepares the ritual, while unknown to him, Cordelia watches from a hidden spot above. Lorne begins the ritual and starts to sing as Cordelia slowly descends some stairs and approaches with a raised knife. Before she can strike, the lights suddenly turn on, exposing Cordelia and Angel standing behind her. Cordy turns and finds Fred and Wesley are also there, both with guns pointed at her, and Lorne refers to a Magic 8-ball to find out if Cordy's been bad.

Written and directed by Steven S. DeKnight, it was originally broadcast on April 2, 2003 on the WB network. Angel roughs up the demon guide Skip to find out why Cordelia has turned evil. Skip tells them a higher being has manipulated events over the past few years to cause itself to be reborn. Meanwhile, Cordelia convinces Connor to mystically expedite the birth using the blood of a virgin. Angel arrives in time to stop him, but hesitates, and Cordelia gives birth to a full grown woman. Plot Cordelia is in the basement of the Hyperion, surrounded by the team, who have figured out that she was the Beast's master. She brags that there was a time when she would have figured out that they were using Lorne as bait eons before it even crossed their minds; she claims to be a lot smarter than Angel. She asks what tipped Angel off and he replies, \\"Tongue, slip of.\\" In a flashback, Cordelia tells the gang about the baby and calling it \\"my sweet.\\" Angel says that this was the same phrase the Beast's master used when she talked to Angelus. Cordelia is surprised that she was almost able to end the world and it was two words that tipped him off. Angel demands to know where the real Cordelia is. Connor jumps down through the glass roof and Angel tries to convince him that Cordelia isn‚Äôt who he thinks she is, but he doesn‚Äôt listen. He fights off the gang, and runs off with Cordelia. In the confusion, Angel is accidentally hit with a tranquillizer dart intended for Connor. \\"What are you?\\" Angel manages to ask, before passing out, and Lorne's Magic 8-Ball rolls next to him, replying, \\"Ask Again Later.\\" After the group has recovered from Connor's attack, Gunn returns to the hotel from his romp with Gwen and they fill him in. Fred and Wesley realize Cordelia has been \\"grooming Connor as her champion.\\" They wonder when Cordelia turned evil and if her amnesia upon returning from the higher plane was an act or a side effect. Angel points out that nothing happened until Lorne gave Cordelia the memory potion in \\"Spin the Bottle.\\" Lorne realizes that Wolfram & Hart stole information from his head to keep the gang from knowing about the Beast's master. Gunn wonders how Cordelia could get away with killing Manny, since she didn't have any blood on her clothes; Wesley determines that she took off her clothes first. She was then able to slip out, kill the Svea priestesses, and steal Angel's soul. Her vision of how to re-ensoul Angel was misdirection, so that she could put a spell on Lorne and keep him from reading Angelus properly. She then released Angelus from the cage and killed Lilah. The gang wonder what exactly Cordelia is pregnant with. Cordelia and Connor head to a deserted warehouse, where Cordelia tells Connor that the gang were trying to hurt her \\"You were right about Angel,\\" she tells him. \\"He's an animal, and he's turned everyone against us.\\" He promises he‚Äôll kill all of them before he lets them hurt her. \\"My sweet, sweet boy,\\" she replies. Angel returns to the Hyperion, having had no success finding Cordelia and Connor. Wesley tells him that he's wasting his time looking for them; Connor will stay hidden if he wants to. Angel is distraught that the truth was in front of him the whole time, but Wesley says that Cordelia played on his emotions in order to cloud his judgment. Wesley suggests going to the Powers That Be, but Angel reminds him that the last few times he's gone, they haven‚Äôt been forthcoming. He says that they wouldn't stop Cordelia because they \\"didn‚Äôt want to get their hands dirty,\\" so they need to find someone who's willing to: \\"somebody right in the middle of all this.\\" Angel goes to ask Skip about Cordelia and at first, Skip pretends to be clueless. As they talk, Angel suspects Skip is part of a conspicuous act to keep them in the dark and protect whatever it is that Cordelia's doing. Angel eventually defeats Skip and hauls him back to his (Angel's) dimension. Cordelia suggests they perform a ritual to speed up her pregnancy and bring the baby to life immediately. Connor rescues a young girl from a vampire attack, but then knocks her out and brings her, unconscious, to Cordelia, so that they can use her blood in the ritual. However, a vision of Connor's dead mother Darla appears before him, claiming to be sent by the Powers. She explains why she couldn't be part of his life, then tries to convince him that killing an innocent is the wrong choice. After Skip wakes up, trapped by a magical circle, Fred and Angel threaten him with the Sphere of the Infinite Agonies until Skip confesses Cordelia is not in control of her own body. Cordelia didn't ascend to a higher plane because she was a good deserving soul, it was because she was a part of the plan all along. Skip explains all the big events in their lives have been designed for a much bigger purpose: Cordy receiving the visions, Lorne leaving Pylea, Gunn's sister being sired, Fred going to Pylea, and Wesley sleeping with Lilah. Gunn argues that they have free will, but Skip says only about little stuff. The team realize that Connor's birth was also a part of the whole plan; \\"an impossible birth to make one possible.\\" Angel says that Connor was a vessel and Gunn realizes that the being controlling Cordelia is going to give birth to itself. Angel asks how to stop this being, but Skip tells him that the only way is to kill Cordelia. When she gives birth to the being, the strain will be too much and she'll either die or become incapacitated. Gunn tries to reassure Fred that even though it appears their future is out of their hands, they always need to act as if the decisions are theirs because they may never know when they will be. After Wesley and Lorne locate Cordelia, Angel arms himself and prepares to leave. He refuses to let any of the others go with him, unable to let them carry the burden of killing Cordelia. Darla coaches Connor as he starts to free the young girl, but Cordelia catches him and realizes that Darla is trying to turn him away from her. Connor finds himself in the middle as Darla and Cordelia fill his head with opposing suggestions until Connor can't take anymore and sides with Cordelia, grabbing the girl and dragging her into the other room. Cordelia slashes the woman's throat with a cleaver - Connor sees the woman as Darla and stares at the scene before him, reality hitting him. Then Cordelia has Connor coat his hand in the dead woman's blood and place it on her stomach. The bloody print is soaked into Cordy's skin, her labor begins and everything begins to shake around them. The circle around Skip breaks and he attacks the others; Wesley shoots him dead after finding an open spot. Angel arrives at the factory, intent upon destroying Cordelia before she can have the baby, but Connor stands in his way. Angel and Connor fight with each other while Cordelia struggles with labor. After tossing Connor aside, Angel raises his sword to kill Cordelia but a bright light sends him and Connor flying back. The being using Cordy's body rises in the form of a full-grown, nude, dark-skinned woman. Angel raises his sword again to kill this being, but on sight of her, he drops to his knees with Connor, seemingly awestruck. Production details The costume for Skip took three and a half hours to put on, and required an additional five hours of makeup. Although David Denman hated the process, he was \\"surprised and very excited\\" after learning that Skip was actually a villain. Julie Benz was called back to reprise her role as Darla, in her first and only scene with Vincent Kartheiser, who plays her character's son. \\"I loved the dynamic between the two of them,\\" Benz says. \\"Darla really is the mother who gave up everything for her son and he doesn't appreciate it.\\" To subtly emphasize that Darla finally achieved redemption, the wardrobe department had Darla wear a soft, virginal dress, and lit her in warm candlelight. Benz explains that she attempted to convey \\"the pure love that exists in a relationship between mother and son. It's an unconditional love, and it‚Äôs probably the most simple relationship Darla has ever had.\\" Reception and reviews Author Peter David said he was \\"underwhelmed\\" by the suggestion that all events of consequence in the series had been manipulated so that Jasmine could be born. \\"That's pushing predestination to the point where it seems that every decision the characters have made was fated,\\" he complains. However actor David Denman, who plays Skip, calls this episode \\"probably the best so far. You find out what Skip's all about and where he's from.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Angel (season 4) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes ","title":"Inside Out (Angel)"},{"id":"3579910","text":"The Battle of Renty was fought on 12 August 1554, between France and the Holy Roman Empire at Renty, a northern French secondary theatre of the Italian Wars.

Written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain, and directed by Marita Grabiak, it was originally broadcast on April 9, 2003 on the WB network. As Cordelia lies in a coma following her demonic delivery, the rest of the gang becomes enchanted by her unexpected offspring - a full grown woman, whom Angel names Jasmine, who hypnotizes anyone she meets by mere sight. Jasmine tells the gang that she is a former higher being who wants the world clean of all evil. But when Fred has a sudden vision of Jasmine as something other than good, or human, she must find the root to Jasmine‚Äôs true nature on her own. The episode's title is derived from the R.E.M song of the same name. Plot After bursting from Cordelia's womb in a flash of blue-green light, the godly woman materializes and covers herself with a blanket. She appreciates the world around her and thanks Cordelia for giving her life. Guiltily, Angel offers the woman his sword to punish him for his earlier intentions of killing her. Fred cleans up around the office while she worries and rants to Lorne about what happened with Cordelia and whether Angel could have really killed her. Connor returns to the hotel and Fred pulls a knife on him, but his strange peaceful behavior confuses her. Angel shows that he's returned as well with a no-longer pregnant Cordelia and he's just as strangely happy as Connor. Wesley and Gunn come upstairs from the basement where they were dismembering Skip, and they all marvel over Cordelia's return and the strange behavior of Angel and Connor. Awe-struck Angel and Connor boast about this godly creature that rose from Cordelia whom they don't want to kill, but merely to worship. Wesley tries to convince Angel that he's under a magical influence and this creature is evil, but then the woman arrives and kindly offers to help the gang as they all fall to their knees. Later, as Cordelia rests in a bed and candles are lit around the room, the woman explains how she was a power in the very beginning, before man, then became a watcher as humans developed, and finally could not stand to watch any longer and planned a return. She explains how Angel's trip to the trials to win Darla's life bought not Darla's life but Connor's, which was just one of the miracles necessary to bring her into the world. Once Connor was born and Cordelia had ascended to a higher plane, she had the vessels necessary to bring her into the world. She then tells the group that they have all been drowning in the war against evil, but that soon she will take them on the offensive and turn the tide. A group of vampires tries bowling with a human head for a ball, but it doesn't work. One of them tries to explain that they're there for a good reason, but he doesn't have time to finish as the gang appear and start to fight. The woman and Fred sit and talk about a name, but as they sit, one vampire scratches the woman with its claws. Angel chases the vampire outside and stakes it in front of a crowd of dining people. The woman comes outside, her arm bleeding from the scratch and the crowd falls to their knees. She preaches to them about her power and how wonderful the world will be now that she's there. A man in the crowd grabs a knife and charges at this apparent \\"monster,\\" but Angel vamps and stops the man, punching him repeatedly. The woman stops Angel and brushes her hand across the man's face before asking Wesley to call for an ambulance. She continues to preach to the crowd about good things as the beaten man wonders why the others can't see what he sees. At the hotel, the gang tries to brainstorm ideas for a name that fits for the woman. Fred feels guilty about letting the woman get hurt, and muses about how she can clean the shirt for the woman, despite the lack of need for it. As Fred rushes off to continue trying to clean the shirt, the woman observes the common love Wesley and Gunn have for Fred. Connor apologizes for allowing the woman to be hurt, but she shows that the wound has almost healed completely already. He questions why the man tried to hurt her, but she doesn't have much of an explanation for him. The woman moves outside to see Angel, admiring the smell of the jasmine in the Hotel's garden. Angel feels terrible about failing her again and worries about becoming too happy, but the woman offers him inspiration and comfort for his feelings. Fred scrubs roughly at the shirt while Angel and the other males set out on a mission to destroy vampires and demons, guided by the all-powerful woman. The next day, Fred returns to the lobby, revealing that she had to buy a new shirt for the woman, then breaks down into tears because she can't stand not being around the woman. Upstairs, Lorne shows the woman her new, beautifully decorated room and she loves it. After Lorne leaves, she senses Connor walking in the halls outside and invites him in to talk. She explains why he's special, why he deserves happiness and why he was chosen to be her father. Fred comes into the room to give the woman the new shirt, but instead of the woman's normal beauty, Fred sees a decaying corpse covered in insects. She panics and as the others come in to see what the fuss is about, she quickly excuses herself. Fred goes to talk to a still unconscious Cordelia, and tells her about the seriousness of their situation since no one else seems aware that there might be a problem or how to deal with it. Angel catches Fred and talks to her about the great new woman in their lives. Fred tries to get him to think about the strangeness of their situation and this seemingly wonderful woman, but Angel's faith is unwavering. Later, Fred goes to the local hospital to check up on the man that tried to attack the godlike woman. The receptionist eventually tells Fred where she can find the man, John Stoler: in the Psychiatric ward. Fred sneaks into John Stoler's room, where he's strapped to a bed, and confronts him about what he saw. She convinces him that she saw the same thing and then he reveals that the side of his face that Jasmine touched has become deformed and decayed. He tells her she's been called like him to stop this woman and her evil, but Fred doesn't like that idea very much and runs off. Fred returns to the hotel to find that the hotel is full of people who followed Jasmine back to the hotel after she took a walk. Fred talks covertly to Wesley about her visit to the hospital and what she saw. Wesley says he believes her, then goes over to talk to Gunn and then Jasmine upstairs. The news spreads amongst the gang and Fred panics, heading for the weapons cabinet. She grabs a crossbow and lets a bolt fly at Jasmine. Angel takes the bolt in the shoulder and drops to the floor below with Connor chasing after. Lorne tries to confront Fred about her actions, but she pulls a knife on him and uses him to keep the others at bay. Jasmine tells Fred that her love will always be there and Fred lets Lorne go, then runs away alone. Fred drives alone and stops along the street, crying to herself. Later, after the other guests have left, Angel brings the woman a bundle of jasmine flowers, while the others talk about the fact that Fred is now evil. The woman tries to motivate and keep the mood positive, but classifies Fred as a danger to their purpose. The gang decides that they need to kill Fred, but the woman suggests they wait and try to help her first. A depressed Fred has breakfast at a diner and she watches as the morning news program has a special guest: the godlike creature, Jasmine. The other patrons in the diner drop to their knees and a horrified Fred wanders out onto the streets, alone. Production=Arc significance * This episode demonstrates, though does not state, the power of Jasmine's blood to reveal her true form. Both Fred and Stoler (the restaurant patron who attacked Jasmine) were exposed; Fred to the blood on Jasmine's sweater, which she scrubbed until her own fingers bled, and Stoler to the blood on the vampire's claws before Angel could stake him. Reception In this episode, Jasmine draws a line all the way back to \\"The Trial\\" in explaining all the events of the last two seasons. Webzine PopMatters was dissatisfied with this idea, complaining that \\"the whole 'it's all part of the Plan' thing becomes an excuse for all sorts of leaps in the plot.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Angel (season 4) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Fiction about mind control ","title":"Shiny Happy People (Angel)"},{"id":"3579917","text":"Sini may refer to:  People =Given name * Sini (name), a Finnish female given name * Sini Jose (born 1987), Indian sprinter * Zeng Sini (born 1988), Chinese cyclist Surname * Fata Sini (born 1966), Samoan rugby footballer * Linda Sini (1924‚Äì1999), Italian actress * Simone Sini (born 1992), Italian footballer  Places  * Sini, Jharkhand, India * Sini, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Iran * Sini, Razavi Khorasan, Iran * Sini, Sardinia, Italy  Other uses  * Sini (script), a form of Chinese Islamic calligraphy * Sini (Turkish dining), a communal food tray * Sports Institute for Northern Ireland  See also  * Saini, an Indian caste * Sinai (disambiguation) ","title":"Sini"},{"id":"3579936","text":"The was an improved version of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks of the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. It had a more powerful main gun, engine and thicker armor. It was the first Japanese tank to have a communication radio as standard equipment. Production of the tank did not begin until 1943, due to the higher priority of steel allocated to the Imperial Navy for warship construction. A total of 170 units were built. All of the tanks produced were allocated for the defense of the Japanese home islands, against the anticipated Allied Invasion. History and development After 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army quickly realized that its 1930s designed medium tank, the Type 97 Chi-Ha, was inferior to the 1940s generation of Allied armor, such as the M4 Sherman. Since the Type 97‚Äôs low-velocity 57 mm main gun was designed for infantry support in 1938, it could not penetrate the 1940s generation of Allied armor, whereas its own thin armor made the Type 97 vulnerable to most adversaries equipped with anti-armor capabilities. In response, a new series of tanks based on an improved Type 97 design was conceived. The first of this new series was the Type 1 Chi-He. Work on the design began in 1941. However, production did not begin until 1943, due to the higher priority of steel allocated to the Imperial Navy for warship construction. A total of 170 units were built from 1943‚Äì44, and they did not see any combat.History of War: Type 1 Chi-He Medium Tank Design Type 1 Chi-He Type 1 Chi-He on left and Type 97 Shinhoto Chi-Ha on right Type 1 Chi- He rear view Compared to the Type 97, the Type 1 Chi-He was slightly longer and taller. Its angled, thicker frontal armor was welded, as opposed to riveted. The adding of the frontal armor and a fifth crewman increased the weight, but the \\"streamlining\\" of the hull reduced the increase to only 1.5 tons. The Mitsubishi Type 100 diesel engine at 240 hp generated 70 horsepower more than the Mitsubishi Type 97 diesel engine, and was thus more than able to compensate for the additional weight in armor. The Type 1 Chi-He's 47 mm high- velocity gun had a barrel length of 2.250 mm, a muzzle velocity of , and a penetration capability of 55 mm/100 m, 40 mm/500, 30 mm/1,000 meters; over double that of the Type 97s low-velocity main gun.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: \\"Tank Guns\\" It was more reliable and more accurate, with the gun barrel having a 16 groove rifling and an improved firing mechanism. The gun did require the installation of elevation gear (on the earlier Type 97 the gunner had to physically move the gun up or down on his shoulder). In light of these improvements, the gun was adequate against Allied armor. The ammunition was the same as used with the anti-tank version of the gun. The tanks carried 120 rounds of ammunition with both armor-piercing and armor-piecing high explosive shells. The gun was placed in a three-man turret, which had space for the commander, gun-layer and loader. The gun could be elevated and depressed between +20 and -15 degrees. This gun was used in the Type 97-Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha tank, and on the Type 3 Ka-Chi Amphibious Tank. The Type 1 Chi-He was also the first Japanese tank to carry a radio as standard equipment in each tank, eliminating the need to use signal flags. Combat record All of the Type 1s were allocated to the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion. Despite Type 1's superiority in terms of armor and firepower over the earlier Type 97, it still underperformed against the American M4 Sherman, leading to a new design known as the Type 3 Chi-Nu. Variants The Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank retained the same chassis and suspension of the Type 1 Chi-He, with the addition of an enlarged turret ring for the new large hexagonal gun turret with a commander's cupola. A more direct variant was the Type 97 Ka-So command tank. It was built to replace the older Type 97 Shi-Ki. It was based on the Type 1 Chi-He and had additional radios in its turret. A wood dummy main gun was placed in the turret. This way the Ka-So did not stand out from the regular tanks like the older Shi-Ki models, which had a machine gun in the turret and a 37 mm gun on the hull.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: Command Tank \\"Shi-Ki\\" Another variant designed in 1944 was the Type 2 Ku-Se self-propelled gun (SPG). It used the Type 1 Chi-He chassis and was armed with a 75 mm gun in an open casemate with light frontal armour only.

Written and directed by Jeffrey Bell, it was originally broadcast on April 16, 2003 on the WB network. While Jasmine settles in at the hotel with her followers for a mysterious gathering, Fred is forced to flee Los Angeles while the rest of the gang hunt her down, with assistance from most of the populace, who are also under Jasmine's enchantment. Fred learns that Jasmine's blood is the key to seeing her for what she really is and plots to free Angel and the gang from Jasmine's influence. Plot Thanks to the events of \\"Shiny Happy People,\\" everyone in L.A. is happy and cheerful. The first scene opens with the Beach Boys‚Äô ‚ÄúWouldn't It Be Nice?‚Äù playing behind a montage of harmonious street scenes of pedestrians and drivers in the city, until Fred runs into a car at an intersection and the music stops. She‚Äôs pursued by Wesley and Gunn, but Fred eludes them by hiding out in a sewer under a shopping center. Back at the Hyperion, Lorne has to turn away people who have come to the hotel to see Jasmine. She makes time to talk to many of them, and Angel asks how Jasmine always knows exactly what to say to people. She tells him that she looks into their hearts, though sometimes what they need is right on their faces. She tells a man in Spanish that his mustache \\"provides [him] great strength and dignity.\\" Wesley and Gunn return with the news that Fred escaped. Connor wants to kill her and bring her back, but Wesley reminds him that Jasmine wants her alive. In the lobby, Jasmine invites a couple of people to go upstairs with her. Fred goes to the Magic Bullet Bookstore, which she apparently visited three days earlier to read up on mass hypnosis. Now she's looking for information on mind control. The shopkeeper, Ted (Patrick Fischler), says that he used to be obsessed with mind control, and though he still believes in it, he just doesn't worry about it anymore because of Jasmine. The shopkeeper pulls out a gun (as well as a yoyo and a book called Making Mind Control Work for You) and says that he thinks Fred is trying to get the government to learn about Jasmine's love. Connor and Angel try to track Fred through the sewers; Angel learns that Connor has been tracking people since he was a kid. Holtz would tie him to a tree and then run away, expecting Connor to free himself and find Holtz. Angel is shocked that Holtz abandoned Connor like that, but Connor considers it good, since he learned to track. Angel and Connor both suddenly close their eyes, receiving a message that Jasmine wants them back at the Hyperion. Jasmine explains that everyone is connected by love, and she wants to test that connection to see if they can find Fred. Everyone holds hands as Jasmine tells them to picture Fred and concentrate on finding her. Fred checks into a motel, where people around her start looking at her. Fred takes off running, passing a man who is fueling his car. Another car hits his car, which sets off a fire. The guy from the car gets out and, in flames, walks to Fred and tells her not to be afraid. Jasmine's hand starts smoking and burning as she takes the physical damage of the man; she adds that she saw Fred, and now that all of the Jasmaniacs know what she looks like, she can't hide anywhere. Fred walks by the side of a highway and falls down a hill while trying to run from an SUV. She takes refuge in a cave where a short demon is also holed up. The creature assures Fred that he is vegetarian and won't hurt her; it doesn't seem to matter, since Fred makes sure he knows that she can handle herself. Back at the Hyperion, Lorne gives the \\"hourly Jasmine report,\\" then announces that he has a surprise - open mic night. A montage follows of various odes to Jasmine, including Lorne singing \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and Angel and Connor singing a revised version of \\"Mandy\\". The demon in the cave reveals that he's hiding out because of \\"those freakin‚Äô Jasminites and their demon jihad\\", but then he uncovers a bunch of human hands, revealing himself to be carnivorous, and attacks Fred, who is injured but fights back with an axe. Fred returns to the Magic Bullet Bookstore, luring a crowd of people outside. The shopkeeper tells Fred that she's famous now, and that he's not supposed to hurt her. Jasmine arrives with Angel and Connor and, in exchange for the shopkeeper's help, tells him that Lee Harvey Oswald worked alone in assassinating JFK. Fred says that she's sorry, and Jasmine accepts the apology, but it turns out that Fred is talking to Angel. She raises the shopkeeper's handgun, aims at Jasmine, and fires. The bullet goes through Jasmine and then into Angel's shoulder. Angel vamps out and attacks Fred, grabbing the gun and pointing it at her jaw. Crying, Fred tells him to look at Jasmine. He does, seeing the same decaying, maggot-infested flesh that Fred saw earlier. Jasmine realizes that it was her blood that released Fred and Angel and tells Connor that Angel is infected. Fred shoots Jasmine several more times before Connor stops her. Angel runs out with Fred and Jasmine keeps Connor from following them. Jasmine sees how much blood she's lost and tells the shopkeeper to burn the store down. In the hotel office, Jasmine explains that they've lost Angel to Fred: \\"by being loving to Fred, I opened the door to her hate. By trying to save Fred, I lost Angel. It won't happen again. We must eradicate their hate.\\" Fred explains that Jasmine's blood breaks the spell - she got it in her system when she washed Jasmine's shirt, and Angel got it after the bullet passed through Jasmine. Fred decides that they need to get more of Jasmine's blood so that they can break the spell for the others. They hear people coming, and Fred kisses Angel to throw the people off, but they do have to run. Later they sneak not-so-stealthily into Cordelia‚Äôs room, where she‚Äôs still comatose. Angel apologizes to Cordelia, then starts to cut her arm with a knife. She grabs his wrist and he panics, thinking that she‚Äôs awake. Fred has to tell him that people in comas sometimes move or do things that don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre waking up. Meanwhile, Jasmine tells Connor to keep guard in the hallway as she goes into her room with her chosen guests. She tells them to strip, and as they do, she heals her gunshot wounds. Connor stands guard outside Jasmine‚Äôs room; inside, green light shines. In the next act, the green light disappears from Jasmine‚Äôs room. Connor asks her where the people went, and Jasmine replies, \\"I ate them.\\" \\"Cool,\\" Connor says. Angel and Fred succeed in \\"infecting\\" Lorne with Cordelia's blood to break the spell. Lorne lures Wesley and Gunn upstairs, grabs a baseball bat, and knocks them out so that Fred can administer the cure. When they come to, Wesley brings Connor in, and the others hold him down for the cure. After Connor calms down, Angel tells him they had to make him see the truth. \\"You understand why we‚Äôre here?\\" Angel asks. Connor nods and goes to the door. He throws it open and yells, \\"They‚Äôre here! Come quick!\\" Production This was Jeffrey Bell's first experience as a director. \\"What's the word?\\" Bell says when asked how it felt to direct. \\"Terrifying.\\" Arc significance * Angel, Lorne, Wes, and Gunn are exposed to Jasmine's true visage. * It is revealed that Jasmine eats people. * Connor is revealed to be impervious to Jasmine's blood. Continuity *At least a week had passed since Fred was exposed to Jasmine's blood in \\"Shiny Happy People\\" Cultural references The title of the bookstore and the episode itself is a reference to the Single Bullet Theory of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Jasmine confirms the theory when she tells the shopkeeper that \\"Oswald acted alone\\", thus implying that a single bullet struck two people, moments before the same thing happens to her.

She was registered at St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador on completion. For many years she crossed back and forth over the Atlantic, bringing timber from Quebec, Canada which was then sailed to Padstow, Cornwall. In Cornwall she was loaded with passengers who then sailed back to Canada. Many of these passengers were Cornish people emigrating to the United States.  History  First, she was sold to Avery, the well- established Padstow merchant house. As a brand new deep water square rigger owned by Padstow, a full Lloyd's surveying port, trading from Padstow to Quebec City and other North American ports taking substantial numbers of emigrants and returning with prime timber for Padstow's expanding shipyards in some ways she marks the zenith of Padstow shipping.

She carried on as a Quebec trader, sailing from Falmouth and Plymouth and even from Gloucester. In 1865 J. Moore of Stonehouse, Devon was her owner, and her record ends with the note \\"Abandoned at Sea 3 July 1866\\".  Side information  In April/May 1855, the Clio sailed for Quebec. Her sister ships were the John, Siam and Oriental. The Captain of Clio was William Symons, the others being Edward Rawle (John), Charles Rawle (Siam) and Henry Tom (Oriental). The Rawles originated from Boscastle, the others from Padstow. The Rawles were a ship-owning family. Joint owners (certainly of the John) were; Thomas Ham, 10 Prospect Street, Plymouth; William Williams, draper, of Padstow; Robert Williams Avery, ship owner, 3 Charles Place, Plymouth; Philip Rawle the Younger, ship owner, 37 Gibbon Street, Plymouth; Philip Rawle the Elder of Boscastle, ship owner, 2 Gibbon Street, Plymouth; James Moore, merchant clerk of Richmond Walk, Plymouth.

Plot synopsis Angel shuts the door on Connor, letting the others escape through the fire escape. Angel then barges out into the hall and begins to pound Connor into unconsciousness. As Fred and the others bring the car around on the street, Angel and Connor come flying out of the window. Angel gets in the car and orders Wesley to drive, even as Jasmine and her followers approach. They listen to a radio announcer reporting that the mayor has named L.A. a \\"citadel of Jasmine\\". In her suite, Jasmine has several of her followers come to her while Connor wakes from his unconsciousness. Restored by feeding on her followers, Jasmine heals Connor and then reassures him that they'll deal with Angel and the others. Wesley pulls up at a gas station. While Gunn fills the car, the others are attacked by people at the station speaking with Jasmine's voice. Once the car is filled, they all take off, but police cars and other followers chase after them. Leaving the car behind, Angel leads the others down into the sewers, where they are surprised by a group of young kids, who point sticks and makeshift spears at the gang. One of the kids recognizes Gunn and turns out to be Golden, the younger brother of one of Gunn's former crew members. Something causes their surroundings to shake and the youngest of the crew, Matthew, warns that it's back. The kids guide Angel and the others to their hideout, which is secured by bars and makeshift gates. Angel grabs a weapon and directs his team to go out and help get rid of this unidentified monster. Connor goes to check on Jasmine, but finds that Cordelia is no longer on the bed. Jasmine explains that Cordy is in a safe place where her blood can't be used as a threat. Connor wants to go out and find Angel and the others, but Jasmine won't let him yet. Jasmine gouges her nails into Connor's hand as she demands that he let go of his pain and give it to her. As she releases his hand and Connor releases his pain, the wounds on his hand appear on hers as well. While searching for the creature in the sewers, Golden is grabbed and pulled up into a high tunnel, but Angel flies up after him and saves him. Angel returns with his vampire face and scares Matthew into running away. Fred and Gunn chase after him, and Angel realizes that Wesley has been taken while they weren't looking. Fred and Gunn chase after Matthew as they talk about feelings. They start to talk about when they killed the professor and how much that it hurts them both. They arrive on the surface and carefully scour the streets for Matthew, finding him in an alley. He refuses to return with them, so Gunn simply knocks the boy unconscious. Fred is stunned by the action, but helps Gunn carry the boy back anyway. Angel tells Lorne to stay with the others while he goes to find Wesley, but in light of Angel's newly discovered demon side, Golden and the others are not keen on the idea of letting Angel out of their sight alone. With spears pointed at him, Angel doesn't bother trying to defend his nature, saying he wouldn't be able to, and instead points out that if he chose, he could kill them all without difficulty. A demonic crab-like creature approaches Wesley, proclaiming that his kind loved \\"her\\" first. Once Wesley realizes that the demon is talking of Jasmine, the demon scolds Wesley for giving her a name, then scurries off to work on a mass of flesh and bone against a wall, cutting and stitching together the body of a vampire. Wesley questions where the demon is from and he points out a blue sphere that's the key to his dimension, but warns that the dimension is not one a human can survive. The demon explains that he's working on blood magic, not magic that consists of words. The vampire trapped in the sadistic web asks to just be killed, but the demon instead rips its tongue out. Wesley realizes that there is a word that can hurt Jasmine ‚Äì her name ‚Äì but the demon refuses to provide it and instead prepares to kill him, but Angel arrives in time to stop it, eventually managing to kill the demon. Lorne lectures the rest of the gang about hurtful words just before Gunn and Fred return with Matthew, who begins to laugh in Jasmine's voice, which turns the others on Gunn, Lorne and Fred and the three run for their lives. Before they can get far, though, they run into Connor and a group of military men to back him up. Wesley grabs the blue orb and explains the other dimension to Angel, while he ponders a way to make it work for them. Angel senses danger and Connor's presence. As Connor and Jasmine sense Angel in return, Angel signals the others to him and Wesley. Wesley figures blood magic is the answer to working the orb and uses a cut on his head as the source. A portal opens before them and while the others hold the door against Connor and the soldiers, Angel reluctantly takes the orb from Wesley and moves through the portal as the others finally release the door and prepare for battle, which is made more difficult because all the damage inflicted to the soldiers is healed by Jasmine instantly, making her followers practically immortal. Meanwhile, Angel finds himself in another dimension, surrounded by the Spider Demons.

Narasimha Nayaka later assumed the Vijayangara throne as Viranarasimha Raya bringing the Tuluva dynasty to prominence.

A Sanskrit epigraph on the eastern wall of Tirumala temple describes the genealogy of Krishnadevaraya. (Nayaka vamsam) The first ancestor of the Tuluva lineage to be mentioned is Timmabhupati and his wife Devaki. Timmabhupati is followed by his son Ishvara and consort Bukkamma and then a certain Narasa Bhupala who is none other than Tuluva Narasa Nayaka, the father of Emperor Krishnadevaraya. The powerful warlord Tuluva Narasa Nayaka is attributed with the conquest of the Gajapatis as well as certain Muslim rulers. Krishnadevaraya a Tulu speaker himself was noted to be linguistically neutral as he ruled a multilingual empire. He is known to have patronised poets and issued inscriptions in languages as varied as Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. However, he elevated Telugu as a royal language possibly because of the dominance of Telugu speaking chiefs and composed the epic poem Amuktamalyada in it. Tuluva rulers were staunch Vaishnavas and patronised Vaishnavism. Vyasatirtha, a Dvaita saint was the Kulaguru of Krishnadevaraya. The fall of the Tuluva dynasty led to the beginning of the disintegration of the Vijayanagar empire.

Plot synopsis The gang, minus Angel, are fighting Connor and his band of Jasminites in the mantis demons lair. Angel and the blue orb are in the demon world, where he's spotted a bridge to a city that holds a temple. Connor takes Wesley, Fred, Gunn, and Lorne captive and announces that he has to kill them. He says that the heroes are all alone and don't belong there. Gunn is happy not to belong, since everyone else is worshipping a false god. Before Connor can kill anyone, a guard speaks in Jasmine's voice and tells him to bring the others back to the Hyperion. As Angel climbs a cliff to the temple, Jasmine thanks some of the Jasminites for being loyal followers. Connor brings in the gang and Jasmine tells them that they've caused themselves pain by abandoning her. She asks where Angel is and Wesley taunts her, saying she should know since she's omniscient. Wesley asks about the mantis demon he met in the previous episode and she compares this past world to the humans‚Äô world. She says that when she came along, she ‚Äúkicked their evolution up a few ticks,‚Äù but it obviously didn't work out (also that she has a better chance in this world as it can be taken over quickly, as mass communications speed the spread of her message). She adds that Angel is wasting his time in the demon world, but Wesley says that if she really believed that, she would have killed them already. Jasmine tells a follower to tell the media that she'll be down soon; Wesley realizes that she's about to beam out her ‚Äúlove‚Äù to everyone. Fred tries to get Connor to stop her, telling him that Jasmine will enslave everyone, but he says that she'll bring everyone together. Fred says that they tried to show him what Jasmine really is; he tells her that he knows. He looks at Jasmine, and Connor sees what they have been seeing - her maggot-infested flesh. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù Connor says. Jasmine heads for her press interview, telling Connor that she won't be able to keep an eye on everyone while it's going on, so he'll have to do that for her. Connor asks what Angel has gone after and Jasmine replies, ‚ÄúThe unattainable.‚Äù Angel makes it to the temple, where he encounters the high priest, a short, bipedal being. The priest says that Angel has come this far only to die. He calls himself ‚Äúguardian of the word, caretaker of her most blessed temple‚Äù and Angel notes that there don't seem to be any other followers. The high priest is sure that Jasmine will return when she's done with the human world. Angel tries to get the priest to say Jasmine's real name, but the priest won't say it. Angel tries to intimidate him and the priest tells him, ‚ÄúYou can take away her power, but you‚Äôve already lost‚Ä¶everything.‚Äù Connor sticks Wesley and company in Angelus‚Äô cage in the basement and Wesley notes that the blood ritual didn't work on Connor because he's seen Jasmine's true face all along. Connor says that appearance doesn't matter to him, since he grew up in Quor-toth. Fred tries to get Connor to feel badly about Cordelia; Connor tells her that Cordelia has been moved. Wesley asks Connor what Jasmine eats, since the demon called her ‚Äúthe devourer.‚Äù Connor denies that he knows, but Wesley has already figured out that she eats her followers. Gunn worries that Cordelia has already been eaten. Angel demands that the priest give him Jasmine's true name, but the priest reveals that he can't; only the Keeper of the name has it. The priest is the guardian of the word, but the guardian of the word is not the keeper of the name. The word is the name, so the priest is the guardian of the Keeper - the keeper of the Keeper. The Keeper happens to be in the corner of the room, but the priest warns that he'll only speak Jasmine's real name with his last breath. Turns out he's right, since the Keeper's mouth is sewn shut. Connor heads to the banquet hall, where Jasmine is chatting with some of her followers who have no idea that they're about to be eaten. He pulls her aside and asks where she took Cordelia. Jasmine assures him that she didn't eat Cordelia; Connor tries to pretend that he didn't think that, but he's relieved. However, Jasmine won't tell him where she took Cordelia. Angel fights the Keeper as the priest taunts that his friends are probably dead by now, so there's no reason for Angel to try to fight for his world. The priest points out that his world doesn't care about him or want him, but Angel counters that it needs him. The priest says that he's actually fighting for Connor. He's going to lose his son. The press sets up for the conference, excited to share Jasmine with the rest of the world. Connor finds a couple of followers who moved Cordelia and demands to know where she is. Back at the temple, the priest wonders why Angel keeps trying to make things right with Connor. The priest points out that Connor was only brought about to bring Jasmine into the world. ‚ÄúHe will never love you,‚Äù the priest taunts. Angel says that it doesn't matter. He ducks a swing from the Keeper and lets the priest get knocked into a wall instead. In the basement of the Hyperion, Gunn is kicking the cage to try to break out of it, but he's mostly just succeeding at annoying Lorne. Fred notes that Connor left them unguarded. Wesley wonders why Jasmine had Cordelia moved, since the gang were the only people using her blood to turn others. He asks why Jasmine doesn't just kill Cordelia. Fred thinks that she can't and Wesley agrees that Jasmine is dependent on Cordelia - she can't hurt her without hurting herself. However, Cordelia might be able to hurt Jasmine. The gang decide that they should figure out how to wake up Cordelia, though first they'll have to find her. Connor finds a church (with a sign reading, ‚ÄúGod is nowhere. Jasmine is the way‚Äù) and tries to get past the police officers outside. Connor knocks the cops out and goes into the church, where he finds the comatose Cordelia. While Jasmine eats a large group of people and prepares for her press conference, Connor gives an impassioned speech to Cordelia about needing a reason to fight. He says that he doesn't have one now and wants to just stop. He admits that he never believed in Jasmine but went along because everyone else did and he wanted to belong. She's bringing peace to everyone and helping them get rid of their hatred, but it's not working for him. He says that his whole life has been built on lies, but at least this one was better than the other ones. In the lobby of the Hyperion, the media prepares for the press conference. Upstairs, one of the men Connor attacked for info on Cordelia alerts Jasmine. Jasmine heads to the press conference and starts talking about love, her image broadcast around the world. From the basement, Wesley and company hear the audience cheering and realize that Jasmine has started her world broadcast. They realize that they really are alone now. Back at the conference, Jasmine tells everyone that they don't have to give her anything, just show her love and maybe a large temple to stand as a beacon of hope. As Angel suddenly appears during her speech she orders her followers to attack him. They do but Angel cuts the sewn mouth of the Keeper and a long hissing sound is heard. With her name revealed, Jasmine glows and screams are heard as her face switches between her beauty and true form until it settles in the middle. Now with purple eyes and covered in boils Jasmine begs her followers to calm down as they erupt into chaos and despair. Convinced that something has gone terribly wrong, Gunn kicks open the door to the cage and they head upstairs. Out in the streets of L.A., everything is chaotic and Jasmine is upset that no one is worshipping her anymore. She contacts Connor through one of the cops at the church; Connor runs off to find her. Angel catches up to Jasmine and tells her that she lost. She replies, ‚ÄúThere are no absolutes. No right and wrong. Haven‚Äôt you learned anything working for the Powers? There are only choices. I offered paradise. You chose this!‚Äù He counters that he chose this world because he could; she had taken choice away from everyone. ‚ÄúAnd look what free will has gotten you,‚Äù Jasmine says. Angel responds that free will is what makes humans human; Jasmine points out that he's not human. ‚ÄúWorking on it,‚Äù he says. She heads off, wanting to be alone, and Angel says that he's not going to let her hurt anyone else. He lists the things she's done, pointing out that thousands of people are dead because of her. Jasmine asks how many people will die because Angel stopped world peace. She argues that she murdered thousands in order to save billions, but now the world has to fend for itself. ‚ÄúThe price was too high, Jasmine,‚Äù Angel says. ‚ÄúOur fate has to be our own, or we‚Äôre nothing.‚Äù He tells her that everyone has done horrible stuff, but they can make up for it; she doesn't have the world she wanted, but she can still try to make it better. Jasmine doesn't want to. She punches Angel off of a bridge and uses a car as a weapon. She tells him that she loved the world and sacrificed everything to be there. Angel counters that she did so in order to run the world. Jasmine says that the other Powers That Be didn't care the way she did and he knows it. The fighting continues and Jasmine reminds Angel of the prophecy that said he would play a role in the apocalypse. He never knew which side he would be on, but now he does - she's going to wipe out the human race with the last of her energy, and the blood will be on his hands. He tells her to go to hell; she replies, ‚ÄúYou first, baby,‚Äù then kisses him. Connor arrives, noting that once again Angel is involved with a girl who was Connor's first. Jasmine is thrilled that Connor is finally there. Wesley, Gunn and Fred search the hotel but find that everyone has taken off. Lorne notes that all of the TV stations are off the air, which means that something big happened. Wesley realizes that Angel came back and that they need to find him and Cordelia before Jasmine does. Before the gang can get out the door, they're met by something surprising. On the bridge, Jasmine tells Connor that Angel can't defeat both of them. ‚ÄúYou still believe in me, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúYou still love me?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Connor replies, before punching her through her maggoty head and killing her. Angel tries to comfort Connor, but he runs off. Angel heads back to the Hyperion, where he's shocked to see that the others are still alive. He tells them that Jasmine is dead and Connor killed her. As Wesley tries to interrupt and tell him something, Angel says that he's never seen Connor like that before. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs gonna do something,‚Äù Angel says. ‚ÄúYou know, he might--.‚Äù ‚ÄúEnd world peace?‚Äù a woman replies. Angel looks over to see Lilah in the office doorway. ‚ÄúWell, you already took care of that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúCongratulations.‚Äù Acting *Unlike other episodes, Stephanie Romanov's name appears in the opening guest star credits, despite her making a surprise appearance in the last few seconds of the episode.

Biography Wolski‚Äôs work is predominantly sculpture. Some of the projects he has undertaken in Mexico include; the sculpture \\"Infinity Chains\\" at the entrance of the Rufino Tamayo Museum, the series of works created for the Four Seasons Hotel in Punta Mita, and the Stelae arranged at √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (at the exit of Metro Zapata) in Mexico City. Wolski created this work in collaboration with street children from the area with the help of the French Ministry of External Relations. He has participated in many artist in residence programs, spent long periods of his creative time in Asia and India producing sculptures related to specific cultural and meta physical issues, made over seventy individual exhibitions throughout the world. Among them the Liu Haisu Museum in Shanghai, The Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art, The Lux Art Institute, Museo Carillo Gil, Museo Rufino Tamayo and Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico. Work The work of Wolski is characterized by a profound simplicity and consolidates a fusion between a remote past and the present. Wolski‚Äôs work approximates an ancestral sculptural tradition in which he synthesizes simple forms and roughly geometric shapes in order to represent specific ideas and concepts. Notwithstanding this tradition and Wolski's use of antique techniques to create his sculptures, the artist has generated a body of work with a contemporary vision. His terracotta sculptures are related by organic and natural forms that he synthesizes and abstracts from their origin in eternal forms, and at the same times imbues with a complex spiritual and reflective energy. Wolski's latest work conserves its abstract quality but subtly reveals the presence of the human form. By means of fragments of bodies and faces the artist invites the spectator to reflect on the smooth, white surfaces of his work, traditionally associated with the idea of peace and rest, but also suggesting distinct questions and meanings. Ongoing project of Infinity chains (2017), consist in a series of permanent sculptures in public spaces, among them in San Diego, California (USA), Park Grotowskiego in Warsaw, Poland and the Kimpton Epic Hotel in Miami, Florida (USA). \\"I am interested in creating bridges of communication permitting past and present appear in unity and with hope that the dialogue in time and space continues in order for new configurations to be found‚Äú.

Kosslyn is president and chief academic officer of Foundry College, an online two-year college designed to help working adults develop skills and knowledge that will not be automated in the foreseeable future. Prior to that, Kosslyn was founding dean and chief academic officer of the Minerva Schools at KGI (the Keck Graduate Institute). And before that, he was the John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James and Dean of Social Science at Harvard University.  Biography  Kosslyn was born in Southern California, and grew up in Pacific Palisades. As an undergraduate at UCLA he worked in the labs of Barbara Henker, who studied children with autism, and John P. SewardJohn P. Seward, Psychology: Los Angeles 1905-1985, Professor Emeritus. Accessed May 10, 2013 with whom he published his first publication, a study of learning in rats.Stephen Kosslyn (1980) Image and Mind. p. ix Kosslyn also spent considerable time talking to Edward Sadalla, who helped him learn how to structure an argument and identify when a creative idea was worth considering. He received a B.A. in psychology from UCLA in 1970. Kosslyn attended graduate school at Stanford University. Upon arriving, he discovered that his advisor was resigning so that he could work for the \\"ecology movement,\\" leaving Kosslyn adrift. He took courses his first quarter and did not engage in research. In his second quarter, he met his future advisor, Gordon H. Bower, who would have a huge influence on all aspects of his life.Mark A. Gluck, John R. Anderson, Stephen M. Kosslyn eds. (2007) A Festschrift for Gordon H. Bower. In graduate school Kosslyn was also fortunate to share an office with Susan Haviland, who was soon to marry Edward E. Smith. Smith loved to \\"talk shop\\" and Kosslyn learned an immense amount from him. Kosslyn received a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford in 1974. On leaving graduate school, Kosslyn first went to the Johns Hopkins University as an assistant professor, specializing in developmental psychology. At the beginning of his third year at Hopkins, Kosslyn received offers from MIT and Harvard, both at the associate professor level. He went to Harvard in large part because of an impassioned letter he received from a first-year graduate student, Steven Pinker, who was seeking an advisor. After four years at Harvard, Kosslyn obtained a Research Career Development Award and went to Brandeis University. One year later he went back to Hopkins as a visitor; while there he was granted tenure at Harvard. Kosslyn returned to Harvard in 1983, and after 10 years as \\"Head Tutor\\" (running the undergraduate program), became chair of the department, and then became Dean of Social Sciences. According to a September 2019 letter from Harvard's president to alumni, Kosslyn's lab was a beneficiary of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs philanthropy and he nominated Epstein as a visiting fellow in the department of psychology in 2005 (prior to Epstein's 2008 conviction). Kosslyn remained at Harvard until 2011, at which point he returned to Stanford, as director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. After two years, he had developed a strategic plan for how the center could operate within its means. He then accepted an offer to be the Founding Dean of the Minerva Project, based in San Francisco. The Minerva Project in turn partnered with Keck Graduate Institute, a member of the Claremont University consortium, and Kosslyn was chief academic officer at the Minerva Schools at KGI until early 2018. Foundry College was funded (by Learn Capital) in July of that year. Kosslyn has received numerous honors for his research. These include the National Academy of Sciences Initiatives in Research Award, the Prix Jean- Louis Signoret, three honorary doctorates (from the University of Caen, France; the University of Paris-Descartes, France; the University of Bern, Switzerland), a Guggenheim fellowship, and a Cattell Award. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society of Experimental Psychologists, and Academia Rodinensis pro Remediatione (Switzerland).  Work = Mental imagery  Kosslyn is known primarily for his research and theories on mental imagery. He championed the idea that mental images are distinct from language because they depict, not describe, information. His theory contends that, contrary to a commonly held assumption, imagery is not a single, unified phenomenon; rather, it consists of a collection of distinct functions, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of imagery. For example, he decomposes imagery into four sets of processes, responsible for generating the image (i.e., activating information stored in long-term memory and constructing a representation in short-term memory), inspecting the object in the image (e.g., by reinterpreting it), maintaining the image over time, and‚Äîif so desired‚Äîtransforming the image (e.g., by rotating it, adding or deleting parts, or changing the color). His research, which includes Positron Emission Tomography and fMRI-imaging and similar techniques, has located some of these functions in different neural networks in the brain, some of which are in different cerebral hemispheres. For example, his laboratory demonstrated that the left half of the brain is better than the right at encoding categories and generating mental images on the basis of categories; whereas the right half of the brain is better than the left at encoding specific examples or continuous distances, and at generating images with such characteristics.  Visual display design  Kosslyn also works on visual display design, showing how psychological principles can be used to produce displays that can be understood at a glance. Most recently, he has extended this work to show how psychological principles of perception, memory, and comprehension can be used to make and deliver effective PowerPoint presentations.  Individual differences  Kosslyn has also studied how people differ in their preferred types of information processing. Some of this work is based on neuroimaging, showing that the degree of activation in distinct parts of the brain predicts how well a person can perform particular tasks. Other work on this topic is based entirely on behavior. In this latter category, he and the late J. Richard Hackman used brain-based behavioral measures of individual differences to compose effective teams. In his 2013 book, Top Brain, Bottom Brain: Surprising Insights into How You Think, Kosslyn developed another approach to analyzing individual differences in cognition. He and his co-author, G. Wayne Miller, examined a newly conceived understanding of brain function, through top-brain and bottom-brain systems. According to Kosslyn: The top-brain system uses contextual and emotional information to plan, while the bottom-brain system thinks through the consequences of actions by using sensory information and memories from the brain. Kosslyn used this concept to define four cognitive modes, one of which represents a default mode for every individual: *Mover: both top and bottom systems are used to both plan and perceive the consequences of actions. *Perceiver: emphasis upon bottom-brain mode, whereby analysis and contextual understanding occur. *Stimulator: doesn't always think through consequences of elaborate plans. *Adaptor: doesn't overly gravitate toward either system and typically allows external factors to dictate a situation.  Science of learning  Most recently, Kosslyn has developed ways to apply the science of learning to teaching. This work began in earnest when he was at Minerva, and progressed significantly after he founded Foundry College. As part of this effort, he has distilled a set of principles from the empirical literature and developed new teaching methods.  Publications  Kosslyn has published over 300 scientific papers and written or co-authored 15 books and edited or co- edited 13 books, including:Details of books published List of publications * 1980.

Written and directed by Tim Minear, it was originally broadcast on May 7, 2003 on the WB network. In the Season Four finale, Connor ‚Äì having defeated Jasmine in the previous episode ‚Äì plans to blow himself up with a comatose Cordelia and other hostages, while an undead Lilah Morgan offers Angel Investigations control of the Wolfram & Hart L.A. branch. Plot While Wesley doubts that the Lilah before them is real, Angel (with his preternatural vampire senses) confirms that it's really her. Lilah also shows her beheading scar as she explains that the \\"Senior Partners\\", the ruling counsel of the demonic firm who are based in Hell, are offering them control as thanks for bringing back chaos and discord in Los Angeles in \\"Peace Out\\", which the group intended for the greater good. On the streets, while people raid stores, Connor spots a cop on top of a building, and catches him before he shoots himself with his own gun. The confused cop reveals that he has a family that are his \\"home.\\" Enraged by the thought that the man would leave his family, Connor attacks the cop. Wesley confides his doubts to Gunn, worrying his remaining feelings for Lilah cloud his perspective. Lorne returns without news on Connor or Cordy, but with the news that mayhem has been released on the streets in the aftermath. Angel warns the others against going to Wolfram & Hart, but as dawn approaches, the group finds themselves drawn to the offer of touring the Wolfram & Hart offices. One by one, they sneak off and get into the limo, surprised to see the others there. At the office, the group is approached by guides for their individual tours. Lorne is introduced to the manager of the entertainment department, who gives Lorne a glimpse of the talent managed by the firm. Wesley's guide, former Watcher Rutherford Sirk, impresses him with a vast collection of mystical references. Fred's guide is Knox, a smart young man who shows off the science department which she would run. Lilah shows Angel his new office, private elevator, and special windows that allow him to be in the sun without burning. She presents him with a file labeled \\"Sunnydale\\" and an amulet that Buffy needs for a battle, but he still acts uninterested. But when Lilah shows him a TV news report about Connor holding several people hostage, including the comatose Cordelia, in a sporting-goods store, Angel is finally ready to make a deal. Gunn is met by an attractive woman, and after mentioning he doesn't see how he would fit in at Wolfram & Hart, she takes him on a long elevator ride to the White Room. Alone in the room, Gunn is greeted by a black panther. Connor shouts at one of his captives, who struggles to hold his crying daughter because of a broken arm, then notices Angel has arrived. Meanwhile, Wesley knocks Sirk unconscious and makes his way to the records room, where Lilah finds him searching through the files. Wesley finds her contract with the law firm and burns it in an effort to free her, but the contract just reappears in the drawer. She says she already knew the price when she signed the contract but still appreciates the gesture. Angel cautiously approaches Connor as the teen warns the hostages are rigged with explosives. As Connor rises - revealing he and a still unconscious Cordelia are rigged similarly - he rages that he can't seem to feel anything and doesn't feel loved. Angel tries to promise a better future, but Connor, unconvinced, starts to push the detonation trigger. Angel punches him, yanks the trigger from the explosives around Connor, releases the hostages, and throws a knife into Connor's leg before he can injure Cordy. Promising to prove his love, Angel brings the knife down in a deadly blow, fulfilling the prophecy. Gunn joins the group in the lobby, proclaiming he is taking the job whether the others do or not. Wesley reveals that he's considering taking the job as well and then Angel says he already took the deal for them. Lilah confirms that Cordelia is getting the best of care and if a recovery is possible from her coma, they'll find the way. Completing their deal, Angel asks to see Connor and although Lilah argues that wasn't part of the deal, she agrees to let it happen. Lilah hands over the folder on Sunnydale along with the amulet and Angel leaves to see Connor, while Fred wonders aloud, \\"Who's Connor?\\" A limo takes Angel to a cabin in the woods where he spies through the window. Connor sits with his new family as they enjoy dinner and laugh about the promising college life before him. Angel walks away, pleased that his son has a new life filled with the love and happiness he lacked. Production details The scenes in the Wolfram & Hart offices were shot on location in the Thousand Oaks business complex. \\"They were kind enough to let us come in on a working day,\\" Tim Minear explains, and worked while the crew was filming. The \\"White Room\\" scene was accomplished via greenscreen and split screen. The endless room in the background was computer generated, with an actual leopard on the same stage as J. August Richards. While filming, the big cat \\"kind of got out of its chain,\\" says Minear. \\"J. thankfully didn't tell me until the shot was done and they had it back in its chain because I would have run screaming from the room like a girl.\\" Writing Tim Minear returned to Angel for this episode, after having not written for Angel since \\"Benediction\\" due to being busy with Firefly. He both wrote and directed the episode, which he says acted like a pilot in order to demonstrate to both the network and the television audience that the show could move in a new and interesting direction. Minear says, \\"It's setting up the new configuration for the show.\\" Writer David Fury explains, \\"You can't sell [the network] on a show they've already been producing so you have to kind of sell them on a new paradigm - something to enliven it. It may not be broke but they feel like a little change won't hurt.\\" Minear explains that he decided to open this episode with the assumption that Lilah's offer of taking over Wolfram & Hart happened off- screen during the commercial break. \\"I watched the clock for 40 or 50 seconds and have each actor just shift uncomfortably for about a minute. It got pretty hilarious after a while but I got all the pieces. And Stephanie just kicked it out. So once my name is clear of the screen,\\" Tim laughs, \\"someone will speak.\\" Wesley's guide around Wolfram & Hart asks him how he knew he was a Watcher. Wesley says, \\"there's something about Watchers and libraries,\\" referencing Rupert Giles (Buffy Summers' Watcher), who was employed as the Sunnydale High School librarian during the first three seasons of Buffy. This episode's tone mirrors that of the Season 4 finale of \\"Buffy.\\" Whedon comments about \\"Restless\\" that he didn't want to do the traditional big action, explosion, fighting finale that had been done in previous Buffy finales. For this episode, there is no significant fight sequence barring Angel and Connor toward the end of the episode. Both episodes also precede significant story changers; Buffy with new 14-year-old sister Dawn, and Angel now in charge of the L.A. branch of Wolfram and Hart.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, in which it is categorized as a national general aviation facility. The airport is owned by Holland, Zeeland, and Park Township, and operated by the West Michigan Airport Authority. The airport relies on user fees, federal and state grants and donations to operate. The reason is a provision in the city charter that prohibits tax dollars from being used for airport operations. However, a regional airport authority was authorized by area voters in November 2008. The West Michigan Airport Authority consists of representatives from Holland, Zeeland, and Park Township. In October 2011 the airport authority formally voted to change the airport's name from Tulip City Airport to West Michigan Regional Airport. Although many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned BIV by the FAA and no designation from the IATA (which assigned BIV to Bria Airport in Bria, Central African Republic).

It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 6,002 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m). Passenger loading is from the tarmac. Flights range from light sport aircraft to business jets; it has no regularly scheduled commercial flights. A full-service fixed-base operator (FBO) offers aircraft rental, flight instruction, charter flights, and aircraft maintenance. The airport has two public viewing areas. One is located near the southwest corner of the airport (accessed from 64th Street), and the other is located on the northeast corner of the airport (accessed from Lincoln Avenue). Both are paved and equipped with a picnic table. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, the airport had 52,520 aircraft operations, an average of 143 per day: 92% general aviation, 8% air taxi, and <1% military.

The Desert of Maine is not a true desert, as it receives an abundance of precipitation, and the surrounding vegetation is being allowed to encroach on the barren dunes. The Desert of Maine originated when the Tuttle family purchased and began farming the site beginning in 1797. Failure to rotate their potato crops, combined with land clearance and followed by overgrazing by sheep, led to soil erosion of the overlying silt exposing the sand. The initially-exposed small patch of sand gradually spread and overtook the entire farm. The Tuttles abandoned the land in 1919 when it was purchased for $300 ($7.50/acre) by Henry Goldrup, who converted it to a tourist attraction in 1925. The site is preserved as a natural curiosity, hosting a gift shop, a sand museum, and a farm museum.

Fletcher's Castoria, now known as Fletcher's Laxative, is an oral syrup containing a stimulant laxative and ingredients to soothe the stomach. It is a product of The Mentholatum Company, Inc. History On May 12, 1868, the United States Patent Office granted a patent to Dr. Samuel Pitcher (1824-1907) of Barnstable, Massachusetts, for a cathartic composed of senna, sodium bicarbonate, essence of wintergreen, dandelion, sugar and water. The remedy was initially sold under the name Pitcher's Castoria. Over time the product formula has changed. In 1871, The Centaur Company was formed by Charles Henry Fletcher to purchase the rights to and manufacture Pitcher's Castoria. It was renamed Fletcher's Castoria. Castoria was the subject of one of the most significant campaigns in early mass advertising. Castoria ads from the 1870s through 1920s are still visible today (or at least were between the 1970s and 2005) on the buildings of New York. See Forgotten-NY Ads and Frank Jump's for photos. At the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, there were Castoria ads on virtually every blank wall in sight. They are quite visible in images of the opening of the bridge.The Miami Herald, Nov 11, 1984) There were two \\"Fletcher's Castoria\\" B-17 Flying Fortress bombers during World War II, both part of the 100th Bomber Group. The first was lost, but the crew survived. The second survived the war. Its pilot was William H. Fletcher (not a descendant of Charles Henry Fletcher), hence its name. The Centaur Company was acquired by Sterling Drug during the 1920s.1/4 interest acquired Feb 9, 1923 (New York Times, Feb 9, 1923, Page 24, col 1). It later acquired the remaining interest. In 1984, Sterling Drug sold Fletcher's Castoria to The Mentholatum Company. In 1988 Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese company, purchased Mentholatum, which continues to operate as a Rohto subsidiary. Pharmacology *Active laxative ingredient: senna, 33.3 mg/ml *Other ingredients: citric acid, flavor, glycerin, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium benzoate, sucrose *Non-alcoholic *Non- prescription Acts within 6‚Äì12 hours. There are no known drug interactions, although as a stimulant laxative it may affect how long a medicine remains in the digestive tract. It is best not to take senna within 1 to 2 hours of taking other medicines. Availability Once known as Fletcher's Castoria, the product has since been renamed Fletcher's Laxative for Kids. Although marketed as a children's laxative in the US, it is effective for adults. Once a staple of drug stores, Castoria is becoming difficult to find.

It has a football and a basketball team. As the club did not have access to a suitable stadium, the football team was not able to play in an official league of the Cyprus Football Federation until 1968, when it joined the second division. The team was promoted to the first division after the 1969‚Äì70 season. After finishing second in the Cypriot First Division in 1971, it qualified for the UEFA Cup competition and was knocked out by AC Milan (lost 4‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì0) UEFA Cup 1971-72 under the Management of Noel McFarlane one of the Busby Babies of Manchester United. The club had a great following and was ranked within the strongest clubs in Cyprus before the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and occupation of the city of Morphou in 1974. Following the Turkish invasion, the team was displaced to the southern part of the island, where they currently play in exile. This upheaval brought a downturn in fortunes, and the team loitered in the lower divisions until the 1999‚Äì2000 season, when they again earned promotion to the top division. 2005 also brought success in the Cypriot Cup, in which they reached the final of the competition only to lose 2‚Äì0 to Omonia Nicosia and finishing in 4th place in the Cyprus first division. Digenis also has an active basketball team. They won the top division championship twice, in 1967 and 1968. last year the team won the 2nd division championship with an unbeaten record and were promoted back to division 1. The 2018‚Äì19 season, restored some of the club's former glory as it managed to win the 3rd division championship, returning to the 2nd tier of Cypriot football after 8 years, additionally the club did the double by winning the cup competition that the Cyprus Football federation runs for the lower divisions, closing this year with the \\"double\\". The club is also reinstating its historic basketball team which will be competing in the 2nd division for the 2019‚Äì2020 season. Digenis Akritas Morphou is this year once again running academies for all age groups, under its new basketball team name, Digenis Akritas Morphou-NBA. History Digenis Akritas Morphou is one of the oldest sport clubs in Cyprus. It was established on 23 April 1931 under the full name of \\"Mousikofilologikos ke Athlitikos Sillogos Digenis Akritas Morfou\\". The club started with 61 members but it soon reached 400. Its first executive panel comprised Stavros Geroudis, Christos Koumeras, Christos Sofroniou (Chamberlaine) Christakis Yiallourides, Pantelis Tsiapparis, Melis Hatzhiloizou, and Charalambos Odisseos. In addition to its athletic activities the club was very active in organizing cultural events in the area of Morphou. After its establishment Digenis sets up its first football team. Due to the absence of an appropriate stadium in Morphou the team could not enter the official league of the Cyprus Football Federation. In 1968, however, Digenis (along with the other football club from Morphou, AEM) is admitted in the Second Division. From its first year in the league Digenis shows its potentials by finishing in the second place (with Enosis Neon Paralimniou being the champions that year). The dream came true the following year. In the 1969‚Äì70 season Digenis became the champions and was promoted to the First Division. With Kostas Talianos being the manager, manages a great achievement from its first year in the First Division. Digenis rises up above the big teams of that time (APOEL, Omonoia, Anorthosis, AEL etc.) to finish up in the second place of the league (with Olympiakos being the champions). The greatest moment in the history of the club is written as Digenis participates in the UEFA cup and plays in \\"San Siro\\" stadium against the mighty A.C Milan (0‚Äì3). The golden era of Digenis soon came to an end. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus of 1974 and the subsequent occupation of the city of Morphou left Digenis with no home, no financial resources, and no stadium.

It was built in 1959 and is home to the Colgate University Raiders basketball and volleyball teams. It is named for Wesley M. Cotterell '19, a two-time letterwinner in basketball and school trustee. The basketball arena was built as the northern half of the William A. Reid Athletic Center, a twin barrel- vaulted complex which also houses Starr Rink. The complex is located on the western side of campus next to Andy Kerr Stadium and across Broad Street from Huntington Gymnasium, the school's former athletics facility. The hardwood was replaced in 2016 for the first time since the venue's opening. The gym has bleacher seating on three sides, with the main sides being the east and west sides and a much shorter section on the north side. The main entrance to the arena is on the south side, leading into the rest of the athletic center. Cotterell Court hosted the championship game of the 1995, 1996, 2019, and 2020 Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament and the 2004 Patriot League Women's Basketball Tournament. It has also hosted many notable concerts over the years, often as part of Colgate's homecoming or other university events. These include a November 4, 1977 Grateful Dead show which was recorded and released in its entirety on their 2014 live album Dave's Picks Volume 12.

A diocesan priest is a Catholic, Anglican or Eastern Orthodox priest who commits themself to a certain geographical area and is ordained into the service of the citizens of a diocese,\\"Diocesan Priests\\", Diocese of Helena a church administrative region. That includes serving the everyday needs of the people in parishes, but their activities are not limited to that of their parish. Catholic Church In the Catholic Church, the secular clergy are ordained ministers, such as deacons and priests, who do not belong to a religious institute. While regular clergy take religious vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and follow the rule of life of the institute to which they belong, secular clergy do not take vows, and they live in the world at large (secularity) rather than at a religious institute. Canon law makes specific demands on clergy, whether regular or secular, quite apart from the obligations consequent to religious vows. Thus in the Latin Church, among other regulations, clerics other than permanent deacons \\"are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy\\" and to carry out the Liturgy of the Hours daily. They are forbidden to \\"assume public offices which entail a participation in the exercise of civil power.\\" Depending on which conference of bishops they belong to, deacons may also be required to recite the Divine Office daily. All clerics, once ordained, are forbidden from marrying or remarrying. The teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and some scholars hold that a tradition of clerical continence existed in early Christianity, whereby married men who became priests were expected to abstain from sexual relations with their wives.Roman Cholij, Priestly Celibacy in Patristics and in the History of the Church.Cesare Bonivento, Priestly Celibacy ‚Äî Ecclesiastical Institution or Apostolic Tradition? ; Thomas McGovern,Priestly Celibacy Today; Alfons Stickler, The Case for Clerical Celibacy: Its Historical Development and Theological Foundations; Anthony Zimmerman, Celibacy Dates Back to the Apostles The Council of Elvira, held in 306, before Constantine had legitimized Christianity, made it an explicit law that bishops and other clergy should not have sexual relations with their wives. Despite consistently upholding the doctrine of clerical celibacy, over the following centuries the Church experienced many difficulties in enforcing it, particularly in rural areas of Europe. Finally, in the 12th century the Western Church declared that Holy Orders were not merely a prohibitive but a diriment canonical impediment to marriage, making marriage by priests invalid and not merely forbidden.New Catholic Encyclopedia, Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. 1967, p366 The secular clergy, in which the hierarchy essentially resides, takes precedence over the regular clergy of equal rank. The episcopal office was the primary source of authority in the Church, and the secular clergy arose to assist the bishop. Only bishops can ordain Catholic clergy.Catholic Encyclopedia: Secular Clergy Catholic Online One of the roots of the Philippine Revolution was the agitation of native secular priests for parish assignments. Priests of the powerful religious orders were given preferential treatment in these assignments and were usually Spaniards who trained in European chapters. The agitation led to the execution of the \\"Gomburza filibusteros\\". St. Thomas Becket is a patron saint of secular clergy. St. John Vianney is patron saint of parish priests. St. Stephen is patron saint of deacons. Preparation Preparation for Catholic priesthood generally requires eight years of study beyond high school, usually including a college degree followed by four or more years of theology study at a seminary.\\"Occupational Outlook Handbook\\", U.S. Department of Labor At the time of their ordination as deacons (usually about a year before their ordination as priests) they promise respect and obedience to the diocesan bishop and his successors. They also promise to live in chastity, and according to the status of clergy (which includes a comparatively simple life). Diocesan priests do make vows, but they do not promise poverty, so they may own their own property, such as cars, and handle their own financial affairs.Unlike members of a religious order, diocesan priests pay taxes, and may buy their own furniture, invest in stocks, and inherit money from others. They also receive a low annual salary from their diocese (on top of room and board and other benefits) and are generally expected to help manage parish finances. \\"What is the difference between a diocesan priest and a priest who is a member of a religious order?\\", St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Liturgical responsibilities In his apostolic letter Dies Domini, Pope John Paul II wrote: \\"Among the many activities of a parish, none is as vital or as community-forming as the Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist\\".Pope John Paul II. Dies Domini, Apostolic Letter of the Holy Father John Paul II to the Bishops, Clergy and Faithful of the Catholic Church on Keeping the Lord's Day Holy, (Vatican, 31 May 1998) A diocesan priest spends much of his time preparing for and celebrating the Sacraments (Eucharist, Reconciliation, Baptism, Marriage, Anointing of the Sick, Confirmation). In the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium, the Second Vatican Council teaches that the priest acting in persona Christi celebrates the Sacrifice of the Mass and administers the Sacraments. \\"Christ is also present through preaching and the guidance of the faithful, tasks to which the priest is personally called.\\"\\"The Priest, Pastor and Leader of the Parish Community\\", Address of Pope John Paul II to the Plenary Session of the Congregation for the Clergy, 23 November 2001 There are many parishioners whom he visits, those who are ill, those who are dying, and those who are unable to travel outside their homes. Sometimes, he is directly involved in the catechetical work of the parish and teaches catechism classes. He works with parish and finance councils that assist him in overseeing the welfare of the parish.\\"Vocations\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina Diocesan priests may serve in myriad different capacities, these services include, but are not limited to, campus ministry, teaching, and chaplain work for hospitals or prisons. Orthodox Church In the Orthodox Church, the term \\"secular clergy\\" refers to married priests and deacons, as opposed to monastic clergy (hieromonks and hierodeacons). The secular clergy are sometimes referred to as \\"white clergy\\", black being the customary colour worn by monks. Traditionally, parish priests are expected to be secular clergy rather than monastics, as the support of a wife is considered necessary for a priest living \\"in the world\\".

The Natchez were matrilineal, and while the paramount chief was a man, this title was inherited through his mother, the Female Sun. Tattooed Arm was the mother of the Great Sun (in office from 1728), and the daughter of the previous female sun, \\"White Woman\\" (died 1704). She was the sister of war chief Tattooed Serpent (d. 1725) and the Great Sun (d. 1728). Like her brothers, she was friendly to the French, and had attempted to warn them of plans by her tribe to attack them by surprise. In early 1731 the French besieged a Natchez fort in the Tensas watershed. Several hundred Natchez, mainly women and children, surrendered to the French under a false offer of amnesty. Tattooed Arm may have surrendered then, or may have stayed in the fort until escaping with almost all of the remaining defenders during a rainstorm. In any case, Tattooed Arm was later interviewed by Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz in New Orleans. Tattooed Arm may have been among the 291 Natchez people who were sent to the French colony of Saint-Domingue in May 1731, where they were sold as slaves. Her original Natchez name is unknown.

Activities in the field range from small scale youth groups attached to parishes or Catholic schools, to large international gatherings, such as World Youth Day. It is a field which has evolved much over recent decades, especially in comparison to more formal methods of education or catechesis within the church. Nearly all dioceses and a great deal of parishes have some form of youth provision running, although a great deal of areas particularly in the developed world are finding youth work both more difficult and rare as the numbers of young people regularly practicing the Catholic faith continue to decline. In contrast, though, the new and exciting developments of recent decades and particularly the influence of the new movements within the Church are ensuring that youth work continues to be an active and fruitful field. Forms of organization=Catholic youth organizations In many countries local groups of Catholic youth have founded diocesan or national umbrella organizations to foster the exchange between young people and to organize joint activities, like camps, seminars or pilgrimages. Typical for the youth work of Catholic youth organizations is that their work is not determined by priests or other professionals but that they are self-organized and -determined by young volunteers. However, many Catholic youth organizations also elect a theologically qualified person as \\"preses\\". Many Catholic youth organizations in Europe are rooted in the movement of the Catholic Action. Catholic youth work organized by youth workers, priests or orders As with youth work in many Christian communities, Catholic youth ministry is often conducted by a combination of local priest pastors and lay volunteers. Some parishes, particularly in more affluent parts of the world, may well employee lay professionals on a full-time basis as well. In some areas of the Church, such as North America, there will be full-time youth officers at the deanery or diocese level. Some of the time these will be lay professionals and some of the time they will be priests or members of religious congregations. The advantages to employing priests in these roles include the reduced salary costs, their ability to minister the sacraments and their guaranteed theological knowledge. The shortage of priests in many areas, however, mean that dioceses are increasingly turning to religious or lay people, who as well as being a little more flexible, will also often be able to break down the barrier that is often perceived between priests and church congregations (e.g. the Salesians of Don Bosco). School chaplaincy This is particularly popular in the UK and Australia and other countries where Catholic Schools are common, but struggles to receive recognition in many areas where the role of full-time lay people within the Catholic Church is still not properly respected or provided for. Chaplaincy involves a dedicated youth worker acting as a lay chaplain to introduce an element of youth work provision into a school so as to back up the school's Catholic ethos and complement the mainstream educational work of the school. In recent and not-so recent times, many movements have emerged supporting or complementing chaplaincies, including Newman Centers in several countries, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students in the United States, and Catholic Christian Outreach in Canada. Catholic residential youth work This involves the focused work done normally for just a few days where a course or retreat is run for a group of young people in a residential retreat center. Normally this work is very transitory work and residential centers can expect to work, in some cases, with thousands of young people a year. Young people are normally sent on retreat by a school or parish and thus the work is normally secondary rather than primary input. Catholic residential youth work is particularly popular in the UK, where an established network of thirteen centers exists, including places like Castlerigg Manor, SPEC Centre, Briars, Soli House, St Vincents Centre and Walsingham House. New movements Movements such as Youth 2000 and various organizations connected to the Charismatic Renewal, will normally run either local groups not connected to parishes or schools, or larger annual events. Normally these groups will aim to enforce a certain part of faith in young people or a certain tradition or style. One of these new movements is LIFE TEEN, \\"leading teens closer to Christ\\"; a parish-based program centered on the Eucharist, Contemporary Christian Music, relational ministry and catechesis. Another movement is ECYD which focuses on youth service projects and personal prayer through a network of gender-specific clubs. Jesus Youth is a 28-year-old catholic youth movement, which begin in India and now present many countries around the world. Mission Teams Mission teams are groups of youth workers who spend a period of time (usually around a week) in schools or parishes running a program, normally fairly kerygmatic in nature, with a group of young people. The transient nature of these programs makes this field somewhat similar to residential work, however the increased costs of maintaining mission teams combined with the difficulties in recruitment mean that they are normally not as widespread. Aims=Training and qualification The issue of training and qualifications for Catholic youth workers is normally a sticky question in many parts of the world. The advantages and generosity of lay volunteers, for instance, is often augmented in the minds of some people by their lack of catechetical and theological knowledge in comparison especially to priests and also by their lack of training in informal education in comparison to secular youth workers. Many systems to educate and train youth workers have appeared and youth workers are able to participate in schemes for catechists (such as the CCRS in the UK). Also many youth workers in the Church are increasingly opting for secular training. On the whole though, the Church still lacks a formal and widely recognized system of training and achievement for youth workers. Although a Foundation Degree in Youth Work/ Youth Ministry (with professional JNC recognition) started in September 2007 at Newman University, Birmingham. This will be the first of many across the UK. Spiritual activitiesEmpowerment and personal developmentSocial activities=Different levels There are a variety of different activities which are classed as Catholic youth work. They include the following: Parish based youth work A great deal of parishes have groups which cater to young people in some way or other. These may be designated 'youth groups' of 'youth clubs' or may be groups for particular young people within the parish such as altar servers or those about to receive confirmation, for example. Whether or not all groups for, or including, young people in parishes can be considered among the realm of youth work is debatable as many will be catechetical or organised around particular duties rather than holding to the established methodology of informal education. Both Catholic youth organizations and national and diocesan youth ministry departments often offer resources, ideas and programmes supporting parishes to plan and run own local youth ministry activities. Area (diocesan/deanary) youth work Many dioceses or deaneries will employ a coordinator to look after youth initiatives for a group of Churches. This is especially important in areas where not every parish can afford a full-time worker. Typically these coordinators, who may be a priest, a religious brother or sister will be responsible for training local volunteers and assisting them in setting up local youth groups, organizing large events or pilgrimages such as to World Youth Day, and building links between parishes and other local Catholic bodies such as schools.  International Catholic youth work International Catholic youth organizations= There are also international networks and umbrella organizations of Catholic youth organizations (one of the biggest e.g. is the International Federation of Catholic Parochial Youth MovementsPontifical Council for the Laity: Fimcap). =World Youth Day= A global event held every 2‚Äì3 years and attended by the Pope. The event in the Philippines in 1995 was attended by over 5 million people, making it the largest Christian gathering ever. The last event was in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil in 2013; ; Krakow, Poland in 2016 was visited by current pope. 2.1 million people turned up to World Youth Day 2000 in Rome Ecumenical cooperations In some countries there is traditionally a good cooperation between youth organizations of different Christian denominations and churches. In Germany e.g. the Catholic youth umbrella BDKJ and the Protestant youth umbrella aej founded together the fairtrade initiative GEPA.www.weltundhandel.de There are also cooperations at international level. E.g. the International Federation of Catholic Parochial Youth Movements (Fimcap) has got a partnership with the European Fellowship.Homepage of the European Fellowship: Members and partners Recent challenges=Church and society In many countries not the some doctrines of the Catholic church are perceived by the public opinion as outdated or out of touch with reality. Often this perception is not only shared by the general public opinion but also by Catholic lays and especially young people.

It has a population of around 42,000 inhabitants. It is the second-most important railway junction in the country, situated on the line between Cape Town and Kimberley. The junction was of particular strategic importance to the British during the Second Boer War. De Aar is also a primary commercial distribution centre for a large area of the central Great Karoo. Major production activities of the area include wool production and livestock farming. The area is also popular for hunting, although the region is rather arid. De Aar is also affectionately known as \\"Die SES\\" deriving its nickname from the six farms that have surrounded De Aar since the 1900.  History  De Aar was originally established on the Farm \\"De Aar.\\" The name means \\"the artery,\\" a reference to its underground water supply. The Cape Government Railways were founded in 1872, and the route that the government chose for the line to connect the Kimberley diamond fields to Cape Town on the coast, ran directly through De Aar. Because of its central location, the government also selected the location for a junction between this first railway line, and the other Cape railway networks further east, in 1881.Burman, Jose (1984). Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town. Human & Rousseau, p.62. In 1899 two brothers who ran a trading store and hotel at the junction, Isaac and Wulf Friedlander, purchased the farm of De Aar. Following the Anglo Boer War, the Friedlander brothers surveyed the land for the establishment of a town. The municipality was created a year later and the towns first mayor, Dr Harry Baker, was elected in 1907.

Headquartered in Thief River Falls in the U.S. state of Minnesota, the company is the fourth largest electronic component distributor in North America and the fifth largest electronic component distributor in the world. Founded in 1972 by Ronald Stordahl, its name is a reference to the \\"Digi-Keyer Kit\\", a digital electronic keyer kit that he developed and marketed to amateur radio enthusiasts. He continues to privately own the company.  History  After earning a in electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota, Ronald Stordahl returned to his hometown of Thief River Falls, Minnesota where he took up ham radio in the early 1970s. Stordahl created a kit of electronic parts to improve transmission of Morse code over his radio. He soon began selling kits to other ham operators, and eventually branched off into the distribution of other electronic components, allowing customers to purchase parts in any quantity, no matter how small. The company quickly grew and by 1984 it was located in a one million square foot facility next door to Arctic Cat, a snowmobile manufacturer. Mark Larson, who joined Digi-Key in 1976 as its general manager, became president in 1985. He has led the company from its initial focus on the hobbyist market to the expanded market it serves today. In 2015 Larson stepped down from his role within the company and transitioned to a board position. On June 1, 2015 Dave Doherty, who served as the Executive Vice President of Operations at Digi-Key, transitioned to Larson's position as President and Chief Operating Officer.

E. Ellis or Tom Ellis, was a Welsh politician who was the leader of Cymru Fydd, a movement aimed at gaining home rule for Wales. Ellis was, for a time, the most prominent of a generation of Liberal politicians who emerged in Wales after 1886, who placed greater emphasis than the previous generation to a Welsh dimension to their politics. His early death in 1899 aged 40 added to the aura that surrounded his name. Early life T. E. Ellis was born at Cefnddwysarn near Bala, the son of a tenant farmer, and was brought up among folk memories of the political evictions in Merioneth following the 1859 and 1868 General Elections. Having attended Bala Grammar School, where his fellow pupils included Owen Morgan Edwards, he progressed to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth (then Aberystwyth college) from 1875 to 1879, then went to New College, Oxford, graduating in history in 1884. On leaving Oxford, Ellis briefly went into journalism and also acted as a private tutor to the son of a South Wales shipping magnate. He then became private secretary to Liberal Party MP, John Brunner. This took him to London and drew him closer to political life. Parliamentary career In 1886, he was selected as the Liberal Party candidate for the Merionethshire constituency, and was elected the same year at the general election. Ellis quickly became prominent as a spokesman for Welsh concerns, and in a speech in Bala in 1890 called for a legislative assembly for Wales. He became the leader of the Cymru Fydd movement which sought to gain home rule for Wales, cooperating closely with David Lloyd George, and also played a prominent part in the campaign for Welsh disestablishment. In 1892 when Gladstone formed a new administration, Ellis accepted the post of the second whip, which meant that he had to withdraw from the movement, whose leadership was taken over by Lloyd George and Herbert Lewis (MP for Flint Boroughs). In 1894 Ellis was appointed Chief Whip. Ellis also published the first volume of the collected works of the 17th century Welsh Puritan writer Morgan Llwyd, a work completed after his death by his brother in law, J. H. Davies. He died in Cannes in February 1899. His son, the academic Thomas Iorwerth Ellis, wrote a two-volume biography of him, the volumes being published in 1944 and 1948 respectively. Ellis was a proponent of Pan-Celticism, stating \\"We must work for bringing together Celtic reformers and Celtic peoples. The interests of Irishmen, Welshmen and [Scottish] Crofters are almost identical. Their past history is very similar, their present oppressors are the same and their immediate wants are the same.De Barra (2018), page 78 Personal life Ellis married Annie Jane, daughter of Robert J. Davies and sister of John Humphreys Davies. They had one son, his biographer Thomas Iorwerth Ellis, who was born posthumously in December 1899. Assessment Tom Ellis, according to Kenneth O Morgan, was a 'nationalist of a complex kind'. On the one hand, he was deeply rooted in the Methodist tradition, with a love of Welsh poetry and literature. He regarded himself as a follower of Mazzini, and his support for Cymru Fydd made him a prominent advocate of Home Rule. In contrast, he became an admirer of Cecil Rhodes, whom he had met in Cape Colony and his acceptance of government office attracted criticism from some of his erstwhile supporters.

McClinton (born 1961) is a Kansas politician, originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and former mayor of Topeka, Kansas who served only a portion of his term from January 2004 to April 2005. He was appointed by the city council to replace Butch Felker, who resigned amid a campaign finance scandal (Duane Pomeroy served as acting mayor from November to December 2003). McClinton had previously served on the city council from 1991 to 1993 and from 1997 to 2001. He is a member of the Democratic Party. James McClinton was born in Milwaukee, then moved to Helena, Arkansas in early childhood, and then finally to Topeka. After graduating from Washburn Rural High School, he attended Washburn University, where he received a minor degree in psychology, an associate degree in mental health and a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He received his master's degree in public administration from the University of Kansas with honors. McClinton's short stint as mayor is significant for its firsts and lasts. He was the first African-American mayor of Topeka and the first mayor to be appointed by the city council (he was chosen from a field of 40 candidates by the city council). However, he was also the last mayor to serve the city with full authority as the populace subsequently voted in a referendum for council-manager form of government in 2004 which stripped the mayor position of most of his or her powers. Instead, a new city manager and the city council would hold non-ceremonial power (the decision to include this initiative on the 2004 ballot was made prior to the appointment of McClinton, possibly in reaction to Felker's alleged abuses). In 2004, McClinton decided against running for a full term as a \\"ceremonial\\" mayor. During his time as mayor, Topeka celebrated its 150th anniversary. The city was also honored by a visit from George W. Bush, Stephen Breyer and John Kerry, celebrating the anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision which ended racial segregation in schools and the renovated Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. Mayor McClinton created a large diverse group of community leaders and charged them to create a Riverfront Development Plan. He submitted that plan to the city council prior to leaving office. The Riverfront Plan was approved by the council, received approval by the Kansas Legislature, and signed into law by former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius. Mayor McClinton created new community development strategies to revitalize the inner city, his new program received a Regional Award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. McClinton, along with other national mayors collaborated with the White House to eradicate homelessness in 10 years. Through mayor McClinton's leadership, the City of Topeka was recognized with several \\"Best Practices\\" citations. Mayor McClinton created a partnership with the University of Kansas to forgive tuition for students who returned to the community and committed to community service. After leaving office in 2005, Mayor McClinton worked with a local developer in several states revitalizing inner cities. In 2007, Mayor McClinton moved to the Dallas area. McClinton is Housing Resources Director at Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance and Operations Manager at Legacy Counseling Center in Dallas. He is also CEO of McClinton Consulting. McClinton is the father of two daughters, Jameika and Tawana. Career At the age of 19, he began a long career of supervisory and management in both public agencies and in the private sector. His career in management and administration includes mental health management, correctional hospital administration, state nursing board management, correctional management, both adult and juvenile justice administration, human resource and project management. McClinton has in excess of twenty years of administrative and managerial experience managing people, projects, resources and a multitude of operational budgets. As of February 23, 2019, McClinton has never tried a soft pretzel.

He is currently Professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  Life  Fred D'Aguiar was born in London, England, in 1960 to Guyanese parents, Malcolm Frederick D'Aguiar and Kathleen Agatha Messiah. In 1962 he was taken to Guyana, living there with his grandmother until 1972, when he returned to England at the age of 12. D'Aguiar trained as a psychiatric nurse before reading African and Caribbean Studies at the University of Kent, Canterbury, graduating in 1985. On graduating he applied for a PhD on the Guyanese author Wilson Harris at the University of Warwick, but ‚Äì after winning two writers-in-residency positions, at Birmingham University and the University of Cambridge (where he was the Judith E. Wilson Fellow from 1989 to 1990) ‚Äì his PhD studies \\"recededed from [his] mind\\" and he began to focus all of his energies on creative writing. In 1994, D'Aguiar moved to the United States to take up a Visiting Writer position at Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts (1992‚Äì94). Since then, he has taught at Bates College, Lewiston, Maine (Assistant Professor, 1994‚Äì95) and the University of Miami where he held the position of Professor of English and Creative Writing. In 2003 he took up the position of Professor of English and Co-Director of the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing at Virginia Tech. In the fall of 2015, he became a Professor of English and Director of Creative Writing at UCLA, which post ended in 2019.  Poetry, novels and plays = Poetry  D'Aguiar's first collection of poetry, Mama Dot (1985), was published to much acclaim. It centres on an \\"archetypal\\" grandmother figure, Mama Dot, and was notable for its fusion of standard English and Nation language. Along with his 1989 collection Airy Hall (named after the village in Guyana where D'Aguiar spent his childhood), Mama Dot won the Guyana Poetry Prize. Where D'Aguiar's first two poetry collections were set in Guyana, his third ‚Äì British Subjects (1989) ‚Äì explores the experiences of peoples of the West Indian diaspora in London. London was also the focus of another long poem, Sweet Thames, which was broadcast as part of the BBC \\"Worlds on Film\\" series on 3 July 1992 and won the Commission for Racial Equality Race in the Media Award. After turning to writing novels rather than poetry for a period of time, D'Aguiar returned to the poetic mode in 1998, publishing Bill of Rights (1998): a long narrative poem about the Jonestown massacre in Guyana in 1979, which is told in Guyanese versions of English, fusing patois, Creole and Nation Language with the standard vernacular. It was shortlisted for the 1998 T. S. Eliot Prize. Bill of Rights was followed by another narrative poem, Bloodlines (2000), which tells the story of a black slave and her white lover. His 2009 collection of poetry, Continental Shelf, centres on a response to the Virginia Tech Massacre in which 32 people were killed by a student in 2007. It was a finalist for the 2009 T. S. Eliot Prize.  Novels  D'Aguiar's first novel, The Longest Memory (1994), tells the story of Whitechapel, a slave on an eighteenth- century Virginia plantation. The book won both the David Higham Prize for Fiction and the Whitbread First Novel Award. It was adapted for television and televised by Channel 4 in the UK. Returning to themes he had earlier developed in British Subjects, D'Aguiar's 1996 novel, Dear Future, explores the history of the West Indian diaspora through a fictional account of the lives of one extended family. His third novel, Feeding the Ghosts (1997), was inspired by a visit D'Aguiar made to the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and is based on the true story of the Zong massacre in which 132 slaves were thrown from a slave ship into the Atlantic for insurance purposes. According to historical accounts, one slave survived and climbed back onto the ship; and in D'Aguiar's narrative this slave ‚Äì about whom there is next to no historical information ‚Äì is developed as the fictional character Mintah. His fourth novel, Bethany Bettany (2003), centres on a five-year-old Guyanese girl, Bethany, whose suffering has been read by some as symbolising that of a nation (Guyana) seeking to make itself whole again. His 2014 novel Children of Paradise is a fictional reimagining of the Jonestown massacre told through the perspective of a mother and child living at the commune.{{cite weburl=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/books/review/children-of-paradise- by-fred-daguiar.htmltitle=Devil's Deedsnewspaper=The New York Timesfirst=Julia last=Scheeresdate=7 March 2014  Plays  D'Aguiar's plays include High Life, first produced at the Albany Empire in London in 1987, and A Jamaican Airman Foresees His Death, performed at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in 1991.

He was Medical Director of the National Health Service in England from 2007 and National Medical Director of the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS England) from 2013 until his retirement early in 2018. He is Chair of Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Early life Keogh was born on 24 November 1954 in Harare, Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), the son of Gerald and Marjorie Beatrice Keogh (n√©e Craig). His father held a senior position in the Civil service, having been Chief Inspector of Public Services for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland while his mother was a Hansard reporter in parliament. He attended the private Catholic boys school St George's College, Harare. Clinical medical career (1980-2007) Prior to becoming full-time NHS Medical Director in November 2007, Keogh practised as a cardiac surgeon with a special interest in reconstructive mitral valve surgery. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree and MB BS degree from Charing Cross Hospital Medical School part of the University of London in 1977 and 1980 respectively. He was a demonstrator in anatomy at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School before training in general surgery in London and Sheffield and gaining his FRCS in 1985. He then opted for a career in cardiac surgery, returning to the Hammersmith Hospital as a registrar. During this time he spent a year as a laboratory-based British Heart Foundation Junior Research Fellow which led to the award of the MD higher degree in 1989 for research into laser coronary angioplasty. He was appointed as senior registrar on the West London training rotation where he spent time at St George's Hospital and the Harefield Hospital training in cardiac, pulmonary and oesophageal surgery. He was subsequently appointed a university Senior Lecturer in cardiothoracic surgery at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and honorary consultant surgeon at the Hammersmith Hospital between 1991‚Äì1995. He then took an NHS consultant position in Birmingham where he became the clinical service lead for cardiothoracic surgery and Associate Medical Director for Clinical Governance at University Hospital Birmingham before being appointed Professor of cardiac surgery at University College London and Director of Surgery at The Heart Hospital in 2004. In 1994 he established the National Adult Cardiac Surgical Database and as a consequence, he is perhaps best known for his work promoting the measurement, analysis and public disclosure of clinical outcomes. But he has also published numerous peer-reviewed scientific articles on coronary artery vasomotor tone, the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on gut blood flow and function, myocardial protection during surgery, surgery for patients with poor left ventricular function and the effects of social deprivation on cardiac surgical outcomes. He has co-authored a book on the Evidence for Cardiothoracic Surgery (2005) and another on Normal Surface Anatomy (1984). While at UCL he brought the national registries on adult and pediatric cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty and pacemakers into a new National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research. His work with Paolo Camici using PET scannining to identify hibernating myocardium in people with heart failure in the mid 1990s helped transform surgery for heart failure worldwide.http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/93/4/737 He performed the first successful transabdominal, off pump gastroepiploic artery bypass graft to the heart in the UK and was among the first to adopt minimally invasive, direct coronary artery bypass surgery, thoracoscopic mitral valve surgery and warm blood cardioplegia for myocardial protection. Keogh has been active on many medical and professional committees. He has been secretary and president of the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland, Secretary General of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic SurgeryEuropean Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery website and president of the Cardiothoracic Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and served on the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the board of directors of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons in the US.Society of Thoracic Surgeons website He is an elected member of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery and a Fellow of the European Society of Cardiology. In addition, he has served as a member of the Civil Aviation Authority Medical Advisory Panel, the advisory board for the National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Outcome and Deathshttp://www.ncepod.org.uk/ and the Board of the Picker Institute.http://www.pickereurope.org/about-us/ He has sat on the editorial boards of Heart and the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. He has been a British Heart Foundation junior research fellow, senior lecturer, member of the Research Grants Committee and Council member. Prior to becoming Medical Director of the National Health Service he served on the National Coronary Heart Disease Taskforce, the NHS Standing Medical Advisory Committee, and was chairman of the NHS Information Taskforce on Clinical Outcomes for the Department of Health. He has also served as Commissioner on the Commission for Health Improvement and the Healthcare Commission, where he chaired the Clinical Strategy Group. Given his long-standing interest in measuring and publishing clinical outcomes as a driver for improving quality, in 2007 he was asked by Patricia Hewitt, then Secretary of State for Health, to assist Tim Kelsey in establishing a new health website, \\"NHS Choices\\". Keogh's role was to ensure credible clinical content. He chaired the clinical advisory group and subsequently went on to chair the NHS Choices Board. NHS Medical Director (2007‚Äì13) As Medical Director of the NHS (2007‚Äì13) he was a Director General in the Department of Health where he led the Medical Directorate which had oversight for clinical policy and strategy in the NHS. This included the work of the National Clinical Directors and their associated strategies such as those for coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, renal disease, liver disease, trauma, and transplantation. He established the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP)a joint venture between the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the Royal College of Nursing to develop and run the national clinical audits. Keogh's role also included oversight of the medicines supply chain into the UK, policy relating to the pharmaceutical industry, drug pricing, prescriptions and the role of pharmacy in England and sponsorship of the work programmes of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the NHS regulator the Healthcare Commission and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), including the National Confidential Enquiries and the National Research Ethics Service. Through sponsorship of Medical Education England (MEE) a product of the 2008 Darzi review of the NHS, he had oversight of postgraduate education of doctors, dentists, pharmacists and clinical scientists, but this was superseded by Health Education England (HEE) in 2012 to ensure a balanced and integrated approach to all healthcare professionals. He opposed the establishment of the Cancer Drugs Fund which he believed would undermine NICE and the quest for an evidence based NHS. He was subsequently responsible for drawing together NICE, cancer charities and the pharmaceutical industry to lay the groundwork for a revised evidence driven CDF which went live under NICE in 2017.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nhs-chief-calls- for-greater-scrutiny-of-cancer-drugs-7dmm9qtlkxp Keogh's team was responsible for implementing the majority of the recommendations from Lord Darzi's review of the NHS \\"High Quality Care for All\\" published in 2008. This review has been credited with refocusing the NHS on quality of care. Keogh's team also developed the Quality Framework for the NHS (based on the work of Sheila Leatherman) and included in Darzi's review. The principles were simple: Define what is meant by quality, measure it, publish it for everyone to see, reward those who do well, regulate for minimum standards, promote and develop leadership for quality within the NHS and promote research and innovation within the NHS, by drawing on and linking with the best British universities and biotechnology companies in to form academic science networks. The resultant definition of healthcare quality based on the provision of effective care, safe care and a positive experience became widely accepted and was subsequently enshrined in the Health and Social Care Act (2012). In 2011, after the collapse of the British Association of Medical Managers, he established the Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management under the jurisdiction of the Medical Royal Colleges in order to ensure access to all doctors, not just those in leadership or management positions. He subsequently asked the Faculty to administer the National Medical Director's Clinical Fellows Scheme which had grown out of the Clinical Advisor Scheme in the Department of Health, thereby ensuring a long-term home for the programme. NHS England (2013-18) Following the election of a coalition Government in 2010, he was tasked with making clinical outcomes the currency of NHS business. In response, his team developed the NHS Outcomes Frameworkhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-outcomes- framework-2013-to-2014 which was based on the observation that all healthcare systems should do five things well: Firstly, the NHS should stop you dying prematurely from things they could influence through treatment or prevention through immunisations e.g. stroke, heart attacks, measles. Secondly, the NHS should look after you well if you have a long-term medical condition such as diabetes, asthma, arthritis. Thirdly, the NHS should treat you effectively if you need a short episode of care e.g. broken leg, an operation or infection. Fourthly, the NHS should treat you well. The experience should be as positive as possible, ranging from participation in decisions about your treatment to decent customer service. Finally, the NHS should treat you safely. All of these are measurable at different levels. They also dovetail with the definition of quality in the three domains of effectiveness, safety, and experience. The five domains of the NHS Outcomes Framework have formed the basis of the Government's Mandate to NHS England and NHS England's planning guidance for the NHShttp://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/5yr- strat-plann-guid-wa.pdf where they give clarity of purpose and direction to the NHS in a way that was previously undefined. He has argued that the role of NHS England is to \\"turn taxpayers money into good clinical outcomes\\". Following the Lansley reforms of the NHS, he was appointed National Medical Director in NHS England from 2013, where he is responsible for promoting a focus on quality, clinical leadership and innovation. To facilitate these aims he was responsible for overseeing the establishment of Academic Health Science Networks, Strategic Clinical Networks and Clinical Senates. He put clinicians at the heart of NHS England through the Chief Pharmaceutical, Dental, Scientific and Allied Health Professions officers, a primary care deputy, a medical director for specialised commissioning, regional medical directors and pharmacists, area medical directors, over 20 expert national clinical directors and junior doctors, pharmacists and dentists through the National Medical Director's Clinical Fellowship Scheme. With the advent of medical revalidation, he became the senior responsible officer for doctors in England. In November 2014 Keogh oversaw the publication of success rates of around 5,000 consultant surgeons when mortality rates and complications in surgery relating to procedures they performed was published. He warned that a further 2,500 who did not share this information would face penalties.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30072899 In April 2017, Keogh announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the year and in January 2018, left NHS England to become chair of Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust. Views Keogh maintains the NHS is Britain's greatest medical innovation: \\"Our health service, while still ranked among the best in the world, has never been busier. The NHS sees almost 1.5 million patients every day in England alone. So as well as celebrating its many achievements, in our landmark year we must also reaffirm our commitment to a taxpayer-funded service, based on clinical need and not the ability to pay.\\"The NHS turns 70 this year, and it‚Äôs Britain‚Äôs greatest medical innovation The Guardian National reviews In 2008, while interim Director General for Informatics in the Department of Health, Keogh undertook a National Health Informatics review. He argued for a Chief Information Officer for Health and the development of associated career structures in the NHS. He also highlighted the need to \\"focus on clinical metrics that improve quality, in the context of patient safety, patient experience and patient outcomes. The lack of a national set of clinical outcome and quality measures has slowed progress towards a culture of continuous quality improvement. It has prevented meaningful institutional comparisons and deprived the public of essential information...\\".https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124043310/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_086127.pdf In 2009 Keogh led a national taskforce to improve neonatal services.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/@sta/@perf/documents/digitalasset/dh_108435.pdf In 2012 he co-chaired a review of medical and dental school intakes, with Sir Graeme Catto, on behalf of the Higher Education Funding Council and the Department of Health.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213236/medical- and-dental-school-intakes.pdf In 2012 he was asked by the Secretary of State for Health to investigate the safety of PIP breast implants,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-expert-report-on- pip-breast-implants-published a product of fraudulent quality, but concluded that although they were more likely to rupture than other implants they did not pose significant health risk to women a finding endorsed by a subsequent European report. http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_038.pdf in 2013 In 2012 Keogh ordered a review of the national quality assurance frameworks and governance for pathology services with the aim of making the process more robust and transparent. This was prompted by a series of misdiagnoses at Kingsmill Hospital, which had negatively affected the care of a number of women with breast cancer. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213285/Bruce- Keogh-letter-Pathology-Quality-Assurance-Review.pdf The review reported in 2014.https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/path-qa-review.pdf In 2013, he published four significant reports: One on how to improve safety in the cosmetic intervention industry through a review of regulation with hard hitting recommendations.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of- the-regulation-of-cosmetic-interventions An independent review of the related ethical issues by The Nuffield Council on Bioethics concluded that, \\"all recommendations in the 2013 Keogh review of the regulation of cosmetic interventions should be implemented in full\\".https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/publications/cosmetic-procedures A second, widely known as the Keogh Review on the 14 Trusts with the highest mortality rates in England;http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/bruce-keogh- review/Pages/Overview.aspx,https://www.nhs.uk/news/medical-practice/keogh- review-on-hospital-deaths-published/.

The recommendations based on a rogorous review of 14 million 999 calls were accepted and implemented.https://preview.healthcareleadernews.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/07/ambulance-response-programme-letter.pdf In 2019 he led a review for the Independent Healthcare Providers Network aimed at improving clinical governance in independent healthcare providers in the UK.https://www.ihpn.org.uk/resources/regulation/mpaf/ Controversies In 2012 Keogh was asked by Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health, to reassure him that there had been adequate clinical consultation on proposals to reconfigure services in south London. In a letterhttp://www.savelewishamhospital.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/keogh_let_hunt.pdf to Hunt Keogh concluded that there had been adequate clinical consultation, but he also included a warning about closing Lewisham A&E.; His advice was seen by some as an intervention to protect and prevent the closure of Lewisham A&E;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/nhs-chief-had-critical-concerns- over-cuts-at-lewisham-hospital-8479824.html and by others as the opposite.https://www.facebook.com/savelewishamhospitalnhs/posts/484491851587248 Much debate centred around a projection regarding the number of lives that might be saved, a calculation of unknown origin ‚Äì attributed by some to Keogh and by others to work conducted by the London Clinical Senate. In 2013 Keogh provoked the suspension of children's heart surgery in Leeds just before the Easter weekend, based on evidence from Professor Roger Boyle, the former national heart czar and director of the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, that the mortality rate was 2.75 times higher than might be expected for their practice. Keogh was also concerned that one consultant surgeon was suspended from operating, that the senior consultant was on holiday and that the remaining surgeons were locums. The hospital could not contradict the mortality figures, so he suggested suspending surgery till the full facts could be verified. It subsequently turned out that Leeds had submitted poor data, 20 times more missing data than any other unit in the country, despite the fact that one of their cardiologists ran the national registry. After Leeds had submitted accurate and complete data, analysis showed that although they still had the highest mortality in the country they were within normal statistical boundaries. His intervention was widely regarded as sensible and preemptory given the evidence, but some thought it precipitous. Keogh remained unrepentant, arguing he would rather be remembered for preventing an avoidable disaster and embedding the \\"precautionary principle\\" in NHS safety culture, than responsible for not acting on reasonable doubt. He cited examples of prevarication at Bristol in the 1990s and Mid Stafforshire in the 2000s when some people argued over data while other people were harmed. In 2014 he told the Parliamentary Health Select Committee that there was \\"extreme skepticism\\" in the NHS that the ¬£1.6 billion of NHS money being transferred to local government as the Better Care Fund would be used for the benefit of NHS patients. He expressed concern that it would \\"be used for filling in potholes\\" as local councils grappled with their priorities and funding cuts. The remark attracted opprobrium from local government and support in equal measure from NHS commentators. Ahead of proposed industrial action in England by junior doctors, NHS England published a letter from Keogh to the BMA which made reference to the November 2015 Paris attacks.https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/industrial- action-bk-letter.pdf The letter sought reassurance regarding the impact of the proposed strike, including clarification that the BMA would call off the strike in the event of a terrorist attack. On 7 January 2016, The Independent newspaper revealed details of involvement from the Department of Health and the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt. The Independent article stated: \\"In one email, sent the day before the strike was declared, Sir Bruce was told by a DoH official that the risk of a ‚Äúmajor incident‚Äù would be ‚Äúpressed quite hard in the media once the strike is formally announced‚Äù and he was advised that ‚Äúthe more hard-edged you can be on this, the better‚Äù. The leak also revealed that Hunt agreed Sir Bruce would not be asked to speak to the media on the day the strike was declared ‚Äúso long as‚Äù his letter reiterated his opposition to strike action. A British Medical Association spokesperson has since openly condemned these actions by saying: \\"This level of political interference is extremely concerning and will only serve to worsen junior doctor‚Äôs lack of trust in the Government‚Äôs handling of negotiations\\". Sir Bruce has been clear that he was discharging legal responsibilities imposed by the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) and the Health and Social Care Act (2012) which meant he was the NHS England Board member responsible for ensuring no one would be harmed by the strike, a responsibility complicated by the heightened security status at the time. He clearly worried about the impact of withdrawing emergency cover on patient care and the standing of the medical profession.https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2016/apr/09/emergency- nhs-junior-doctors-strike Despite the controversy above he has remained a strong advocate for harnessing the energy and creativity of junior doctors to better the NHS. He was responsible for introducing , with the deans of medical schools a structured programme to introduce fresh medical graduates to pre registration doctor roles in the NHS with the aim of reducing anxiety and improving safety.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/215127/dh_132946.pdf He established the National Medical Director's Clinical Fellowship programme,https://www.fmlm.ac.uk/programme-services/individual- support/national-medical-directors-clinical-fellow-scheme the Agents for Change movement with the BMJ https://stg- blogs.bmj.com/agentsforchange/about/,https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/05/12/layla- mccay-on-making-junior-doctors-agents-for-change/ included junior doctors in the hospital inspection regime and in a report to the Secretary of State for Health in 2013 on hospitals with high mortality (Keogh Review) he argued that junior doctors, \\"are capable of providing valuable insights, but too many are not being valued or listened to.... were receiving inadequate supervision and support, particularly when dealing with complex issues out of hours. They often felt disenfranchised\\" and he \\"strongly advised medical directors to tap into the latent energy of junior doctors, who move between organisations and are potentially our most powerful agents for change\\". He argued that junior doctors in specialist training should not just be seen as clinical leaders of tomorrow, but the clinical leaders of today.https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/bruce-keogh- review/Documents/outcomes/keogh-review-final-report.pdf Honours Keogh was appointed as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 2003.

Over the 800 m Peltzer improved Ted Meredith's long-standing record by 0.3 seconds to 1:51.6 min in London in July 1926. Over the 1000 m he set a world record of 2:25.8 in Paris in July 1927, and over 1500 m Peltzer broke Paavo Nurmi's world record (3:52.6) and set a new one at 3:51.0 in Berlin in September 1926. Peltzer was the only athlete to have held the 800 m and the 1500 m world records simultaneously, until Sebastian Coe matched the feat over fifty years later. Biography Born in Ellernbrook-Drage in Holstein, Peltzer overcame childhood ill-health to become a successful athlete, winning his first German championship at age twenty-two. He started university in Munich in 1918, joining the TSV 1860 club, where he was nicknamed \\"Otto der Seltsame\\" (Otto the Strange). He continued in Munich, receiving his doctorate in 1925. In 1926 he was one of a group of German athletes invited to the AAA Championships at Stamford Bridge stadium in London, where he won the 800 m, beating Britain's Douglas Lowe, who had won the event at the 1924 Olympic Games which, along with the 1920 Games, Germany had been barred from entering. In 1926, a specially arranged 1500 m race between Peltzer, Paavo Nurmi of Finland, Edvin Wide of Sweden and Herbert Bocher of Germany took place in Berlin which was won by Peltzer in a new world record time.Otto the Strange ‚Äì the Champion who defied the Nazis, The Observer Sport Monthly, July 2008 No 101 Shortly before the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, to which German athletes were again allowed to enter with Peltzer elected as team leader, Peltzer was injured in an accident while playing handball. Although he recovered enough to take part in the 800 m heats, he failed to qualify for the final.The Historic Series on Olympic Running (III): Men‚Äôs 800m. Scc-events.com (25 August 2015). Retrieved on 2015-09-11. In 1932 he was team captain, but poor arrangements left the German team trying to run with spiked shoes on the hard Olympic track. Peltzer made the final, but did not finish. Peltzer was often persecuted for his homosexuality. In 1933 he joined the Nazi Party and the SS. However, in June 1935 he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for 'homosexual offences with youths'.Herzer, Manfred: Dr. Otto Peltzer ‚Äì \\"Ein P√§dophiler √ºberlebt den Nazi- Terror,\\" in: Capri.

After spending time in Denmark, Finland (where he slept rough and contracted bronchitis) and Sweden, he returned to Germany in 1941 having been assured that the charges against him would be dropped. However, he was arrested and sent to KZ Mauthausen, where he remained until the camp was liberated on 5 May 1945.Running Cultures: Racing in Time and Space, author John Bale 2003 pp. 111‚Äì112 With homosexuality remaining a criminal offence in 1950s Germany, and Peltzer in conflict with the German Athletic Association (DLV) and Carl Diem, Sportswissenschaft No 3 2004 Peltzer's opportunities to coach athletics were limited in Germany. He obtained a commission from a German newspaper to report on the Melbourne Olympics, and after the Games tried unsuccessfully to get work with various national athletics organisations. He eventually came to India, coaching in the national athletics stadium in New Delhi, and founded the Olympic Youth Delhi club, later renamed the Otto Peltzer Memorial Athletic Club in his honour. Following a heart attack in 1967, Peltzer was persuaded to return to Germany, and was treated in hospital in Holstein. After attending an athletics meeting in Eutin, Schleswig-Holstein, Peltzer collapsed and was found dead on a path towards the car park.The true friends of India.

[1997] 3 S.C.R. 3 is a leading opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in response to a reference question regarding remuneration and the independence and impartiality of provincial court judges. Notably, the majority opinion found all judges are independent, not just superior court judges and inferior court judges concerned with criminal law, as the written constitution stipulates. Unwritten constitutional principles were relied upon to demonstrate this, indicating such principles were growing in importance in constitutional interpretation. The reference also remains one of the most definitive statements on the extent to which all judges in Canada are protected by the Constitution. The majority opinion established that independent compensation commissions are required to help set salaries free of political manipulation. These commissions, described by the majority as \\"an institutional sieve\\"Lamer C.J., para. 170. and by the dissent as \\"a virtual fourth branch of government\\", make recommendations that governments may deviate from only with rational explanations. However, the reference has been subject to harsh published criticisms. Background The reference was the amalgamation of three different sets of challenges to the impartiality and independence of provincial court judges in Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, and Alberta. The powers of the provincial legislatures to reduce the salaries of the provincial court judges was challenged as a violation of section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which gives an accused the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty \\"in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\\". In Prince Edward Island and Manitoba, the salaries of judges were lowered along with those of other civil servants to help combat deficits. In Prince Edward Island, various challenges of the judges' consequent independence were raised by defendants, causing the government to bring two reference questions to its Supreme Court. Only one reference resulted in a finding of dependence, namely for lack of adequate security of tenure. In Manitoba, the pay cut was challenged directly by a provincial judges association. Meanwhile, in Alberta, cuts to judicial salaries were challenged by defendants. Concerns in Alberta were also raised by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein saying on the radio that a certain judge should be \\"very, very quickly fired\\". The judge had threatened to simply stop working due to his belief that his salary was insufficient.Lamer, para. 19. (The Supreme Court only briefly addressed this, saying Klein's words were \\"unfortunate and reflect a misunderstanding of the theory and practice of judicial independence in Canada\\".Lamer, para. 286.) Opinion of the Court Lamer C.J. with L'Heureux-Dub√©, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ, allowed the appeals in part, stating that there was constitutional protection of judicial independence and impartiality for all judges. One problem identified was that the independence of provincial judges was not protected as extensively as the federal judges were under sections 96 to 100 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The majority read section 11(d) as only protecting independence in the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to offence (i.e., it would protect judges concerned with criminal law, but not civil law). However, section 11(d) is not a broad or exhaustive code. Instead, the Court looked to constitutional norms and found that judicial independence was one such norm implied by the preamble to the Constitution. Although Lamer recognized case law such as the Patriation Reference which noted the preamble technically has no binding effect in itself, he also found the preamble reveals the \\"basic principles which are the very source of the substantive provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867\\" and \\"invites the use of those organizing principles to fill out gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme\\".Lamer C.J., para. 94‚Äì95. The implication of the importance of judicial independence came from the preamble's statement that Canada's constitution should be similar to the United Kingdom's, and the UK has a tradition of judicial independence. The Act of Settlement of 1701 was particularly important for independence. The Supreme Court had previously reached this conclusion in Beauregard v. Canada (1986).Lamer, para. 105. However, the Court now claimed that since courts are more important today, judicial independence has become a fundamental issue that should not just be reserved for the superior courts, as dictated by the Act of Settlement. The Constitution could adapt to changing circumstances in this regard. (This interpretation of the British Constitution has inspired criticism. The British form of judicial independence was more limited in 1867, neither extending to inferior courts nor limiting government power to lower the judges' remuneration. At any rate, no act of Parliament can be declared ultra vires by a court in British law. This is why academic Jeffrey Goldsworthy attacked the decision as \\"a self-contradiction, a vague reference to 'evolution' combined with a plainly false analogy, and an evasion\\".Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. \\"The Preamble, Judicial Independence and Judicial Integrity.\\" FORUM Constitutionnel (2000) 11:2.) The Court turned back to examine section 11(d) and from precedent, namely Valente v. The Queen, identified three fundamental requirements of judicial independence: 1) security of tenure, 2) financial security, and 3) some administrative independence. As well, judicial independence can be divided into two types of independence: 1) individual independence belonging to a judge and 2) institutional independence of a court as a whole. A judge must also be reasonably seen as being independent. It is possible, Lamer found, to interpret each of the three requirements in light of the two types of independence; this case, in particular, would explore how financial security belongs to both a judge and the court as a whole. This discussion would go beyond Valente, since that decision only treated financial security as a matter of individual independence.Lamer, para. 119‚Äì121. The Court emphasized that the role of institutional independence has become expected of provincial courts due to their increased role in dispute resolution in the country. As a previous judicial independence case, Beauregard, had demonstrated, institutional independence was needed so that courts could guard the Constitution, the rule of law and fundamental justice.Lamer, para. 123. This required more separation of powers; whereas judicial independence has normally been understood to protect the judiciary from the executive, the Court now found the judiciary should be free of manipulation from the legislative branch.Lamer, para. 125. Provincial courts should benefit from this independence, as demonstrated by their handling of important cases such as R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd. in 1983.Lamer, para. 127. For these reasons, it was strongly suggested that the government establish judicial salary commissions, thus overruling obiter dicta in the previous landmark judicial independence case, Valente v. The Queen, which had found such commissions were desirable but not necessary. In this case, it was noted commissions could guard against manipulation by both the executive and legislatures. If remuneration of provincial judges is to be raised, lowered or kept the same, this may be done along with the remuneration of other government employees or with the judges' alone. The continued independence of judges, however, will be kept apparent in any of these circumstances if it involves review by an \\"independent, effective, and objective\\" body, i.e. the salary commissions. While salary recommendations of these commissions should not be binding, they should be taken seriously. Any government rejection of a recommendation will have to be justified and may be challenged in a court.Lamer, para. 133. However, the justification need not be scrutinized to the extent that a government decision will be scrutinized under Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Instead, governments must only show their rejections are rational, and rationality can be measured in the way it was measured by the Supreme Court in Reference re Anti-Inflation Act (1976).Lamer, para. 182‚Äì183. Another benefit for having salary commissions was that it eliminated direct salary negotiations between the government and judges. Such direct negotiations would naturally raise concerns about what exactly is being negotiated. Namely, there was a concern that governments could manipulate judges to make decisions in certain ways.Lamer, para. 134. In order to ensure the government would not deliberately let judges' salaries fall below the cost of living, in relation to inflation, it was also decided that the commissions should meet regularly, for example once every three to five years.Lamer, para. 147. Since judicial independence is guaranteed by the preamble, civil law judges have a right to these salary commissions, even though they have no rights under section 11(d). Turning to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court faulted the governments of Prince Edward Island and Alberta for neither consulting salary commissions nor having such bodies to begin with. For this reason, the actions of these governments breached section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights.Lamer, para. 200, 217. Manitoba did have a salary commission, but its actions were unconstitutional because the provincial government did not use it.Lamer para. 224. Since these considerations were made using section 11(d), the Court considered whether violations of these rights could be justified under section 1 of the Charter of Rights, as is normal procedure. Section 1 typically requires a valid government reason for violating rights, and in this case Prince Edward Island and Alberta's actions failed the section 1 test because they did not explain why they did not have salary commissions. Likewise, Manitoba did not explain why they did not use their salary commission.Lamer, para. 278‚Äì280. An academic commentator has suggested the section 1 analysis was actually unneeded since the right to a commission is based in the preamble, which is not subject to section 1; the analysis was thus \\"a first year law school mistake\\".Kahana, Tsvi. \\"The Constitution as a Collective Agreement: Remuneration of Provincial Court Judges in Canada\\", (2004) 29 Queen's L.J., page 487. Dissent La Forest J., alone in dissent, rejected the majority's finding of an unwritten constitutional principle that protects a right to judicial salary commissions. He was very wary of the \\"discovery\\" of such new principles, especially when some protection of judges can already be found elsewhere in the text of the Constitution, namely section 11(d), which was the subject of this case. The counsel had primarily relied on section 11(d) and only briefly spoke of unwritten rules.La Forest, para. 297. La Forest also suggested that section 11(d) granting independence only to inferior criminal law judges, and not inferior civil law judges, was deliberate, because \\"Being accused of a crime is one of the most momentous encounters an individual can have with the power of the state.\\"La Forest, para. 298. La Forest went on to caution that \\"judicial power\\" is limited so that a court \\"does not initiate matters and has no agenda of its own\\".La Forest, para. 300. This made him worried about the majority launching into an extensive, unneeded discussion on unwritten principles.La Forest, para. 302. He accepted unwritten principles exist, but disputed that limits on government decisions can be found in the preamble. There was no tradition guarding judicial independence against Parliament.La Forest, para. 305. Parliamentary supremacy remained important in Britain even after the Act of Settlement; thus British courts cannot invalidate a law, even if the law is generally thought to be wrong.La Forest, para. 309. La Forest acknowledged this could be seen as a \\"technical quibble\\" since courts in Canada can invalidate laws, but he went on to point out that the Act of Settlement only covered superior judges, and not inferior judges.La Forest, para. 312‚Äì313. He also said courts should have clearer grounds for limiting legislative actions, casting previous decisions such as Switzman v. Elbling (1957), which relied on the Implied Bill of Rights, into doubt. He pointed to Attorney General for Canada and Dupond v. Montreal (1978) as a prior Supreme Court decision questioning the Implied Bill of Rights.La Forest, para. 316-317. If an implied bill of rights existed, it should be found in the creation of Parliament, in section 17 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and should allow for Parliamentary supremacy instead of limiting it.La Forest, para. 318. In this case, La Forest pointed to Valente and R. v. Lipp√© to show section 11(d) does not guarantee a type of independence that is most favourable to judges.La Forest, para. 330. The conclusion in Valente that judicial compensation committees were not needed was therefore valid; section 11(d) left room for determining what methods can be used to achieve independence. In this case, judges' salaries were lowered along with those of other government employees, and this did not seem to raise reasonable concerns about judicial independence.La Forest, para. 334‚Äì337. As a judicial compensation commission likely should not have a problem with this, as acknowledged by Lamer, La Forest found the requirement that the commission look into the matter to be \\"a triumph of form over substance\\".La Forest, para. 343. La Forest also felt requiring such commissions was also \\"tantamount to enacting a new constitutional provision to extend the protection provided by s. 11(d)\\" by forcing the creation of \\"what in some respects is a virtual fourth branch of government to police the interaction between the political branches and the judiciary\\". Judges simply asking whether government decisions seem reasonable would be enough.La Forest, para. 344. Rehearing The 1997 Reference caused numerous challenges regarding the creation of compensation committees. Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them. Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals. Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again. In Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2) (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being. Also as a result of the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998. Aftermath Notably, the reference had the effect of damaging the reputation of the judicial system. The outcome affecting remuneration has been seen as being motivated by greed. As one academic wrote, the judiciary's \\"integrity has been tarnished by the perception of self-interest and bias\\". This author also claimed that a resulting 35% raise for federal judges has led to burdensome taxes.LeRoy, Sylvia, \\"Judicial Independence and the Integrity of the Judiciary\\", Fraser Forum, August 2004. Page 3. Another scholar wrote that the reference \\"demonstrates that judges can be audacious, greedy and jealous\\". This scholar said judges' standard of living prior to the reference was already good, and that provincial judges only seemed to want the same pay as federal judges.Kahana, page 448. Scholars have offered various specific critiques for the majority opinion. Among these was that it was self- contradictory. The request that government reasons should be rational and legitimate seemed to ask for two separate things, namely reasonableness and correctness. Rationality allows for government reasons to be accepted if they are not overly flawed, even if courts disagree with them. Legitimacy, meanwhile, implies government decisions should be correct, i.e., consistent with commission recommendations.Kahana, 452. Professor Peter Hogg objected to the notion that governments and judges cannot directly negotiate. He wrote that \\"It assumes that there is a real possibility that judges would violate their oath of office and decide cases wrongly (for example, by convicting an innocent person or imposing an unduly harsh penalty) in order to obtain some (highly speculative and likely trivial) advantage at the negotiating table.\\"Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 188. Hogg also felt the Reference made it increasingly unlikely that judges' salaries can be lowered. In terms of case law, he pointed to Mackin v. New Brunswick (2002) as a case that, after the 1997 Reference, \\"reinforced and even extended\\" the notion that lowering judges' salaries could be unconstitutional.Hogg, page 187. After the Reference, all provinces had salary commissions. The Reference also inspired the federal government under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien to establish a salary commission for federal judges, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission.F.L. Morton and Ranier Knopff, The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, (Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000), page 109. Still, the Provincial Judges Reference sparked further litigation as some provincial government's decisions not to follow commissions' salary recommendations were challenged in the courts. The Supreme Court addressed the matter again in 2005 in Provincial Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice) and urged courts to be deferential when governments give sufficient reasons for rejecting salary commissions' recommendations. Some scholars also expressed concern that the reference set a precedent for enforcing unwritten rules. This could lead to even wider grounds for judicial review.LeRoy, 4. The study of unwritten rules is also said to have surfaced in the Supreme Court decisions New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v.

It was offered as a cargo van, a passenger van, and a pickup truck. Mercedes-Benz Espa√±a S.A. had obtained the Vitoria factory from Industrias del Motor S.A. (IMOSA) which had been making their F1000 L van there. The F1000 L was a development of the DKW Schnellaster, but with a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine instead of the original DKW two-stroke petrol engine. The MB100 was a further development of IMOSA's F1000 L van. The MB100 was powered by a 2.4 litre diesel making about 55 kW (73 hp), an engine also used in the Mercedes Benz 207D. The MB100 was offered in Germany from 1987 to 1995 as an extension of Daimler-Benz's commercial motor vehicle range. In 1992 the MB100 was given a slanted radiator and an extended front end, intended among other things to enhance safety in a collision. The MB100 was replaced by the Mercedes-Benz Vito in 1996, but remained available for export markets such as Brazil and Argentina until 1997 when the Sprinter started to be made in Argentina. Pacific market MB100 and MB140 Rear In 1999, DaimlerChrysler Australia/Pacific introduced the MB100 and the MB140 (Model type 661), a larger derivative of the MB100, to the Australian and Pacific markets. These vans were manufactured under licence by the SsangYong Motor Company, which also made a rebadged version called the SsangYong Istana. The Pacific market MB100D and MB140D both used a licensed version of the naturally aspirated 2.9L OM602 I5 motor from Mercedes mated to a 5 speed manual transmission while the MB100 and MB140 used a licensed Mercedes M111 2.3L petrol engine mated to a 5 speed as well. There were both van and minibus versions with the bus versions having sliding windows, rear concealed air conditioning in the ceiling and convenience lights for the comfort of passengers. In some markets, for example Singapore, there was also an electric step which would slide out when the sliding door was opened for the convenience of passengers. They were made in both right and left hand drive depending on the market it was in and depending on seat arrangement, could accommodate up to 15 people. In late 2004, Shanghai Huizhong Automotive Manufacturing Co., Ltd. took over a major stake in Ssangyong's automobiles division and started manufacturing a redesigned version of the Pacific market MB140.

Lyrics  Thomas Oliphant's original English words as they appear in \\"Welsh Melodies With Welsh and English Poetry\\" (volume 2), published in 1862 The English-language lyrics were written by the Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant. They first appeared in 1862, in volume 2 of Welsh Melodies, a set of four volumes authored by John Thomas, including Welsh words by John Jones (Talhaiarn) and English words by Oliphant.

Welsh lyrics  In the original 1862 publication, Oliphant's English lyrics were published alongside Talhaiarn's Welsh lyrics. Although some early sources state that Oliphant's words were a translation of Talhaiarn's Welsh original, this is not the case in any strict or literal sense. The first verse in Welsh, together with a literal English translation taken from Campbell's Treatise on the language, poetry, and music of the Highland Clans (1862), is given for comparison:. \\"Fa la la\\"s omitted for brevity Goreu pleser ar nos galan, T≈∑ a th√¢n a theulu diddan, Calon l√¢n a chwrw melyn, Pennill mwyn a llais y delyn, The best pleasure on new year's eve, Is house and fire and a pleasant family, A pure heart and brown ale, A gentle song and the voice of the harp  Variants  Pennsylvania School Journal, 1877 A variation of the lyrics appears in the December 1877 issue of the Pennsylvania School Journal. This version, in which there is no longer any reference to drinking, runs as follows:\\"Fa la la\\"s omitted for brevity; differences from the original emphasized An identical printing appeared four years later in The Franklin Square Song Collection. The pluralizing of the title of the carol to \\"Deck the Halls\\" is found as early as 1892.

Melody  Melody of \\"Deck the Hall\\", from John Hullah, The Song Book (1866) The melody of \\"Deck the Hall\\" is taken from \\"Nos Galan\\" (\\"New Year's Eve\\"), a traditional Welsh New Year's Eve carol published in 1794, although it is much older. The music is in AABA form.Boyd, Jack (1991). Encore!: A Guide to Enjoying Music, p. 31. .  Variants  The Pennsylvania version from 1877 omits the third \\"Fa la la\\" line (which corresponds to the instrumental flourish in the Welsh original). The third and fourth \\"Fa la la\\" lines sung to the words \\"Deck the Hall\\" differ from those sung or played in Wales, the fourth having a more arpeggiated melody in the Welsh version and the third differing in both melody and rhythm.  History  The tune is that of an old Welsh air, first found in a musical manuscript by Welsh harpist John Parry dating back to the 1700s. Poet John Ceiriog Hughes later wrote his own lyrics. A middle verse was later added by folk singers. In the eighteenth century the tune spread widely, with Mozart allegedly using it in his 18th violin sonata (1778) and later Haydn arranged it in under the Welsh title, \\"Nos galan\\" (Hob. XXXIb:29, 1803). The Welsh and English lyrics found in the earliest publication of the \\"Nos Galan\\" melody are as follows: Edward Jones O mor gynnes mynwes meinwen, fal lal lal lal lal lal lal lal la.

Seitz 83a Description from Seitz L. alcon Schiff. (= areas Esp., euphemus Godt.) (83 a). Large, the male above deep blue, but without brilliant gloss. The female black-brown, dusted with dark blue in the basal area. The dark violet-grey underside has numerous ocelli. L. alcon is easily distinguished from the following species (coeligena, euphemus, arcas, arion, arionides ...) by the male bearing on the blue disc of the forewing no other black spots but the discocellular lunule. Central Europe and North Asia, from the coast of the North Sea (Hamburg, Bremen, Belgium) to the Mediterranean, and from France to the Altai, Dauria and Tibet, ab. nigra Wheel, has the males strongly darkened, the females being quite black above. In ab. cecinae Hormuz. the ocelli of the underside are absent or strongly reduced. In ab. pallidior Schultz the margin is grey instead of black. ‚Äî marginepunctata Gillm. has a row of black dots before the margin, almost parallel with it; found by Hafner at Loitsch and other places in Carniolia.‚Äî In the form rebeli Hirschke the blue of the upperside is more brilliant and more extended, the dark margin being reduced, in the female only the apical area black; Styria. ‚Äî monticola Stgr. (83 a) has a narrow black margin like rebeli, but the blue is very deep and dark, so dull as in true alcon; from the Alps of Switzerland and the Caucasus. ‚Äî Egg white, finely reticulated, laid on the flowers of the food- plant (Gentiana pneumonanthe). The larva generally does not break through the shell on the upperside, so that the holes of empty eggs are not easily noticed. At first grey, later on reddish brown with dark dorsal line and dark head. The butterflies occur on damp meadows where Gentiana grows; they are plentiful in such places, sometimes even in abundance, from the end of May into July, in the North not before the end of June.Seitz, A. ed. Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) Taxonomy There are five subspecies: *P. a. alcon (Central Europe) *P. a. jeniseiensis (Shjeljuzhko, 1928) (southern Siberia) *P. a. sevastos Rebel & Zerny, 1931 (Carpathians) *P. a. xerophila Berger, 1946 (Central Europe) *‚Ä†P. a. arenaria (Netherlands) There has been controversy over whether Phengaris rebeli, currently regarded as an ecotype within the Alcons, should be listed as a separate species. The two types are morphologically indistinguishable and molecular analysis has revealed little genetic difference, mostly attributable to localized habitat adaptation. Still some maintain that they should be treated as distinct species, especially for conservation purposes, because they parasitise different host ant colonies and parasitise these ants at different rates, and also rely on different host plant species (Gentiana pneumonanthe in the case of Phengaris alcon and Gentiana cruciata in the case of Phengaris rebeli). Ecology Alcon blue depositing an egg Alcon blue eggs on marsh gentian The species can be seen flying in mid- to late summer. It lays its eggs onto the marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe); in the region of the Alps they are sometimes also found on the related willow gentian (Gentiana asclepiadea). The caterpillars eat no other plants. Parasitic relationship Pupa in ant nest Like some other species of Lycaenidae, the larval (caterpillar) stage of P. alcon depends on support by certain ants; it is therefore known as a myrmecophile. Alcon larvae leave the food plant when they have grown sufficiently (4th instar) and wait on the ground below to be discovered by ants. The larvae emit surface chemicals (allomones) that closely match those of ant larvae, causing the ants to carry the Alcon larvae into their nests and place them in their brood chambers. Once adopted into a nest, Alcon larvae are fed the regurgitations of nurse ants (just as other ant brood), a process called trophallaxis. This parasitic method is known as the \\"cuckoo\\" strategy and is an alternative to the predatory strategy employed by most other members of the genus such as Phengaris arion. Though less common, the cuckoo strategy has been found to have several advantages over the predatory strategy. For one, it is more trophically efficient than preying directly on other ant grubs, and as a result, significantly more cuckoo-type larvae can be supported per nest than predatory larvae. Another advantage of cuckoo feeding is that individuals, having pursued a higher degree of social integration, have a higher chance of surviving when a nest is overcrowded or facing food shortage because ants preferentially feed the larvae; compared to the type of scramble competition that can devastate predatory larvae, this contest competition results in much lower mortality. Though the cuckoo strategy has its advantages, it also comes with important costs; with greater host ant specialization comes much more limited ecological niches. When the Alcon larva is fully developed it pupates. Once the adult hatches it will leave the ant nest. Over time, some ant colonies that are parasitized in this manner will slightly change their larva chemicals as a defence, leading to an evolutionary \\"arms race\\" between the two species. Generally, Lycaenidae species which have a myrmecophilous relationship with the ant genus Myrmica are locked to primary host specificity. The Alcon blue is unusual in this regard in that it uses different host species in different locations throughout Europe, and often uses multiple host species even within the same location and population. Though it may be adopted into the nests of multiple Myrmica species within a given site, there is typically one \\"primary\\" species with which the locally adapted larvae can best socially integrate, leading to drastically higher survival rates. Across Europe, Alcons are known to use Myrmica scabrinodis, Myrmica ruginodis, Myrmica rubra, Myrmica sabuleti, Myrmica scabrinodis, Myrmica schencki, and rarely Myrmica lonae, and Myrmica specioides. Predation P. alcon larvae are sought underground by the Ichneumon eumerus wasp. On detecting a P. alcon larva the wasp enters the nest and sprays a pheromone that causes the ants to attack each other. In the resulting confusion the wasp locates the butterfly larva and injects it with its eggs. On pupation, the wasp eggs hatch and consume the chrysalis from the inside.

The line, formed from various one-shots, focused on creating all- new characters using established DC names, such as the Joker, Superman, and the Flash. Contrasting the Tangent Universe with the DC Universe, Jurgens commented: Publication history=Superman According to Dan Jurgens, the reconceptualization of Superman \\"went through many permutations\\". An early idea eschewed powers altogether and revolved around highlighting the \\"man\\" in \\"Superman\\", and making him \\"a cop, or a doctor or something different. A guy with no powers but tremendous character who fights on behalf of his fellow man\\". Writer Millar noted that \\"the classic Superman role is already filled by the Atom\\", and wanted to echo \\"Kafka's metamorphosis where we actually see this likable, regular guy transform into a superhuman\\". Thus Millar took Jurgens' early idea \\"of the average Joe as the superMAN\\" and used artist Guice's \\"unique approach to the flashback scenes\\" (as seen in his Resurrection Man work) to create a different style than that used by Guice on his Action Comics work. The character and his storyline also draw influence from the story The Reign of the Superman written by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster prior to the creation of their iconic character. The Tangent universe's Superman utilises the name of DC villain Two-Face (Harvey Dent) rather than the name 'Clark Kent'. Superman's powers, according to his writer, are that \\"his brain is evolving at an accelerated rate\\" thanks to a 'god-force'.\\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Man of Tomorrow\\", Tangent Comics Volume Three (DC, 2008) , DC Comics, p. 199 Wonder Woman Writer Peter David worked from Jurgens' concept that Tangent's Wonder Woman is \\"a female warrior\\" exiled to Earth for sins committed on another world. Seeking a twist to make her different from the original DCU character, David thought up Wanda's origin as \\"a symbol of what [her] world could be if [her people] were united\\". Combining two diverse aspects, she \\"seems distracted in any combat situation\\" and \\"would rather not fight\\", preferring \\"pondering some deep philosophical point\\". After the character conception, artist Gene Ha produced design artwork, initially of a bearded lady, but eventually merely \\"a very alien woman\\".\\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Wonder Woman\\", Tangent Comics Volume Three, DC Comics, p. 200 Nightwing: Nightforce Writer Ostrander previously wrote Nightwing for the first wave of Tangent issues, and for his second wave issue christened the team (Hex, Black Orchid and Wildcat) \\"Nightforce\\". Citing the benefit of the Tangent line as giving \\"a far greater freedom to sculpt the world in any fashion we want\\", Jurgens said that for the second wave he hoped to \\"see Earth totally and completely subjugated\\". As the Tangent universe's premiere covert team, much of the \\"mammoth task\\" of staging a pivotal Tangent event fell to Ostrander, who installed an undead, vampire Stalin as head of a Soviet Empire. Ostrander also revealed the \\"Dark Circle\\", whose members could be killed and \\"resurrected as a warrior, Night of the Living Dead style, for the Ultra- Humanite\\".\\"Tangent Comics: The Background: Nightwing Nightforce\\". Tangent Comics Volume Three DC Comics, p. 201 Overview The history of the Tangent Universe radically diverges from the real world due to the presence of superheroes. The interference of the original Atom causes the Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that results in the nuclear obliteration of Florida and Cuba. The aftermath of the destruction of Florida shapes the lives of several characters. The city of New Atlantis is created out of the remains of the city of Atlanta and is later the birthplace of the Joker. A group of sea creatures are mutated by the radioactive fallout into humanoid form and become known as the Sea Devils. The other major event to have repercussions is the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which leads to the creation of the Manhunter and deployment of alternate Metal Men as a U.S. black ops squad. As a result of the Cuban War in this timeline, the Soviet Union still existed in the late 90s and was still a world superpower. However, China was not involved in this nuclear exchange and has its own metahuman genetic experimentation program, resulting in the creation of Supergirl and Powergirl.

Tangent: Superman's Reign (2008) The 12-issue limited series revisits the Tangent Universe 10 years later, both in reality and fiction. The series ran between March 2008 until February 2009, and was written by Dan Jurgens with art by Jamal Igle and Carlos Magno. The series was met with favorable reviews, noting strong character development and plotting. In efforts to aid an alternate- reality-displaced Tangent Flash (Lia Nelson), Green Lantern (John Stewart) and the Flash (Wally West) are inexplicably transported to Earth-9, the Tangent Universe, by the Tangent Green Lantern. The trio joins the Tangent Spectre and the Tangent Manhunter in freeing the Atom, leaving John Stewart captured by the Tangent Superman, ruler of Earth-9. While being interrogated by the Tangent Superman, John Stewart's ring is contacted by Hal Jordan's ring, which the Tangent Green Lantern uses to bring additional members of the Justice League to Earth-9. The rescued Atom is revealed to be the Tangent Powergirl, lover to the Tangent Superman, and a fight ensues. The Tangent Manhunter is brutally murdered. The Tangent Superman takes Stewart's power ring, and uses the ring, augmented by his psychic powers and the magic of the Tangent Orion to travel to New Earth of the mainstream DC Universe. Meanwhile, Batman infiltrates the Core, hub of information on Earth-9, and is saved by the Tangent Batman while escaping, who is mounting a revolution against the Tangent Superman. The Tangent Superman and the Tangent Powergirl battle their New Earth counterparts, only to escape and destroy the White House. The Tangent Superman proceeds to kidnap the world's leaders, cede power from them and detonate a nuclear weapon to distract New Earth's heroes. While on Earth-9, the heroes find and recruit the Tangent Superman's last tie to humanity, his wife Lola Dent. The heroes on Earth-9 transport themselves back to New Earth, where the combined forces of New Earth's and Earth-9's heroes fight against the Tangent Superman, the Tangent Powergirl and a cadre of villains that the Earth-9 ruler has gathered from New Earth (Lex Luthor, the Joker, Mr. Freeze, the Icicle, Black Manta, Poison Ivy, and Felix Faust), as well as the Tangent Ultra-Humanite. The raging battle against the Tangent Superman weakens him, allowing him to be ultimately defeated by his wife, concluding the story. Convergence (2015) Convergence is a two-month weekly miniseries, published by DC Comics, that ran from April 2015 to May 2015. Convergence spins out of the final issues of the weekly series, Earth 2: World's End and The New 52: Futures End. The story involves Brainiac trapping cities from various timelines and planets that have ended, transporting them in domes to a planet outside of time and space, and \\"opening them for a great experiment to see what happens when all these folks meet\\". Notable during this event is the return of DC characters from before the 2011 Flashpoint story arc that led to the creation of The New 52 universe. Interactions with the mainstream DC Universe The Kingdom (1998) revealed that the Tangent Universe was part of Hypertime, a fluid system of alternate realities based on splitting and re-merging timelines. Regular DC characters became aware of the Tangent Universe, but did not interact with it. Infinite Crisis (2006) identified the Tangent Universe as Earth-97, part of the recreated Multiverse. As Earth-97 was being destroyed in the chaos, the Tangent Universe's Green Lantern said that the heroes had to follow her lantern's light in order to survive. At the end of the story on New Earth, two children found the lantern belonging to the Tangent Universe's Green Lantern washed up on a beach. The Tangent Universe's Green Lantern, Flash and Atom appeared in Ion #9-10 (2007), in which they displaced Ion and the two children who had found the lantern. Ion found himself in the Bleed, where he encountered Captain Atom. Upon returning to Earth, Ion defeated the Tangent heroes, apparently by sending them back to their native dimension. During this appearance, everything said by the Tangent heroes was a repeat of lines from the original Tangent comics run. The Tangent Universe's Green Lantern later appeared in Justice League of America #50, where she fled to New Earth in order to warn its heroes of an impending attack by the Crime Syndicate of Amerika. During the issue, it was revealed that the Syndicate members had ravaged the Tangent Earth and killed many of its heroes in the process. The Tangent Universe's Green Lantern later became instrumental in the ensuing battle by temporarily resurrecting Alexander Luthor Jr., and by the end of the story, the Tangent Universe had been restored to its former state. Earth-9 The \\"History of the Multiverse\\" backup stories in the 2007-2008 series Countdown to Final Crisis established that the Tangent Universe now exists as one of the new 52 alternate universes. DC's official list of the current known multiverse lists the Tangent Universe as Earth-9.

She was named for the Kennebec River. Kennebec was launched 5 October 1861 by G. W. Lawrence, Thomaston, Maine; and commissioned at Boston Navy Yard 8 February 1862, Lieutenant John Henry Russell in command. Operational history=Blockade duty The new gunboat was assigned to Admiral David Farragut's newly created West Gulf Blockading Squadron and stood out to sea 12 February 1862. She reached Ship Island, Mississippi, 5 March and 3 days later crossed the bar at Pass a l'Outre and entered the Mississippi River. In the ensuing weeks she did reconnaissance and patrol duty, occasionally engaging Confederate ships chasing them upstream. Attack on Forts Jackson and St. Phillip On 28 March she and Wissahickon steamed up the river within sight of Fort Jackson and found the cable-linked line of hulks which the South had placed across the river to bar Farragut's invaders. After Southern batteries at the Fort opened a rapid fire on the gunboats, they retired down the river; but, from time to time thereafter, they steamed up to learn more about the Southern defenses while Farragut made ready to attack. On 18 April a flotilla of schooners under Commander David Dixon Porter opened a steady fire on Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and maintained the barrage until it reached a crescendo on the night of 24 April as Farragut in Hartford led his fleet past the forts. Kennebec, in the gunboat division commanded by Captain Henry H. Bell, became entangled in the line of rafts which obstructed the river and struck one of the Confederate schooners. This delayed her until Admiral Farragut had completed his dash, enabling the Confederate guns fire to concentrate their fire on Kennebec, Itasca and Winona. As dawn had made their ships even more vulnerable targets, their commanders ordered the crews to lie flat on the decks while the gunboats drifted down stream out of action. However, Kennebec's disappointment was softened 4 days later when she was on hand to see the Stars and Bars at Fort Jackson lowered and the Stars and Stripes raised in their place. Mississippi Patrol and convoy duty up and down the Mississippi occupied Kennebec for the next 2 months. She was with Farragut below Vicksburg, Mississippi 25 June, and began a bombardment of the Confederate batteries there the next day. She remained below with Brooklyn continuing the shelling until Farragut had safely run by the Southern guns on the 28th and joined Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis above Vicksburg. The gunboat engaged batteries and snipers ashore for 2 days before heading down stream to resume escort and patrol duty. The tricky waters of the Mississippi ever threatened to fling the gunboat hard aground in hostile territory; and Confederate cannon and riflemen lay hidden ashore waiting to harass' the Union ships and their men. Gulf of Mexico On 9 August Kennebec headed for the open sea for blockade and cruising duty in the Gulf of Mexico. From time she exchanged fire with shore batteries and shelled targets ashore. She helped capture schooner Jupiter 4 May 1863 and took schooner Hunter on the 17th. Steamer William Bayley fell prey to her 18 July. She shared in the capture of schooner Winona off Mobile, Alabama 29 November and she took schooner Marshall J. Smith laden with 260 bales of cotton 9 December. On the last day of 1863, she made a prize of steamer Grey Jacket after the blockade runner had slipped out of Mobile laden with cotton, rosin, and turpentine for Havana. She then took schooner John Scott after an 8-hour chase 7 January 1864. The conquest of Mobile was Farragut's next major objective. Kennebec helped blockade the port during the spring and summer of 1864. On 30 June Glasgow had forced blockade- running steamer Ivanhoe to run aground near Fort Morgan 30 June. Because the steamer was protected by the fort's guns, Rear Admiral Farragut attempted at first to destroy her by long range fire from Metacomet and Monongahela. When this proved unsuccessful, Farragut authorized his Flag Lieutenant, J. Crittenden Watson, to lead a boat expedition to burn Ivanhoe. Under the cover of darkness and the ready guns on board Metacomet and Kennebec, Watson led four boats directly to the grounded steamer and fired her in two places shortly after midnight 6 July. Farragut wrote: \\"The admiral commanding has much pleasure in announcing to the fleet, what was anxiously looked for last night by hundreds, the destruction of the blockade runner ashore under the rebel batteries by an expedition of boats... the entire conduct of the expedition was marked by a promptness and energy which shows what may be expected of such officers and men on similar occasions.\\" On the morning of 5 August Admiral Farragut was ready to attack Mobile. Kennebec was lashed alongside Monongahela when the Union ships got underway shortly after 6 A.M. An hour later the guns at Fort Morgan opened fire and Confederate steamers Morgan and Games soon joined them. Undaunted Farragut's ships steamed steadily ahead and answered as they came within range. After an hour of fighting, the South's ironclad ram Tennessee passed across Monongahela's bow and struck Kennebec's bow; glanced off; and fired into the gunboat's berth deck as she pulled away, wounding four members of Kennebec's crew but doing little damage to the ship. Kennebec then cast off from Monongahela and steamed up the bay. By mid-morning all major Confederate opposition afloat had been destroyed or captured; and the rest of the day was spent rounding up Southern merchant ships. Kennebec chased several and captured schooner Corina. On 8 August Fort Gaines surrendered; and Kennebec turned her attention to shelling Fort Morgan until that valiantly-defended southern stronghold surrendered on the 23d. After repairs at Pensacola, Florida, Kennebec sailed for the Texas coast 10 March 1865 and remained on blockade there until the Confederacy collapsed. Off Galveston, Texas she engaged in one of the last actions of the war. On 24 May blockade runner Denbigh, once described by Admiral Farragut as \\"too quick for us,\\" was found aground at daylight on Bird Key Spit, near Galveston. She had attempted to run into the Texas port once again under cover of darkness. She was destroyed during the day by gunfire from Cornubia and Princess Royal, and later boarding parties from Kennebec and Seminole set her aflame. Prior to the capture of Mobile Bay, Denbigh had plagued Farragut by running regularly from Mobile to Havana. Post war After the war ended, Kennebec remained off the Texas coast providing stability as Union authority was restored and keeping an eye on events in Mexico, where French intervention had violated the Monroe Doctrine. She headed eastward 6 July, stopped at Pensacola a week, and reached Hampton Roads on the 23rd. Five days later she sailed North and reached Boston 1 August. Kennebec decommissioned at Boston Navy Yard 9 August 1865 and was sold at New York 30 November 1865.

Over 40 different color morphs of this species are dispersed throughout the lake, ranging from dark green to flame red and yellow. They mostly feed on filamentous algae on the rocky shallows they inhabit. T. moorii is a maternal mouthbrooder, so eggs are fertilized and young are carried in the mouth of the female while they hatch and develop. Territorialism Both male and female adults occupy individual feeding territories. Blunthead cichlids inhabiting territories at greater depth tend to have smaller adult body sizes and larger territories compared to those in shallows. Males have larger territories than females. A female leaves her territory to pair with a male and usually visits several territories multiple times before choosing a male. After the male and female form a pair bond, the female forages in his territory up to three weeks under his protection before spawning. A female's ovaries do not fully mature until she pairs with a male and feeds from his territory. After spawning, the female leaves the male's territory to occupy a small unclaimed area for the mouthbrooding period. In contrast to the frequent movement of females, a male usually remains in his territory for months even if he is never visited by females. Interspecies interactions Often, blunthead cichlid feeding territories are adjacent to territories of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors. A male T. moorii usually courts a female conspecific, which visits his feeding territory. In Lake Tanganyika, blunthead cichlids coexist with other herbivorous cichlids P. trewavasae, P. orthognathus, P. polyodon, and T. temporalis. T. moorii, P. polyodon, and T. temporalis individuals are not aggressive towards one another, but are aggressive towards individuals of other species and conspecifics. Although their territories often overlap, individuals of the three species do not usually interact due to the dietary differences that exist. For example, P. polyodon and P. trewavasae mostly feed on unicellular algae rather than filamentous algae. Having overlapping territories with P. polyodon may benefit T. moorii individuals since P. polyodon removes silt from the rock surface as they feed. This allows T. moorii to easily scrape filamentous algae from the rocks. Having overlapping territories with P. trewavasae may benefit T. moorii individuals because both defend their territory from much larger P. orthognathus individuals. They also are able to drive them away, whereas an individual blunthead cichlid may not be able to defend territory successfully. This is an example of commensalism rather than mutualism because individuals would defend their territories regardless. Size-dependent dominance hierarchies T. moorii participates in size- dependent dominance hierarchies when defending territory from intruders. If an individual intrudes on a T. moorii territory, the interaction may be a one- sided (territory owner towards the intruder) attack, one-sided display (spread and quiver fins/tail to intimidate), mutual attack, or mutual displays. These usually occur at or near the borders of the territories. In a one-sided attack, the territory owner chases the intruder until it leaves the territory. Interactions vary depending on the relative size of the territory owner and intruder. Individuals tend to perform one-sided attacks on neighbors smaller than them and perform one-sided displays towards those larger than them. Attacks may occur inside or outside the feeding territory of the territory owner, while displays usually take place within the territory. Displays are very rare when a large difference in body size (more than 2.5 cm)exists, and more common when the difference is smaller (less than 2 cm). Mutual attacks are very likely to occur when the individuals are of similar size. Neighbors (having an adjacent territory) are more likely to respond to an attack with a display compared to a non-neighbor. In observed interactions between specifically P. orthognathus and T. moorii individuals with adjacent territories, the larger fish attacked the smaller one regardless of species, and no displays occurred. Mating and reproduction The mating system of T. moorii is serial monogamy. A male and female establish a temporary monogamous pair bond and spawn. The female mouthbroods the eggs and young with no direct assistance from the male, so after spawning, the male is free to pair bond with other females. T. moorii broods show genetic monogamy, with all eggs having been fertilized by a single male. Other cichlid species that exhibit similar social monogamy in mating, such as V. moorii, do not always show genetic monogamy due to parasitic spawning (males fertilizing eggs of a female paired to another male). Spawning occurs on a rock surface, with the female laying up to 20 eggs which are bright orange in color. Eggs are incubated for 30 to 35 days, and when the young emerge from their mother's mouth, they are advanced enough in their physical development to live like adults. Buccal feeding Buccal feeding refers to the feeding a mouthbrooding mother does to feed her young located in her buccal cavity. T. moorii females have unusually high parental investment in their offspring since they produce large eggs and buccally feed their young. Among cichlids, T. moorii has a very high egg to adult body size ratio. In the early stages of mouthbrooding, a female rarely feeds, but after the eggs hatch, she begins feeding to nourish them. The mother effectively starves herself during the mouthbrooding period, since all nourishment she takes in goes to feed the young. The yolk sacs of the eggs are depleted around the 25th day of mouthbrooding, but the offspring are not released for several more days, so in that time, all of their nourishment must come from buccal feeding. Buccal feeding is costly in terms of energy for the female since it requires more swimming. Buccal feeding does not shorten the mouthbrooding period; instead, young that are fed buccally are larger, heavier, and faster than unfed young. These benefits are very advantageous to the young since they lower their predation risk and size is usually the determining factor in conflicts over resources. Sexual selection and color morphs Two of the many variants currently included in T. moorii: \\"Kiriza\\" above and \\"Kachese\\" below. The former is part of a group informally known as T. sp. \\"Black\\" (also including \\"Bemba\\", \\"Bulu Point\\", \\"Lueba\\" and others), which may represent a separate species Since male blunthead cichlids provide no brood care or other parental investment after spawning, the operational sex ratio in a population is strongly biased towards males. A male's reproductive success varies based on how many times he can mate during his life. Females, by discriminating between males to decide a mate, strongly influence male reproductive success. Experimentally, females have been shown to share preferences for the same males when given two to choose from, meaning some males get to reproduce more often than others. T. moorii shows very great diversity in color morphs, and color morph is a typical target for mate-choice sexual selection. A female is more likely to choose a mate that has the same morph she does and this is probably what drove the proliferation and maintenance of the many color morphs. T. moorii individuals of a particular color morph are usually found in the same geographic area, so color morphs are also maintained by the relative isolation of T. moorii populations. There is a level of genetic differences between some populations, and it is possible that these (notably the so-called Tropheus sp. \\"Black\\" and Tropheus sp. \\"Mpimbwe\\") represent separate species. Sexual differences As a sexually monomorphic species, T. moorii can be quite challenging to sex. The upper lip of males is more prominent (i.e., larger) than that of females. Males' lips on average tend to be more off-white, as well, due to their constant lip-locking aggression. Furthermore, males tend to have a turned-up nose, while females tend to have a greater slope and rounded nose, making the shape of their heads ellipsoid. Males generally grow at a faster rate and display their adult colors sooner. Males' coloration is also often more bold than females' because they display when courting females. Adult males also tend to have a deeper body, whereas females appear more slim and streamlined. Feeding and habitat T. moorii is strictly herbivorous like all Tropheus species. They spend the majority of their time scraping algae from the rocks. In the wild, blunthead cichlids are found in shallow bays and in the upper reaches of the lake over rocky reefs where the water is quite illuminated, because this is where the algae and other vegetable matter grow most thickly. Consequently, they are adapted to bright light. Etymology The specific name honours the discoverer of this species, John Edmund Sharrock Moore (1870-1947).

He is best known for his work on Nextwave, Ultimate X-Men, The New Avengers, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Ultimate Spider-Man. His pencils are usually inked by Wade Von Grawbadger. Early life Stuart Immonen grew up in a Finnish Canadian family in Canada. The first comics he read as a child were Disney comics and Harvey Comics. He would later seek out superhero comics from Marvel Comics. Sporadic distribution in the 1970s and 1980s led to the development of an eclectic sense of taste in titles, as he was often only able to find a few issues available per series. A later increase in self-publishing in Toronto spurred him to pursue a career in comics following his studies at university. Career In 1988, he self-published a series titled Playground; it was his first published work. From 1990 through 1992, he drew several issues of Rock 'N' Roll Comics for Revolutionary Comics, including issues on Prince, 2 Live Crew and Public Enemy, ZZ Top, Anthrax, and more. He worked at several smaller comic book companies before being hired by DC Comics in 1993. Since then, Immonen has drawn such high-profile characters as Superman, the Hulk, and the X-Men. His work since 2004 includes stints on the titles Ultimate Fantastic Four and Ultimate X-Men with writers Warren Ellis and Brian K. Vaughan, as well as a 12-issue run pencilling Nextwave, which again paired him with Warren Ellis. Stuart Immonen has also done work for Top Cow and Image Comics. In 1993 and 1994, Immonen drew the Legion of Super-Heroes and with writers Mark Waid and Tom McGraw created a new Legion continuity, beginning with a retelling of the team's origin story starting in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #0 (Oct. 1994). In 1996, writer Karl Kesel and Immonen produced The Final Night limited series.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 274: \\"In this four-issue miniseries by writer Karl Kesel and artist Stuart Immonen, the heroes of the present united with the Legion of Super-Heroes and the New Gods in an attempt to stop a 'sun- eater'.\\" That same year, Immonen was one of the many creators who contributed to the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 275: \\" The behind-the-scenes talent on the monumental issue appropriately spanned several generations of the Man of Tomorrow's career. Written by Dan Jurgens, Karl Kesel, David Michelinie, Louise Simonson, and Roger Stern, the one-shot featured the pencils of John Byrne, Gil Kane, Stuart Immonen, Paul Ryan, Jon Bogdanove, Kieron Dwyer, Tom Grummett, Dick Giordano, Jim Mooney, Curt Swan, Nick Cardy, Al Plastino, Barry Kitson, Ron Frenz, and Dan Jurgens.\\" Immonen wrote and drew part of the Superman Red/Superman Blue one-shot which launched the storyline of the same name which ran through the various Superman titles.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 283: \\"The special written by Dan Jurgens, Stuart Immonen, Karl Kesel, and Louise Simonson, with pencils by Stuart Immonen, Ron Frenz, Tom Grummett, Paul Ryan, and Jon Bogdanove.\\" Immonen ended his ongoing involvement with the Superman franchise with the Superman: End of the Century graphic novel in 2000 but returned to the character for the Superman: Secret Identity in 2004. In 2000, Immonen was one of the founders of Gorilla Comics, a company formed with Mark Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others. Immonen and Busiek collaborated on the Shockrockets limited series and the Superstar: As Seen on TV one-shot but the company folded after a short time. In 2005, Immonen published 50 Reasons to Stop Sketching at Conventions, a series of fifty comics that detail why he no longer does sketches for fans. Besides self- publishing, Immonen also maintains a webcomic called Never as Bad as You Think which is co-authored by his wife, Kathryn. Moving Pictures - a webcomic co- authored by the Immonens - was published as a graphic novel by Top Shelf Productions in 2010. Immonen illustrated Marvel Comics' Ultimate Spider-Man from issue #111 to issue #133. He subsequently worked on The New Avengers from issue #55 to issue #64. He continued to be the series artist when The New Avengers relaunched during the \\"Heroic Age\\" storyline and was the regular artist for the first seven issues as well as issue #11. In 2011 Immonen illustrated Marvel's Fear Itself miniseries which formed the core of a company-wide crossover storyline of the same name. In November 2012 he and writer Brian Michael Bendis started the series All-New X-Men. Reception In 2010, Immonen won the Joe Shuster Award for Outstanding Artist. Doug Zawisza, reviewing the 2011 Fear Itself miniseries for Comic Book Resources, praised Immonen's art. He consistently singled out Immonen for his simple but detailed storytelling, and his ability to render varied subject matter, from Nazis to sea monsters. Zawisza called his art \\"incredible\\" and \\"gorgeous\\", and Immonen a \\"modern master\\" whose ability to convey a large amount of story in a small portion of a page Zawisza compared to that of George P√©rez. Though Zawisza was not reluctant to note the occasional error, he praised specific visuals, including Immonen and Laura Martin's depiction of Yggdrasil in issue #1, as well as numerous scenes in issue #4, such as the scenes of global chaos, the Odin-Serpent framing sequence and the shots of British Columbia, which he called \\"chilling\\". Jennifer Margret Smith, reviewing the first issue for Newsarama, while praising the entire creative team, commented, \\"but it's Immonen who really shines\\", in reference to Immonen's storytelling and skill at crowd scenes. Similar reactions was garnered among reviewers at Comics Bulletin, with Danny Djeljosevic echoing Zawisza's comments regarding Immonen's ability to effectively render different subjects, such as sleepy seaside Canadian towns from superhero battles, saying, \\"Immonen is easily the most versatile artist in comics, who will surely go down as one of the greats with his striking layouts and dynamic, varied panel to panel storytelling. Immonen reminds me of the old-school Marvel Comics artists, who were capable of delivering strong, consistent work every month with little need for fill- ins.\\" Alex Evans and Dean Stell of Weekly Comic Book Review thought the art and colors were vibrant and detailed, and Immonen the perfect choice for the series, though Stell thought it looked a bit rushed in issue #6, and not up to Immonen's usual standards in issue #7.

It offers a national and international curriculum for pupils aged 2 to 18 years old. Graduates obtain the national Bilingual Baccalaureate and may optionally take the IGCSE, AICE, AS and A levels of the Cambridge International Examinations. The school draws its pupils from a wide area of Buenos Aires, but the majority come from within the districts of Belgrano, N√∫√±ez and Palermo. All pupils in primary, middle and senior schools belong to a house, North, South, East or West, through which internal competitions are organized. The school has over one hundred teachers and support staff from Argentina and abroad. Pupils are of all religious beliefs, however the school has a Catholic orientation. Pupils can prepare for First Communion and Confirmation and may attend monthly masses. Participation in all religious activities is optional.  History  The school was founded on 22 February 1912 by English teacher John Ernest Green and began its first year with only 12 students. Over the years, it has grown into a school of more than 1000 students from kindergarten to senior school.  Academics = Kindergarten  The implementation of an early English immersion programme from the age of two, led by fully bilingual teachers, is designed to develop bilingualism, social skills, creativity and self-esteem. The kindergarten has the official supervision of the Ministry of Education.  Primary  It is divided in six years, labelled P1 to P6. Students follow a mixed national-bilingual syllabus and the Cambridge International Primary Programme (CIPP) in English, science and mathematics. At the end of P6 a theatre play is prepared.  Middle and senior school  Middle school offers a debate club, a creative writing and arts workshop, a choir, the project ' (Young Negotiators) implemented under the supervision of ', and other extracurricular activities. A psychological advisor is also present from this stage until graduation. The preparation for the Cambridge International Examinations starts during this period.  Games and sports  There are teams in association football, field hockey, rugby union and volleyball that participate in matches against other schools. Senior teams have toured Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Chile. In the latter part of the school year there are athletics tournaments, including an interhouse competition.  Facilities  Each section has its own building, entrance and playground. Shared facilities include rooms for music, art, computer studies and drama, a dining room, a library, a gym, laboratories, an auditorium, a fully equipped music academy and a first aid centre. The twenty- hectare sports fields are located in El Talar, with seven rugby union and mini-rugby fields, seven field hockey and mini-hockey fields, six volleyball courts, a spacious open air gym, and a snack bar. The school buildings form the greater part of one whole square between the streets of Juramento, Zapiola, Mendoza and Conesa and all sections are connected from one playground to another.  Alumni  Belgrano Day School has on record more than two thousand graduates since its foundation in 1912. Children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of Old Facrecteans are among its pupils. Old Facrecteans prolong their link with the school through the Old Facrectean Association (OFA), take part in activities such as the BDS Club or the Old Facrectean Choir, and keep alive the Old Facrectean Newsletter that is electronically distributed twice a year. The recently published book Belgrano Day School Centennial / Centenario has mainly been written by Old Facrecteans.

Construction of the line started in 1897 and it opened in 1901. Never more than a purely local line, it closed to passengers in 1931, and completely in 1963.  History = Construction  The first attempt to build a railway line in this part of North Somerset took place in 1882, when an Act was obtained (on 18 August) incorporating the Radstock, Wrington & Congresbury Junction Railway, which was to run from Farrington Gurney on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway to Congresbury through Wrington. However sufficient capital could not be raised, and the company was dissolved in 1886. The Light Railways Act of 1896 was passed with the intention of enabling low-cost local railways to be built, and a line from Blagdon to Congresbury was promoted. At this time the Bristol Waterworks Company were building a reservoir at Blagdon,Parliamentary approval had been obtained in 1888 and work started in 1891; the reservoir started to fill in 1899 and was ready in 1903. Four compound beam engines were responsible for the pumping until April 1949 when they were replaced with electric pumps. Source= Maggs. and they supported the scheme. The Great Western Railway (GWR) agreed to finance the scheme and to manage the actual construction. In 1896, an application was made for a Light Railway Order; there was to be with a short branch to Blagdon Waterworks. A statutory enquiry was held on 20 May 1897.Colin G Maggs, Wrington Vale Light Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2004, A public inquiry was held on 20 May 1897; the line was supported by Bristol Waterworks Company. The Order was confirmed on 18 March 1898, and the Great Western Railway were authorised to finance, construct and work the line. Lt Col Yorke inspected the line on 28 November 1901, and as he found it satisfactory, the line opened to traffic on 4 December 1901. It was 6 miles 41 chains (10.5 km) long and there were stations at Wrington, Langford, Burrington and Blagdon.Derek Phillips, Steaming Through the Cheddar Valley, Oxford Publishing Co., Hersham, 2001, E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1932 Gradients were severe: leaving Blagdon the line fell at 1 in 75 and then rose at the same gradient, followed by a further downward gradient of 1 in 75. There was then a local summit at Burrington, falling from Langford at 1 in 50. From Wrington to Congresbury the line was broadly level, although with short sections rising at 1 in 70 and falling at 1 in 60. At Blagdon there was a spur siding diverging to the right on the approach, serving the Yeo Pumping Station.  Traffic  The railway's primary purpose was to bring construction materials for the building of the Blagdon Lake reservoir. Construction of the line overran cost and time forecasts. It was constructed and owned by the Great Western Railway. The GWR used it to trial various innovative schemes to reduce the cost of lightly used passenger services, such as the push-pull system, where driver's controls are provided in a trailer coach, enabling the locomotive to propel its train, eliminating the need for the engine to run round at the end of a run, and so cutting costs. The motor trolley system of maintenance was also adopted. The GWR 101 Class experimental oil-fired locomotive of 1901 was also designed for use on this line, but issues with the technology prevented it coming into service. Milk traffic was a considerable source of business on the line. Initially passenger trains generally ran from Yatton, the junction for the main line between Bristol and Exeter, and traversed 1.8 miles of the Cheddar Valley Line, that had opened in 1869. The junction for the light railway was at Congresbury, where a second platform and much extended track and signalling were provided. When the line first opened in 1901, there were four trips a day each way between Blagdon and Yatton; one trip each way was a mixed passenger and goods service. The first train out of Blagdon in the morning went only as far as Congresbury, and returned to Blagdon from there. Other trains ran through from or to Yatton. In 1910, there were five trains a day in each direction on weekdays only. Until 1915, there was a late trip on Saturdays from Blagdon to Yatton and return. With light loadings, the service was reduced to three trains a day each way in 1919, but the fourth trip was re-instated in 1921. Railmotors were considered at this time in an effort to match operating costs to income, but the gradients on the line prevented railmotors from operating successfully, and they were not used. In 1926, the service was increased again to five trips a day, to respond to competition from the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company's buses. However, this was not successful, and the service returned to the original four trips a day in 1927, until closure to passenger traffic from 14 September 1931.\\"Railway Magazine\\", November 1959 In 1926 also the General Strike took place. Nestl√© were managing milk flows from the area at the time, and arranged road lorry collections for the milk traffic. When the strike ended, much of this business stayed on road. Freight service continued along the length of the line until 1 November 1950, when the section between Wrington and Blagdon was closed fully. Coal traffic continued to Wrington until 6 June 1963, and the line closed completely on 10 June 1963; Congresbury itself retained passenger services until later in 1963, when it closed with the rest of the Yatton to Witham line.  Since closure  After trains were withdrawn the track was lifted and station buildings either demolished or left unoccupied. The only buildings on the line to have survived until the present day are at Blagdon station, which is now part of a private residence, and the stationmaster's house at Burrington, although it has been much extended. The Strawberry Line Association and Sustrans have aspirations for a cycle route on the trackbed. North Somerset council has marked the former railway as a future key cycle route in the local plan. The cycle route would connect with the Strawberry Line railway walk at Congresbury and a future route to Clevedon at Yatton station. Much of the planned route between Blagdon and Wrington is in private ownership which presents an obstacle for the route as, apart from the technical issue of who owns which bit of land, there‚Äôs a shortage of public money to buy real estate. Bristol Airport Rail Link In 2016, the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership produced a report outlining the possibility of using the old trackbed of the railway for the proposed Bristol Airport Rail Link.

Servi√ßo Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial (SENAI), Portuguese language for National Service for Industrial Training is a network of not-for-profit secondary level professional schools established and maintained by the Brazilian Confederation of Industry (a patronal syndicate). SENAI is one of the most important institutions in the country providing formal training for specialized workers for the industry, in the areas of chemistry, mechanics, construction, etc. SENAI has 744 operational units in all states of the Union, which offer more than 1,800 courses. SENAI is part of an integrated social action system which was founded by industry and political leaders in the 1950s, under the leadership of Euvaldo Lodi, which includes SESI (Social Service for Industry), and the Instituto Euvaldo Lodi. Social Services for Industry The Brazilian Social Services for Industry (Servi√ßo Social da Ind√∫stria (SESI) in Portuguese) is a private not-for-profit institution that operates throughout the country. It was set up in July 1946 with the aim of promoting social welfare, cultural development and improving the lives of workers and their families and the communities they live in. Role The roles of SESI and the National Industrial Apprenticeships Association(SENAI) were set out in Acts 4.048, of 22 January 1942, 4.936, of 7 November 1942, 6.246, of 5 February 1944 and 9.403, of 25 June 1946. According to these bills, the roles referred to are owed by industrial establishments classified as such by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI),along the lines that they are required to pay a monthly contribution for the funding of social work among industrial workers and their dependents for the setting up and maintenance of training schools. Regional Departments SESI maintains a presence in every state in Brazil and in the Federal District of Bras√≠lia through a chain of regional departments, each of which has jurisdiction and technical, financial and administrative autonomy. Its function is the delivery of social services in the areas of health, education, leisure, culture, food and the promotion of citizenship, having in mind improvements in quality of life among industrial workers and their families. Besides providing services in their activity centres and operational units, the regional departments develops operations within industry and in harmony with the needs and expectations of the workers. Various projects also benefit the community through partnerships and agreements with international and national governmental and private institutions.

She was named for the Ottawa chief, Pontiac. Service history Pontiac was begun for the Navy in 1862 by Hillman & Streaker and Neafie, Levy & Company, was delivered to the Navy at Philadelphia Navy Yard 7 July 1864, and commissioned the same day, Lieutenant Commander John Henry Russell in command. The new gunboat joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Port Royal, South Carolina, 12 August, and proceeded to blockade station off Charleston, South Carolina. On 1 September, Lt. Comdr. Stephen B. Luce relieved Russell in command. Pontiac engaged Southern guns at Battery Marshall, Sullivan's Island 7 November. One shell exploded in the steamer's forecastle hitting six men and wounding six others. On 13 January 1865, she steamed to Savannah, Georgia, thence some up the Savannah River to protect General William Tecumseh Sherman's left wing as his troops crossed the river at Sister's Ferry, Georgia, beginning their march north which soon caused Charleston to fall. Luce later credited his meeting with General Sherman as the beginning of his thinking which eventually resulted in the founding of the Naval War College. He said: \\"After hearing General Sherman's clear exposition of the military situation, the scales seemed to fall from my eyes....It dawned on me that there were certain fundamental principles underlying military operations,...principles of general application whether the operations were on land or at sea.\\" On 1 March, Pontiac captured steamer Amazon, a former Confederate ironclad laden with cotton. After the war, Pontiac was decommissioned at New York Navy Yard 21 June 1865 and she was sold on 15 October 1867 to John Roach.

Named after the animal Zebra, it was the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Zebra was laid down 18 March 1943 as Liberty ship SS Matthew Lyon (MCE hull 535) by Permanente Metals Corporation, Richmond No. 1 Yard, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; launched on 11 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Harry H. Feldhahn; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 26 April 1943. Service history=As SS Matthew Lyon, 1943 Operated for the WSA by a civilian contractor, Dichmann Wright & Pugh, the ship plied the waters of the Pacific during the summer of 1943. On 12 August, while voyaging to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, she received severe damage as the result of a torpedo fired by . The ship reached port under her own power with one of her forty-one merchant sailors and eighteen man Naval Armed Guard injured. At Espiritu Santo the ship languished in Segond Channel for several weeks, apparently headed for scrapping. Commissioned as Zebra Late in September, a naval officer recognized her potential for emergency service as a net cargo ship; and, on 1 October 1943, she was acquired under bareboat agreement from WSA and placed in service as Zebra (IX-107). Her subsequent success in that role prompted her complete conversion to a net cargo ship and her total rehabilitation to operable status. On 15 February 1944, the ship was redesignated AKN-5, and Zebra was placed in commission on 27 February 1944, while in drydock at Espiritu Santo, Lt. Comdr. Robert D. Abernethy, USNR, in command. Salvaging net gear, 1944 During the first three months of her commissioned service, Zebra remained at Espiritu Santo completing her partial conversion to a net cargo ship. She began her first mission on 1 June, when she started loading a cargo of reclaimed net material and put to sea on 8 June, bound for New Caledonia. The ship arrived in Noum√©a on 11 June, unloaded her net material, and took on a general cargo destined for the Fiji Islands. She departed Noum√©a on 19 June, arrived at Suva three days later, unloaded, and began taking on reclaimed net material. On 27 June, she moved to the other side of the island where she began loading material salvaged from the Nandi net installations. The ship completed loading on 5 July and headed back to New Caledonia that same day. Zebra entered Noum√©a on 8 July and discharged her load of salvaged net gear. Following 10 days at Noum√©a, the net cargo ship embarked upon a circuit of various South Pacific islands to collect nets and equipment salvaged from the harbor defense installations. Through the remainder of the summer, the ship visited Tongatapu; Bora Bora; Tutuila and Upolu, Samoa; and Funafuti. At each island, she stopped long enough to unload part of the general cargo she had taken on at Noum√©a and pick up each installation's salvaged net gear. She departed her last port of call on that voyage, Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, on 23 August and returned to Noum√©a five days later. Palau Islands Zebra remained at Noum√©a until 15 September. On that day, she embarked upon a voyage which took her closer to war and which brought her first actual net-laying mission. The ship arrived in Eniwetok lagoon on 24 September and remained there until 3 October when she continued on toward the Western Carolines. Reaching Ulithi Atoll on 8 October, the net cargo ship immediately began installing net gear around the anchorage with two of her sister ships, and . They completed their mission by 10 November, and Zebra loaded the unused net material for transportation to the Palaus. She departed Ulithi that same day and entered Barnum Bay near Peleliu two days later. While the fighting on Peleliu continued, the net cargo ship assembled a net installation for the protection of a wharf about to be constructed at the island. She concluded that portion of her mission on 14 November and headed north in company with two net tenders to the anchorage at Kossol Roads. There, she spent 11 days assembling over two miles of net and supporting equipment. At the conclusion of that assignment, Zebra received orders to Pearl Harbor. She departed the Palaus on 25 November, stopped at Eniwetok briefly on 4 December, and arrived in Hawaii on 15 December. At Pearl Harbor, she underwent 20 days of repairs and modifications before loading net gear in preparation for her next mission. Iwo Jima, 1945 She remained at Pearl Harbor through the end of January 1945 awaiting sailing orders. Finally, the ship got underway on 5 February, bound for Iwo Jima. She stopped at Eniwetok between 16 February and 21 February and then continued her voyage. Two days out of Eniwetok, Zebras convoy received orders changing its destination from Iwo Jima to Saipan in the Marianas. Zebra, two net tenders, and a destroyer, however, received instructions to continue on to their original destination as a result of battle damage to her sister ship . The little task unit arrived off Iwo Jima on 28 February, and Zebra immediately began double duty, laying nets and serving as flagship for all minecraft in the vicinity. She stayed at Iwo Jima for 42 days, laying nets in spite of adverse weather, heavy seas, and fire from the doomed but stubborn enemy garrison. She also superintended the laying of ship moorings and performed several salvage jobs including pulling and off the Iwo Jima beach. California Zebra concluded her tour of duty at Iwo Jima on 11 April and shaped a course back to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 18 April. Continuing east, the ship entered Pearl Harbor again on 28 April for a four-day layover before resuming her voyage to the West Coast. On 11 May, the net cargo ship arrived in San Francisco, California, to complete her conversion to a net cargo ship. She entered the Oakland yard of the Moore Dry Dock Company on 14 May. Work continued until mid-July when she received orders to participate in net laying experiments at Tiburon, California. Though speeded up, her conversion had not been completed when she slipped her moorings on 25 July to join the operations up the bay at Tiburon. That duty lasted until 3 August at which time the ship returned to Moore Drydock Co. to complete the remaining conversion work. On 26 August, she made her post- conversion, full power trial run and, soon thereafter, received orders assigning her to the Administrative Command, Minecraft, located at Pearl Harbor. Post-war activities, 1945-1946 The ship stood out of San Francisco Bay on 31 August and arrived in Pearl Harbor on 8 September. She remained in Hawaii only 12 days. On 20 September, she headed back to the western Pacific to collect salvaged net equipment. Carrying a small cargo of mine gear for the Marshall Islands command, she steamed to Kwajalein where she arrived on 30 September and unloaded her cargo before proceeding on to Iwo Jima. Zebra arrived at the latter island on 9 October, loaded net gear, and then headed for the Marianas on 29 October. The ship made port at Saipan on 1 November, unloaded the salvaged net equipment at the Saipan stockpile, and began loading passengers and equipment for return to the United States. She departed Saipan on 15 November and stopped at Guam on 16 November. There, she unloaded some mine-sweeping gear before resuming the voyage on 29 November. Steaming by way of Pearl Harbor, theZebra arrived at Pear Harbor on 11 December, and departed on 13 December for the Canal Zone, arriving there on 31 December 1945. Routed on to Norfolk, Virginia, she reported to the Commandant, 5th Naval District, on 8 January 1946. Zebra was decommissioned at Norfolk on 21 January 1946 and simultaneously returned to the War Shipping Administration. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 7 February 1946. Zebra was awarded one battle star for service during World War II. Lay up On 21 January 1946 the ship was laid up at Lee Hall, Virginia and, again Matthew Lyon, was under the reserve fleet repair program in the James River fleet during the mid 1950s, then awarded to Union Minerals & Alloys Corporation for scrapping on 28 March 1972 for $35,621.54.

The Latin War broke out in the year that Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus and Publius Decius Mus were consuls and ended in the year that Lucius Furius Camillus and Gaius Maenius were consuls. When converted to the western calendar using the traditional Varronian chronology, those years become 340 and 338 BC. However, modern historians have shown that the Varronian chronology dates the Latin War four years too early because of inclusion of unhistorical \\"dictator years\\". Despite that known inaccuracy, the Varronian chronology remains in use by convention also in academic literature and so is also the chronology used in this article. Forsythe(2005), pp. 369-370 was a conflict between the Roman Republic and its neighbors, the Latin peoples of ancient Italy. It ended in the dissolution of the Latin League and incorporation of its territory into the Roman sphere of influence, with the Latins gaining partial rights and varying levels of citizenship. Sources The most comprehensive source on the Latin War is the Roman historian Livy (59 BC ‚Äì AD 17), who narrates the war in the eighth book of his history of Rome, Ab Urbe Condita. Two other substantial narratives have also survived, a fragment from the Roman Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BC‚Äìafter 7 BC), a Greek contemporary of Livy, and a summary by the 12th century Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras based on the Roman history of Cassius Dio (AD 150 ‚Äì 235).Oakley (1998), pp. 425-426 Modern historians consider the ancient accounts of the Latin War to be a mixture of fact and fiction. All the surviving authors lived long after the Latin War and relied on the works of earlier writers. Several of the historians used by Livy experienced the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC) between Rome and its Italian allies and seem to have interpreted the Latin War in the terms of that war, which has introduced anachronistic elements into the historical record.Oakley (1998), p. 410 Background The Latins did not have any central government, but were divided into a number of self-governing towns and cities with a shared language, culture and some legal and religious institutions.Forsythe (2005), p. 184 In the 5th century BC, these city-states had formed a mutual military alliance, the foedus Cassianum, primarily to resist the raids and invasions of two neighbouring peoples, the Aequi and the Volsci.Forsythe (2005), pp. 186-188 As the largest Latin city, Rome naturally enjoyed a leading position in this alliance.Forsythe (2005), p. 187 By the early 4th century BC, the Latins were no longer threatened by invasions, but instead feared an increasingly powerful Rome. Several wars between Rome and other Latins, now often found fighting beside their former enemies the Volsci, are recorded for the first half of the 4th century.Cornell (1995), pp. 322-323 In the end, the Latins and the Volsci could not prevent Rome from establishing control over the ager Pomptinus (the territory of the Pomptine Marshes and the Monti Lepini) and in 381 annexing the Latin town of Tusculum.Cornell (1995), p. 322; Forsythe (2005), p. 258 The threat of Gallic invasion seems to have convinced at least some Latin towns to resume their treaty with Rome in 358,Oakley (1998), p. 5; Forsythe (2005), p. 258 but these did not include Tibur and Praeneste, Rome's chief opponents among the Latins, who only made peace with Rome in 354 after a lengthy war.Oakley (1998), pp. 5-6; Forsythe (2005), p. 258 During the 340s, Roman-Latin relations seem to have worsened again.Oakley (1998), pp. 13-15 Livy records that, in 349, when again faced with a Gallic invasion, the Latins refused to supply their share of troops,Livy, vii.25.5-6 and in 343 actually planned to attack Rome, but following news of Roman victories against the Samnites instead decided to attack the Paeligni.Livy, vii.38.1 The Samnites were a tribal federation living in the central Apennines. In 354, they had formed a treaty of friendship with Rome,Diodorus, xvi.45.8Livy, vii.19.3‚Äì4. probably fixing the river Liris as the border between their respective spheres of influence,Salmon (1967), pp. 187-193 but despite this treaty, in 343 the First Samnite War broke out between Rome and the Samnites over the control of Campania. According to Livy, this war originated in Samnite attacks on a smaller tribe, the Sidicini. Unable to resist, the Sidicini appealed to the Campanians, who were led by the famously wealthy city-state of Capua, but these were also defeated and the Samnites invaded Campania. At this point the Campanians decided to surrender themselves unconditionally into the power of Rome, following which the Romans felt compelled to intervene to protect their new subjects against Samnite attacks.Livy, vii.29.3-32.1‚Äì2 Modern historians are in some dispute whether this surrender really took place or was invented to absolve Rome of treaty breaking, but generally agree that Rome formed some kind of alliance with Capua.Salmon (1967), p. 197; Cornell (1995), p. 347; Oakley (1998), pp. 286‚Äì9; Forsythe (2005), p. 287 The First Samnite War ended in 341 with a negotiated peace and renewal of the former treaty between Rome and the Samnites. Rome retained her Campanian alliance, but accepted that the Sidicini belonged to the Samnite sphere.Livy, viii.1.8-2.3Salmon (1967), p. 202; Forsythe (2005), p. 288 According to Livy, once peace with Rome had been concluded, the Samnites attacked the Sidicini with the same forces they had deployed against Rome. Facing defeat, the Sidicini tried to surrender themselves to Rome, but their surrender was rejected by the senate as coming far too late. The Sidicini then turned to the Latins who had already taken up arms on their own account. The Campani joined the war as well, and led by the Latins a large army of these allied peoples invaded Samnium. Most of the damage they dealt there to the Samnites was done by raiding rather than fighting, and although the Latins got the better in their various encounters with the Samnites, they were happy to retire from enemy territory and fight no further. The Samnites sent envoys to Rome to complain and demand that if the Latins and Campani really were subject peoples of Rome, Rome should use her authority over them to prevent further attacks on Samnite territory. The Roman senate gave an ambiguous reply, being both unwilling to acknowledge that they could no longer control the Latins and afraid of alienating them further by ordering them to stop their attacks on the Samnites. The Campani had surrendered to Rome and must obey her will, however there was nothing in Rome's treaty with the Latins preventing them from going to war against whomever they wanted.Livy, viii.2.4-13 The result of this reply was to completely turn the Campani against Rome and encourage the Latins to take action. In the guise of preparing a Samnite war, the Latins plotted in secret with the Campani for war against Rome. However, news of their plans got out, and at Rome the sitting consuls for 341 were ordered to leave office before the expiry of their term, so that the new consuls could enter office early in preparation for the major war that was brewing. The consuls elected for 340 were Titus Manlius Torquatus, for the third time, and Publius Decius Mus.Livy, viii.3.1-5 The annually elected consuls were the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and responsible for commanding Rome's armies in times of war. Modern historians have not put much credence in these events supposed to have taken place following the end of the First Samnite War, believing them to be largely invented. There are several similarities with the events supposed to have started the Samnite War, the Samnites are once again at war with the Sidicini and a surrender offer is made to Rome, and this duplication is unlikely to be historical.Oakley (1998), p. 394; Forsythe (2005), p. 289 This time the surrender is refused, showing the moral superiority of the Roman senate.Oakley (1998), p. 394 The supposed secret plotting between the Latins and Campani are also likely to be inventions, inspired by similar secret talks held by the Italians before the outbreak of the Social War, news of which were also leaked to the Romans.Forsythe (2005), p. 289 Outbreak=Ancient account Livy writes that when the Romans learnt of the Latins' secret talks with the Campanians they sent for the ten leading men among the Latins to come to Rome and receive instructions, pretending to be concerned for the Samnites. At this time, the Latins had two praetors, Lucius Annius of Setia and L. Numisius of Circeii, both colonies. Through their efforts, the colonies of Signia and Velitrae and also the Volsci were convinced to take up arms against Rome.Livy, viii.3.8-9 As there could be no doubt what the real reasons for summoning these men to Rome were, the Latins held a council meeting to decide what their leaders should reply to the questions they expected the Romans to ask.Livy, viii.3.10 At the meeting, Annius complained that Rome was treating the Latins as subjects rather than allies and proposed that the Latins should demand that henceforth one consul and half the senate should be elected from among the Latins, and so give Latins and Romans an equal share in the government. This measure was adopted and Annius was appointed spokesman for the Latins.Livy, viii.4.1-12 The Roman senate received the Latin delegation in an audience in the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, where they advised the Latins not to make war on the Samnites with whom the Romans had a treaty. In a speech to the senate, Annius presented the demands of the Latins to which he received a furious reply from the consul, T. Manlius Torquatus.Livy, viii.5.1-12 Livy writes that, according to tradition, while the senators were invoking the gods as guardians of their treaties with the Latins, Annius was heard dismissing the divine power of the Roman Jupiter. However, when storming out of the temple, Annius slipped on the stairs and was knocked unconscious in the fall, or, according to some, killed. When Torquatus saw Annius lying there, he vowed to strike down the armies of the Latins just as the gods had struck the Latin envoy. This speech was wildly cheered by the people of Rome and war was declared.Livy, viii.6.1-7 Modern view Modern historians consider Livy's account of the outbreak of the Latin War unhistorical fiction, filled with invented speeches written, as was common practice among ancient historians, so as to present the arguments of both sides.Oakley (1998), p. 409 There is a general resemblance between the rhetoric of the speeches Livy has written for L. Annius and the complaints and demands made by Rome's Italian allies in the years before the Social War.Oakley (1998), p. 409 Several of the writers Livy is known to have used for Roman history during the 4th century lived through the Social War, and it would have been natural for them to see parallels between the Latin War and contemporary events.Oakley (1998), p. 410; Forsythe (2005), p. 289 Like the Roman senate rejected an embassy from the Italian insurgents in 90 BC, so the Latin embassy of 340 BC is also rejected.Oakley (1998), p. 409 Later, in his account of the Second Punic War, Livy mentions that some of his sources claimed that the Capuans, after the Battle of Cannae, had similarly sent an embassy and demanded to receive an equal share in the government of the Roman Republic. He, however, rejected this as a duplication of the demands made by the Latins at the outbreak of the Latin War. Modern historians do not believe that the Latins made any demand for a consul and half the senate in 340. It is possible that Capua really did so in 216, but most likely Livy was correct to consider this a duplicate of accounts of the Latin War.Oakley (1998), pp. 410-411 Instead, they have proposed that historically these were political demands made by the Italians at the outbreak of the Social War.Oakley (1998), p. 411; Salmon (1967), p 207 However, no ancient attestations of such demands exist today.Oakley p. 410 By the early 1st century BC, Rome had risen to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean and Roman citizenship was a highly desired favour. However, such sentiments are considered anachronistic for the 4th century. In 340, Rome was still only a local power in Latium, but whose aggressiveness and recent expansion into Campania was an increasing threat to the independence of the smaller Latin communities who risked becoming entirely surrounded by Roman territory.Oakley (1998), p. 409; Forsythe (2005), p. 289 Rather than being caused by the Roman refusal to share their government with the other Latins, the Latin War was a final bid by the Latins to preserve their own independence. In this endeavour they were joined by the Volsci, who were in much the same situation as the Latins, and the Campani, Sidicini and Aurunci, three peoples who all risked being squeezed between the growing powers of Central Italy, Rome and the Samnites.Salmon (1967), p 207 The South-Eastern campaign 340 BC The Latins entered Samnium; the Roman-Samnite army moved to the Fucine Lake, then, avoiding Latium, entered the Campanian territory and attacked the Latins and Campanians near Mount Vesuvius. In the Battle of Vesuvius, the Romans, under consuls Decius Mus and T. Manlius Torquatus Imperiosus, defeated the Latins. According to Roman sources, Manlius reinstated army discipline by executing his son for his unintentional disobedience, while Decius sacrificed his own life to the gods for the Roman victory. Roman subjugation of the Latins and the Volsci 339 - 338 BC One year later, Manlius defeated the Latins at the Battle of Trifanum. The Latins were finally defeated in 338 BC at the Battle of Antium on the river Astura, where Gaius Maenius commanded the Roman naval forces which defeated the combined Latin armies of Antium, Lanuvium, Aricia and Velitrae.Livy viii. 13. Political aftermath The Latins, forced to leave Campania, moved to Latium, where they put up a long yet unsuccessful resistance against the Roman forces. The defeated Latin peoples were obliged to recognize Roman suzerainty. Some of the Latin towns were Romanized, others became partially Roman, adopting Roman magistratures, while some others became Roman colonies.

The seventh named storm of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season, Greta formed from a tropical wave just northwest of Trinidad on September 13, and despite being in a climatologically unfavorable area, gradually intensified while moving west-northwestward. On September 16, it became a hurricane south of Jamaica. Two days later, the well-defined eye approached northeastern Honduras but veered to the northwest. After reaching peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) that day, Greta weakened while paralleling the northern Honduras coast just offshore. On September 19, it made landfall on Belize near Dangriga and quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing Guatemala and southeastern Mexico. After entering the eastern Pacific, the system re-intensified into a hurricane and was renamed Olivia, which weakened before dissipating over Chiapas on September 23\\\\. Taking a similar path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200 homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roat√°n along the offshore Bay Islands, and there was one death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125 houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25 million (1978 USD), and there were four deaths. Meteorological history A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September 7\\\\. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September 13, the wave moved through the Windward Islands, producing wind gusts of 50 mph (85 km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75 mi (120 km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 14 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the north of the Netherlands Antilles. After becoming a tropical storm, Greta intensified slowly due to a strong trough to the northwest, and with the South American coastline located to the south, the southerly inflow was disrupted. With a ridge to the north along the 30th parallel, the storm moved quickly west- northwestward across the Caribbean. On September 16, Greta intensified into a hurricane about south of Jamaica. Shortly thereafter, the trough to the northwest weakened, which had been preventing the storm's intensification. An increasingly well-defined eye developed while approaching the coast of Honduras as the barometric pressure quickly dropped. Early on September 18, the eyewall passed just offshore Cabo Gracias a Dios, the sparsely populated border between Honduras and Nicaragua The NHC described the eye as having \\"literally ricocheted off of the protruding northeast coast of Honduras\\", thus sparing much of the country from the strongest winds. At 0710 UTC on September 18, the Hurricane hunters observed a minimum pressure of just off the northern Honduras coast, which was the basis for the estimated peak intensity of 130 mph (215 km/h). This made it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Satellite image of Hurricane Olivia in the eastern Pacific Despite the proximity to land, Greta initially maintained a well-defined structure. The hurricane continued generally west-northwestward due to the ridge to the north, and initially was expected to enter the Bay of Campeche. After passing through the Bay Islands off northern Honduras, Greta weakened slightly while approaching Belize, and made landfall near Dangriga at 0000 UTC on September 19, with winds of about 110 mph (175 km/h). The calm of the eye was reported for three to five minutes there. Rapidly weakening over land, the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over Guatemala within 12 hours of landfall. A large high pressure area from the Carolinas to the central Gulf of Mexico turned Greta southwestward toward the eastern Pacific Ocean. At 0000 UTC on September 20, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while Greta was 30 mi (50 km) from the coast. Soon after, the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and re-intensified. At 0600 UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named Olivia by the EPHC. After initially moving to the north, Olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop. Based on observations from nearby ships and radar, it is estimated Olivia attained hurricane status early on September 22\\\\. While tracking towards the Mexican coastline, the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 1900 and 2000 UTC, Olivia made landfall about 60 mi (95 km) east of Salina Cruz. Early on September 23, Olivia dissipated over the Mexican state of Chiapas. Hurricane Greta‚ÄìOlivia was a rare crossover storm from the Atlantic to the Pacific, one of ten named storms to maintain tropical cyclone status during the crossing. Impact Image of Hurricane Greta north of Honduras Early in its duration, Greta produced heavy rainfall in the Netherlands Antilles, but the strongest winds remained north of the island. Late on September 17 when Greta's eye was just offshore Honduras, the country's government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern coastline. Around the same time, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the eastern Yucat√°n peninsula, and on September 18 a hurricane warning was issued for the Belize and Guatemala coastlines. These advanced warnings helped reduce fatalities. In Puerto Castilla, Honduras, about 2,000 people were evacuated in advance of the storm. The Honduran government put its military, police, and Red Cross on standby in advance of the storm, due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Fifi in 1974. However, unlike Fifi, which caused deadly floods in the region four years prior and took a similar track, Greta did not cause as significant river flooding in Honduras. Across much of Greta's track in Central America, the hurricane dropped locally heavy rainfall. When Greta passed just offshore northeastern Honduras, it produced sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) in Puerto Lempira, with gusts to 115 mph (185 km/h). Winds along the northern Honduras coast were diminished due to the eyewall passing to the north. In Honduras, meteorologists estimated that upwards of of rain fell in mountainous regions. Many villages were isolated and communication with them was severely hampered. In Puerto Lempira, roughly 1,500 of the town's 7,000 residents sought refuge in five large structures during the storm. In twelve communities along the coastline, military officials reported that 656 homes were destroyed, of which 278 were in Punta Potuca. In the offshore Bay Islands, the hurricane destroyed 26 houses on Guanaja, where many roofs were lost and several boats were destroyed. On nearby Roat√°n, about 75% of the houses lost their roofs after experiencing wind gusts of 80 mph (130 km/h). There was one death in Honduras, and nationwide, the hurricane damaged about 1,200 homes, washed out roads and bridges, and wrecked coconut and rice crops. At Greta's final landfall in Belize, the highest sustained winds were 55 mph (89 km/h) in Belize City, with gusts to at Dangriga near the landfall location. On the offshore Ambergris Caye, winds reached , and there was heavy rainfall. On Half Moon Caye, the hurricane damaged the base of a lighthouse and knocked over several coconut trees. Along the Belize Barrier Reef, the hurricane downed palm trees and produced high waves, with significant wave heights of about 33 ft (10 m) along Carrie Bow Caye. On the mainland, storm tides in Dangriga were above normal, which did not cause much flooding. The strong winds destroyed 50 houses there and unroofed a further 75, including damage to the hospital. There were also disruptions to power and water service. About 90% of the grapefruit crop was destroyed, and 50% of the orange crop was lost. Tides were above normal in Belize City, which caused flooding in conjunction with swollen rivers. The United States embassy was flooded with about one foot of mud. There was little damage in the city, although a tornado in Belize City that damaged four houses and flipped over a truck. During the storm, the Belize International Airport was closed. Farther inland, strong winds caused heavy damage at Guanacaste National Park. Damage throughout Belize was estimated at $25 million (1978 USD), and there were four deaths. Three of the deaths were on offshore islands in areas without radios, and the other was due to electrocution. Aftermath Following the storm damage in Honduras, the country requested help from the United States. The Tactical Air Command had sent two squadrons to Central America in the middle of 1978, and in response to the request from Honduras, two aircraft delivered over of cots, water, and generators; the units also deployed a 13-person crew who specialized in disaster relief. The aid was distributed by the Military of Honduras. In late October 1978, the United Methodist Church sent books and other supplies via aircraft to Belize, after a youth group rode out the storm there and desired to help residents. Despite the hurricane damage, the economy of Belize continued to grow after Greta struck, including an increase in banana production.

The extension was finalized in December 2005 and published as ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005/Amd 2:2006 in 2006. The latest description of MPEG-4 ALS was published as subpart 11 of the MPEG-4 Audio standard (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009) (4th edition) in August 2009. MPEG-4 ALS combines together a short-term predictor and a long term predictor. The short-term predictor is similar to FLAC in its operation - it is a quantized LPC predictor with a losslessly coded residual using Golomb Rice Coding or Block Gilbert Moore Coding (BGMC). The long term predictor is modeled by 5 long-term weighted residues, each with its own lag (delay). The lag can be hundreds of samples. This predictor improves the compression for sounds with rich harmonics (containing multiples of a single fundamental frequency, locked in phase) present in many musical instruments and human voice.  Features  * Support for PCM resolutions of up to 32-bit * Arbitrary sampling rates (tested up to 192 kHz, higher frequencies such as 384 kHz can be handled with the current specifications) * Multi-channel / multi-track support (up to 65536 channels) * Fast random access to any part of the encoded data. * Tagging * Streaming * Error correction mechanisms * Optional storage in MP4 file format * Can be multiplexed with video data using MP4 file format * An MPEG-4 Audio profile \\"ALS Simple Profile\\".  Software support  , there has not been wide acceptance of this format, possibly due to the lack of encoders and decoders available. A reference implementation of MPEG-4 ALS encoder and decoder (mp4als - e.g. mp4alsRM22rev2) can be obtained at the MPEG-4 ALS homepage and it was also published as ISO/IEC 14496-5:2001/Amd 10:2007/Cor 3:2009. There is a MPEG-4 ALS Decoder plugin for Winamp player. On November 11, 2009, the FFmpeg open source project gained an MPEG-4 ALS decoder in its development version.  History  In July 2002, the Moving Picture Experts Group issued a call for proposals of lossless audio coding procedures to be sent in before December. Seven companies submitted their proposals which were examined taking into consideration compression efficiency, complexity and flexibility. By July 2003, Lossless Predictive Audio Compression (LPAC) was selected as the first draft for the future standard. The reference model was further developed under participation of the Technical University of Berlin (TUB), RealNetworks, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT).

Scholars differ as to whether they regard Oirat as a distinct languageBirtalan 2003. Note that she is not altogether clear about that matter as she writes: \\"For the present purpose, Spoken Oirat, from which Kalmuck is excluded, may therefore be treated as a more or less uniform language.\\" (212). See also San≈æeev 1953 or a major dialect of the Mongolian language.SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005 Oirat- speaking areas are scattered across the far west of Mongolia, the northwest of People's Republic of ChinaSeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 396-398 and Russia's Caspian coast, where its major variety is Kalmyk.SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005, Bl√§sing 2003: 229 In China, it is spoken mainly in Xinjiang, but also among the Deed Mongol of Qinghai and Subei County in Gansu. In all three countries, Oirat has become variously endangered or even obsolescent as a direct result of government actions or as a consequence of social and economic policies. Its most widespread tribal dialect, which is spoken in all of these nations, is Torgut.Svantesson et al. 2005: 148 The term Oirat or more precisely, Written Oirat is sometimes also used to refer to the language of historical documents written in the Clear script.Birtalan 2003: 210-211  Dialects  In Mongolia, there are seven historical Oirat dialects, each corresponding to a different tribe:Coloo 1988: 1-6 #D√∂rbet is spoken in half of the districts (sums) of Uvs Province and in D√∂rg√∂n sum, Khovd Province #Bayat in the sums of Malchin, Khyargas, Tes and Z√º√ºngovi, Uvs #Torgut in Bulgan sum, Khovd #Altai Uriankhai in the sums of Duut and M√∂nkhkhairkhan, Khovd and in the sums of Altai, Buyant and Bulgan, Bayan-√ñlgii Province #√ñ√∂ld in Erdeneb√ºren, Khovd #Zakhchin in the sums of Mankhan, Altai, √úyench, Zereg and M√∂st, Khovd #Khoton in Tarialan, Uvs. There are some varieties that are difficult to classify. The Alasha dialect in Alxa League in Inner Mongolia originally belonged to OiratSeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 265-266 and has been classified as such by some because of its phonology. But it has been classified by others as Mongolian proper because of its morphology.SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 190-191 The Darkhad dialect in Mongolia's Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province has variously been classified as Oirat, Mongolian proper, or (less often) Buryat.See literature given in San≈æaa and Tujaa 2001: 33-34  Endangered language  Oirat is endangered in all areas where it is spoken. In Russia, the killing of a large fraction of the Kalmyk population and the destruction of their society as consequences of the Kalmyk deportations of 1943, along with the subsequent imposition among them of Russian as the sole official language have rendered the language obsolescent: it is almost exclusively the elderly who have a fluent command of Kalmyk.Bitkeeva 2007; for details see Bitkeeva 2006 In China, while Oirat is still quite widely used in its traditional ranges and there are many monolingual speakers,Bitkeeva 2007 a combination of government policies and social realities has created an environment deleterious to the use of this language: the Chinese authorities' adoption of Southern Mongolian as the normative Mongolian language,SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 179 new educational policies which have led to the virtual elimination of Mongolian schools in Xinjiang (there were just two left as of 2009), policies aiming to curtail nomadism, and the limited occupational prospects in Chinese society for graduates of Mongolian schools.Indjieva 2009: 59-65 As for Mongolia, the predominance of Khalkha Mongolian is bringing about the Khalkhaization of all other varieties of Mongolian.Coloo 1988: III-IV Script systems An oirat manuscript in \\"clear script\\" (todo bichig)Chuluunbaatar 2008: 41 Oirat has been written in two script systems: the Mongolian scripts and Cyrillic. Historically, the Clear script, which originated from the Mongolian script, was used. It uses modified letters shapes e.g. to differentiate between different rounded vowels, and it uses a small stroke on the right to indicate vowel length. It was retained longest in China where it can still be found in an occasional journal article. However in China, Buryat and Oirat are considered non-standard compared to Southern Mongolian and are therefore supposed to use the Mongolian script and Southern Mongolian grammar for writing. In practice the people use neither and resort to learning Mandarin Chinese and using h√†nz√¨ to communicate with others in China. In Kalmykia, a Cyrillic-based script system has been implemented. It is strictly phonemic, not representing epenthetic vowels, and thus doesn‚Äôt show syllabification. In Mongolia, Central Mongolian minority varieties have no status, so Oirats are supposed to use Mongolian Cyrillic which de facto only represents Khalkha Mongolian.

Wagner's disease was originally described in 1938. This disorder was frequently confused with Stickler syndrome, but lacks the systemic features and high incidence of retinal detachments. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Genetics Wagner's syndrome has for a long time been considered a synonym for Stickler's syndrome. However, since the gene that is responsible for Wagner disease (and Erosive Vitreoretinopathie) is known (2005), the confusion has ended. For Wagner disease is the Versican gene (VCAN) located at 5q14.3 is responsible. For Stickler there are 4 genes are known to cause this syndrome: COL2A1 (75% of Stickler cases), COL11A1 (also Marshall syndrome), COL11A2 (non-ocular Stickler) and COL9A1 (recessive Stickler). The gene involved helps regulate how the body makes collagen, a sort of chemical glue that holds tissues together in many parts of the body. This particular collagen gene only becomes active in the jelly-like material that fills the eyeball; in Wagner's disease this \\"vitreous\\" jelly grabs too tightly to the already weak retina and pulls it away. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on fundus examination that reveals an empty vitreous with vitreoretinal degeneration in similar picture to stickler's syndrome but with no systemic associations. Treatment Most people with the disease need laser repairs to the retina, and about 60 per cent need further surgery. History In 1938 Hans Wagner described 13 members of a Canton of Zurich family with a peculiar lesion of the vitreous and retina. Ten additional affected members were observed by Boehringer et al.. in 1960 and 5 more by Ricci in 1961. In the Netherlands Jansen in 1962 described 2 families with a total of 39 affected persons. Both families had only ocular features. Alexander and Shea in 1965 reported a family. In the last report, characteristic facies (epicanthus, broad sunken nasal bridge, receding chin) was noted. Genu valgum was present in all. In addition to typical changes in the vitreous, retinal detachment occurs in some and cataract is another complication.

Wayne King (February 16, 1901 ‚Äì July 16, 1985) was an American musician, songwriter, singer and orchestra leader with a long association with both NBC and CBS. He was sometimes referred to as the Waltz King because much of his most popular music involved waltzes; \\"The Waltz You Saved for Me\\" was his standard set closing song in live performance and on numerous radio broadcasts at the height of his career. Life and career Born Harold Wayne King in Savanna, Illinois, King was an impressive athlete in high school, and briefly played professional football with the Canton Bulldogs. He also attended Valparaiso University in Indiana for two years, but left to begin a career in music. After playing saxophone for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, he created \\"Wayne King and Orchestra\\" in 1927. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's \\"I Love You Truly\\" from its original time over to ., p. 19. From 1931 to 1940 the Wayne King Orchestra was featured on various national radio programs sponsored by Lady Esther. The orchestra disbanded during World War II, and King joined the army, advancing to the rank of major. The orchestra was reestablished in 1946. In 1948, the half-hour Wayne King Show was syndicated on radio via transcription discs. King's orchestra had a television show in Chicago from 1949 to 1952. The telecast was carried by most midwest NBC Television affiliate stations. In early 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell The Truth. He released a Christmas album on Decca Records, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, in 1963. King's orchestra played its last engagement in March 1983 at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota, Florida. Wayne was honored in his hometown of Savanna, with a sign acknowledging that he was a resident of the town. In later life he operated a black angus cattle farm and a car rental business. King died in July 1985 and his body was cremated. His wife, silent film actress, Dorothy Jones King (stage name Janis) kept his urn with her for the rest of her life following their 53 years of marriage. She died on March 10, 2010 at the age of 98.AltFilmGuide entry King had two children, Wayne King II and Penelope King Pape. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Radio category.

His surviving works include a setting of verses from Lamentations, and instrumental music for viols. Thomas Morley, in his A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) extols him as one of the greatest English composers, equal to Orlando di Lasso. He notes White's bold harmonies, and includes him in a list of seven eminent Tudor composers that includes \\"Fayrfax, Taverner, Sheppard, Whyte, Parsons and Mr Byrd.\\" Some MS partbooks now at Christ Church, Oxford dated about 1581 contain the tribute \\"Maxima musarum nostrarum gloria White' Tu peris, actemum sed tua musa manet\\" (\\"Thou, O White, greatest glory of our muses, dost perish, but thy muse endureth for ever\\").  Life  According to Arnold, the first glimpse we get of Robert White, son of an organ builder, is as a chorister, and then an adult singer in the choir of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1554 to 1562. During that time, in 1560, he received a Bachelorship of Music from Cambridge University, and in 1562 he moved the few miles to Ely, where he succeeded his father-in-law Christopher Tye as Master of the Choristers and married Christopher Tye's daughter in 1565.Denis Arnold ed., (1983) The New Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford University Press He accepted a similar post at Chester Cathedral in 1566, where he succeeded Richard Saywell and took part in the Chester Whitsuntide pageants during the years 1567 to 1569. Such was his reputation as a choir trainer that in 1570 he was appointed organist and master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey.J C Bridge 'The organists of Chester Cathedral: Part I, 1541 to 1644; Part II, 1663 to 1877'; White and his family died in a virulent outbreak of plague in the Westminster area in 1574. Although White seems to have spent much of his life working to the north of the capital, his will (dated 7 November 1574) stated that he left property of some substance in Sussex and directed that he be buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster \\"nere unto my children\\". White was buried on 11 November 1574 aged around 36. Though Robert White stood so high among mid-sixteenth century musicians, his compositions were almost utterly neglected till unearthed by Charles Burney.BURNEY, Gen. Hist. of Music (4 vols., London, 1776-89);  Music  Fortunately quite a large number of White's compositions have survived, several of which were included in the Dow Partbooks. His surviving 17 Latin motets, one Latin Magnificat, two sets of the Lamentations, and eight anthems are all sufficient to place him in the front rank of English composers of the Elizabethan age. His surviving non choral works include In nomine for viols and his hexachord fantasia for keyboard. Many of the motets are settings of the Psalms, characterized by continuous points of imitation, with the beginnings of each phrase set syllabically. His Lamentations, set for five voices, has a flavour in advance of his period, as also his motet Peccatum peccavit Jerusalem and Regina Coeli.\\"Latin Sacred Music by Robert White,\\" John Aplin, Journal of the Royal Musical Association, Volume 113, Issue 2, 1988, pages 340-344 White's works fall into two main groups: those that could have been used in Sarum services and devotions under Mary, and those (psalm-motets and Lamentations) that were probably written in Elizabeth's reign. The Sarum works comprise antiphons, hymns and a respond, all on equal-note cantus firmi, and a large-scale six-part Magnificat that, like two of Taverner's settings, has a psalm tone as the tenor of the full-choir sections. The Magnificat bears the date 1570 in the fragmentary source in the Bodleian Library, but the style makes it very much easier to take this as the year of copying than as the year of composition. For example, at Sicut locutus, a four-part section with the plainsong in the mean, mostly in longs and breves, the accompanying parts have numerous crotchet runs, which, although considerably more numerous and more hectic, give something of the same effect as the similarly scored Et incarnatus of Taverner's Gloria tibi Trinitas. But there are also traces of the repetitive techniques characteristic of White in his full-choir motets. The key point here is the exchanging of material between pairs of voices of equal range throughout a four-part or six-part texture. Tallis and Sheppard reversed a single pair of (countertenor) parts when the music for one verse of a hymn was re-used, or very occasionally when a set of entries was re- stated.Instrumental Forms in England through 1635: Keyboard Music -http://www.hoasm.org/IVM/EnglKeyGuide.html The Compline hymn Christe qui lux es et dies follows the established pattern of alternating plainchant verses with polyphonic ones that incorporate the chant, in this instance in the tenor part. Its text, an evening prayer for peaceful rest, full of imagery of light and darkness, seems to have held special appeal for White, who made four separate settings of it.Grattan-Flood, W. (1912).

It comprises five sub- districts: Eversley, Northlands Park Neighbourhood (previously known as Felmores), Chalvedon, Pitsea Mount and Burnt Mills. It is part of the new town of Basildon. During the creation of the new town of Basildon in the late 1940s and early 1950s, \\"Pitsea\\" (as well \\"Vange\\" and \\"Laindon\\") were considered as names for the new town. Because Basildon village was central to the district, the town was named \\"Basildon\\". Before the new town regeneration, Pitsea was made up of plot lands and was regarded as run down.  History  There is little known history about Pitsea but its earliest recorded name is Piceseia which was in 1086 and probably recorded as this in the Domesday Book. This however has changed over the years to many different names including: Pichesey(e), Pikeseye, Pithesey, Petchesey(e), Pisseye, Pitchesey, Pytsay, Pittessey, Pytchey, PitseyT.C.Chisendale - Transaltion of Domeday Book and finally to what it is now Pitsea. It is thought however that all the names are derived from the meaning of Pics' Island, which refers to the area now known as Pitsea Mount. Chalvedon, which is part of Pitsea has also been known under different guises. In its earliest form it was known as Chauendona meaning Calves Hill this was first recorded in 1119. Other names include: Chaluedona, Chaluedene, Calueden and Callwedone before it ended up being Chalvedon. Great Chalvedon Hall still stands, now operating as a pub, and was completed some time in the 16th Century. During the building of the new town Chalvedon became a housing estate in the west of Pitsea and the local secondary school had taken that name (now Basildon Academy - Chalvedon merged with Barstable School). Pitsea was connected by the new London, Tilbury and Southend line in 1855. Next to the station is Cromwell Manor, previously Pitsea Hall, which dates from the 15th century. The arrival of the railway saw land around Pitsea bought and sold off piecemeal by companies like Protheroe and Morris, London who used tactics of free rail tickets and champagne auctions to convince East Londoners of the plotland dream.http://raincoatoptimism.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/a-brief-history-of- pitsea-and-the-ideology-of-urban-regeneration/ It was not until 1925 that planned development took place, when local entrepreneur Harold George Howard built The Railway Hotel (now demolished). He continued the development with The Broadway Cinema (closed 1970 re-opened as a bingo hall closed 2009 - currently empty) in 1930, along with Tudor Chambers and Anne Boleyn Mansions (home to TSB Bank). He also built Howard Crescent and Park which still exist to this day. Also in 1925, the famous Pitsea market first opened.http://www.basildon.com/history/pitsea/pitsea.html Further major development of Pitsea did not take place until the 1960s when the new town redevelopment of Basildon took shape. Pitsea market was moved from its original location in Station Lane in 1969 to Howards Field, to make way for the construction of South Mayne. Pitsea was cut in half in the 1970s by the construction of the new A13 flyover (opened 1973), with Pitsea Mount separated from the rest of the town. In 1976 Pitsea's new town centre was opened along Northlands Pavement (previously Northlands Drive), with Sainsbury's being the anchor store along with a new office block called Pembroke House, and was quickly followed by the new Pitsea Swimming Pool (demolished 2013). In 1978 Tesco opened what was at the time the largest supermarket in Europehttp://raincoatoptimism.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/a-brief-history-of- pitsea-and-the-ideology-of-urban-regeneration/ and would eventually become the first Tesco Extra store in 1997. Also in 1978 Pitsea Market moved for a second time, re-located behind the Railway Hotel and in front of the Sainsbury's Supermarket (the second market place became a car park). In 1981 the Pitsea Centre opened - a leisure centre and library opposite the former pool. A new Leisure centre at Eversley opened in 1987. 1995 saw the opening of the Old Market Retail park on the second market place; part of this was destroyed by fire in 2006, to be rebuilt again in 2007. Sainsbury's supermarket moved outwards to Nethermayne, on the former sports ground of Carrera's cigarette factory.  Landmarks  The remains of the church of St. Michael at Pitsea mount. The most prominent landmark is the tower of the 13th-century church of St. Michael, situated on Pitsea Mount. The dominant position of the building over the local area has seen the church used as a station for a mobile telephone aerial. The nave of the church was demolished in 1998, as it was being vandalised and had fallen into disrepair since its deconsecration in 1983. The only remaining part is the tower. Great Chalvedon Hall is a 16th- century home which Basildon council purchased in 1977. It is located in Tyefields and now operates as a pub. Pitsea Hall, now known as Cromwell Manor, is a 15th-century house next to Pitsea railway station.  Governance  From 1894 to 1934, the Pitsea parish formed part of the Billericay Rural District. In 1934 it became part of the Billericay Urban District and in 1937 the parish was abolished and absorbed into a larger parish of Billericay.Vision of Britain - Pitsea parish (historic map ) The district, consisting only of the Billericay parish, was renamed Basildon Urban District in 1955.Vision of Britain - Billericay parish (historic map ) In 2010, the district became part of the Borough of Basildon. In terms of parliamentary representation, the area was included in the Basildon parliamentary constituency. Since the 2010 general election Pitsea is represented as part of the South Basildon and East Thurrock parliamentary constituency, the MP being Stephen Metcalfe of the Conservative Party. Regeneration The regeneration of Pitsea town centre started in 2010. The Station Lane redevelopment was completed in 2012, and is a prominent landmark that can be seen for miles on approach to Pitsea. A large L-shaped building, it comprises five ground-floor retail units, 121 flats (mixture of social and private housing), and resident parking for 126 cars and 109 bikes and forms a new linkway between Pitsea Broadway and Tesco. In May 2013, The Railway Hotel public house was pulled down, as the Fortune of War pub had been. The Pitsea Swimming Pool was pulled down in January 2013. A new market square has been put onto the site of the former Railway Hotel, officially opening in 2014. The former co-op store (closed early 1980s) that had hosted an arcade and several independent business was demolished in early 2014, and by July 2014 a new Aldi was built on this site and part of the former market place. The rest of the former market place has been converted into parking. The former Sainsbury's building that had hosted Aldi and Castaways, a fish restaurant, were knocked down and replaced by a 70,000 sq ft store which was to be occupied by Morrisons in Spring 2015. However, due to the downturn in the supermarket business Morrisons pulled out of the deal, and The Range chain opened their new store in the building in July 2016.  Sport  Pitsea is the home to Ryman League Division 1 North side Bowers & Pitsea F.C. They play at Crown Avenue, or to give its proper name the Len Salmon Stadium. The club play in the FA Trophy and compete in the FA Cup. It was in the FA Vase that Bowers & Pitsea F.C. achieved their highest ever attendance of 1,800 against a Billericay Town side which featured ex-West Ham United and Charlton Athletic forward Steve Jones. In 2016 the club reached its furthest placing in the Vase with an appearance in the Semi Final. The club first competed in the FA Cup in season 1994/95 when they lost 4‚Äì1 at home to Barking in the Preliminary round, they have never progressed beyond the first qualifying round, and have suffered some quite heavy defeats along the way. The club has also had some well known faces play for them, including former Southend United manager Steve Tilson, ex-Charlton Athletic and Crystal Palace and forward Paul Williams, and were even managed by ex-Millwall keeper Brian Horne. Bowers & Pitsea also have many youth teams playing in and around the local area. There are few sporting clubs in Pitsea other than Eversley Park Cricket Club, Basildon & Pitsea Cricket Club, Chalvedon Football Club, Chalvedon Boys Football Club, Chalvedon Boys Amateur Boxing Club, Pitsea Running Club and numerous Sunday League junior and men's football teams. Most of these teams can be found playing locally on a Sunday at various points across Pitsea, including Eversley Recreation Ground and Pitsea School. Northlands Park is a large open space in Pitsea and is home to two large fishing lakes regularly used by anglers. The lake holds bream, carp, eel, perch, pike, roach, rudd and tench.

The centre provides both day and night courses in computer IT and design and technology for both school leavers and adults. It was once an infant and junior school for the local area called Nevendon Infant and Junior School, but due to other schools opening in the area, pupil numbers declined and the school eventually closed. Essex County Council's Adult Community Learning service operated a satellite centre at Briscoe School in Felmores End until 2016, in addition to the main centre located at Ely House at Churchill Way in Fryerns. Transport Pitsea is served by Pitsea railway station on the c2c line from London to Southend. Local bus services are the 1, 5, 8, 12, 21, and 22, that operate from Pitsea Broadway to the nearby towns of Basildon, Canvey, Southend by First Essex, Arriva Southend and Stephensons. The town is served by the Pitsea bypass of the A13, which connects London to Southend, and has a direct link to the M25. To the east is the A130 to Canvey Island or Chelmsford, and also links to the A12 to London or East Anglia. To the north is the A127 which serves the same purpose as the A13, and to the west is the A132 which is the border which separates Pitsea from Barstable and Vange; this road links into Basildon town centre, the A127 and Wickford. Employment Most people living in Pitsea either commute to Basildon, Southend or London for employment. Pitsea has a fair amount of office spaces as well, which can be found in Pembroke House in the main Pitsea Centre, Broadway Chambers in the main Pitsea Broadway, and Tudor Chambers located in Station Lane. The offices include solicitors, insurance companies, an accounting software company and an employment agency. To the north of Pitsea is the Burnt Mills Industrial Estate which has many industrial units, including freight delivery, printing, a car wreck yard and a small amount of manufacturing, including Gardner Aerospace. Also in this area is the main delivery depot for the courier T.N.T.. The area also has the main sewage treatment works which during the summer has reportedly been the cause of a nasty stink, although Essex and Suffolk Water deny there is anything wrong with it. Also further along from there is the main local depot for the cable TV company Telewest Blueyonder, which came to the area in the early 1990s under the name of United Artists before changing its name to Telewest and then more recently to Virgin Media. This previously had been the main customer service centre for United Artists. Local issues In the land between the sewage treatment works and the Hovefields Industrial Park, there have been ongoing talks of building a large incinerator, much to the town residents' disagreement. This has led to local disapproval with petitions having been signed and handed to the government. The fumes which would be churned out by the chimneys on the incinerator and what effect they could have on local people's health were the main concerns. However, after agreement between Essex County Council, Balfour Beatty and Urbaser building work started in 2013 and the plant opened in 2015. Pitsea Tip has been in operation throughout the 20th century on the Pitsea Marshes. It has been reputedly the source of a nasty smell which affects both Pitsea and Canvey Island, although scientific evidence completed on behalf of the landfill operator Vieola proved inconclusive. In 2013 it was announced that developers wanted to build a new village on land in between Pitsea and Bowers Gifford. The development was being put forward by Meridian Strategic Land but was plainly rejected in September 2013, as it did not fall within the town plan. Meridian raised an appeal to the Government Inspector, and an outcome is due late 2014.http://www.echo- news.co.uk/news/11052883.750_homes_will_destroy_Pitsea_village__campaigners_fear/?ref=rss Notable people * Scott Robinson, singer with 5ive * QBoy, UK's leading gay rapper * Michael Kightly footballer with Southend United F.C., Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., Stoke City F.C. and Burnley F.C. *James Tomkins footballer with West Ham United F.C. and Crystal Palace F.C.

History \\"The Friendly Mathematics Competition\\" was founded at Wabash College in 1965 by Professor Paul T. Mielke. Today it is known as \\"The Indiana College Mathematics Competition.\\" The Competition has emphasized collegiality and teamwork from the very beginning, earning its sobriquet \\"The Friendly Exam\\" because of the (relatively) noncompetitive ambience created during the contest. Students within a team cooperate and the teams submit one solution per question. Each team determines how to manage its work and time: Some teams are truly collaborative, whereas others carry out a divide and conquer strategy, with different members working on different problems. The number of problems varies from six to eight per year, and no calculators are allowed. Since 1978, the competition has been a part of the spring meeting of the Indiana Section of the MAA. As is consistent with the \\"friendly\\" nature of the competition, each year's problems include \\"some problems everyone should be able to do,\\" along with those that challenge and allow for distinguishing among the problem solvers. (One problem statement on the 1968 exam was false!) Many problems are classics borrowed from various sources. Early Competitions=Exam #1 - 1966 The first \\"friendly competition\\" was held at Wabash College, located in Crawfordsville, a bit northwest of Indianapolis. Eight schools participated in the competition that year. It was won by the team from Wabash College consisting of James Clynch, Albert Hart Jr., and Larry Haugh.

It took place after the Romans' victories in the Battle of Thermopylae (in 191 BC), in the Battle of Magnesia (in 190 BC) and after Roman and Rhodian naval victories over the Seleucid navy. The treaty, according to Appian, obliged Antiochus III to abandon Europe altogether and all of Asia west of the Taurus Mountains. Also, he had to surrender all the war elephants in his possession and was limited to twelve warships for the purpose of keeping his subjects under control, but he was allowed to build more if he was attacked. Antiochus was barred from recruiting mercenaries from Roman territory and entertaining fugitives from the same. Antiochus had to give twenty hostages, whom the Roman consul would select. The hostages should be changed every third year, except the son of Antiochus. In the future, he would maintain no elephants and pay for the cost of the present war, incurred on his account, 500 Euboic talents down and 2,500 more when the Roman Senate ratified the treaty; and 12,000 more during twelve years, each yearly installment to be delivered to Rome. He was also forced to surrender all prisoners and deserters to his enemies, and to Eumenes II, the King of Pergamon, whatever remains of the possessions he acquired by his agreement with Attalus I, the father of Eumenes. Rome gave the control of a large part of Asia Minor to Eumenes. Antiochus kept the region of Cilicia, while most of Lycia and Caria became part of the Rhodian Peraia. Hellenistic kings generally accepted, for their own lifetimes, any treaty they had signed, on the grounds of honour. On the other hand, their heirs did not feel honour bound to accept treaties signed by their predecessors. The naval conditions of the treaty appear to have fallen into abeyance, but the other conditions held. The treaty was formalized at Apamea in Phrygia. It allowed the Romans to expand their political hegemony to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. But at this time Roman power was still indirect, and Rome depended on its capacity to ally itself to second-rank powers.

The show is essentially a children's version of The Newlywed Game with young siblings playing instead of married couples. The show was produced by Saban Productions and DIC Enterprises. Gameplay=Main game Three teams competed, each (usually, but not always) consisting of a brother and sister. The front game was played in two rounds. In Round 1, the brothers were \\"teleported\\" to the \\"Isolation Zone\\" (or \\"Iso-Zone\\") using special effects and a video edit (i.e., taken offstage to a soundproof room). One of three pun-styled categories was chosen at random by hitting a plunger, and Faso read a question loosely based on the chosen category. Three questions were played, with each sister choosing one category, and all three sisters responded to every question. After the sisters' answers were recorded, the brothers were brought back onstage and asked the same three questions. If a brother's response matched his sister's, the team scored points (25 for the first question, 50 for the second, and 75 for the third). If the responses disagreed, no points were awarded. Much like the adult Newlywed Game, more often than not, the siblings would usually argue over their conflicting answers. Round 2 was played in the same manner, but with the sisters taken offstage and the brothers providing initial answers. Question values were increased to 50, 75, and 150 points. The game continued until both rounds were completed or one team had built up an insurmountable lead. The highest-scoring team received a $1,000 savings bond and advanced to the \\"Pick-A-Prize Arcade\\" for a chance to win bonus prizes. The other teams each received consolation prizes, including a copy of the I'm Telling! home game. If two or all three teams were tied for first place after the second round, a tie-breaker question was asked to determine the winner. Before the show, the producers filled a large container (dubbed the \\"I'm Telling! Fun Box\\") with many of the same object. Before the game, each team had to guess how many objects were in the container, and write down their answer on a card. Whichever team came the closest to the actual number (without going over) would advance to the Pick-a- Prize Arcade. Pick-a-Prize Arcade At the end of the game, the set was rotated 180 degrees to reveal the Pick-a-Prize Arcade. Twenty prizes were displayed, 10 designated for each sibling; the brother's prizes sat on yellow platforms while the sister's sat on pink ones, and a strobe light and pushbutton were placed next to each prize. Prior to the show, each sibling chose the six prizes that he/she thought the other would most like to have. The home audience was shown one sibling's choices, after which the other one selected six prizes by pushing their buttons. Every time the siblings' choices matched, a siren sounded and the light next to that prize flashed. After both siblings had taken a turn, the team won all prizes they had matched; if they made at least 10 matches between them, they won all 20 prizes. Broadcast history Although the last first-run episode aired on March 5, 1988, repeats aired until August 27. Reruns were seen on The Family Channel from September 9, 1989 to September 8, 1990; August 29, 1994 to September 30, 1995; and October 30, 1995 to March 29, 1996. Special episodes While most shows featured brother and sister teams, special episodes were also aired in order to accommodate siblings of the same gender, known as \\"Brothers' Week\\" or \\"Sisters' Week\\", in which the teams would be all male or all female. Youthful stars of NBC's prime-time series also played with their real-life siblings for charity on two episodes, known as \\"Celebrity Week\\".

The hydrocarbon group is a 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenyl group. Triton X-100 is closely related to IGEPAL CA-630 or former Nonidet P-40, which might differ from it mainly in having slightly shorter ethylene oxide chains. Thus Triton X-100 is slightly more hydrophilic than Igepal CA-630; these two detergents may not be considered to be functionally interchangeable for most applications. Triton X-100 was originally a registered trademark of Rohm & Haas Co. It was subsequently purchased by Union Carbide and then acquired by Dow Chemical Company upon the acquisition of Union Carbide. Soon afterward (in 2009), Dow also acquired Rohm & Haas Co. Other trademarks for very similar compounds include Conco NI, Dowfax 9N, Igepal CO, Makon, Neutronyx 600's, Nonipol NO, Plytergent B, Renex 600's, Solar NO, Sterox, Serfonic N, T-DET-N, Tergitol NP, Triton N, etc. Triton X detergents are distantly related to Pluronic range of detergents marketed by BASF. The pluronics are triblock copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with the ethylene oxide segments being more hydrophilic than the propylene oxide. Physical properties Undiluted Triton X-100 is a clear viscous fluid (less viscous than undiluted glycerol) owing to the hydrogen bonding of its hydrophilic polyethylene oxide parts. Undiluted Triton X-100 has a viscosity of about 270 centipoise at 25 ¬∞C which comes down to about 80 centipoise at 50 ¬∞C. Triton X-100 is soluble at 25 ¬∞C in water, toluene, xylene, trichloroethylene, ethylene glycol, ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene dichloride. Triton X-100 is insoluble in kerosene, mineral spirits, and naphtha, unless a coupling agent like oleic acid is used. Uses Triton X-100 is a commonly used detergent in laboratories. Triton X-100 is widely used to lyse cells to extract protein or organelles, or to permeabilize the membranes of living cells. Some applications include: *Inactivation of lipid-enveloped viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV) in manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals *Industrial purpose (plating of metal) *Ingredient in influenza vaccines, including Fluzone *Permeabilizing unfixed (or lightly fixed) eukaryotic cell membranes *Solubilizing membrane proteins in their native state in conjunction with zwitterionic detergents such as CHAPS *Part of the lysis buffer (usually in a 5% solution in alkaline lysis buffer) in DNA extraction *Reducing surface tension of aqueous solutions during immunostaining (usually at a concentration of 0.1-0.5% in TBS or PBS Buffer) *Dispersion of carbon materials for soft composite materials *Restricting colony expansion in Aspergillus nidulans in microbiology *Decellularization of animal-derived tissues *Removing SDS from SDS-PAGE gels prior to renaturing the proteins within the gel *Disruption of cell monolayers as a positive control for TEER measurements *Micellar catalyst Apart from laboratory use, Triton X-100 can be found in several types of cleaning compounds, ranging from heavy-duty industrial products to gentle detergents. It is also a popular ingredient in homemade vinyl record cleaning fluids together with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol. Triton X-100 inclusion in the Authorisation List (Annex XIV) of REACH In December 2012, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) included the substance group ‚Äú4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol, ethoxylated‚Äù ‚Äì which includes Triton X-100 ‚Äì in the Candidate List of substances of very high concern of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation which addresses the production, import and use of chemical substances and their potential impacts on human health and the environment. A Triton X-100 degradation product has indeed turned out to be ecotoxic as it possesses hormone-like (estrogeno-mimetic) activity that may act on wildlife. The ECHA finally included the substance group in the Authorisation List (Annex XIV), mandating the pharmaceutical and other industries to replace this detergent by the ‚Äúsunset date‚Äù January 4, 2021, thereby affecting EU manufacturers, importers, and downstream users, as well as non-European manufacturers exporting their products into the EU.  Alternatives for viral inactivation  Since the inclusion of Triton X-100 in the candidate list of substances of very high concern for authorization, pharmaceutical companies, as well as bioprocessing research groups, are in need of an alternative detergent which must at the same time be eco-friendly and effective. Ideally, a Triton X-100 replacement should generate minimal manufacturing process change, because only then the necessary updates of regulatory filings for medicines could be realized without additional animal experiments or even clinical studies. Therefore, an alternative virus-inactivating detergent should have physico-chemical properties similar to Triton X-100, should be soluble, easy to remove, eco-friendly, but not degrade to toxic metabolites. In a recent study, two alternatives for antiviral treatment in biopharmaceutical manufacturing have been identified: Triton X-100 reduced, as well as a novel compound which was named Nereid (after the mermaids in Greek mythology). As reflected by the name, Nereid can be seen as just another relative of the Triton X-100 family, however, due to a small molecular difference, it does not degrade into phenolic compounds the way that Triton X-100 does. The virus inactivation studies comprised experiments with several relevant viruses under various conditions. It turned out that at room temperature, where most virus inactivation steps in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are conducted, both Triton X-100 reduced and Nereid showed similar virus inactivating performances as Triton X-100. In contrast, for some processes that are conducted at cold temperatures, Nereid and Triton X-100 gave better results than Triton X-100 reduced. To date, Nereid can be produced at kilogram-scale using a three-step synthesis, and a patent has been applied for. Nereid is scalable and compatible with existing processes and has not shown any impact on product activity so far. In terms of performance, Nereid would be a robust ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù replacement for Triton X-100. Thus, it is currently tested in ecotoxicology and biodegradation studies to confirm that it is environmentally safe.

In the summer of that year she transported supplies from New York City to the , which was anchored at Godhavn, Disko Island, preparatory to departing on an Arctic expedition. Late in 1871, Congress served also as flagship for Vice Admiral Stephen Clegg Rowan who had been designated to accord suitable reception to a visiting Russian squadron. After a cruise to Haiti in early 1872, Congress sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 February, to join the Mediterranean Squadron. This lengthy tour included visits to many ports of Europe and ended at Key West, Florida, where she arrived on 5 January 1874.

History Gadid was founded in 1982 as an Orthodox moshav by a group of 22 families, mostly new immigrants from France, as well as families from the Bnei Akiva Mizrachi youth group. Most residents earned their living from hothouse crops such as leafy vegetables, tomatoes, flowers, and herbs. A unique characteristic of Gadid was that each family's agricultural land was adjacent to its home. The village also housed an absorption center (built in 1999) for new immigrants from France. A cottage industry for herbal remedies was one of the most prominent local initiatives and operated by the Barbei family.

Sutton Square is the cul-de- sac at the end of East 58th Street, just east of Sutton Place; Riverview Terrace is a row of townhouses on a short private driveway that runs north from Sutton Square. History Townhouses line the east side of Sutton Place between 58th and 57th Streets \\"Avenue A Estate\\" of New York & Suburban Homes Company, named before the Avenue was renamed Early years The street that became York Avenue and Sutton Place was proposed as an addition to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for Manhattan, which designated 12 broad north- south avenues running the length of the island. The geography of Manhattan left a large area on the Upper East Side east of First Avenue without a major north-south thoroughfare, so Avenue A was added to compensate. Sutton Place, the name that applied to the whole street at the time, was originally one of several disconnected stretches of Avenue A built where space allowed, east of First Avenue. In 1875, Effingham B. Sutton constructed a group of brownstones between 57th and 58th Streets.Sutton Place Park history, NYC Parks website. Retrieved 2015-01-06. The earliest source found by The New York Times using the term Sutton Place dates to 1883. At that time, the New York City Board of Aldermen approved a petition to change the name from \\"Avenue A\\" to \\"Sutton Place\\", covering the blocks between 57th and 60th Streets.Senft, Bret. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Sutton Place; A Riverside Enclave for the Well- to-Do\\", The New York Times, June 12, 1994. Accessed December 27, 2007. The block between 59th and 60th Streets is now considered a part of York Avenue. Sutton Place first became fashionable around 1920, when several wealthy socialites, including Anne Harriman Vanderbilt and Anne Morgan, built townhouses on the eastern side of the street, overlooking the East River. Both townhouses were designed by Mott B. Schmidt, launching a career that included many houses for the wealthy. Very shortly thereafter, developers started to build grand co-operative apartment houses on Sutton Place and Sutton Place South, including several designed by Rosario Candela. Development came to an abrupt halt with the Great Depression, and the luxury apartment buildings on the lower part of Sutton Place South (below 57th Street) and the northernmost part of Sutton Place (adjacent to the Queensboro Bridge) were not developed until the 1940s and 1950s. NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian/Weill Cornell as seen from the East River In 1912, New York Hospital became affiliated with the Cornell University Medical College and in 1932 moved to its current location, a joint facility, the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, on York Avenue between East 67th and 68th Streets. In 1998, NY Hospital merged with Presbyterian Hospital to become NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital (NYP) and the site functions as one of the main campuses of NYP.https://weill.cornell.edu/our-story/about- weill-cornell-medicine/history History of Weill Cornell Medical College In 2019, NYP was ranked as 5th Best Hospital in the United States. In 1928, a one-block section of Sutton Place north of 59th Street, and all of Avenue A north of that point, was renamed York Avenue to honor U.S. Army Sergeant Alvin York, who received the Medal of Honor during World War I's Meuse-Argonne Offensive.Pollak, Michael. \\"F. Y. I.\\", The New York Times, August 7, 2005. Accessed October 16, 2007. \\"In 1928, Sutton Place from 59th to 60th Street, and Avenue A north of 60th, were renamed York Avenue in honor of Sgt.

Park controversy Sutton Place encompasses two public parks overlooking the East River, one at the end of 57th Street and another at the end of 53rd Street. The 57th Street park, named Sutton Place Park, is separated by an iron fence from the landscaped grounds behind One Sutton Place South, a neo-Georgian apartment building designed by Rosario Candela. The property behind One Sutton Place South was the subject of a dispute between the building's owners and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Like the adjacent park, the rear garden at One Sutton Place South is, in fact, cantilevered over the FDR Drive, a busy parkway at Manhattan's eastern edge that is not visible from most of Sutton Place. Sutton Place Park at the end of 57th Street, with the Queensboro Bridge in the background In 1939, city authorities took ownership of the property behind One Sutton Place South by condemnation in connection with the construction of the FDR Drive, then leased it back to the building. The building's lease for its backyard expired in 1990.Bagli, Charles V. \\"In Sutton Place's Backyard, Private Oasis on Public Land\\", The New York Times, December 31, 2003\\"Sutton Place Private Lawn Going to the Masses\\", Curbed.com, December 7, 2004 The co-op tried unsuccessfully to extend the lease, and later made prospective apartment-buyers review the legal status of the backyard and sign a confidentiality agreement.Bagli, Charles V., \\"A Co-op on Sutton Place Sues to Keep Its Backyard\\", The New York Times, June 19, 2007.

Early life Kimball was born on May 5, 1843, on a farm near Jay, Maine.\\"Mourn Judge Kimball.\\" Washington Post. May 16, 1916, p. 5. His parents were Wilbraham Kimball, Jr. and Anna L. Kimball ( Hatch). His ancestor, Richard Kimball, emigrated from Ipswich, Suffolk, England, to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving in America on April 10, 1674. The Kimballs moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in June 1846. Ivory Kimball was educated in the city public schools, receiving a high school diploma at the age of 16. This qualified him to teach, which he did from 1860 to 1862. Kimball enlisted as a private in Company E, 55th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, an infantry unit. He became seriously ill during his three-month enlistment, and his full recovery took nearly a year. He was denied readmission to the military. (The illness, dysentery with internal bleeding, recurred periodically throughout the rest of his life.) He relocated from Indiana to Washington, D.C., where he was employed by the United States Treasury Department. He received his law degree from Columbian College (now The George Washington University) in 1867 and entered the practice of law.

January 11, 1898, p. 2; \\"Named For A Second Term.\\" Washington Post. January 12, 1898, p. 4. There was opposition to Kimball's renomination when his second term expired in 1904. Kimball was renominated for the bench by President Theodore Roosevelt. Local physician W.A. Croffut and others made complaints to the Senate about Kimball's ethics and behavior on the bench. An ad hoc subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia was formed to investigate the charges (which were not specified in a public way) in executive session. The executive hearings lasted several days in December 1903.

Legislation to fully fund the commission and build an amphitheater was introduced in 1912 by Senator George Sutherland. Sutherland's bill proposed construction of the amphitheater Kimball wanted: a 5,000-seat structure with a small museum and an underground crypt (for the burial of famous individuals).\\"Favor Big Memorial.\\" Washington Post. March 30, 1912; \\"Blocks Big Memorial.\\" Washington Post. May 8, 1912. This bill was successful.

The 1908 authorizing legislation established an Arlington Memorial Amphitheater Commission (AMAC) to oversee the design and construction of the structure. Its members included the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Superintendent of the U.S. Capitol, Judge Kimball (as a representative of the GAR), and Charles W. Newton (as a representative of the United Spanish War Veterans, a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War veterans group).War Department Annual Reports, 1915, p. 1683. Accessed 2013-05-13.

The boy Wilbra suffered from epilepsy, and died at the age of 20. Anna Kimball died on March 23, 1914. Death, burial and memberships In retirement, Kimball was named president of Edmonston & Co., a boot manufacturing company. Kimball fell ill in February 1916. He never regained his health. He became bedridden on May 12, and died suddenly at about noon on May 15. Funeral services were held at the Metropolitan Prebysterian Church, and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Kimball was a deeply religious man, as were many of his forebears. For many years, he sat on the board of directors of the Central Union Mission, an outreach center for the poor in Washington.\\"Union Mission Celebrates.\\" Washington Post.

In these contemporary chronicles, they were styled dux, a Latin term for leader which is the origin of the title duke and its cognates in other languages (duc, duce, doge, duque, etc.). They were independent until the death of Radbod at the earliest. Finn, son of Folcwald, is a semi- legendary figure. He was killed by Hengest, who later migrated to Britain and founded the Kingdom of Kent.

A 19th century work, the Oera Linda Book (authorship uncertain but considered to be a hoax), embellished these stories further by describing an ancient and glorious history for the Frisians extending back thousands of years, during which time they were supposedly ruled over by a line of matriarchs known as folk-mothers, founded by the eponymous goddess Frya, ancestress of the Frisians.

Uriarte Talavera Contempor√°nea exhibition at the Franz Mayer Museum, Mexico City. The ceramic mural is by the artist. Pedro Friedeberg (January 11, 1936 ‚Äì) is a Mexican artist and designer known for his surrealist work filled with lines colors and ancient and religious symbols. His best known piece is the ‚ÄúHand-Chair‚Äù a sculpture/chair designed for people to sit on the palm, using the fingers as back and arm rests. Friedeberg began studying as an architect but did not complete his studies as he began to draw designs against the conventional forms of the 1950s and even completely implausible ones such as houses with artichoke roofs. However, his work caught the attention of artist Mathias Goeritz who encouraged him to continue as an artist. Friedeberg became part of a group of surrealist artists in Mexico which included Leonora Carrington and Alice Rahon, who were irreverent, rejecting the social and political art which was dominant at the time. Friedeberg has had a lifelong reputation for being eccentric, and states that art is dead because nothing new is being produced. Life Pedro Friedeberg was born on January 11, 1936 in Florence, Italy, as the son of German-Jewish parents. His parents escaped from Europe at the beginning of the Second World War arriving in Mexico when he was three years old. He remembers his grandmother marking names in European newspapers of family members which had survived the Holocaust. He says he does not talk about his childhood because it was ‚ÄúGerman,‚Äù describing it as ‚Äúdiscipline,‚Äù ‚Äútorture‚Äù and ‚Äúpunishment.‚Äù He was made to learn violin and speak several languages and he hated to be at home. He was not raised Jewish but rather atheist. Once a servant took him in secret to a church to be baptized. He says because of these experiences, he has seven religions, one for each day of the week. As a child he express an interest in art early. His mother said that when he was two he liked to sit in front of the Santa Mar√≠a Novella Church in Florence and try to draw it. In his youth he was captivated by the Renaissance architecture of the churches and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. When he was older, he traced the images in the art books that belonged to his father, favoring the works of Canaletto, Piranesi and others from the 18th century. He also liked the perspectives of the drawings of M. C. Escher. He studied for a while in Boston and then entered the Universidad Iberoamericana in 1957 to study architecture. He began to study architecture because of his own interest and pressure from his parents but made it only to the third year. His professors favored symmetrical architecture such as that of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who designed the Seagram Building in New York, which Friedeberg thought boring. He preferred the works of Antoni Gaud√≠, creating circular plans, and he began to design impossible works such as houses with artichoke roofs and skyscrapers topped by pears, which earned him failing grades. However, his time at Iberoamericana allowed him to meet artist Mathias Goeritz, who appreciated his work. Goeritz told Friedeberg to continue with his art and ignore his parents. During the summers, Friedeberg worked as Goeritz‚Äôs secretary, which included helping on artistic projects. Through family and friends he met surrealist artists such as Remedios Varo, who recommended his work to Galer√≠a Diana, leading to Friedeberg‚Äôs first exhibition in 1960 when he was only twenty two. From these connections, he began to meet other surrealist artists such as Leonora Carrington and Alice Rahon to become a member of Los Hartos (The Fed- Up), in 1961. This group was based on Dadaist principles: the creation of anti-art for art's sake, rejecting political and social painting. This group‚Äôs influence led Friedeberg to believe in the autonomy of aestheticism. Later, he and Javier Giron organized a ‚Äúmovement‚Äù called ‚ÄúChinchismo‚Äù from the Mexican Spanish world ‚Äúchinche‚Äù which means bug. They asked thirty artists to create bug words and called Pita Amor their muse, with the idea of ridiculing ‚Äú-isms‚Äù or movements in art. Friedeberg‚Äôs reputation for eccentricity has been lifelong, not only linked to surrealist artist but other eccentrics such as Edward James and Antonio Souza. Friedeberg has had a tendency to protect and defend those who have lost their fame and fortune, such as Pita Amor did in her old age, when she was ridiculed by elements of Mexican society. He says he consults the I-Ching everyday, and has a collection of saints. His biography on the Internet includes a passage that reads ‚ÄúI get up at the crack of noon and, after watering my pira√±as, I breakfast off things Corinthian. Later in the day I partake in an Ionic lunch followed by a Doric nap. On Tuesdays I sketch a volute or two, and perhaps a pediment, if the mood overtakes me. Wednesday I have set aside for anti-meditation. On Thursdays I usually relax whereas on Friday I write autobiographies‚Äù He says that the world lacks eccentrics today because people have returned to being sheep through the consumer culture and television which wants us all to be the same. Friedeberg has been married four times. His third wife was Polish Countess Wanda Zamoyska. This marriage lasted twelve years which he describes at surrealist, a circus and crazy, but tiring. His last wife is Carmen Gutierrez, with whom he has two children, Diana and David. He says Carmen is a very serious woman, unlike his other former wives. Having children changed his life because he could no longer travel around the world and stay up until 5 am drinking. He currently lives in Mexico City. When he dies, he says he hopes to be buried at the same Venice cemetery where Stravinsky and Diaghilev are, in a tomb with a white gondola and black feathers. Career Hand-chair, monumental sculpture by Pedro Friedeberg located in the Alameda Central in Mexico City Friedeberg has painted, created murals for institutions in Mexico and abroad, illustrated books and book covers, created furniture and set designs. He was the art director, along with Sergio Villegas of a spectacular called Arbol de la Vida. He began designing furniture in the 1960s, rejecting the then-dominant international style of architecture. He has designed chairs, tables, couches and love seats in fantastic designs. He is best known for his hand-chair, which has sold more than 5,000 copies since it was created in 1962. The original chair was made of wood and covered in gold leaf. It is designed to allow one to sit on the palm, using the fingers as a back and arm rest. He has declared that he is never really relaxed and stated that he has painted one canvas per week, 52 weeks a year for the fifty years of his career in addition to sculptures and chair designs. His paintings, sculpture and furniture was very fashionable, called ‚Äúchic‚Äù in the 1960s and 1970s. His first two individual exhibitions were at the Diana Gallery in 1959 and the Protec Gallery in 1960, both in Mexico City. In the 1960s, he had sixteen exhibitions in Mexico, France, New York, Portugal and the Pan American Union in Washington, DC in 1963. In the 1970s, he had nineteen exhibitions in various cities in Mexico and the United States, Barcelona, Haifa (Israel) and Canada. In the 1980s, he had thirteen including the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. In the 1990s, he had twenty one, mostly in Mexico which a tribute to his work in 1997 and an exhibition in Colombia. In the 2000s, he had nine, all in Mexico except for one in Germany in 2000 and one in Belgium in 2003. He has also participated in many group exhibitions from 1960 to 2003. Awards include the C√≥rdoba Argentina Biennale in 1966 (2nd prize), the Solar Exhibition in Mexico City in 1967 (1st prize), the Argentina Engraving Triennale in Buenos Aires in 1979, the XI Biennale of Graphic Works in Tokyo (Special Award) in 1984 and was named an ‚ÄúArtistic Creator‚Äù by the National System of Mexican and Foreign Creators in 1993. His work and life have been featured in many books from 1972 to the present. These books include his autobiography published in Mexico ‚ÄúDe vacaciones por la vida, Memorias no autorizadas‚Äù (On vacation for life, Unauthorized memories) edited by Trilce and CONACULTA . In his autobiography, Friedeberg writes about experiences with his many friends in the art world, including Salvador Dal√≠, Leonora Carrington, Kati Horna, Tamara de Lempicka, Mathias Goeritz, Edward James, Zachary Selig and Bridget Bate Tichenor.Friedeberg, Pedro.

Artistry From his first exhibition, his work has had an easily identifiable style, although it is not easily classifiable. He often uses architectural drawing as his medium to create unusual compositions including designs for useless objects, often as a result of boredom. He has studied and incorporated elements of various artistic and design trends from his lifetimes from Art Nouveau to Op art. Much of his work has an industrial quality, stemming from his training as an architect. However, there is a dream like quality as well, painting impossible palaces and other structures, with innumerable halls and rooms, secret passages and stairs which are often absurd. Irony and surfeit are generally expressed through the almost hallucinogenic repetition of elements and formal disorder, but it is the result of conscious thought. He classifies his work as eclectic and hybrid. His art is not political, it is art for art‚Äôs sake and he states it is elitist. He does not believe in making art ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù because most people do not care about it. His art almost always have a sarcastic and cynical touch. He says his only intention in his art is to make fun of himself and everyone else. Paintings, furniture and more are often characterized as being filled with ornamentation, with little or no white space, with lines, colors and symbols referencing ancient scriptures, Aztec codices, Catholicism, Hinduism and the occult. While his art has been criticized as adding ornament for its own sake or even distraction, he disagrees, saying that ornamentation is the oldest form of fine art, added to give objects an exceptional, even religious quality. He has called his extensive ornamentation, which includes elements from ancient texts, ‚ÄúNintendo Churrigueresque‚Äù Friedeberg belongs to a group of 20th century surrealist artists, which in Mexico include Gunther Gerzso, Mathias Goeritz, Alice Rahon, Kati Horna, Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo and Paul Antragne, who were grouped together under the name of Los Hartos. They were original, eccentric, irreverent and iconoclastic. His techniques have not changes since he started and themes have changed only a little, as today he includes fantastic animal hybrids in some of his work. He has criticized modern artists saying ‚ÄúArt has died, after surrealism, there is nothing new.‚Äù He says that people have lost their taste for irony, sarcasm and the absurd.

He was the first amateur runner to surpass Walter George's professional record in the mile, set nearly 30 years previously. He also won a bronze medal over 1500 m and a gold medal in the team 3000 m at the Olympic Games in Stockholm 1912.Norman Taber. sports-reference.com 1912 Olympics Taber emerged as a top runner in 1910 when he finished third in the IC4A championship mile for Brown University. Missing the 1911 season, he re- emerged in 1912, finishing sixth in the IC4A cross country, then surprising many by tying mile record holder John Paul Jones over that distance at the IC4A championships. He was selected for the Olympic 1500 m team and was one of the favorites for that event at the 1912 Olympics held at Stockholm. When the final was held July 10, he led for part of the race and challenged leader Abel Kiviat on the final homestretch. However, Arnold Jackson of Britain passed them both, and a photo-finish between Kiviat and Taber awarded Kiviat the silver medal and Taber the bronze. He nevertheless won an Olympic gold medal in the 3000 m team race. The first IAAF mile record On May 31, 1913, Taber ran again in the IC4A championships, and was up against world record-holder Jones in the mile. Taber led at the first three quarters, in 61.6, 2:09.3 and 3:16.1. But Jones launched into his drive as the bell for the final lap sounded and Taber couldn't respond. He crossed the finish line in 4:14, a new world amateur record, and the first mile record to be recognized by the new governing body of track and field, the IAAF, known then as the International Amateur Athletics Federation. Taber's 4:16 made him the fourth-best amateur over the distance. Taber won the AAU championship over the mile later that year with a 4:26 clocking, then went to St John's College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He ran for Oxford, but did not find much success. Taber eclipses George In 1915, he decided to make an attempt to break Jones' mile record, and he trained with coach Eddie O'Connor for six months to do so. By June, he was in top form. He defeated Kiviat on June 26 in 4:15 in the Eastern Trials for the AAU, then won a mile at the Milrose AA in 4:17 a few weeks later. He chose July 16 to make a special attempt to break the mile record. But not just Jones' world record ‚Äì he was also aiming for Walter George's professional record of 4:12, set in 1886, 29 years previously. The Harvard track at Allston, Massachusetts was extremely fast and the weather was perfect for the attempt. Five seasoned timers were on hand, as were three pace-setters who were given handicaps to best assist Taber in his quest. J.W. Ryan, who was given a 10-yard lead, set a fast pace, clocking 58 s for the first lap. Then, D.S. Mahoney, who had been given a 120-yard lead, took up the pace-setting duties and pulled Taber through the half in 2:05, then 3:13 at the three- quarter mark. J.M. Burke, given a lead of 355 yards, carried Taber on through the final lap, and the crowd, sensing a record, cheered loudly. Taber passed 1500 m unofficially in 3:55, faster than the world record, and it was clear Jones' amateur record would fall. Taber passed Burke into the homestretch and slowed, but kept his form and crossed the finish line. The official result: 4:12. Taber had beaten George's mile time by a fraction of a second and was not only the fastest amateur runner ever, he was now the fastest miler in history. Some raised objections over the pacing involved and the lack of any \\"race,\\" but the IAAF ratified the record and it stood until Paavo Nurmi eclipsed it in 1923. Personal life After retiring from competitions Taber became an expert in municipal finances and founded a company in this field. He later became a Life Trustee of Brown University.

This style of shoe dates from the nineteenth century but reached the height of popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. Description Common colour combinations include a white shoe body with black, brown or tan toe and heel caps, but other colours can be used. The spectator is typically an all leather shoe, but can be constructed using a canvas, mesh or suede body. The spectator was originally constructed of willow calf leather and white buck or reverse calf suede. The white portion was sometimes made from a mesh material, for better ventilation in hot weather. Saddle shoe The saddle shoe, another style of two-tone oxford shoe, can be distinguished from the spectator shoe by noting the saddle shoe's plain toe and distinctive, saddle-shaped decorative panel placed mid foot. Origin of name John Lobb, the famous English footwear maker, claimed to have designed the first spectator shoe as a cricket shoe in 1868. In the 1920s and 1930s in England, this style was considered too flamboyant for a gentleman, and therefore was called a tasteless style. Because the style was popular among lounge lizards and cads, who were sometimes associated with divorce cases, a nickname for the style was co-respondent shoe, a pun on the colour arrangement on the shoe, and the legal description of a third party caught in flagrante delicto with the guilty party in a case of adultery. Wallis Simpson was famed for wearing this style, although it was said that she was an adulteress and that it was Edward VIII who acted the part of co-respondent.World Wide Words: co-respondent shoes In television In J.G. Ballard's novel and Steven Spielberg's film Empire of the Sun, protagonist Jim Graham (Christian Bale) covets a fellow prisoner's spectator golf shoes. After the prisoner dies, he is given the shoes as a gift from Dr. Ransome (Nigel Havers). In the 1992 film Hoffa, Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito were supplied with spectators from Wisconsin shoemaker Allen Edmonds (specifically the Broadstreet model). In the 1920s-set crime drama, \\"Boardwalk Empire\\", the character Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson, can be seen wearing pink-and-black spectators, especially in the opening credits sequence.

He was an anti-vaccinationist and author of anti-vaccination books.Bodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853‚Äì1907, Nadja Durbach, Duke University Press, 2005, ‚Äì Google Books He was concerned about premature burial. Biography Privately educated, Tebb started work at fifteen for a Manchester business, attending evening classes where he encountered the ideas of the British radicals John Bright, Richard Cobden and Robert Owen, and the American Christian social reformer Adin Ballou. His ideas were also influenced by a Salford Swedenborgian sect promoting physical purity, food reform, and teetotalism. In 1852, Tebb went to the United States as a representative of the Vegetarian Society. He was introduced to Ballou and made frequent visits to the latter's experimental Hopedale Community, where he met and married Mary Elizabeth Scott in 1856. In the 1850s he became active in the American abolitionist movement, but he and his family returned to England in the 1860s to escape a malaria outbreak, settling in London. Tebb became a director of a company making bleaching chemicals for paper, earning a large fortune that he used to fund a variety of social causes. He co-founded the Royal Normal College for the Blind, was active in anti-vivisection, contributed to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (becoming a vice-president of the National Canine Defence League) as well as joining the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Humanitarian League. Politically a radical Liberal, he was a member of the Devonshire Club, National Liberal Club, New Reform Club, and the Vigilance Association for the Defence of Personal Rights. Tebb's daughter Florence married Raphael Weldon. Anti-vaccination activism In 1869 Tebb became deeply committed to the anti-vaccination campaign whose aim was repeal of the Vaccination Acts that made smallpox vaccination compulsory for children. He himself was prosecuted and fined thirteen times for refusal to vaccinate his third daughter. In 1880, he co-founded the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination (LSACV) and established its official publication, the Vaccination Inquirer. He served as its chairman until 1896, when it was dissolved to form the National Anti-Vaccination League (NAVL), of which he was president. He became a highly publicised activist against compulsory smallpox vaccination, and then one of the most prolific writers and activists against vaccination itself. Although interested in spiritualism and theosophy, he campaigned not on religious grounds but on general appeal to values of social liberty. He visited the United States in 1879, and campaigned against smallpox vaccinations. Smallpox had recently become epidemic again, after a decline in vaccination, following a decline in cases of smallpox earlier in the century. Several American anti-vaccination organisations arose around the time of his visit. The NAVL succeeded in its lobbying for a government enquiry (a Royal Commission in 1886), and the 1898/1907 Act of 1898 that introduced exemption from vaccination on grounds of conscientious objection. Although he continued to campaign against vaccination, in later life Tebb took on further causes. Other interests In 1895 he moved to Rede Hall, Burstow, Surrey, where he occupied major posts in the parish council, local horticultural society and cricket club. He paid for a monument to Adin Ballou at Hopedale, and a drinking fountain at Burstow in memory of the 400,000 horses killed and wounded during the Boer War, to which he was strongly opposed as a pacifist and anti-imperialist. Along with Walter Hadwen, in 1896 he had co-founded the London Association for the Prevention of Premature Burial, that campaigned for burial reforms to ensure that those buried were certainly dead. When he died at Burstow in 1917, his will specified that \\"unmistakable evidence of decomposition\\" should be visible, so he was cremated a week after his death.

Biography  Bernt's job as an office boy at the New York Journal , which he took on after dropping out of high school in Brooklyn, put him in contact with leading cartoonists, as he recalled, Fishing for ideas Ed Black wrote about the method E. C. Segar and Berndt used to generate cartoon ideas: :Segar did another strip in the 1920s, but not on his own volition. One of his friends at the New York Journal was Walter Berndt who would in 1922 create the daily and Sunday Smitty strip for the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate (under the aegis of the legendary Capt. Joseph Patterson), a feature destined to run for years. Both liked fishing. Berndt was doing a two-column strip called Then the Fun Began, inherited from Milt Gross. Both Segar and Berndt would finish their work by noon then steal away to an old pier on the Jersey side and spend the afternoon fishing and thinking up ideas. \\"We'd finish the day with a bunch of fish and about 15 or 20 ideas each,\\" Berndt once said.Black, Ed. \\"The Little Man and the One-eyed Sailor,\\" Gylph Then the Fun Began was appearing as early as March 3, 1919.

Origins of Smitty Berndt's first strip, That's Different, drawn for the Bell Syndicate, lasted less than a year. In 1922, he created Smitty, which he continued until 1973, working with his assistant Charles Mueller.

Berndt couldn't get in to see anyone. Segar said there wasn't a World Series in Chicago and suggested he send the proposal to Captain Patterson. So Berndt mailed the strip to the Chicago Tribune. Patterson, opening a phone book for reference, renamed it Smitty and bought it at Berndt's high asking price. The strip became a mainstay, with the adventures of Smitty and Herby continuing for over 50 years. Scroll down for story. He also produced the comic strip Herby, a topper strip of Smitty, from 1938 through 1960. In 1937, Berndt moved to Port Jefferson, Long Island, where he lived until his death at age 79.

If a failure of electrical insulation occurs, all bonded metal objects in the room will have substantially the same electrical potential, so that an occupant of the room cannot touch two objects with significantly different potentials. Even if the connection to a distant earth ground is lost, the occupant will be protected from dangerous potential differences. Explanation In a building with electricity it is normal for safety reasons to connect all metal objects such as pipes together to the mains earth to form an equipotential zone. This is done in the UK because many buildings are supplied with a single phase supply cable where the neutral and earth conductors are combined. Close to the electricity meter this conductor is divided into two, the earth terminal and the wire going to the neutral busbar in the consumer unit. If the ground connection to the neutral is lost, all wiring and other objects tied to the neutral will be energized at the line voltage. Examples of articles that may be bonded include metallic water piping systems, gas piping, ducts for central heating and air conditioning systems, and exposed metal parts of buildings such as hand rails, stairs, ladders, platforms and floors. A person touching the un-earthed metal casing of an electrical device, while also in contact with a metal object connected to remote earth, is exposed to an electric shock hazard if the device has a fault. If all metal objects are connected, all the metal objects in the building will be at the same potential. It then will not be possible to get a shock by touching two 'earthed' objects at once. Bonding is particularly important for bathrooms, swimming pools and fountains. In pools and fountains, any metal object (other than conductors of the power circuit) over a certain size must be bonded to assure that all conductors are at the same potential. Since it is buried in the ground, a pool can be a better ground than the electric panel ground. With all the conducting elements bonded, it is less likely that electric current will find a path through a swimmer. In concrete pools even the reinforcing bars of the concrete must be connected to the bonding system to ensure no dangerous potential gradients are produced during a fault. How the earth protects In a system with a grounded (earthed) neutral, connecting all non-current-carrying metal parts of equipment to earth ground at the main service panel will ensure that current due to faults (such as a \\"hot\\" wire touching the frame or chassis of the device) will be diverted to earth. In a TN system where there is a direct connection from the installation earth to the transformer neutral, earthing will allow the branch circuit over-current protection (a fuse or circuit breaker) to detect the fault rapidly and interrupt the circuit. In the case of a TT system where the impedance is high due to the lack of direct connection to the transformer neutral, an RCD must be used to provide disconnection. RCDs are also used in other situations where rapid disconnection of small earth faults (including a human touching a live wire by accident, or damage) is desired. Equipotential bonding Equipotential bonding involves electrically connecting metalwork so that it is at the same voltage everywhere. Exact rules for electrical installations vary by country, locality, or supplying power company. Equipotential bonding is done from where the distribution wiring enters the building to incoming water and gas services. It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded. Aircraft electrical bonding In aircraft, electrical bonding prevents static electricity build-up that can interfere with radio and navigational equipment. Bonding also provides lightning protection by allowing the current to pass through the airframe with minimum arcing. Bonding prevents dangerous static discharges in aircraft fuel tanks and hoses.Mechanic Support, \\"Aircraft hose and electrical bonding\\" See also * Earthing system * Earth potential rise * Stray voltage * Bonding jumper Notes and references Aircraft hose electrical bondinghttp://www.mechanicsupport.com/hose_electrical_bonding.html Category:Electric power distribution Category:Electrical safety et:Maandamine#Potentsiaal√ºhtluse s√ºsteem ","title":"Electrical bonding"},{"id":"3581036","text":"Smitty was a newspaper comic strip created in the early 1920s by Walter Berndt.

Alex L. Shigo (May 8, 1930 ‚Äì October 6, 2006) was a biologist, plant pathologist with the United States Forest Service whose studies of tree decay resulted in many improvements to standard arboricultural practices. He travelled and lectured widely to promote understanding of tree biology among arborists and foresters. His large body of primary research serves as a broad foundation for further research in tree biology.Urban and Community Forestry in the Northeast, John E. Kuser, Springer, 2006, p 14 Biography Shigo was born in Duquesne, Pennsylvania. He served as a clarinetist with the United States Air Force Band in Washington DC for four years during the Korean War. After his service, he earned a Bachelor of Biological Science degree at Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania, then a PhD in Plant Pathology at West Virginia University in 1960. He joined the U.S. Forest Service as a tree pathologist. He served there as Chief Scientist for 25 years and retired in 1985. Shigo was known for his digressive and philosophical style when writing and speaking, and for his trademarked phrase, ‚Äútouch trees,‚Äù with which he autographed his books.  Research  Early in his career, the first one-man chainsaws became available. These enabled him to prepare longitudinal sections of trees, which allowed him to study the longitudinal spread of decay organisms within them. A major discovery from this work was that trees have ways of walling off decaying tissues, which he named Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees (CODIT). This led to reassessment of arboricultural practices such as pruning techniques and cavity treatments, which showed that many then current practices (such as coating cuts with tar) actually promoted decay or were ineffective. The ANSI A-300 Pruning Standard reflects his recommendations.  Publications  Shigo produced over 270 publications, including many research papers, books, pamphlets, CDs, and DVDs. In retirement, he and his wife Marilyn published these as Shigo and Trees, Associates. He traveled the world doing presentations, workshops, seminars and demonstrations, sharing his passion for trees. The Shigo and Trees, Associates business was transferred to their daughter in 2005.

Frequently, the meet cute leads to a humorous clash of personality or of beliefs, embarrassing situations, or comical misunderstandings that further drive the plot. Etymology The origin of the term is unknown but it appears to have been familiarly associated with Hollywood screenwriting by at least 1941. The earliest example given by the Oxford English Dictionary is from Anthony Boucher's mystery novel The Case of the Solid Key (1941), in which a character says \\"We met cute, as they say in story conferences\\". As this example implies, the term was already well-known, and in a 1996 The Paris Review interview, screenwriter Billy Wilder, referring to his 1938 screwball comedy film Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (in which two characters meet while shopping for pajamas, one seeking a pajama top and the other a pajama bottom) says that the concept was \\"a staple of romantic comedies back then\\". In George Axelrod's play Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), a character explains, Several subsequent examples can be found of reviewers using the term. Bosley Crowther, in his February 1964 review of Sunday in New York, writes that a character \\"is conveniently importuned by this attractive young fellow she happens to run into‚Äîto \\"meet cute,\\" as they say‚Äîon a Fifth Avenue bus\\". Film critics such as Roger EbertThree to Tango \\"meet-cute\\" by Roger Ebert or the Associated Press' Christy Lemire popularized the term in their reviews. In Ebert's commentary for the DVD of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, which he co- wrote, he describes the scene where law student Emerson Thorne bumps into the female character Petronella Danforth. Ebert admits that he, as the screenwriter, wrote into the script a \\"classic Hollywood meet cute\\". He explains the meet cute as a scene \\"in which somebody runs into somebody else, and then something falls, and the two people began to talk, and their eyes meet and they realize that they are attracted to one another\\".
