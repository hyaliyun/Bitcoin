Lady Parsons The Hon. Lady Parsons (n√©e Katharine Bethell) (1859 ‚Äì 16 October 1933) was the co-founder and second President of the Women's Engineering Society (WES), and an engineer in her own right.  Partnership with Charles Parsons  Born to William Frogatt Bethell at Rise Park in the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1859, Katharine met the Hon. Charles Parsons in Leeds in 1882 while he was working there as an engineer. They married in January 1883 and had two children, Algernon George and Rachel Mary.Rolla Appleyard, Charles Parsons: His Life and Work, Constable & Co. Ltd, 1933), p.28. In their early married days Katharine would regularly accompany Charles on 7am morning lakes trials of his prototype torpedoes at Roundhay Park in Leeds. Throughout nearly a half-century of marriage, she was almost always to be found working closely with him on engineering projects - both at home and in the commercial engineering works - especially during the period in which the Parsons steam turbine was developed.  The First World War  Famed for her robust character and exceptional organisational skills, during the First World War Lady Parsons was closely involved in managing the female workforces in Tyneside converted armaments factories. It was for this war work that Lady Parsons was made the first Honorary Fellow of the North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Ship-builders in 1919. Having seen the highly effective deployment of women in engineering work during the Great War, Lady Parsons was robustly critical of the removal of many women from such work under the terms of the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act 1919 that restored many returning male combatants to their pre-war responsibilities. In a widely publicised speech on July 9th 1919: 'Women's Work and Shipbuilding during the War' she deplored the way that women had been required to produce the 'implements of war and destruction' but then be denied 'the privilege of fashioning the munitions of peace.'  The Women's Engineering Society  Just three weeks earlier she had launched the Women's Engineering Society (WES) in collaboration with her daughter Rachel, and five other women of influence, Eleanor Shelley-Rolls; Janetta Mary Ornsby; Margaret D Rowbotham; Margaret, Lady Moir & Laura Annie Willson in order to protect women's position in the field, and enable them to communicate, and especially to share opportunities for training and employment. It was Lady Parsons who appointed Caroline Haslett to be first Secretary of WES in February 1919. Frequent financial challenges arising from the difficulties of prompted Lady Parsons to make substantial donations to keep the fledgling Society afloat. Lady Parsons was also a co-founder of Atalanta Ltd, a company set up specifically to supply employment for women in engineering work. Following a period as President by Rachel Parsons, Lady Parsons was President of WES from 1922 to 1925. Her annual speeches during that WES presidency were described by a contemporary as 'masterly in their range and thorough in details'. In that latter year, however, she broke off relations with WES after a disagreement with Caroline Haslett over the future direction of the Society.  Later years  Lady Parsons served as a magistrate from 1921, and for her public achievements was admitted to the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights and later given the freedom of the City of London. Nevertheless, she also found much time to pursue her pastimes of riding horses, long-distance driving and entertaining guests at the family home of Ray Demesthene at Kirkwhelpington. After Charles Parsons's passing in 1931, Lady Parsons was a major source for Rollo Appleyard's biography of her late husband. She died in 1933 after a long battle with cancer.

He was the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Scotland, and was responsible for a series of popular guidebooks to monuments in public care. Early life and education J.S. (Jamie) Richardson was born in Edinburgh on 2 November 1883 to Dr James T Richardson of North Berwick and his wife Christina Thomson. The family moved to North Berwick in 1887, where Richardson attended first the Abbey School and then North Berwick High School. Richardson developed an early interest in archaeology in which he was encouraged by his father ‚Äì both near to home and on foreign holidays. Richardson was articled to the Edinburgh architect James Macintyre Henry from 1899‚Äì1903, and during this time studied at the School of Applied Art (now part of the Edinburgh College of Art). In 1902 he produced his first publication, co-authored with his father, Prehistoric remains near Gulllane.Richardson & Richardson (1902) In 1903 he joined the office of Robert Lorimer as an assistant, and in 1906 he travelled south to study English church woodwork with Aymer Vallance. Professional life and war-time service Richardson set up his own practise in Edinburgh in 1909. His first notable work was in North Berwick, the angel screen of the south apse of St Baldred Episcopal Church (1909). He was then responsible for the restoration of the ruined church of St Moluag, Teampall Mholuaidh, at Eoropie on the Isle of Lewis. In 1912 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in Scotland and in March 1914 was appointed inspector of Ancient Monuments in Scotland, this being at the time a part-time position. The North Berwick War Memorial On the outbreak of war, the practise closed, and Richardson volunteered for military service and joined the Royal Scots, with whom he had been a volunteer since 1909. His duties were in draft and training, and he spent most of the war in Britain, with time at the front in 1915 and 1918. He did not forget archaeology during this period, and sent some late-Celtic pottery, found in the trenches in France, to the National Museum in Scotland. Richardson's architectural practise resumed in 1919, and the next year John Ross McKay, became a partner. McKay had studied at the School of Applied Art at the same time as Richardson, and had also worked in Lorimer's office. Richardson's position as Inspector of Ancient Monuments became full-time in 1920, and in 1922 he became a part-time lecturer in the Edinburgh College of Art, which had assimilated the School of Applied Art. This left him little time for architectural work, and while Richardson remained a partner, and was able to attract clients through his official position, McKay did most of the practical work. Post-war work by the practice included the North Berwick War Memorial (1920) and the restoration of a fountain in Linlithgow Palace . Richardson and McKay came into conflict with their old boss, Lorimer, over the latter's proposed design for the Scottish National War Memorial. Richardson, as secretary of the Ancient Monuments Board, opposed the design, and was able to defeat the scheme partly by erecting a canvas mock-up of the memorial. Lorimer thought the mock-up gave no idea of what the final work would look like, and described Richardson as an \\"irresponsible devil\\". During the next two decades, he travelled throughout Scotland, inspecting and cataloguing ancient remains, and in many cases making arrangements to take privately owned monuments into public care - in all over 90. Monuments included cairns and stone circles; churches; grave slabs; castles; a water-mill; and wall paintings. Monuments were stabilised and in many cases cleared and laid out for public viewing, and guide-books published for many of the sites (see below). As well as preserving and presenting ancient monuments, Richardson planned and designed the Museum in the Commendator's House at Melrose Abbey. Richardson was also involved in scheduling ancient monuments, enabling the protection of sites that were not in public ownership Richardson carried out a number of archaeological excavations, both of monuments in public care and of other sites. In North Berwick, he discovered many mediaeval floor tiles in a tile-kiln associated with the Cistercian Nunnery.Richardson (1929) In 1932 he excavated a cairn near Kalemouth, Roxburghshire. This was not published until 1951.Richardson & Lindsay (1951) Other investigations included The Broch of Gurness and at Jarlshof, Shetland. Richardson withdrew from architectural practice in 1942, gave up teaching at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1946, and retired from his position as Inspector of Ancient Monuments in 1948. He continued to be involved in archeological and antiquarian activities. He gave a series of lectures on The Mediaeval stone carver in Scotland (not published until 1964),Richardson (1964) was involved in the establishment of the Burgh Museum in North Berwick (opened in 1957) and was often consulted on restorations, in particular by the Queen Mother regarding the Castle of Mey and the garden at Pitmmedden for the National Trust. He suffered a major heart attack in 1969, and died, in North Berwick on 12 September 1970 at the age of 86.

He is one of the pioneers of mechanical computing technology in Germany.  Life  Memorial Journal for Alwin Walther Alwin Walther was born in May 1898 in Reick near Dresden. From 1916 to 1919 Walther served his military service. He was wounded twice and received the Iron Cross 1st Class. From 1919 to 1922 he studied mathematics at the Technical University of Dresden and the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1922, he received his doctorate to Dr. rer. tech. (today according to Dr.-Ing.) from the University of G√∂ttingen. From 1922 to 1928, he was assistant and senior Assistant to Richard Courant at the Mathematical Institute at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1924, he habilitated and became a Privatdozent. The year before, he stayed in Copenhagen for scientific purposes. From 1926 to 1927 he was a Rockefeller Fellow in Copenhagen and Stockholm. On April 1, 1928 Walther became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt and director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics, which he built. In 1955, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Alwin Walther, Heinz Billing, Helmut Schreyer, Konrad Zuse and Alan Turing met in G√∂ttingen in 1947. In the form of a colloquium, British experts (including John R. Womersley, Arthur Porter and Alan Turing) interviewed Walther, Billing, Schreyer and Zuse. Walther retired on September 30, 1966. A few months later he died after a short illness at the age of 68 years in Darmstadt.  Work  Walther attached great importance to questions of the practical application of mathematics. Alwin Walther was one of the first to adapt the mathematics to the requirements of the engineers. In the early 1930s he developed the slide rules \\"System Darmstadt\\", which was widely used in engineering. On his initiative, the German Computing Centre in Darmstadt and the International Computing Centre in Rome were built. Walter was a nominator in two nominations for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Peter Debye (1930) and Enrico Fermi (1936). Peter Schnell, founder of Software AG, Rudolf Zurm√ºhl and Helmut Hoelzer, the inventor and constructor of the world's first electronic analog computer, were his students. From 1952 to 1955 he was chairman of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (GAMM). From 1958 he was board member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and from 1959 to 1962 he was vice president of the newly founded International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). Alwin Walther was active for many years in the Association of Friends of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. In March 1933 he became deputy secretary. In the following year, until the late 1940s, he was their treasurer. In 1950, the general assembly appointed him as honorary member of the Association.  Institute for Applied Mathematics  In 1928, Alwin Walther built the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. It was the first Institute for Applied Mathematics in Germany. The focus of the institute was on the development of electronic arithmetic. Already at the end of the thirties, he set up a computing station in his institute. The computing capacity was unique in Europe at the time. At the computing station two decades before the invention of programming languages, algorithms were tested and used successfully in the processing of problems from industry. In Germany, the beginnings of computer science go back to the Institute for Applied Mathematics of the TH Darmstadt. In 1956, the first programming lectures and internships in Germany were offered at the TH Darmstadt. The Institute for Applied Mathematics contributed to Zuse's Z4 by providing parts and components. IBM 650 at Darmstadt (1957) In 1951, the development of the digital electronic computing machine \\"Darmst√§dter Elektronischer Rechenautomat (DERA)\\" in tube technology was started. Around the same time, Walther procured a computer of the highest performance class, an IBM 650, for the TH Darmstadt. The TH Darmstadt was thus the first university in Germany to have a mainframe computer. Due to the reputation that the TH Darmstadt had at the time in computer science research, the first international congress on computer science held in German-speaking countries took place in October 1955 at the TH Darmstadt.

The Egyptian fruit bat is thought to be a natural reservoir species for the virus.  History  In August 2012, following a six-week field trip to South Sudan and Uganda to collect bats and rodents, an American wildlife biologist became ill with symptoms including fever, malaise, headache, pain, stiffness in the neck, and a sore throat. Upon her return to the US, she was admitted to hospital, where she soon developed a maculopapular rash and oropharyngeal ulceration. Several suspect infections, including Ebola and Marburg, were ruled out through standard diagnostic testing. Genetic sequencing identified a novel virus. To determine the source, tissue samples collected during the three-week period prior to the illness were tested for this new Sosuga virus, and several Egyptian fruit bats were found to be positive. Analysis of historical samples of these bats from sites in Uganda found additional positive individuals, suggesting that this species may be a natural reservoir for Sosuga.  Treatment  Research has identified several compounds which inhibit replication of the Sosuga virus.

Holt (born January 18, 1936) is a radio and television executive who made significant contributions to the early development of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio. As the first programming director at PBS, Holt helped created such programs as Masterpiece Theatre and The MacNeil-Lehrer Report (now PBS NewsHour). When NPR was formed in 1970, the leadership of the network followed many of the recommendations in Holt's report, Public Radio Study, which urged noncommercial radio stations to ‚Äúthink about being something other than ... a classical music turntable.‚Äù  Early years  Holt was born in Alabama on January 18, 1936. His family owned interests in several local radio stations. He studied European history at Princeton University, where he played wingback on the football team and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958. As a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he studied Anglo-American diplomatic history and was a classmate of musician Kris Kristofferson. He received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1960 from Oxford and completed non-thesis doctoral work in military history in 1961. After an internship with CBS TV News in New York, Holt worked as a reporter at WATV Radio in Birmingham, Alabama.  Public radio study  In 1967, Holt began teaching at Harvard and through a television-based course at WGBH-Boston. He became a protege of Hartford N. Gunn Jr. (president of WGBH) and was hired by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to be project director of the Public Radio Study and principal author of the program's 1969 report which ‚Äúoutlined a course of action followed by CPB in developing a national system of public radio.‚Äù Holt found an \\"utter sense of poverty\\" pervading noncommercial radio and made recommendations to strengthen it. \\"When station managers were asked about the first thing they would buy after securing new federal funds, the most frequently mentioned piece of hardware was a typewriter,\\" wrote Michael P. McCauley in his book, NPR. \\"Holt made several recommendations for strengthening the system, including a reallocation of relevant radio frequencies, a strengthening or expansion of FM radio (which had not yet reached its peak of popularity), and the establishment of an advisory board of experienced noncommercial broadcasters.\\"  PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  When PBS was launched, Holt served as its Coordinator of Programming and helped develop such popular series as Masterpiece Theatre, Firing Line, NOVA, The Ascent of Man, and The Electric Company. He expanded news coverage, launching The MacNeil-Lehrer Report (now PBS NewsHour) and Morning Edition, modeled after his Birmingham program Morning Newsstand. At a time when the commercial television networks had no business-news reporting, Holt founded Wall Street Week. He hired Julia Child to ‚Äúmake cooking a public discourse‚Äù and Fred Rogers to launch his program for children.  National Public Radio  National Public Radio launched in 1970 following many of the recommendations made by Holt in his Public Radio Study. In 1977, Holt joined NPR as Senior Vice President for Programming and directed its Programming Division until 1983. There, he created new shows including A Prairie Home Companion, NPR Playhouse, The Sunday Show, and NPR Plus.  Later career  Holt is Chairman and CEO of Content Technologies, Inc. Holt has also served as a Manager and Program Analyst at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission in Washington, DC. He is a director of American Heritage Publishing.

During the 1869‚Äì70 Second German North Polar Expedition this body of water was surveyed by Carl Koldewey, who used the name \\"Tyrolerfjord\\" for the whole water body. Later, during the 1929‚Äì1930 Expedition to East Greenland, Lauge Koch reinstated the name \\"Young Sund\\" for the outer section of the water body. Just north of Daneborg there was a Danish hunting station named Sandodden which is now abandoned.

The website's consensus reads, \\"It's blunt rather than balanced, but Where's My Roy Cohn? does what it sets out to do, offering a disquieting summary of its subject's life and legacy.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Tyrnauer smartly doesn‚Äôt overplay the symbolism of their relationship, or work too hard to connect the dots; it‚Äôs all there to take or leave in the film‚Äôs shrewd, illuminating exploration of a man whose influence, for better or worse, may have far outdone even his wildest dreams\\".

Brian Lowry of CNN wrote, \\"Where's My Roy Cohn? is by no means a flattering portrait; rather, the film portrays Cohn as being emblematic of everything that's wrong with politics, class disparity and the current toxic political environment\\".

It was built in about 1865 for the Pryce Jones family after an earlier hall on the site burned down. It once formed part of the 1,922-acre Cyfronydd Estate. Cyfronydd Hall was sold by Major Hamilton Pryce in 1927 and at that time it had 19 bedrooms and one bathroom. In 1938 it was purchased for ¬£7,250 by Montgomeryshire County Council for use as a girls' school and remodelled, with the number of bedrooms being reduced to 14 and the number of bathrooms increased to four. The property at that time had 44 acres of land. In the 1990s the property was bought by an English couple, Jeff and Jean Bowskill, who gradually repaired and improved the property over a ten year period. They added a swimming pool and a spa and sold the property in 2015 to William Hague and Ffion Hague. The estate now has 12.7 acres. www.walesonline.co.uk; adalwyd 2015.www.walesonline.co.uk; adalwyd 2015. Architecture Pevsner Architectural Guides describe the present building briefly as follows:Haslam, Richard: The Buildings of Wales, Founding Editor: Nikolaus Pevsner, Powys, page 97. London: Penguin Group, 2001. \\"Large square brick house of c. 1865 with vaguely French detail, particularly on the three- storey entrance tower with its chateau roof.\\" Country Life has described the building more enthusiastically as follows: > an elegantly symmetrical country house built around an impressive central > atrium flooded with light from the glass ceiling overhead. Radiating out > from the hall are the main reception rooms-drawing room, dining room, > sitting room and library-all of which have large sash windows with > spectacular panoramic views over the rolling countryside of the majestic > Banwy valley. An intimate study overlooks the rear garden, with its towering > beeches, oaks and cedars. The first floor houses the splendid master suite > and five further bedrooms, which all have luxurious bathrooms.

The union was established due to dissatisfaction with the official shooting association at that time called Centralforeningen for Udbr√¶delse af Legems√∏velser og Vaabenbrug (lit. The Association for Physical Exercise and use of Firearms) At the start of the 1880s, member dissatisfaction in the Centralforeningen increased since the members had no influence over the association. The first Folkev√¶pningssamlag was established after initiative by Inntr√∏ndelag school manager Ole Five on a meeting with representatives from the shooting clubs in Northern Trondhjems amt on 29 January 1881. The following year, the Folkev√¶pningssamlag had clubs in 12 of the 20 amts in Norway, and a board was established in Kristiania between 6 and 8 February 1882, with Ole Five as chairman. The primary goal of the Folkev√¶pningssamlag's was to strengthen Norway's defense capabilities, especially by training the people in shooting and by ensuring that modern firearms became widespread.folkev√¶pningssamlag ‚Äì Great Norwegian Encyclopedia Already in 1881, the Storting had granted a smaller sum for purchasing firearms and ammunition, and in 1882 a larger sum was granted. However, the Regjeringrefused to approve the grant. This disagreement was a key part in theimpeachment of the Selmer Ministry in 1884. The member numbers of the Folkev√¶pningssamlag's increased from 13 000 in 1882 to 18 000 (distributed over 586 shooting clubs) in 1890. In 1892, a Royal Order in Council (kongelig resolusjon) ordered a strengthening in the collaboration between the Folkev√¶pningssamlag's and the Norwegian Army. The Folkev√¶pningssamlag's were allowed to borrow firearms from the army, under the condition that the Folkev√¶pningssamlags hired shooting instructors with military education, and that military officers were allowed to inspect the training. At the same time, the Storting increased their grants for purchasing rifles. In 1893, all rifle shooting clubs in Norway were gathered under one organisation when the Folkev√¶pningssamlags and the shooting part of Centralforeningen together formed the National Rifle Association of Norway (Det frivillige skyttervesen, DFS). Still today, this organisation is the largest sport shooting association in Norway.

Brennan ( ‚Äì August 18, 1889) was the first American Catholic priest to declare bankruptcy. Personal life Brennan was born in Indiana but spent most of his childhood in Taunton, Massachusetts. He was ordained a priest at Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al in 1856. He was graduated from the College of the Holy Cross on July 6, 1859. While in Foxborough his health declined to the point where he had to give up his priestly duties. He spent the last four years of his life at his mother's house on Washington Street in Taunton, bedridden with chronic rheumatism, where he died on August 18, 1889. Ministry His first assignment was in Roxbury before becoming the resident pastor of St. Mary's Church in Dedham, Massachusetts. Brennan took over for his uncle, the founding pastor, Patrick O'Beirne. He served at St. Mary's from 1866-1877. The rectory Brennan purchased in 1867 In June 1867, a house was purchased on High Street by Brennan and was converted into a rectory. Plans were then made for a new church to be constructed at this location. The current church was constructed next door to the rectory Father Brennan established on High Street. While in Dedham he also had care of what is today St. Catherine's Church in Norwood, Massachusetts, which he improved during his pastorate. During his pastorate in Dedham, the Sisters of Charity founded the St. Mary's School and Asylum at what was formerly Temperance Hall, where some of the first masses were said in Dedham two decades before. At news of the sale, the Dedham Gazette wrote in an editorial: > Whatever prejudices may naturally exist against the establishment of a Roman > Catholic School in so central a location, the community cannot but feel that > the transformation of a building recently used only for the indiscriminate > sale of liquors into an institution founded for 'promoting virtue, learning > and piety in the town of Dedham' is an object worthy only of the most > exalted motives, and in this view should be accepted as a public blessing. The school held a number of fundraisers, but with the heavy debt of the parish the school closed on June 27, 1879. The closure was intended to be temporary, but it never reopened. The building was sold in 1905. It was a \\"somewhat pleasant surprise\\" when it was announced on January 14, 1877, that Brennan would be leaving St. Mary's and St. Catherine's and that the parish would be turned over to his curate, Dennis J. O'Donovan. Many in the congregation had been unhappy with Brennan and the week before he became the first priest to ever file for bankruptcy. The parish was also bankrupt at the time. In the early 1880s he served at St. Mary's Church in Foxborough, Massachusetts. In 1883 he was serving in the Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts.

Berliner Herbstsalon at Maxim Gorki Theatre, October- November 2019. Original graffiti from Srebrenica Bosnian Girl is an art work by a visual artist ≈†ejla Kameriƒá that started in 2003 as a public project consisting of postcards, posters, billboards, that is exhibited either as an intervention into public space or as a black and white photograph in various dimensions. It was done in collaboration with photographer Tarik Samarah.  Description and Analysis  Denigrating phrases about Bosnian women are superimposed over a black and white photograph of the artist staring straight at the viewer. Taken from graffiti written by an unknown Dutch soldier in 1994/5, a member of the Royal Netherlands Army who, as part of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992-95, were responsible for protecting the Srebrenica safe area. The artist‚Äôs gaze is unflinching, direct and challenges not just the words pushed onto her, and all Bosnian women, but invites us to see their new form of identity ‚Äì where victimhood and prejudice, the past and the future are intertwined in co- existing opposition. Originally a series of posters publicly displayed on the 2003 anniversary of the Srebenica genocide, this work has become iconic of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, a direct confrontation of war crimes committed against women and the prejudices that came during and after it.

Plot  Gundu Kaakka is a struggling harmonium player, who aspires to join a local drama troupe. One day, after watching a 3D movie, he presents a pair of 3D glasses to his sisters, Pradnya and Pratheeksha. He tells them that the glasses give only him some magical powers. Though they initially refuse to believe him, an event soon raises the sisters' curiosity. The determined sisters set on a path to find out the truth about the glasses, along which tiny stories of the little village start to unfold.  Production  A Thing of Magic was filmed by a crew of five members with a 60,000 rupees budget, paid by Anil in order to keep the creative control over the movie. The entire film's cast were first-time actors and residents of the village in Maharashtra where the story is set. The production team rented a house, which became an audition camp. They were approached, found, and brought to the set by knocking on doors on the day a particular scene was to be shot. Around a hundred people acted in the film. Most of the villagers had no idea about the process of film-making.

FETs' tasks are as varied as American FETs interacting with local Afghan women in Afghanistan; Ghana Battalion FETs taking part in gathering intelligence during peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo; New Zealand Defence Force FETs support Special Operations Force objectives, the primary role being to \\"engage with local women and adolescents [...] in situations where it would be culturally unacceptable to involve male SOF operators\\", and the Jordanian Armed Forces FETs helping to conduct physical searches of woman along the borders. However FETs also have had their fair share of limited success and problems in certain operations, with service personnel unable to interact successfully with the required population, lack of translators, too short a time frame or commanders refusing to take up FET missions. Female Engagement Teams have their roots in American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the form of Team Lioness between 2003 and 2004. In 2009 the US Marine Corps attached FETs to infantry units. One of the first FET programs is with 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, Farah Province, Afghanistan.

The ROG Phone II was announced in July 2019 and competes with the Xiaomi Black Shark 2 Pro and ZTE Nubia Red Magic 3s.  Specifications  =Hardware= The ROG Phone II's overall design is similar to its predecessor, using a metal chassis and a glass backplate. It retains the RGB-illuminated logo on the back of the device which can be user-customized to show different colors. The fingerprint sensor is no longer located on the back, as an under-display optical sensor is used instead. Two LED modules are located next to the camera, one of which acts as a flash and the other is an RGB LED used to light up the optional Lighting Armour case. The front of the phone features front- facing stereo speakers on either side of the display, and a camera built into the top bezel. The screen has a refresh rate of 120 Hz compared to the 90 Hz refresh rate of the original ROG Phone, which can be configured to 60/90/120 Hz in the phone settings. The display itself is a 6.59-inch 1080p AMOLED panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6 and supports DCI-P3 and HDR10 with 240 Hz touch sensing. The device uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ SoC and speed-binned Adreno 640 GPU, paired with 8 or12 GB of RAM and 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. Power is provided by a 6000 mAh battery, and 30 W fast charging is supported along with 10 W reverse charging. Signature features such as the 'vapor-chamber' cooling technology and custom double USB-C port on the side of the phone have also been carried over. The ultrasonic 'air triggers' have been improved as well, with faster haptic feedback. Gaming accessories are also available including the AeroActive Cooler II, the ROG Kunai Gamepad and Twinview Dock II. Camera A dual camera system is used, with a primary sensor and an ultrawide sensor. The main lens has a new Quad-Bayer 48 MP unit, while the ultrawide lens has a 13 MP unit. Neither of the lenses has OIS, but the main lens has PDAF and Laser AF. Users can select Night mode and Pro mode as well. The rear cameras are capable of shooting 4K video at 30 or 60 fps in addition to 1080p at 30, 60 or 240 fps and slow-motion 720p at 480 fps. Gyro- EIS augments video, but it is not supported if 240 fps or 480 fps is used. The front camera has a 24 MP sensor which can record 1080p video at 30 fps. Both the front and rear cameras can film panoramas and utilise HDR. =Software= The ROG Phone II uses ROG UI, a modified Asus skin based on Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\", but can be configured to use the standard ZenUI 6 found on the ZenFone 6, which functions very similarly to stock Android. The phone has several preloaded gaming-focused apps such as ASUS Armoury Crate which gives users advanced control over the hardware and software by allowing per-game performance profiles to be set up, as well as enabling detailed configuration of the RGB LEDs on the phone and its accessories. The phone also comes with Game Genie, which allows live configuration of phone settings in game and provides a moveable UI element displaying FPS, temperature and clock speeds. It also enables configuration of AirTriggers, game specific macros, silencing notifications and a record or live stream function. As of March 2020, the ROG Phone II now officially supports Android 10.

Life and work  Adam Magyar was born in Hungary in 1972. He began taking pictures in his late twenties, when he started wandering Asian cities capturing their street life in images of Indian street vendors, wandering holy men, and students in an exclusive Himalayan school. Obsessed with finding innovative new uses for digital technology, Magyar's work quickly evolved from conventional documentary photography to the radically experimental and surreal. Among Magyar's numerous inventions is a way to insert motion into still images. In his attempt to comprehend the interface of time's infinite flow in the world's modern metropolises, he has developed techniques to capture, on a single visual plane, disjointed, fragmented images of parts of an individual or group on a crowded street. A theme that recurs throughout much of his body of work is based on interlinking yet distinct ideas and techniques that aid us to see the inherent beauty found in the everyday. His unique vision and technical abilities has inevitably led him to modify and even develop his own hardware and software. In his Urban Flow and Stainless works he uses the slit-scan photography technique, known also for use in photo finish cameras, as well as in other, often industrial, techniques.

Lacy, who was black, had been dating a white woman, who also believed Lacy had been murdered, and who claimed neighbors had warned her that their interracial relationship was \\"not right\\".

Life Maude Glasgow was born in Cookstown, Ireland in 1876. Her father was Silas Glasgow of Killycurragh. She had a brother James later of Moneymore. She was educated in the Marlborough Street College in Dublin before she emigrated to New York. Her sister Janet is remembered for having supported Glasgow during her time in education. Once she was settled in New York she attended the Mount Sinai Training School for Nurses where she got a degree in nursing. But she wanted to learn more so she continued her studies and received a degree in medicine in 1901 from Cornell University Medical College. Glasgow got a job with Department of Health in New York. She was appointed as medical inspector. She also spent time as the New York Telephone Company's chief woman physician looking after the health of the employees and responsible for public health education. In 1921 she went on to get a further degree in public health from New York University and Bellevue Medical College. She was particularly interested in the welfare of women. Glasgow donated to funds to encourage young women to study medicine and created an award, the Janet M. Glasgow Memorial Award, named after her sister, to the woman who graduates first in her class. It is moderated by the American Medical Women‚Äôs Association. There are also citations for the women who graduate in the top 10% of their class. She regularly wrote on the difficulties facing women, on suffrage and the importance of women's ability to take part in society without the obstacles which were artificially put in their way. Glasgow was a member of both the International Mark Twain and Eugene Field Societies as well as the Medical Women's National Association. She published a number of books about medicine and women's health as well as the emigration of the Scots-Irish to the US. She was also remembered in her obituary as a suffragist and activist in equal rights for women and people of all races. She died in 1955.

Taxonomy Dermanura rava was described as a new species in 1902 by American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller. The holotype had been collected in San Javier of northern Ecuador by \\"G. Fleming\\", often given by others as Flemming. Georg Flemming was a collector of biological specimens for William Frederick Henry Rosenberg, along with Rudolf Miketta. Dermanura species have frequently been included in the genus Artibeus, so D. rava has also been known as Artibeus ravus. Additionally, it was listed as a synonym of the pygmy fruit- eating bat (Dermanura phaeotis) in 1978 and 1982 publications. However, subsequent molecular analysis showed that D. rava was genetically distinct from the pygmy fruit-eating bat. Its sister taxon is Andersen's fruit-eating bat (Dermanura anderseni). Description Its fur is yellowish brown, and its face has four indistinct, whitish stripes. Its ears and flight membranes are light brown, with the margins of the flight membranes whitish. Based on the holotype, it has a forearm length of approximately . Range and habitat D. rava is found in the following countries: Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It has been documented at a range of elevations from above sea level. Conservation As of 2019, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because of its wide geographic range, which includes large tracts of intact forest. It is considered relatively abundant, and no major threats to it or its habitat have been identified.

Administrative and municipal status  Municipally, Bamut is incorporated as Bamutskoye rural settlement. It is the administrative center of the municipality and is the only settlement included in it.  Geography  Map of Achkhoy-Martanovsky District (until 8 Sep 2019). Bamut is in the west Map of Sunzhensky District (after 8 Sep 2019). Bamut is in the south-east Bamut is located on both banks of the Fortanga River. It is located west of the town of Achkhoy-Martan and west of the city of Grozny. The nearest settlements to Bamut are Katyr-Yurt in the east, Shalazhi, Stary Achkhoy and Yandi in the south-east, Arshty in the south-west, Nesterovskaya in the north-west, and Assinovskaya and Novy Sharoy in the north.  History  From 1922 to 1934, Bamut was a part of the Ingush Autonomous Oblast. In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Bamut was renamed to Bukovka, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Bummat. During the First Chechen War, the infamous Battle of Bamut occurred in the village. At the start of the Second Chechen War, in the fall of 1999, the territory of Bamut was completely closed to civilians. The settlement was only unblocked again in April 2002. In the fall of 2014, by decree of the leadership of the Chechen Republic, a large-scale restoration of the village, which was completely destroyed, was launched. The opening of the revived village of Bamut took place on 3 December 2014. On 8 September 2019, a referendum was held in Bamut on the transfer of the settlement to the Chechen section of Sunzhensky District. According to the official results, 1,565 people (73.61% of residents of Bamut) took part in the referendum, in which 84.98% of people voted in favor of the transfer, and 14.82% of people voted against it.  Population  * 1990 Census: 5,858 * 2002 Census: 5,137 * 2010 Census: 6,025 * 2019 estimate: 5,589 According to the results of the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Bamut (6,013 or 99.80%) were ethnic Chechens, with 12 people (0.20%) coming from other ethnic backgrounds. According to the 2002 Census, 5,137 people (2,465 men and 2,672 women) lived in Bamut.

She was born in Helmstedt to parents Hans Hampe and Emmy Busch. According to The Woman Engineer, Hampe was the first German member of the Women's Engineering Society, which she joined in 1929.  Education and Career  Asta Hampe was educated at the Klosterschule, Hamburg and the Technische Hochschule, Munich, where she was one of five women among 500 men. Her further studies were financially supported by her grandfather and uncle. In 1931, she received her diploma in engineering and she went on to work as an assistant at the Research Laboratory at Friedrich Krupp AG, Essen. In 1933, she was fired from her job at Barmbek Hospital for being a woman, with the dismissal saying that Physics is no profession for a woman, therefore, Hampe must be dismissed. In 1938, she wrote to the Women's Engineering Society about her position at Philips' radio. During the Second World War, Hampe was recruited to work as a physicist for the German Marines. From 1968-69, she held a professor position at the Philips University in Marburg.  Membership of the Women's Engineering Society  Records from the Women's Engineering Society (WES) show that professor Hampe was an active member. She provided a listing for herself in the 1935 Register of Women Engineers and, in the same year, attended the thirteenth annual conference for the society speaking to delegates about her experiences as an engineer in Germany. In response to the toast by Amy Johnson (under her married name Mrs J Mollison) to women engineers across the world, Hampe is reported to have outlined some of the changes for women in engineering in Germany following the election of the National Socialist party, though mostly there were training opportunities for women and some employment options. In The Woman Engineer in 1986, there is a listing for Professor Dr Asta Hampe as a full member. Further reading * Maul, B√§rbel (2002): Akademikerinnen in der Nachkriegszeit.

He served as mayor of Beit Shemesh from 2008 to 2018, before being elected to the Knesset for the Shas party the following year. Biography Born in Beersheba, Moshe grew up in a traditional household and studied at a secular school. From age 9-14, he lived at Zion Blumenthal Orphanage, and later studied at the branch of the Itri Yeshiva in Beit Shemesh. He performed his military service as a driver in a tracker unit, and in the military rabbinate. When he married Esther in 1986, he settled in Beit Shemesh. The couple has eight children. Abutbul was a radio broadcaster on Radio 10, an ultra-Orthodox pirate radio station, and acted in several films aimed at the ultra-Orthodox public. Over the years, he moved to public sector activity, and between 1993‚Äì2018, he served as a member of the Beit Shemesh City Council, in charge of the Engineering and Construction Division of the municipality, the Deputy Mayor, and his place on behalf of Shas. He was elected mayor in November 2008, with 45.74% of voter votes. In 2013, Abutbul ran again for mayor, facing Eli Cohen, a candidate for the Jewish House party supported by the \\"Zionist bloc\\" parties. Abutbul was elected for a second term, with 51% of the vote. The election campaign was accompanied by tensions between ultra-Orthodox and secularists, and due to a genuine suspicion of forgery revealed by members of the ultra-Orthodox \\"power\\" faction, protests were held against Abutbul's victory. Finally, the court ordered re-election. They were held on 11 March 2014, and Abutbul was re- elected, with about 51% of the vote. In the local elections in 2018, Abutbul ran for a third term, and lost, by a gap of 533 votes, to Dr. Aliza Bloch. After the loss, he announced his retirement from public office life. Still, Abutbul was placed ninth on the list of Shas for the 21st Knesset, but, as Shas did not receive 9 seats, did not enter. He was stationed in the same place in elections to the 22nd Knesset, and subsequently entered the Knesset (as Shas received 9 seats in the elections).

She was known in business as Mrs E. H. Gasking.  Early life  Ella Hudson Batchelor was born in Sheffield in 1891 and was educated at the Central Secondary School in the city. She was the second daughter in the family of at least four sons and two daughters of William and Annie Batchelor. Her father was a tea packer and produce merchant in Sheffield and found a way to preserve vegetables, especially peas, by canning. He opened a factory and the firm, Batchelor's Peas Ltd, had grown to employ 50 people when he died at the age of 53 in 1913. His wife was an invalid and his sons soon left to fight in the First World War, and so it was left to his daughter, who had joined the business aged 18, to take over as managing director of the company.  Career  Although she did a course of teacher training, Ella had had no formal business education. She later said that 'I myself never even dreamed of being a business woman ... I took over because I had to'. Under her leadership the factory expanded and Batchelors became a household name. A 1937 article noted that '... her leadership and business acumen have developed what was originally a small family business into a great undertaking with a turnover of a million a year ... Mrs Gasking believes that knowing whom to trust is half the battle in business. She sums people up astutely, and can tell at once whether or not they are worthy of confidence. Also, she has charm - the power of winning other people.' Her younger brothers Maurice and Frederick joined the Batchelors firm after the First World War. While peas remained the main product, production expanded to soups, other vegetables and fruit. Ella Gasking opened a new pea canning factory at Wadsley Bridge, Sheffield, in 1937. It was then the largest canning plant in Britain, covering 12 acres. It cost the then enormous sum of ¬£100,000 and was built and fitted with the latest technology ‚Äì including electric appliances ‚Äì and facilities and services for workers (who were predominantly female), including keep-fit classes, tennis courts, hockey pitches and showers. She also visited the United States to investigate the latest canning methods and attended the American Canners' Convention in Chicago. She was a member of the Women's Engineering Society and 1938 shared an article about the new factory, which produced 1.5 million tins of peas a week. Batchelors was taken over by Unilever in 1943, but Ella Gasking continued to work in the business until she retired as chairman and joint managing director in 1948. In that year she was appointed OBE in the Birthday Honours in recognition of her contribution to the grocery industry and to the war effort, as the firm had been a leading supplier of canned goods to the British armed forces. She was appointed a member of the British Transport Commission Hotels Executive in May 1948, and was a part-time member of the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive in 1949.  Personal life and interests  Ella Batchelor married Cyril Trist Gasking, then a medical student serving in the army, on 11 February 1915 in her hometown. Ella had a number of different interests outside her family business, including golf, gardening, travelling, cattle breeding and, especially, horse racing.

Though both were leaders of local branches of larger rebel groups that were involved in the Second Sudanese Civil War (the SPDF and SPLA, respectively), the confrontation between the two commanders was essentially a private war. As Par and Gadet battled each other, the Sudanese government exploited the inter-rebel conflict as part of a divide and rule-strategy, aimed at weakening the rebellion at large and allowing for the extraction of valuable oil in Unity State. In the end, Gadet and Par reconciled when their respective superiors agreed to merge the SPDF and SPLA.  Background  Following its independence in 1956, the Sudan had suffered from numerous internal conflicts over political, ethnic, economic, and religious issues. In 1983, revolutionaries and separatists from the country's marginalized south launched an uprising against the government which was traditionally dominated by elites from the north. The Second Sudanese Civil War had begun, and fighting spread across southern, eastern and western Sudan. The most prominent southern rebel group was the \\"Sudan People's Liberation Army\\" (SPLA) under the leadership of John Garang. As the war escalated and spread, the SPLA grew increasingly powerful and overran much of southern Sudan. Despite these successes, the SPLA faced major internal and external opposition. Many southern Sudanese outright opposed the group for a variety of reasons, and instead sided with the government or set up rival insurgent movements. In addition, Garang's leadership style caused tensions within the SPLA. He was charismatic, and a capable military commander, but also brutal and autocratic, suppressing and even executing critics. Two prominent SPLA commanders, Riek Machar and Lam Akol, attempted to overthrow Garang in an unsuccessful coup in 1991. The SPLA consequently split into warring factions, and the Sudanese government exploited this by employing a divide and rule strategy. It occasionally supported Machar's group (SPLA-United) so that it could fight against and weaken Garang's faction (SPLA-Mainstream). In the next decade, alliances and militias formed and broke up again, while warlords carved out their own domains. The Sudanese government increasingly focused on clearing areas in the south for oil extraction instead of winning the war, as it was in desperate need of cash. As time went on, oil money became crucial for the Sudanese war effort. One of the centers of oil production was Unity State, also known as Western Upper Nile. To secure the oil wells and pipelines and open land for oil extraction, the government often employed southern militias. These paramilitaries knew the terrain, were more expendable than Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) units, and allowed the government to frame the civil war as anarchic tribal infighting to deflect criticism of its own governance. Oil fields and infrastructure in Sudan and South Sudan The most prominent pro- government paramilitary group of southern Sudan was the SSDF. The SSDF was an umbrella organization for several armed factions, including Machar's loyalists and the troops of warlords like ex-Anyanya II leader Paulino Matip Nhial. It proved to be unstable and affected by internal rivalries, and gradually broke apart. Different SSDF factions already fought each other in 1997 and 1998, and the government allowed it to happen as it mistrusted most of the SSDF anyway. The combat between the pro-government militias was fuelled by a desire of the warlords to control the oil-rich areas and thereby increase their revenue. Matip managed to oust Machar's followers and other rivals from the valuable region around Bentiu, drawing the latter's ire. At the same time, the regime intensified efforts to take full control of the Block 5A oilfields in Unity State. These were held by Machar's forces, and he protested that the oil fields should remain under his control. The government responded by launching a campaign to drive away civilians and Machar's troops from drilling locations in Block 5A such as Thar Jath. Spearheaded by the SAF, northern militias, and Matip's force, entire tracts of land were depopulated. In response, Machar's local loyalists under Tito Biel and Peter Par Jiek aligned with the SPLA and counterattacked. A chaotic and brutal campaign ensued, as the military and numerous militias fought over control of the oil fields. In September 1999, most of Matip's militia revolted under Peter Gadet, as they were upset how the government was using local Nuer militias (like themselves) against other Nuer, while excluding them from the oil revenues. This was a major setback for the government. Gadet was a highly competent commander, and quickly captured the arms depot at Makien military base. He subsequently unified his force with the militias of other regional warlords such as Biel and Par to form the \\"Upper Nile Provisional United Military Command Council\\". The rebel alliance proceeded to capture several important oil wells, and the towns of Buoth, Rier, and Tan near Bentiu. The Upper Nile Provisional United Military Command Council broke apart after the return of Riek Machar (pictured 2014) to southern Sudan. The insurgents consequently agreed to split Unity State. Gadet and Par were assigned territories mostly in accordance to the ethnic groups which supported them: Gadet, an ethnic Bul Nuer, got Mayom and Wangkei (inhabited by Bul Nuer), while Par, a Dok Nuer, was granted Bentiu, Thar Jath, Leer, and Adok (territory of the Dok, Jikany, Jagei, and Leek Nuer). The \\"Upper Nile Provisional United Military Command Council\\" alliance was quite successful, and the united forces of Gadet and Par defeated the SAF and Matip's militia in several battles. This adversely affected government control over Unity State, and reduced local oil production. The situation changed once again in February 2000, when Machar openly broke with the government, fully left the SSDF, and founded the SPDF rebel group. This development resulted in new tensions among the insurgents of Unity State. Machar loyalists like Par and Biel joined the SPDF, while Gadet had officially sided with SPLA- Mainstream ‚Äì Machar's declared enemy. Limited clashes between Gadet and some Machar loyalists, though not between Gadet and Par, broke out soon after. Despite the tensions and opposing political alignments, cooperation mostly continued until the Sudanese government launched another major offensive in Unity State in April 2000. This offensive pushed the rebel alliance to the breaking point. Old rivalries came to the fore, fuelled by the government's divide and rule strategy.  History  = Start of the conflict = Oil processing facility in Unity State (pictured 2012) The cooperation between Peter Par and Peter Gadet broke down in June‚ÄìJuly 2000, as their militias began to fight each other. Who was responsible for the outbreak of hostilities is unknown, as both sides blamed each other. The SPDF stated that its forces were attacked by Gadet loyalists \\"for no reason\\" in Nimne on 26 June 2000. The SPLA argued that Par had executed 22 fighters loyal to Gadet in December 1999 and June 2000, and forged an alliance with the Sudanese government. This had allegedly forced the SPLA to act. Tribal tensions between Dok and Bul Nuer may have contributed to the conflict. At least some locals framed the Par-Gadet fighting as Dok-Bul tribal war. In any case, Gadet launched a surprise attack on Nimne on 26 June or 7 July, resulting in open war. The conflict subsequently became known as \\"War of the Peters\\". As Par and Gadet clashed with each other, the Sudanese government eagerly exploited the situation. It provided ammunition to Par as long as he fought against the SPLA and left pro- government troops alone. Most of the SPDF officially denied the reports of government support: Machar publicly claimed that the ammunition had come from secret stockpiles, and another SPDF commander stated that they had bought it from Baggara tribesmen. Taban Deng Gai admitted that Par had received one arms shipment from the government \\"to survive\\". In fact, cooperation between Par and the government increased in intensity. Matip's SSDF militia began to openly fight alongside Par's men, and the latter also guarded government installations, especially the oil extraction facilities of Thar Jath in Block 5A. The SPDF even protected the road to Thar Jath, allowing Lundin Petroleum to access a new drilling site in Block 5A. Regardless, Par officially remained in opposition to the government. = Escalation and conclusion = Oil Concessions in South Sudan. Between July and August 2000, Par joined forces with Matip's militia and attacked Gadet's forces in the area between Nimne and Nhialdiu. They gradually pushed the SPLA westward, attacking Wicok, Buoth, Boaw, and Koch in succession. Most of Gadet's troops were forced to flee across the Jur River, and only Buoth remained under SPLA control. At the same time, Gadet was resupplied by the SPLA central command, and recruited new troops, including at least 400 child soldiers. He launched a counter-offensive in August 2000, and had retaken most of the lost ground by late September. When they captured Koch, Gadet's men killed two health workers and stole the local clinic's medical supplies. Meanwhile, tensions grew between Par and SPDF co-commander Tito Biel. To avoid war between them, Machar sent Biel to Maiwut County where he was supposed to rally Jikany Nuer to the SPDF's cause. The War of the Peters was brutal, led to enormous destruction, and displaced up to 60,000 people. Many civilians fled to Bahr el Ghazal, and although hunger and disease spread among the refugees, most subsequently chose to stay as their old homes had been destroyed. Both sides used scorched earth tactics, and completely destroyed many settlements, including Nhialdiu. Schools were also targeted, and the militants killed, raped, and abducted many civilians. The war also increased lower-level tribal conflicts between the Bul and Dok Nuer. The region became too dangerous for the delivery of humanitarian aid, worsening the civilians' suffering. The Sudanese government and the oil companies benefitted greatly from the War of the Peters, as the inter-rebel fighting allowed them to boost the oil extraction. In turn, the government was able to increase its defense expenditure and acquire new weaponry for the civil war. Frontlines in June 2001: government control in red, SPDF territory in green, SPLA territory in blue. Gadet's troops attacked the United Nations relief hub of Nyal inside SPDF territory in February 2001. This almost resulted in a further escalation, as the attack was regarded as breach of an earlier peace agreement between Nuer and Dinka militias that was still partially in effect. In addition, this raid caused tensions in Par's militia. Nyal was traditionally Nyuong Nuer territory, and the Nyuong fighters of Par's force believed that the Dok and Bul were spreading their destructive tribal conflict to Nyuong lands. As a result, a shootout between Nyuong and Dok militants erupted at Par's base in Nyal in early May 2001. Gadet launched another major raid against Bentiu, a center of the regional oil infrastructure, on 8 June 2001. The SPLA-Mainstream used the occasion to warn oil companies to withdraw from Sudan, threatening that they were regarded as military targets by the rebels. The War of the Peters continued until August 2001, when Par and Gadet agreed to a ceasefire. A few months later, Machar came to an understanding with the SPLA leadership and agreed to merge the SPDF with SPLA-Mainstream, whereupon Par and Gadet signed a final peace agreement in Koch in February 2002. Par and his faction joined the SPLA, and he and Gadet formally merged their armies. In contrast, Tito Biel was opposed to joining SPLA-Mainstream, and defected to Matip's militia.  Aftermath  The restoration of a rebel alliance in Unity State resulted in growing insecurity in the Block 5A oilfield. Lundin Petroleum suspended opeations at Thar Jath, forcing the government to launch new costly offensives in Unity State in 2002. The offensives proved to be successful enough to serve as a model for other military operations. Fighting continued, and allegiances continued to shift in Unity State. In particular, Gadet would play out the SPLA and the government against each other to gain power, and eventually fully defected back to the pro-government forces. The Second Sudanese Civil War ended in 2005, and South Sudan became independent in 2011. Many issues of the conflict remained unresolved, and most southern warlords such as Gadet continued to maintain their private armies. The warlords occasionally revolted, and South Sudan remained politically unstable. The country descended into another civil war in late 2013. Par and Gadet died during this conflict: The former was killed fighting against his former superior, Machar, while the latter died after a heart attack.

Early life and education  Ayyalasomayajula Lalitha was born in Madras (now Chennai) on 27 August 1919. She was married at 15 and in 1937, gave birth to her daughter Syamala. Her husband died four months later. Her father, Pappu Subba Rao, supported her wish to complete her secondary education and study engineering at the otherwise all-male College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG) where he was a professor. At CEG, Lalitha studied alongside other women engineers P.K. Thressia and Leelamma Koshie (nee George). As per her daughter, Lalitha was supported in the college by the administration and other students. ‚Ä≥Contrary to what people might think, the students at amma‚Äôs college were extremely supportive. She was the only girl in a college with hundreds of boys but no one ever made her feel uncomfortable and we need to give credit to this. The authorities arranged for a separate hostel for her too. I used to live with my uncle while amma was completing college and she would visit me every weekend. Lalitha graduated in 1943 with a degree in electrical engineering - becoming India's first woman engineer. She completed her practical training with a one year apprenticeship in Jamalpur Railway Workshop, a major repair and overhaul facility.  Engineering career  After graduation, Lalitha worked at Central Standards Organisation, Shimla and helped her father research smokeless ovens and the jelectromonium (an electrical musical instrument). She spent a year of practical training in the electrical department of the East Indian Railways, before becoming a technical assistant in the Indian Government‚Äôs Office of the Electrical Commissioner. Following this, in 1948, Lalitha joined a British firm Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in Calcutta and worked on the largest dam in India, Bhakra Nangal Dam, designing transmission lines, and substation layouts. She worked at AEI (later taken over by General Electric Company) for nearly thirty years before she retired in 1977. In 1953 the Council of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) of London elected her to be an associate member, and promoted her to full member in 1966.

In the UK she became a member of the Women's Engineering Society, serving on the Council and supporting efforts to encourage British women to become engineers.  Biography  = Early Career = Rischowski was born in Germany in 1899 to Albert Rischowski (b. 10 January 1848 - ) and Ida n√©e Salomonsohn (12 June 1867‚Äì 26 November 1943), the eldest of four children. The family were Jewish by heritage but the children were baptised. Albert Rischowski ran shipyards and took young Ira with him to watch the riveting of the ships which inspired her to become an engineer. Rischowski at TH Darmstadt c.1920 - 22 In 1919, Rischowski enrolled as the first female engineering student at the Technical University in Darmstadt. Her successful application was supported by six months experience repairing agricultural equipment. From 1928, Rischowski was employed as an engineer, following training at the electrical company Siemens-Schuckert. In 1930 Rischowski became a member of Germany's central engineering institution, the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI). In 1933, there was a women's section in the VDI, but Rischowski refused to join it since it was affiliated with the Nazi Party. = Anti-Nazi Resistance = Rischowski joined the underground anti-fascist group Neu Beginnen in 1932 and became a key clandestine operative with codename 'Gabriele'. She was responsible for encoding and decoding correspondence with comrades abroad. In 1933, the group's operational office moved to Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, masquerading as an engineering consultancy. Rischowski worked at disguising Marxist literature, and transferring documents to the Social Democratic Party in exile in Prague. = Seeking Refuge = In September 1935, Rischowski was arrested while attempting to move banned literature to a safe place. She managed to talk herself free, but fearing surveillance, quickly fled to Prague. In July 1936 she moved on to the UK through the domestic servant visa scheme. Rischowski was invited by Caroline Haslett to attend meetings of the Women's Engineering Society, and she became an associate member in 1939. Interned for a year at the Rushen Camp on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien, she was released in 1942 and worked as a draughtsman and planning engineer, first at Tuvox Ltd and later at James Gordon Ltd, where she became Head of Projects.  Family life  Rischowski met her future husband Fritz Bruno Kartha√ºser (1898‚Äì1973) while studying engineering at the Technical University in Darmstadt. They married in December 1922, and they had two daughters. Their first child Hellen Isot was born in 1924 and their second Herta Maria (Kindi) in 1930. Bruno and Ira divorced in 1933. When she was forced into exile in 1935, Rischowski left her children in the care of her elderly mother Ida in Berlin until 1938 when, with support from members of the WES, she was able to bring them both to London. Ida was deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto where she died in 1943. On her death in 1989, the then WES President Dorothy Hatfield called Rischowski \\"an inspiration to us all\\".

An important element of urban surrealism is a rather comical approach of the high class, or the ruling class, which means that the urban surreal art, with its high quality, may attract the aristocracy, while still being casually produced regarding its structure.

From 1914 to 1916, she was the acting president of Mills College.  Early life  Hettie Belle Ege was born in Erie, Illinois on March 31, 1861, the daughter of Joseph Arthur Ege and his second wife, Catherine Rebecca Reisch Ege. Her parents were both from Pennsylvania; her father died the year she was born, and her mother remarried in 1869. She attended Western College in Oxford, Ohio, graduating in 1886; she later graduated from Mills College in 1903, with further studies at the University of Chicago, the University of Munich, and the University of California.  Career  Ege taught school in Ohio and Colorado as a young woman. From 1895 to 1930, she was a professor of mathematics and Dean of Women at Mills College. She also coached the Mills College basketball team.

In 1920, the college marked her twenty-five years at Mills with a presentation and convocation. At the festivities marking the school's founder's centennial in 1925, Ege received an honorary doctorate. After her retirement in 1930, she spent some time in Cambridge, in England. She was a regular guest at Mills College events and alumnae gatherings: in 1933 she was honored as the college's dean emerita, alongside president Aurelia Henry Reinhardt and physician Mariana Bertola, at an annual breakfast of the Mills Club of San Francisco.

Life Born in 1876, Joris left school at 13 and worked as a shipping clerk. Engaging in left-wing politics, he was secretary of his local branch of the Belgian Workers' Party from 1895 to 1898, as well as for a trade union. He contributed to the Anarchist newspaper Ontwaking under the pseudonym Edward Greene.Maarten Van Ginderachter, \\"Edward Joris: Caught between Continents and Ideologies?\\" in To Kill a Sultan: A Transnational History of the Attempt on Abd√ºlhamid II (1905), edited by Houssine Alloul, Edhem Eldem and Henk de Smaele (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), pp. 67-98. In 1901 he travelled to Istanbul, where he was briefly employed writing commercial correspondence in French and English and then found work at the Singer sewing machine company. In 1902 his fianc√©e, Anna Nellens, joined him in Istanbul and they got married. Through a coworker, Joris became involved with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, and hence in a plot to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The conspirators met for discussions and stored explosives and firearms in his house. The bombing was carried out on 21 July 1905, killing 26 and injuring 58 but failing to harm the Sultan himself. Joris was arrested six days later. He was brought to trial on 25 November and sentenced to death on 18 December. Due to diplomatic pressure from Belgium, the sentence was never carried out.Richard Bach Jensen, The Battle against Anarchist Terrorism: An International History, 1878‚Äì1934 (Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 307. A support committee was set up by left-wing intellectuals in Belgium, to maintain pressure on the Belgian government to work for his release.Christophe Verbruggen, Schrijverschap in de Belgische belle √©poque: een sociaal-culturele geschiedenis (Ghent and Nijmegen, 2009), pp. 161-166. Joris was kept in prison until 23 December 1907 and then returned to Belgium. His letters from prison formed the basis of a later book about his involvement in the plot.Walter Resseler and Benoit Suykerbuyk, Dynamiet voor de sultan: Carolus Edward Joris in Konstantinopel (Antwerp, b+b, 1997). After his return to Belgium, Joris worked as a bookseller and was secretary to the Antwerp branch of the Ligue des droits de l'homme. After the First World War he was convicted of collaborating with the occupying forces' Flamenpolitik, and sought refuge in the Netherlands. He returned to Belgium after an amnesty in 1929 and worked as a self-employed publicity agent. He died in 1957.

The painting was originally in the collection of Albert Eugene Gallatin before being bequeathed to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1952, where it remains. Background Dog Barking at the Moon was originally based on Mir√≥'s sketch of a Catalan folk tale which depicts a dog yelping \\"bow wow\\" at the moon while the moon looks down saying, \\"You know, I don't give a damn.\\" Analysis The painting presents a sparse, earthy brown landscape set against a black sky. However, Mir√≥ uses bright and playful colors to depict the distorted figure of a dog in the right foreground barking at the half moon and bird above it. In the left foreground, a ladder extends from the bottom of the painting before receding into the dark night sky. The vast, empty spaces in the painting create a sense of loneliness and isolation. Michael R. Taylor observes that Dog Barking at the Moon reflects Mir√≥'s memories of his native Catalan landscape and writes that the painting \\"exemplifies [Mir√≥'s] sophisticated blend of pictorial wit and abstraction\\".

It is directed by Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman and the fifth in the Nuke 'Em High film series. Plot Lauren (Catherine Corcoran) and her blogger girlfriend Chrissy (Asta Paredes) must save Tromaville's Nuke 'Em High from the ongoing effects of the nuclear-sludge filled tacos from Tromorganic Foodstuffs, while also trying to keep their illicit love affair from being unmasked. Cast *Asta Paredes as Chrissy *Catherine Corcoran as Lauren *Vito Trigo as Leonardo *Clay von Carlowitz as Eugene *Zac Amico as Zac *Lemmy as The President *Lloyd Kaufman as Lee Harvey Herzkauf *Ron Jeremy as God Production A majority of the fifth film was shot concurrently with the fourth film, Return to Nuke 'Em High Volume 1. Principal photography began in August 2012 and finished in September 2012. However, the film suffered an extended post-production period. In June 2015, Troma launched a crowdfunding campaign and raised $63,615 for post-production costs. Release The sequel premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2017 with some slight controversy as Kaufman stated Troma employees were \\"slapped around and arrested by thugs in suits joined by police\\" while promoting the film. The film had its American debut with a Los Angeles premiere on March 8, 2018 at the Ahrya Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California. Prior to its home video debut, Troma allowed fans a three-day digital rental of the movie online for $4.99 in February 2019. The movie will be released on Blu-ray on November 12, 2019. Reception Reviews were generally positive with nearly all noting the film's various excesses. Writing of the 2017 Cannes premiere, Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com said \\"Kaufman delivers everything exploitation fans want: full frontal nudity, duck rape, mutant monsters, oodles of blood and gore, a fat man with a Prince Albert genital piercing, and more\\" and that this film \\"might be Kaufman's angriest polemic yet, and it's consequently his looniest.\\" Katie Walsh of The Los Angeles Times stated one had to admire \\"Kaufman for staying so committed to sensational, offensive exploitation filmmaking.\\" Film Threat gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and called it \\"Troma‚Äôs most manic magnum opus yet\\" that could be considered \\"the all too meta, fourth wall breaking, asylum wall destroying amalgamation of everything Kaufman has been working towards in his career.\\" Glenn Kenny of The New York Times called the film a \\"putrid but at times oddly amiable exercise\\" that \\"offers a relentless barrage of toilet humor, haphazard film parodies and gore effects that are no less repellent for being unconvincing.\\" References External links  Official website * The official home of Troma Entertainment Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Lloyd Kaufman Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:American independent films Category:Punk films Category:Troma Entertainment films Category:2010s science fiction films ","title":"Return to Return to Nuke 'Em High AKA Volume 2"},{"id":"61849574","text":"K√∂ppen climate types in South Dakota showing the state to be largely hot- summer humid continental. near the US Capitol with sign about South Dakota Climate change in South Dakota encompasses the effects of climate change, attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, in the U.S. state of South Dakota. Due to South Dakota's location in the Northern Great Plains, the effects of climate change will vary from eastern South Dakota to western South Dakota. Eastern South Dakota can experience more flooding and western South Dakota can experience more droughts due to climate change. Climate change in South Dakota will directly impact agriculture, city planning and development as well as the tourism industry. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, \\"South Dakota's climate is changing. In the past century, most of the state has warmed by one to two degrees (F). Rainstorms are becoming more intense, and annual rainfall is increasing. In the coming decades, summers are likely to become increasingly hot, which may amplify some risks to human health and decrease yields of some crops while lengthening the growing season for others\\".  Flooding  In the spring of 2019, the Big Sioux River and James River (Dakotas) experienced severe flooding. Effects of the flood episode included: delayed crop plantings, spread of noxious weeds, litter and debris scattered along river banks, damage to roads and bridges and a decline in canoeing and kayaking due to strong current. Heavy rains On August 2, 2019, Huron set a new record of 3.26 in. of rainfall in one day, and an area south of Chamberlain reported 2.5 inches of rain in a half hour. Hecla reported 4.5 inches of rain, and Waubay reported 5 inches. On August 3, 2019, two weather stations in Hutchinson County reported 6.20 and 7 inches of rain. Some areas of the state have received 27 inches of rain in 2019, almost breaking the record of 28.71 inches in 1993. The EPA reports:  Temperature increases  Some of the greatest increases in average temperatures in the U.S. are expected in the region over the coming decades. \\"A projected increase of 4.05 degrees Fahrenheit in average temperature is expected by 2065, and a projected increase of 9.37 degrees Fahrenheit in average temperature can be expected by the turn of the century if nothing is done to curb emissions. The average annual temperature in South Dakota has increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the beginning of the 20th century, and most of that warming has occurred in winter and spring. All but two of South Dakota‚Äôs top 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1980, and four of the top 10 warmest years have been registered since 2005.\\" The EPA reports:  Invasive species  One invasive species that will dominate South Dakotas eastern woodlands due to climate change is buckthorn. This tree species is not native to the area and spreads drastically into open areas. Removing buckthorn is very costly and time consuming. The only way to remove the tree is to either pull it out of the ground or cut and spray it with a herbicide. Agriculture \\"Rising temperatures and changes in rainfall are likely to have both negative and positive effects on South Dakota‚Äôs farms and ranches. Hot weather causes cows to eat less and grow more slowly, and it can threaten their health. Increased winter and spring precipitation could leave some fields too wet to plant, and warmer winters may promote the growth of weeds and pests. During drought years, hotter summers will dry the soil. Within 70 years, the frequency of days above 100¬∞F is likely to double. Even where ample water is available, higher temperatures would reduce yields of corn in the warmest parts of the state\\". \\"The overall yield of corn, however, is likely to increase in cooler parts of the Great Plains. Although higher temperatures would reduce yields of wheat and soybeans, increased concentrations of carbon dioxide are likely to increase yields enough to offset the impact of higher temperatures. Increased precipitation at the beginning of the growing season could also benefit some crops. Warmer and shorter winters may allow for a longer growing season, which could allow two crops per year instead of one in some instances. Warmer winters may also benefit cattle, offsetting some of the harm from hotter summers: during the winter of 1996‚Äì1997, for example, high winds and heavy snow killed half of the newborn calves and 100,000 adult cows in the northern Great Plains\\". From 2005 to 2016, South Dakota was one of nine states to see an increase in energy- related carbon dioxide emissions. However in 2016, South Dakota was ranked 44 out of the 50 in the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions it released that year. Forests \\"Longer growing seasons and increased carbon dioxide concentrations could increase the productivity of forests. Although forests generally benefit from higher productivity, warmer conditions make forests more susceptible to pests. Temperature controls the life cycle and winter mortality rates of pests such as bark beetles, which have infested and killed trees in the Black Hills in recent decades. With higher winter temperatures, some pests can persist year-round, and new pests and diseases may become established\\".

Formed as the 48th Rifle Brigade in late 1941, it fought in the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive and was reorganized as the 215th Rifle Division in May 1942. The division fought in the Battles of Rzhev until March 1943 and in the Battle of Smolensk, receiving the name of Smolensk as an honorific for its participation in the capture of the city. Advancing into eastern Belorussia in late 1943, the division fought in a series of stalemated offensives before participating in Operation Bagration during mid-1944. Receiving the Order of the Red Banner for its actions in the capture of Vilnius, the 215th advanced into East Prussia in late 1944 and in early 1945 fought in the East Prussian Offensive. For its actions in the latter, the division received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class. After the Samland Offensive, the division was railed from East Prussia to the Soviet Far East to participate in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The 215th received its final decoration, the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for its actions in the latter. Postwar, it remained in the Soviet Far East and was briefly renumbered as the 33rd Rifle Division in 1955 before being disbanded a year later.  History  The division was formed in the Ural Military District during October 1941 as the 48th Separate Cadet Rifle Brigade, under the command of Colonel Andrey Kupriyanov from 25 October. After completing its formation, the brigade was sent to the Northwestern Front, joining the 4th Shock Army to fight in the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive. After the army transferred to the Kalinin Front on 22 January, the 48th fought in defensive battles near Velizh. During May 1942, the brigade was used to form the 215th Rifle Division near Ponizovye (30 kilometers from Troitsa) in the reserve of the Kalinin Front, with Kupriyanov continuing in command of the division. The 215th included the 618th, 707th, and 711th Rifle Regiments, the 667th Artillery Regiment, the 421st Anti-Tank Battalion, and the 421st Communications Company. A month after its first commander was appointed in mid-May, the division was assigned to the 58th Army. In the following month, it was transferred to the 22nd Army, creating a temporary defensive line from Yefremov Gora to Ponizovye and strengthening the forward portion of the main defensive line near Bukharin, Verkh-Goritsa, and Plyushchevo while defending positions near Nelidovo. The division became part of the 30th Army of the Western Front in mid-August, fighting to capture strongpoints on the left bank of the Volga, northwest of Rzhev. Crossing the Volga on 9 September, the 215th fought on the approaches to Rzhev but was stymied by German defenses. Kupriyanov, now a major general, was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his leadership of the division in actions between August and October, in which it was credited with destroying up to two German infantry regiments and fifteen tanks. When German forces began withdrawing from the Rzhev salient, the 30th Army advanced in pursuit from 2 March 1943. The division helped capture Rzhev on the next day and by 19 March it had reached the approaches to the road junction at the village of Novo-Lytkino. Kupriyanov was killed on 20 March in a German artillery bombardment that struck the village where his headquarters was located. He was replaced by Major General Sergey Iovlev. The 215th remained with the 30th Army until April, when it transferred to the 31st Army, with which it served until the end of 1943. With the 31st Army, the division advanced as part of the 36th Rifle Corps during the Smolensk‚ÄìRoslavl Offensive, participating in the capture of Smolensk and the crossing of the Sozh River. For its actions in the capture of Smolensk, the division received the name of the city as an honorific on 25 September. At the end of 1943, the 215th was transferred to the 33rd Army. Iolev was replaced by Major General Andranik Ghazaryan, a Hero of the Soviet Union, in early April. The division was transferred to the 39th Army of the Western Front (the 3rd Belorussian Front from 23 April) on 16 April, and in early May took up defensive position near Vitebsk. Just before the beginning of Operation Bagration in late June, the division became part of the 72nd Rifle Corps of the 5th Army. It fought in the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive and the Vilnius Offensive during Operation Bagration, pursuing retreating German troops and crossing the Berezina River, capturing Borisov, Vilnius, and Kaunas. For its \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" in the capture of Vilnius the 215th received the Order of the Red Banner on 25 July. By the end of the summer offensive in August, the average rifle company in the division was reduced to 70 men, about half strength. The division was placed in the second echelon of the 72nd Rifle Corps between 3 September and 16 October, then fought in the Gumbinnen Offensive. It defended positions near Pillkallen between 28 October and 13 January 1945 before fighting in the East Prussian Offensive and the Insterburg‚ÄìK√∂nigsberg Offensive. For its actions in the former, the division received the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class on 19 February. The process of attrition continued: by March 1945, after the East Prussian Offensive, the division fielded 2,873 officers and men. Between late March and early April, the 215th marched from Valitnik, 15 kilometers northwest of K√∂nigsberg to fight in the Samland Offensive. With the 5th Army, it was transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command on 20 April and began relocating to the Soviet Far East for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The division began loading into rail cars on 22 April. = Soviet invasion of Manchuria = The 5th Army completed its move to the Far East by July, with the 215th part of the 72nd Rifle Corps together with the 63rd and 277th Rifle Divisions. The 215th fought in the Harbin‚ÄìKirin Offensive Operation during the latter with its corps and army, part of the 1st Far East Front. Breaking through Japanese border fortifications, the division pursued retreating Japanese troops and captured Dunhua. After the end of Japanese resistance, the division guarded the railway at Dunhua, Jiaohe, and Kirin, along with factories in the area. It was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, on 19 September for its actions in the capture of Kirin. Postwar, the 215th was stationed in Primorsky Krai with its corps and army; Ghazaryan remained in command until about October 1947. It was renumbered as the 33rd Rifle Division on 30 April 1955, stationed at Krasny Kut. It was disbanded there on 25 July 1956.

The 100 mile event was marked by a disqualification which would play a part in final finishing order. Al Keller beat Billy Meyer to the checkered flag, but was found to running with modified pistons, and Meyer was awarded the victory.

The son of Izs√°k Jakab (a government official, professional soldier and eventual store owner), by arranged marriage to Friedman Vilma, M√°rton was born in GƒÉlƒÉu»õa»ô. After his family home in Gheorgheni burned down in World War I, his family spent some years in Petele before eventually settling down in T√¢rgu Mure»ô. After moving to the city, he spent some time apprenticing in furniture making under an artist named R√≥zsa G√©za, who noted M√°rton's artistic talent. At the artist's behest, M√°rton's father enrolled him in an arts program, and he spent the next 3 years learning how to carve at the Industrial High School in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, but before finishing he was invited by R√≥zsa to complete highschool, and then continue to an arts degree, at the College of Applied Arts in Budapest, graduating (notably early for his age) in 1933. While at the College, he studied under notable sculptors Imre Simay and Lajos M√°trai. In the late 1930s he returned home to T√¢rgu Mure»ô, where he remained until his deportation (despite his fathers' world war I medals, which should have afforded some protection) at the beginning of World War II. He gained recognition and eventually presented his works in personal exhibitions in 1936 and in 1937. During the war, he lost 25 relatives, including his mother, to death camps. After his return to the city from labour camp in 1944, he worked as well recognized instructor and eventually art director at the acclaimed Liceul Vocational de Art√¢ (art high school) in T√¢rgu Mure»ô 1945 to 1974. During his time at the art school, he produced many notable works, including several collaborations with Istv√°n Csorv√°ssy. His Monument to the Deportees, erected in Dej in front of the local Orthodox synagogue is one of the earliest Holocaust memorials to be erected in Europe, and memorializes ~7000 jews relocated to the nearby Dej ghetto and eventually deported and killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Many of his other works still are on display in several cities, but primarily in T√¢rgu Mure»ô ‚Äì including the notable \\"Two Bolyai\\" in Bolyai Square in T√¢rgu Mure»ô. The mysterious overnight removal, in 1962 of his statue of Stalin, erected just five years earlier in 1957, is remembered as signifying the metaphorical end of a Soviet Union domination of Romania during De-Stalinization in Romania. In 2003, a public Holocaust memorial was erected in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, based on a cast and plans originally produced for Dej in 1947. Shortly before his death, he was ordained as :ro:CetƒÉ»õean de onoare (Honorary Citizen, an order recognizing civic contribution) for the city.  Mysterious disappearance of the Stalin statue in 1962  According to local tales, the T√¢rgu Mures statue was not officially destroyed ‚Äì it simply disappeared overnight, without indication of where it went or what was done with it. All this occurred against a background of significant political upheaval, including the start and end of the Magyar Autonomous Region, De-Stalinization in Romania, and Romania's gradual distancing from the Warsaw pact. The event has entered public folklore, and to this day continues to be a subject of conversation and the source of several urban myths ‚Äì for example, the popular idea that the state was originally meant to contain a library in its base (which is also a myth related to the Bucharest statue), or that the library was actually constructed, still currently exists. Some claim the statue is still stored inside.

The band was formed in the year 2017, with support from the Neelam Panpaatu Maiyam started by Pa. Ranjith, and Tamil-Indie Musician and Composer, Tenma founder of the label Madras Records. The band's name originates from the usage, Jaathi Illadha Tamizhargal, a phrase coined by 19th century anti caste activist and writer C. Iyothee Thass, who urged Dalits across Tamilnadu to register themselves without caste. The name of the band was inspired by a phrase ‚Äì \\"jaathi bedha matra Tamilargal\\" ‚Äì used by Tamil anti-caste activist and writer C Iyothee Thass. Iyothee Thassa Pandithar (1845-1914) was the first to moot the phrase \\"Jaathi Bedha Matra Tamizhargal\\" in the early 20th century by publishing the same in his Tamil Journal Tamizhan (1907-1914). The band's music is political, and their songs rebel against the inequality of the caste system, and the oppression of women and minorities by the state.The current lineup consists of 19 members including Tenma, leader and music producer, singers Muthu, Bala Chandar, Isaivani, Arivu and Chellamuthu, Dharani (Dholak), Sarath (Satti), Gautham (Katta molam), Nandhan Kalaivanan (Parai and Tavil), Manu Krishnan (drums) and Sahib Singh (guitar). As of November 2019, the band had released thirty-five songs.  Early years and band formation  Tenma, the leader and the music producer of the band was trying to put together a group of indie musicians and artists, the Madras Indie Collective, in 2017. At this time, he received a call from Neelam spearheaded by Pa. Ranjith, enquiring if he could train Gaana singers and musicians from the Gaana genre. Within a week, they put out calls for an audition and received about 150 applications. Since the band was embarking on a socio-political journey, the auditions were looking to understand the motivations of the performers, as much as their musical strengths. A blend of Gaana, hip-hop, rock, rap, and folk musicians were brought into the fold. About 19 singers were brought together to form the initial ensemble.

He is primarily known as the author of the book Seder haYom, source of the Modeh Ani prayer. Biography He was the head of a yeshiva in Ein Zeitim, just north of Safed. There survive fundraising letters the yeshiva sent abroad between 1598 and 1601, which show it to have the typical structure of a Sephardic yeshiva from this period, with a circle of talmidei hachamim lead by a rabbi known as the \\"Rishon\\" (first) or \\"Hacham\\" (wise one). From the letters and from a manuscript of the yeshiva's rules, it can be seen that the yeshiva was influenced by the intensely spiritual atmosphere and messianic tension which prevailed among the Jews of Safed in that period, and put a focus on repentance and ascetic practices. Unlike other nearby scholarly circles (like those of rabbis Shlomo Alkabetz, Isaac Luria, Hayyim Vital, and Elazar Azikri), his yeshiva focused on traditional study of Talmud and halacha rather than mystical secrets. The manuscript of the yeshiva's rules contains ten rules. One rule established shifts so that Torah would be studied in the yeshiva at all hours of day and night. Another specified regular visits to the grave of Rabbi Judah bar Ilai to pray \\"for all Israel\\".‚Äè◊ó◊ë◊ï◊®◊™ ◊®' ◊û◊©◊î ◊ë◊ü ◊û◊õ◊ô◊® ◊ï◊™◊ß◊†◊ï◊™◊ô◊î The yeshiva apparently was located in Ein Zeitim starting in the Hebrew year 5342 (1582), and relocated to Safed after being threatened by a \\"band of Ishmaelites\\" in 1601.

It connects the central valley and Greater Metropolitan Area to the Caribbean coast of the country. Description As the main exports road of the country, through the Mo√≠n ports, 83% of the products are shipped abroad, equivalent to around 1500 trailer trucks. Together with Route 4, at the junction in Fr√≠o river, Gu√°piles, it forms the southeast side of the Corredor Norte-Caribe (North- Caribbean Drive), which allows to travel between Puerto Lim√≥n to La Cruz in Guanacaste province. From Route 108 in downtown San Jos√© canton, towards the Virilla river bridge there four lanes, two in each direction, then there are two lanes, one in each direction with a third ascent lane when required. As it crosses the Braulio Carrillo National Park, there is lush greenery and vegetation as well as touristic points of interest along the road, but at the same time there is fog frequently and landslides are common through the rainy season. There are two named sections, Braulio Carrillo Road () from Tib√°s to Siquirres, and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Trejos Fern√°ndez Road () from Siquirres to Lim√≥n. = Zurqu√≠ tunnel = Excavated to cross the Hondura mountain, by Kier International Limited, it has a length of 600m, 12m wide and 10m height. It is the only road tunnel in the country. History The (Braulio Carrillo road) was inaugurated on March 28, 1987. The initial plan or ideas were from the first half of XIX century, by then Head of State Braulio Carrillo Colina, after whom the road is named due to these initial efforts. These plans were to use the then known as (La Palma passage), following the December trade winds coming from the Caribbean. The initial trace of the route was known as (Carrillo's way), which goes through the cantons of Goicoechea, Moravia and V√°zquez de Coronado. There were a couple of small villages of around six hundred people at Alto de La Palma and Bajo de la Hondura, supporting the road. Due to lack of economic interests, the road and villages were abandoned. The remains of Alto de La Palma Hermit and some dairy farms still exist as of 2019. Due to the Atlantic Railroad construction, and the existing Route 126 (Sarapiqu√≠) and Route 10 (Turrialba) roads, the project was shelved until the 1970s, when then during president Rodrigo Carazo government, the works started in 1977 on the current Route 32. Route 32 then diminishes in 100 km the travel distance, and clears the older routes. =Virilla river new parallel bridge= A new 285m bridge started construction in March 2019 parallel to the existing bridge, as a project supervised by the United Nations Office for Project Services. The objective is to provide three new lanes over Route 32, towards San Jos√©, with the existing 1980s bridge providing two lanes in the opposing direction. Works are expected to be finished on the second semester of 2020. This bridge is colloquially known as (Saprissa bridge), due to its location near the Saprissa soccer team stadium. =Widening proposal from San Jos√© to Fr√≠o River= By using the private initiative works mechanism, the contractor consortium H. Sol√≠s-TPF Ingenier√≠a has proposed to widen the road from two lanes, one in each direction, to four lanes, two in each direction, on the 45.8 kilometer segment from the Virilla River bridge to the Fr√≠o River. Still in the design stage, the proposal includes several alternatives according to the terrain to this work, including: * Fake tunnels over the existing road, to avoid landslides in exposed areas. * Two level highways, with the top segment moving in one direction, and lower level in the opposite direction. * Bridges over canyons next to the existing road. * Elevated or lower adjacent levels to the existing road. A new tunnel next to the Zurqu√≠ tunnel would be required. =Gu√°piles to Puerto Lim√≥n widening= A widening project of 107 km from two lanes to four lanes, two in each direction, starting at the junction with Route 4 at Fr√≠o river to Puerto Lim√≥n district center, was awarded to China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) in November 2017, with works starting in April 2018, and plans to deliver the widened road in October 2020. However, due to delays from expropriations, lack of tree cutting environmental plans and of designs at the start date, required utilities pipelines relocation, archaeological studies at five locations, and also cultural and language barriers, the finish date has been moved many times. Among the works, nine of the thirty two existing bridges will be completely rebuilt, thirteen new interchanges, twenty four pedestrian bridges and five junctions at Fr√≠o river, Gu√°piles, Siquirres, Mo√≠n and with Route 257 that links with APM Mo√≠n Container Terminal (TCM).

Description Key diagnostic characters of this sand-loving species include reddish-brown leaf sheaths and relatively narrow flowering heads (inflorescences) with generally three to six spikelets. The leaves of this species are usually less than half the length of the culm and the nutlet beak is continuous with the body of the nutlet. Schoenus arenicola is most similar to Schoenus compar; however, the former species has shorter leaves and reddish-brown leaf sheaths compared to the longer leaves and ivory leaf sheaths of S. compar. Similar to other sedges, plants in this group are very difficult to identify. It appears that part of this problem is caused by the tendency of the southern African Schoenus to form hybrids with each other. However, hybridization is yet to be observed in S. arenicola. Other genera in tribe Schoeneae include Lepidosperma, Oreobolus, Costularia, Tetraria and Gahnia. Southern African Schoenus were once classified as Tetraria; however, based on molecular and morphological differences, the two groups are considered evolutionary distinct. To ensure that this group of sedges is monophyletic (i.e. the genus only has closely related species), the southern African Tetraria were transferred into Schoenus. In the field, the southern African Schoenus can be distinguished from Tetraria species by their lack of stem leaves and the absence of reticulate sheaths at the bases of the flowering stems. Closely related species include the Schoenus compar - Schoenus pictus group. Distribution and ecology Schoenus arenicola mostly occurs near the south-western coast of South Africa, ranging from the Knysna area in the east to the Cape Peninsula in the west. This species usually grows among fynbos vegetation at low elevations on well-drained sandy sites.

She made over 100 appearances on the London stage between 1775 and 1791. Born in London, Leeson developed an early interest in the theatre through the encouragement and support of her friends exacerbated by the frequent absence of her father from the family home owing to the long hours he worked in his printer's business. The Irish actor Charles Macklin took her on as an apprentice and in 1771 she accompanied him to Ireland where she made her d√©but at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin.An Historical View of the Irish Stage; From the Earliest Period Down to the Close of the Season 1788.

On their return to Dublin Leeson continued to act in Macklin's company but he had become \\"deeply but fruitlessly infatuated with her\\" and he released her from her apprenticeship, following which she joined the Dawson Company at the Capel Street Theatre. She began to live with the actor William Thomas Lewis and went with him to England in 1775 where they married in about 1780. She appeared with Lewis at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, at first as Mrs Leeson and later as Mrs Lewis. She joined her husband on his tours of the provinces.Roland Metcalf,William Thomas Lewis - Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2012) The quality of her acting was debated: Joseph Haslewood claimed her occasional appearances on the London stage (103 appearances between 1775 and 1791) were largely owing to her wanting to provide for her large family rather than through a desire to display her talent.Joseph Haslewood, The secret history of the green rooms: containing authentic and entertaining memoirs of the actors and actresses in the three theatres royal, 2 vols.

In April of 2015, before departing from the music industry, Long toured one last time with his bandmates in Europe. Early life Long was born into a family of musicians. His uncle, Huey Long (1904‚Äì2009), was an African-American jazz and R&B; guitarist of the pop group The Ink Spots. By age 17, he was selling beats recorded on equipment his stepfather, Melvin Hudnall, bought him. As he developed as an artist, he cited musician D'Angelo as a heavy influence. Long has since earned credits for singing, songwriting, producing. https://www.allmusic.com/artist/j-long-mn0002342737/credits Early music career Long signed his first record deal soon after graduating high school, joining NBA player Steve Francis's label ISOH Entertainment. http://www.breathecast.com/articles/j-long-jlong-christian-rap-christian- rapper-jlong-baptism-christian-hip-hop-christian-music-news-3058/ In 2006, Long released his Six-10 mixtape through Mike Jones's Ice Age Entertainment label. https://www.datpiff.com/JLong-Six-10-mixtape.9429.html His career began to take off with his 2008 single, \\"Berry Love\\".

Among Greco- Roman writers, this region was known as Scythia. The Scythian cultures are characterized by the Scythian triad, which are similar, yet not identical, styles of weapons, horses' bridles and Scythian art. The question of how related these cultures were is disputed among scholars. Its peoples were of diverse origins, and included not just Scythians, from which the cultures are named, but other peoples as well, such as the Cimmerians, Massagetae, Saka, Sarmatians and obscure forest steppe populations. Mostly speakers of the Scythian branch of the Iranian languages, all of these peoples are sometimes collectively referred to as Scythians, Scytho-Siberians, Early Nomads or Iron Age Nomads. Origins and spread Horseman from the Pazyryk burials, c.300 BC, one of the most famous archaeological discoveries from the Scythian cultures. Equestrianism is one of the chief characteristics of the Scythian cultures. The Scythian cultures emerged on the Eurasian Steppe at the dawn of the Iron Age in the early 1st millennium BC. The origins of the Scythian cultures has long been a source of debate among archaeologists. The Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe was initially thought to have been their place of origin, until the Soviet archaeologist Aleksey Terenozhkin suggested a Central Asian origin. Recent excavations at Arzhan in Tuva, Russia have uncovered the earliest Scythian-style kurgan yet found. Similarly the earliest examples of the animal style art which would later characterize the Scythian cultures have been found near the upper Yenisei River and North China, dating to the 10th century BC. Based on these finds, it has been suggested that the Scythian cultures emerged at an early period in southern Siberia. It is probably in this area the Scythian way of life initially developed. Recent genetic studies have however suggested an origin in the Srubnaya culture, or in the eastern Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe and the southern Urals. The Scythian cultures quickly came to stretch from the Pannonian Basin in the west to the Altai Mountains in the east. There were however significant cultural differences between east and west. Over time they came in contact with other ancient civilizations, such as Assyria, Greece and Persia. In the late 1st millennium BC, peoples belonging to the Scythian cultures expanded into Iran (Sakastan), India (Indo-Scythians) and the Tarim Basin. In the early centuries AD, the western Scythian cultures came under pressure from the Goths and other Germanic peoples. The end of the Scythian period in archaeology has been set at approximately the 2nd century AD. Peoples Sarmatian from a Roman sarcophagus, 2nd century AD. Although a different people than the Scythians, the Sarmatians were part of the Scythian cultures. =Ethnicity= The peoples of the Scythian cultures are mentioned by contemporary Persian and Greek historians. They were mostly speakers of Iranian languages. Peoples associated with the Scythian cultures include speakers of the Scythian languages, such as Massagetae, Sarmatians, Saka and Scythians, and the Cimmerians. The peoples of the Forest steppe were also part of the Scythian cultures. The origins of those peoples are obscure. There might have been early Slavs, Balts and Finno-Ugric peoples among them. The settled population in Scythian cultural areas also included Thracians. Despite belonging to similar material cultures, the peoples of the Scythian cultures belonged to many separate ethnic groups. =Terminology= Among the diverse peoples of the Scythian cultures, the Scythians are the most famous, due to the reports on them published by the 5th century Greek historian Herodotus. The ancient Persians referred to all nomads of steppe as Saka. In modern times, term Scythians is sometimes applied to all the peoples associated with the Scythian cultures. Within this terminology it is often distinguished between \\"western\\" Scythians living on the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, and \\"eastern\\" Scythians living on the Eastern Steppe. The terms Saka or Sauromates, and Scytho-Siberians, is sometimes used for the \\"eastern\\" Scythians living in Central Asia and southern Siberia respectively. The term Scytho-Siberians has also been applied to all peoples associated with the Scythian cultures. The terms Early Nomads and Iron Age Nomads have also been used. The ambiguity of the term Scythian has led to a lot of confusion in literature. Nicola Di Cosmo questions the validity of referring the cultures of all early Eurasian nomads as \\"Scythian\\", and recommends the use of alternative terms such as Early Nomadic. By ancient authors, the term \\"Scythian\\" eventually came to be applied to a wide range of peoples \\"who had no relation whatever to the original Scythians\\", such as Huns, Goths, T√ºrks, Avars, Khazars and other unnamed nomads. =Physical appearance= Anthropological data has revealed that the people of the Scythian cultures were Europoid, although Mongoloid admixture is discernible on its eastern fringes. They were tall and powerfully built, even by modern standards. This was particularly the case for warriors and noblemen, who were often more than 6 ft (1.83 m) tall. Sometimes they exceeded 6 ft 3 in (1.90 m) in height, and males even exceeding 6 ft 6 in (2 m) have been uncovered. The ordinary people whom they dominated were of much smaller stature, averaging 4-6 in. (10-15 cm) below them in height. Skeletons of Scythian nobles differ from those of today by their longer arm and leg bones, and stronger bone formation. These physical characteristics affirm an Iranian origin. Characteristics Horse attacked by tiger, Ordos culture, 4th-1st century BCE. Scythian cultures are characteristic for their art, which was made in the animal style. The Scythian cultures are characterized by similar, yet not identical, shapes for horses' bridles, weapons, and art-types. Their art was made in the so-called animal style, and is referred to as Scythian art. The three characteristics are known as the Scythian trias. Finds In the beginning of the 18th century, Russian explorers began uncovering Scythian finds throughout their newly acquired territories. Significant Scythian archaeological finds have been uncovered up to recent times. A major find are the Pazyryk burials, which were discovered on the Ukok Plateau in the 1940s. The finds are notably for revealing the form of mummification practiced by the Scythians. Another important find is the Issyk kurgan. Society The Golden Man of Issyk Kurgan, ca. 4th-3rd century BC The Scythians were excellent craftsmen with complex cultural traditions. Horse sacrifices are common in Scythian graves, and several of the sacrificed horses were evidently old and well-kept, indicating that the horse played a prominent role in Scythian society. They played a prominent role in the network connecting ancient civilizations known as the Silk Road. The homogeneity of patrilineal lineages and diversity of matrineal lineages of samples from Scythian burial sites indicate that Scythian society was strongly patriarchal. Numerous archaeological finds have revealed that the Scythians led a warlike life: the competition for territory must have been fierce. The numerous weapons placed in graves are indicative of a highly militarized society. Scythian warfare was primarily conducted through mounted archery. They were the first great power to perfect this tactic. The Scythians developed a new powerful type of bow known as the Scythian bow. Sometimes they would poison their arrows. Genetics In a 2015 study published in Nature, the remains of an individual from Samara Oblast, Russia, dated ca. 380‚Äì200 BCE and ascribed to the Scythian cultures, was analyzed. The individual was found to belong to haplogroup R1a1a1b2a2a. This lineage is associated with earlier Srubnaya culture of the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, which again traces its origin to the Yamnaya culture. In 2017, a genetic study of various Scythian cultures was published in Nature Communications. The study suggested that the Scythian cultures on the Pontic- Caspian steppe and the Eastern Steppe emerged independently of each other, and were a mixture of Yamnaya culture-related and East Asian ancestry. Much of this admixture probably happened during the earlier expansion of the Afanasievo culture and Andronovo culture onto the Eastern Steppe. The peoples of the areas of the Scythian cultures were more closely related to each other than modern populations in the same areas, and there appears to have been significant gene flow between them, mostly mitochondrial lineages from east to west. It was suggested that the source of this gene flow may have contributed to the uniformity of the Scythian cultures. Modern populations with a close genetic relationship to the peoples of the Scythian cultures were found to be those living in close proximity to the remains examined, suggesting genetic continuity. Another 2017 genetic study, published in Scientific Reports, reported similar results. It found and increasing number of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages among the eastern Scythian cultures. The origins of presence of east Eurasian lineages in Scythian samples was explained as a result of admixture between migrants of European ancestry and women of east Eurasian origin. The authors of the study suggested that the Srubnaya culture was the source of the Scythian cultures of at least the Pontic steppe. In 2018, a genetic study of the earlier Srubnaya culture, and later peoples of the Scythian cultures, such as Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians, was published in Science Advances. While members of the Srubnaya culture were found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a1a1, which showed a major expansion during the Bronze Age, the Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian samples examined were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup R1b1a1a2, which is characteristic of the earlier Yamnaya culture, although one Sarmatian studied carried haplogroup R1a1a1. Peoples of the Scythian cultures were also found to have a presence of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages, which are completely absent among the Srubnaya. Groups of the Scythian cultures in the west showed close genetic affinities with the Afanasievo culture and the Andronovo culture, while groups in the east, such as those of the Aldy-Bel culture and Pazyryk culture, showed closer genetic affinities with the Yamnaya culture. Genetic data found negligible evidence of any mobility among populations in the Far East, suggesting the eastern Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe and the southern Urals as the main source of origin of the western Iron Age nomads. Rather than being directly descended from the Srubnaya, the Scythian cultures probably had a shared origin in the Yamnaya culture. The study corroborated the contention that the peoples of the Scythian cultures did not consist of a single homogeneous group, but rather a number of diverse peoples with an earlier common origin. In 2018, a study of mtDNA from remains of the Tagar culture, which is considered a Scythian culture, was published in PLOS One. Remains from the early years of the Tagar culture were found to be closely related to those of contemporary Scythians on the Pontic steppe. The authors of the study suggested that the source of this genetic similarity was an eastwards migration of West Eurasians during the Bronze Age, which probably played a role in the formation of the Tagar culture. In 2019, a genetic study of remains from the Aldy-Bel culture, which is considered a Scythian culture, was published in Human Genetics. The majority of the samples (9 out of 17) were found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a, including two carriers of haplogroup R1a1a1b2-Z93. East Asian admixture was also detected, as 6 haplogroup Q-L54 (including 5 in Sagly culture) and 1 haplogroup N-M231 were excavated. The haplogroup of the remaining 1 sample is said to be uncertain in the paper Probably R). (The significant genetic differences found between Scythian groups of the Pontic Steppe and South Siberia suggest that these were of completely different paternal origins, with almost no paternal gene flowe between them. In 2019, a genetic study of various peoples belonging to the Scythian cultures, such as Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians and Saka, was published in Current Biology. The remains of all groups were mostly found to be carriers of haplogroup R1a and various subclades of it. Haplogroup Q samples (2/Y-DNA identified 16) were also found.

Distribution and habitat Clavularia frankliniana is native to the Antarctic Peninsula, the coasts of the Antarctic continent and the nearby island groups. It occurs at depths down to about and grows on rocks or other hard substrates. Ecology This coral contains the chemical unpalatable chimyl alcohol for defensive purposes. This is insufficient to prevent the nudibranch Tritoniella belli from feeding on it, and the nudibranch incorporates the substance into its own tissues, making it distasteful to predatory starfish such as Odontaster validus, Perknaster fuscus and Acodontaster conspicuus. Reproduction in this coral can occur at any time of year and is by fission or by sexual reproduction, with the release of larvae.

For reasons of race and politics she was obliged to abandon her university medical studies in 1938 and to flee the country. She was keen to emigrate to England, but the necessary visa was not forthcoming and in March 1939 she fled, instead, to the Netherlands. Her brother Erwin had escaped to Sweden the previous year. For her Jewish parents, who were by this time beyond working age, there seemed to be no hope of admission to a foreign country: they remained behind. Stella Siegmann's long-awaited visa from the British was finally received in August 1939 and she moved to England where, a few months later, she married a fellow Austrian exile called Wolf Rotenberg. For the remaining 64 years of her life Stella Rotenberg lived in England, from 1948 in Leeds (Yorkshire). The language she preferred to use for her published work was always German, however. Life =Provenance and early years= Stella Siegmann was born into an assimilated Jewish family in Vienna and grew up in the city's 20th district, a densely populated quarter a little to the north of the city centre, and located on the island formed by the channeling that two centuries before created the \\"Danube Canal\\". Bernhard Siegmann, Stella's father, was a trader in textiles and fabrics. Her brother, Erwin, was a year older than she. The family was not wealthy, but Bernhard and Regine Siegmann were keen to ensure that their two children received a proper education. Beyond that they were, by the standards of the time and place, open-minded and flexible in their approach to parenting, allowing their children a considerable degree of freedom. She attended junior school locally. As she would later recall, even at this early stage she was aware of antisemitic sentiments on the streets and in the school corridors. She would also always remember the religious studies teacher challenging the mainstream antisemitism at the predominantly Roman Catholic school, telling the children that \\"Jews are human too\\". She moved on to the Staats-Unterrealschule (as the Brigittenauer Gymnasium ‚Äì secondary school ‚Äì was known at that time), near the Augarten park, and also in Vienna's 20th district. As before, most of her school friends and contemporaries were non-Jewish. When she was about fifteen Stella Siegmann and her brother Erwin took part on a schools-arranged camping break during which she made the acquaintance of Jura Soyfer who at the age of nineteen was in the process of embarking on his own career as a precociously gifted and politically committed writer. Her own intense love of the German language was awakened while she was still at school. This, and her love of reading, seem always to have been an important element in her being. As a girl her favourite author was Thomas Mann, to whose multi-layered works she returned, fascinated, again and again. Others whose works she particularly admired included \\"Klabund\\" and Brecht. Reading for Stella Siegmann was no mere pastime for idle moments. It was and remained a core dependency and, in dark times, a vital therapy. The years between 1926 and 1930 were probably the happiest of her young life, but she was nevertheless aware of the darkening political clouds, of the fatal Palace of Justice revolt and later, in 1934, of the brutally crushed insurrection on the streets of Vienna in February of that year. In the early summer of 1934 Stella Siegmann successfully concluded her school career. She teamed up with her brother Erwin and a friend to undertake an extended tour of Europe, taking in Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Milan she met Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. More generally, during their tour she came to a wider appreciation that antisemitism, far from being a peculiarly Viennese phenomenon, was widespread and intensifying across Europe. Returning to Vienna, in the Fall/Autumn she enrolled at the university to study Medicine. Her brother had done the same a year earlier. It was nevertheless, at that time, an unusual step for a woman, especially for a Jewish woman. =Anschluss= The 1930s was a decade of intensifying politicisation and polarisation across German speaking Europe. Siegmann became aware of growing levels of support among fellow students for the banned (after 1933) Communist Party and for the National Socialists. After 12 March 1938 everything changed for Erwin and Stella Siegmann when Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany. Although the transformation came about through military invasion, there was strong support across Austria for the idea of a united German state which extended well beyond hardened Nazi activists. But for Austrian Jews the so-called \\"Anschluss\\" marked the beginning of the end. Stella and Erwin were forced to quit their medical studies and a period of government mandated violence, disenfranchisement and humiliation followed. Her father's business was \\"aryanised\\" (expropriated) while the family's little apartment was first plundered and then taken over. Regine Siegmann was \\"badly mistreated\\" and an uncle was beaten up so badly that he became deaf. The family were moved to a \\"mass housing unit\\". Stella Siegmann who as a young adult had worn her ethnicity relatively lightly, now found refuge in Judaism which she came to see as the embodiment of non-violent principles of charity and respect for the law. =Escape= In July 1938 Erwin Siegmann managed to escape to Stockholm. His sister set her sights on emigration to England. She knew that there was a serious shortage there of domestic servants, which meant that for young women it would be relatively easy to obtain an entry visa and obtain work as a housemaid. She contacted the British \\"Home Office\\" (interior ministry) in London and received an assurance that as a medical student she would be able to work as a trainee carer (\\"Pfleger-Lehrling\\") in a British hospital. But no visa came. In Vienna, antisemitic persecution persisted, while the German take-over in Czechoslovakia brought the prospect of a wider European war into a clearer focus, which could only lead to increased difficulties in Vienna. When she had applied for her British visa, she had also had the prescience to apply for a visa to work as a servant (\\"Hausgehilfinnen-Visum\\") in the Netherlands. On 14 March 1939, she departed from the \\"Westbahnhof\\" on the train to Amsterdam. She would never see her parents again. Her brother had secured Swedish entry documents for them, but the German authorities were disinclined to let them leave the country without payment of prohibitively inflated fees to the government Verm√∂gensverkehrsstelle(loosely, \\"Property Transaction Office.\\"). Stella Siegmann took work as a domestic servant in Leiden, running the home of a single forty-year-old man whose aspirations for her were evidently inappropriate. She spoke about this to the Refugee Committee in den Haag who switched her to an alternative (but unpaid) job, in return for her board and lodging, at an orphanage in den Haag. Her experiences in the Netherlands were in some respects disappointing. As international tensions increased the governments in western Europe took a less welcoming approach to Germany's many refugees, and during her time working at the orphanage she was required to report to a police station every day. In August 1939, shortly before the outbreak (for England and Germany, if not yet for the Netherlands) of the Second World War, the long-awaited visa for Britain arrived, and Siegmann immediately traveled by boat across the North Sea to London. The development was the more welcome because by this time, as she later recalled, she had a \\"boyfriend\\" in England. Almost immediately she accepted a traineeship as a carer at a psychiatric hospital in Colchester (Essex). Her initial impressions of England were only positive. Here was a country where refugees could find work and the opportunity to integrate. There are, however, powerful indications that she soon encountered a darker side to English society, through her work in the Colchester psychiatric hospital: these gave rise to darkly bitter resonances in several of her later poems. Living and working in Colchester meant that Stella Siegmann was cut off from almost all the German and Austrian exiles who had come to England and who stayed in and around London. She spoke no English, but necessity and her superb ear for language enabled her to learn it very quickly, so that her greater concern became that she would forget her German. She was nevertheless too frightened, under the conditions of those times, to speak any words of German in public. =Wolf= One person who came to visit her a few weeks after she arrived in England was her \\"boyfriend\\" Wolf Rotenberg. Wolf Rotenberg was of Polish-Jewish provenance but his family had settled in Vienna and in 1938 he had been deprived of his Polish citizenship after refusing to perform military service in the Polish army. The two of them had been medical students together in Vienna. They married at a registry office in Colchester on 23 October 1939. At around the same time Wolf Rotenberg was accepted into the Pioneer Corps of the British army. As a result of his successive postings to different parts of England the newly married couple lived in a succession of locations, which for Stella involved giving up her work at the Colchester psychiatric hospital. They lived successively in Devonshire and Somerset: she found work as a medical assistant. By 1945 the Rotenbergs were living in the north of England, in Darlington, where Stella Rotenbnerg had found work as a book keeper. The couple's only recorded son, Adrian, was born in 1951. =1940s England= In the early part of 1940 Stella Rotenberg wrote her first published poem. She wrote, sources insist, not for publication, and certainly not for publication in Germany or Austria, but because of a compulsion to write. It would indeed be several decades before any of her poems were published. (Her poems were always written in German.) Her first poem was written while Wolf was away in France and Stella was living as a subtenant in a small room in Colchester. She was always hungry. The she was taken in by a family who fed her properly. She became a little less thin and felt a little better. There was still, in her room, hardly enough space for a bed. Nevertheless, she was able to set her suitcase before the door. Under these conditions she wrote \\"Ohne Heimat\\" (loosely, \\"Without a Homeland\\"). Her short poem corresponded with the conditions under which she was living. After the war Stella Rotenberg and her brother were able to investigate their parents' fate. Bernhard and Regine Siegmann were deported towards the east on 20 May 1942 and disappeared, like thousands of others, a few days later, although the detailed circumstances of their killings were at that time unclear. Subsequent holocaust research confirms they were almost certainly murdered, either at Auschwitz or else during an unscheduled halt in a wooded area by the train transporting victims towards a death camp. In 1946 Stella Rotenberg was granted British citizenship. Erwin Siegmann, her brother, made plans to return \\"home\\" to postwar Austria, but antisemitic incidents that he came across during a visit caused him to abandon the idea: when he died in 1990 he was still living in Stockholm. Wolf Rotenberg husband set about completing his medical training. In 1948 the Wolf and Stella moved to Leeds where Wolf undertook a practical internship at the clinic there. In the postwar austerity of those times there was still no question of the Rotenbergs having their own home. They lived instead in a small one-room service apartment at the hospital where Wolf was working. They nevertheless ended up living together in Leeds for the rest of their lives. Her poetry, which she continued to write, reflected the sense of loss in respect of her parents' murder and the life she had led in Vienna before the coming to power of National Socialism. Commentators have also drawn attention to the rich seams of biblical references in her work. Rotenberg never made any secret of her love and respect for Martin Luther's glorious translations of 1522 and 1534. There were other German refugees also living in Leeds, but none of them felt comfortable speaking German: Stella Rotenberg was acutely aware that her English was accented. Native-born English neighbours were friendly up to a point, but acceptance was never entirely unqualified and her written work continued to reflect a sense of social isolation consistent with the Rotenbergs' position as foreign-born exiles. She also continued to be haunted by a belief that being cut off from daily use of the German language was diminishing her skill as a practitioner of it, and she feared that losing her fluency also removed one of her last surviving connections to her murdered mother. =Late discovery= Publication of her work was not on Stella Rotenberg's agenda during the 1940s and 1950s, and for a German language poet living in England the opportunities were any event limited. Neither Stella nor her brother Erwin would ever return to live in Austria. For a long time Stella Rotenberg's work remained unknown in Austria: that was a fate she shared with a number of exiled Austrian authors who after the war were unwilling unable to re-establish links with the country of their upbringing. Through the immediate post-war decades was a corresponding reluctance in Austria to engage with exiled victims of the National Socialist nightmare. Nevertheless, during the 1960s one or two of Rotenberg's poems began to turn up in newspapers and magazines in a number of different countries. The first compilation of her poems was published only in 1972, however, and it was published not in Vienna, Berlin or London, but in Tel Aviv. The next significant compilation, published by J. G. Bl√§schke in Darmstadt, was \\"Die wir √ºbrig sind\\" which appeared in 1978, and has been re-issued several times by different publishers subsequently. By this time a number of uncomfortable issues relating to the National Socialist years that had been subject to a widespread if informal vow of silence since 1945 were beginning to be discussed more openly, and this coincided with greater recognition and a growing academic interest in Rotenberg's work, notably in Austria and West Germany. \\"Scherben sind endlicher Hort\\" and \\"Ungewissen Ursprungs\\" followed in 1991 and 1997. Late in 2003 \\"Scherben sind endlicher Hort\\" became the first volume of Rotenberg's work to appear in an English language translation. By the early part of the twenty-first century a series of sympathetic translations into English by the Irish-born literary translator Donal McLaughlin were opening up Rotenberg's work to readers in Britain and Ireland, and attracting attention from anglophone scholars in those places. Back in Austria, in 2001 Stella Rotenberg became the first recipient of the Prize for Resistance Writing in Exile awarded (since then) annually by the Vienna-based Theodor Kramer Society. =Death= Wolf Rotenberg died in 1992.

During the Empire of Brazil, some jurists attempted to legalize women's suffrage, with or without the consent of the husband. Later, the republican constitution of 1891 didn't exclude women from voting, because they weren't considered individuals who could have rights. That made some women request, without success, their inclusion among the voters. The 1891 constitution initially had a clause that gave women the right to vote, but it was abolished in its last version because the idea that politics was not an honorable activity for women prevailed. Some historical moments of this time were important in the advance of women's struggle, such as the 1917 strikes, the rise of the Communist Party of Brazil in 1922 and, in the same year, the Modern Art Week in S√£o Paulo. In 1919, Bertha Lutz, who is considered a pioneer in the Brazilian feminist movement along with N√≠sia Floresta, founded the Brazilian Federation for Women's Progress, which fought for voting rights and the right to work without the husband's authorization. Rio Grande do Norte and Minas Gerais were pioneer stats in legalizing the female vote. The first registered female elector was Celina Guimar√£es Viana. Celina, in 1927, invoked article 17 of Rio Grande do Norte's electoral law, which states: In Rio Grande do Norte, all citizens who meet the condictions determined by Law, will be able to vote and be voted, without gender distinction. On 25 November 1927, she requested to be included among the voters, a request which judge Israel Ferreira Nunes approved.  History  The republican constitution of 1891 already assured women the right to vote, depending on how it was interpreted. Article 70 stated that are electors all citizens who are above 21. The term \\"citizens\\", according to the interpretation of the time, referred only to men. Women only effectively got the right to vote in 1932. = 20th century = Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, in 1928. Integrants of the Brazilian Federation for Women's Progress, in 1930. In Brazil, the feminist movements were inspired by the European struggles. N√≠sia Floresta is one of the first to manifest herself as a force in the pursuit of equality for women, as well as Bertha Lutz, who created the Federation for Women's Progress, in 1930; and Jer√¥nima Mesquita, who fought for women's right to vote and tool part in several social and philanthropical activities.  1960s and 1970s  In the 60s and 70s, feminism arose throughout Europe and within the US and got its impulse from the political and cultural upheavals those regions were going through, which challenged the conservative values of society, and in this context The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir was published. However in Brazil the scenario was very different. The country was going through a right-wing military dictatorship. In the height of repression, the feminist movement emerged again through the hands of Romy Medeiros da Fonseca. This movement widened the range of the demands, including the principle of equality between husband and wife in marriage and the introduction of divorce in Brazilian legislation. =1980s= From 1980 onwards, the accomplishments of the feminist movement were great, as a consequence of all the previous years of struggle. In 1980, the show TV Mulher (TV Woman) aired in the Rede Globo TV network, in which themes such as kitchen and decoration were discussed. Later, the necessity to talk about the body, sexuality and freedom arose. The female spectators sent their doubts concerning sexual freedom and curiosities about their own bodies to the host, Marta Suplicy. A need for liberation was perceptible in women. Brazilian music was taken by singers of great success, such as Simone, Rita Lee, Maria Beth√¢nia, Faf√° de Bel√©m and Joana. Many songs turned into icons of the time: Come√ßar de novo (Simone), Atrevida (Simone), Cor de rosa choque (Rita Lee). Concerns about the intersection of race and class with feminism also began developing, with events such at the National Meeting of Black Women highlighting ways in which contemporary feminism was not addressing the concerns faced by poor women and women of color.  Historical Notable Persons  Marie Rennotte - Physician and Feminist Marie Rennotte (1852‚Äì1942) A native Belgian and naturalized Brazilian teacher and physician, who was active in the fight for women's rights. Rennotte directed the obstetrics and maternity unit of the Maternity Hospital of S√£o Paulo. In 1901, she was admitted as a member of the S√£o Paulo branch of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. She conducted research at the surgery of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia on the effects of chloroform as an anesthetic from 1906 to 1910. Then she traveled to Europe to study how to establish a Red Cross Branch in S√£o Paulo. Upon her return she founded the local branch in 1912, opened a nurses training school, and began a campaign to found the first children's hospital in S√£o Paulo. She continued to practice medicine through the mid-1920s, but increasingly in the late 1920s and the 1930s became more involved in the international feminist movement and scientific conferences. In 1922, she founded the Alian√ßa Paulista pelo Sufr√°gio Feminino (Paulistan Alliance for Women's Suffrage). By the late 1930s, suffering from ill health, blindness and deafness, she was granted a state pension, which she collected until her death in 1942. She is remembered for her work to improve women's educational and health care options, and women's rights to employment and citizenship. She is also recognized as one of those who defined feminist thought in Brazil during the 19th century. Patricia Acioli - February 14, 1964 in Niter√≥i, August 12, 2011 in Niter√≥i) was a Brazilian judge and feminist. She was the first judge to be murdered in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Acioli championed the rights of battered women and fought against organized crime and corrupt police officers. She was murdered by masked men on motorbikes outside her house in 2011. Eleven police officers, including its chief, were convicted of planning and executing the murder.

He served as the first African-American Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives and was a committed member of the Republican Party.  Early Life  Lee was born in Abbeville District, South Carolina, on the plantation belonging to Samuel J. McGowan. His mother was a free black woman and Lee asserted that his father was Samuel J. Lee of Charleston, although no documentation has been found to prove this - some historians have argued that McGowan was his father. = Civil War = When he was sixteen Lee followed McGowan and served with the Confederate Army during the Civil War, although there is no official record of his service; however, he was photographed armed and in the uniform of McGowan's regiment, the 14th South Carolina Infantry. Lee claimed that he was wounded twice during the course of the war: once at Second Manassas, where McGowan was also wounded, and then again at the Battle of Hanover.  Career  = Politics = After the Civil War, Lee became a farmer in Abbeville. In 1868 he entered politics, serving on the Edgefield County commission before being elected to the General Assembly that same year. He represented Edgefield County from 1868 to 1871 and then Aiken County from 1872 to 1874. In 1872 Lee became the Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives. In 1874 Lee served as counsel to the legislative committee during the impeachment trial of state treasurer Francis Cardozo. Later that year Lee left the legislature and unsuccessfully ran for attorney general. He continued to serve as an Aiken County commissioner. = Law = Lee became a member of the South Carolina Bar in 1872 and used his connections to McGowan, himself a qualified lawyer, as well as his cooperation with the white establishment to establish a successful legal career. Lee was noted for his oratory skills and legal acumen, with an unprecedented twenty-seven appearances before the state supreme court.  Later Life  Even after his retirement from politics he remained active in the Republican Party, regularly speaking at party events. In 1891 he was appointed a general in the state's \\"colored militia\\", a position in which he continued to serve until his death. On 1 April 1895 Lee died in Charleston. At the news of his death the United States Circuit Court adjourned. He was buried with military honors at Friendly Union Cemetery, Charleston, in a funeral attended by six thousand people.  Legacy  Lee was the first African- American Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Despite this achievement, he is described by University of South Carolina academic Lewis W. Burke as having \\"left a trail of scandal in the wake of his political career.\\" In 1875, while serving as an Aiken County commissioner, Lee was convicted of issuing fraudulent checks and in 1877 he was indicted on various counts of public corruption; however, he was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony against Francis Cardozo. Once again, Lee was charged with corruption in 1879, although these charges were dropped.

It is a tributary of the Moisie River. Hydro-Qu√©bec caused controversy in the early 1990s by proposing to divert the river to supply the reservoir of the SM-3 power plant on the Sainte-Marguerite River. Location The Aux P√©kans River is in the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Mouchalagane in the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality. The name was made official on 5 December 1968. The Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec has no information on its origins. The river rises in Lac de la Bouteille, south of Lake Germaine and west of Fermont. It flows to the west of the Mont Wright mines. Quebec Route 389 crosses the P√©kans River south of Fermont. In August 2015 a limit of 10 tonnes was placed on vehicles crossing the bridge. The Ministry of Transport was working on a replacement structure, due to be commissioned in summer 2016. The river flows in a generally SSE direction, then near its end turns to the NE and enters the Moise River from the right. The P√©kans drains an area of and is the second most important tributary of the Moise River after the Nipissis, which drains . The proposed Moisie River Aquatic Reserve would include of the Aux P√©kans River. Tributaries Tributaries of the Aux P√©kans River include the Grasse River, which enters the right bank from the south, the Carheil River, which enters the left bank from the north and the La Ronde River, which enters the right bank from the south. The Carheil River rises in Carheil Lake at . The lake is south of Fermont and of Quebec Route 389. Environment A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the Aux P√©kans River rising to the northwest of Fermont just west of the Spruce/lichen domain of the boreal zone. It flows to its juncture with the Moisie through the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. Diversion proposal At the start of the 1990s Hydro-Qu√©bec announced plans to harness the Sainte-Marguerite River with a new SM-3 hydroelectric project, which would produce 846 MW of energy. The project would involve the diversion of the Carheil and Aux Pekans rivers, two important tributaries of the Mishtashipu, or Moisie. The Innu people of Mani- Utenam at the mouth of the Moisie were concerned about the increase in methylmercury and decrease in the flow of the Moise, and the effect on the 12,000‚Äì35,000 salmon that entered the river annually. However, the Innuat of Uashat to the west in Sept-√éles tended to favor the project. A report published in 1994 discussed the impact of diverting the Aux P√©kans and Carheil rivers for the SM-3 plant. As well as changing the hydrological regime, water temperature would be affected, an important factor in the habitat quality for Atlantic salmon. The report found that the Moise River would become slightly warmer, with less change further downstream. An earlier study has also estimated the impact if some of the diverted water was returned to the Moisie further down. Calculations were made of the effect on the Moisie estuary if one of the embankments on the Carheil and Aux Pekans were to fail. The flood wave would give a maximum discharge of about , but because both embankments had low storage capacity, discharge would return to a flow rate of within about five hours. Water would rise by in the estuary depending on whether the sand bars at the river mouth were washed away or remained in place when the flood wave arrived. A commission of the Bureau of Public Hearings on the environment concluded that the diversion was not economically justified and could adversely affect the salmon population in the Moisie. In the end the government decided in favor of protecting the two tributaries. On 6 February 2003 the Quebec Council of Ministers approved two decrees granting full legal protection as aquatic reserves to the watersheds of the Moisie River down to 25 kilometers from Sept-√éles, and the Ashuapmushuan River down to Lac-Saint- Jean. The Moisie reserve included protection for the Carheil and Aux P√©kans, which were not to be diverted.

From 1882 to 1921 all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, The south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had dis-affiliated from the governing body, Google books the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all‚ÄìIreland team. Both teams now competed as Ireland and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams. Between 1928 and 1946 the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two Ireland teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. In April 1951, FIFA decreed that the IFA team could not select \\"citizens of Eire\\". An exception was for British Home Championship games, as a 1923 IFAB agreement at Liverpool prevented FIFA intervention in relations between the four Home Nations. However, the exception would only apply \\"if the F.A. of Ireland do not object\\", and was never availed of. At FIFA's 1953 congress, its Rule 3 was amended so that an international team must use \\"that title ... recognised politically and geographically of the countries or territories\\". The FAI initially claimed Rule 3 gave them the right to the name Ireland (see names of the Irish state), but FIFA subsequently ruled neither team could be referred to as Ireland, decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the Republic of Ireland, while the IFA team was to become Northern Ireland. The IFA objected and in 1954 was permitted to continue using the name Ireland in Home Internationals, based on the 1923 agreement. This practice was discontinued in the late 1970s.Matthew Taylor (2008). The Association Game: A History of British Football. Harlow:Pearson Education Ltd.

History  After the death of Euphemia of Masovia, widow of Vladislaus II of Opole by 1424, Bernard of Niemodlin and his brother Bolko IV of Opole inherited her dower lands, G≈Çog√≥wek, which at the end of that year was given to Bolko IV's son, Bolko V the Hussite. In 1424, after Bolko V the Hussite became the independent ruler over G≈Çog√≥wek and Prudnik thanks to the resignation of both his father and uncle Bernard. In 1428 Silesia was invaded by Hussite troops. In the capital of his domains, G≈Çog√≥wek, Bolko V decided at first to fight against them. However, almost immediately, the young Duke, at that time in Gliwice, not only decided to admit the Hussites into his city in order to avoid the destruction of his duchy, but also took the occasion to enrich himself with the secularization of the local churches (one of his first decisions was the cancellation of the building of a Kolegiata in G≈Çog√≥wek, which began by orders of Bolko IV). After a solemn oath, Bolko V vowed to support the Hussites, and he sent his army to help them. The cooperation with the Hussites was not just material, but also ideological. One aim of the duke was the policy of a gradual Germanization of Silesia, and the national teachings of Jan Hus fit in with this purpose. Later in that year, Bolko V took over all the goods of the Church in his Duchy. In 1429 with the Hussites involved on other fronts, Bolko V acquired for himself the neighboring Duchy of Nysa, which belonged to the Bishopric of Wroc≈Çaw. In the following year, together with his allies, he forced Polish troops to retreat to Jasna G√≥ra, which become the new Silesian-Poland frontier. He also tried to obtain some lands from the Dukes of Brzeg: Namys≈Ç√≥w (who could defend himself thanks to the help of the citizens of Wroc≈Çaw) and Kluczbork (which was taken by him). In the following years Bolko V became the ruler of almost all Upper Silesia and parts of Lower Silesia. In his conquests, Bolko V could count on the support of his closest relatives, his father Bolko IV and his uncle Bernard. His luck turned against him on 13 May 1433, in connection with his defeat at the Battle of Trzebnica against Duke Nicholas V of Karni√≥w. Despite this, Bolko V managed to maintain until his death the majority of Church goods obtained after the secularization. For this, in 1443 he was excommunicated. During 1444‚Äì1452 Bolko V led a fight against the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, over the buying of the Duchy of Siewierz. This war resulted in significant destruction on the Silesian-Lesser Poland frontier. The Emperor Frederick III feared a complete collapse of the Silesian states. The dispute only ended in 1452 during the Polish Sejm in Piotrk√≥w, where Bolko V even offered the Polish King Casimir IV financial assistance for a war against the Teutonic Order in exchange for the district of Wielu≈Ñ as a lien (the proposal wasn't accepted). Bolko V died on 29 May 1460 in his favorite residence, G≈Çog√≥wek, and was buried in the local Franciscan church. Without surviving male heirs, he was succeeded in all his domains by his only surviving brother, Nicholas I. = Dukes of G≈Çog√≥wek and Prudnik = * 1420‚Äì1424 ‚Äì Bernard of Niemodlin * 1420‚Äì1424 ‚Äì Bolko IV of Opole * 1424‚Äì1460 ‚Äì Bolko V the Hussite * 1460 ‚Äì Nicholas I of Opole  References  Category:Duchies of Silesia Category:States and territories established in 1420 Category:1460 disestablishments in Europe ","title":"Duchy of G≈Çog√≥wek and Prudnik"},{"id":"61850508","text":"Sphicosa globosa is a species of dance flies, in the fly family Empididae.

In 2014 the WHPCA and WHO produced a joint publication, the Global Atlas of Palliative Care at the End of Life, edited by Stephen Connor and Maria Cecilia Sepulveda Bermedo, a senior adviser on chronic diseases prevention and management for the WHO. It was initiated as part of the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases for 2013‚Äì2020. The study found that roughly 20 million people around the globe, 6% of whom were children, required end-of-life palliative care, with a majority of those in developing countries lacking basic necessities such as opioid medication for pain relief.

Security forces responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets and, , arbitrary arrests had been made, based on data from the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, among which 111 were minors according to Amnesty International and the Belady Foundation. Prominent arrestees included human rights lawyer Mahienour el- Massry, journalist and former leader of the Constitution Party Khaled Dawoud and two professors of political science at Cairo University, Hazem Hosny and Hassan Nafaa. The wave of arrests was the biggest in Egypt since Sisi formally became president in 2014. Human Rights Watch called for all those arrested for peacefully expressing their opinions to be released immediately. Amnesty International described the Sisi government being \\"shaken to its core\\" by the 20‚Äì21 September protests and that the authorities had \\"launched a full- throttle clampdown to crush demonstrations and intimidate activists, journalists and others into silence\\". Two thousand people, including Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) representatives, protested in Khartoum on 26 September in support of Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan, a Sudanese anti-Islamist student detained by Egyptian authorities, who gave a forced confession on MBC Masr television. The SPA stated, \\"the era when Sudanese citizens were humiliated inside or outside their country has gone and will never return\\". The Sudanese Foreign Ministry summoned the Egyptian ambassador and Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan was freed on 2 October 2019. A massive police clampdown took place around Tahrir Square and across Egypt on 27 September, together with pro-Sisi rallies of government employees organised by the National Security Agency, and anti-Sisi protests on Warraq Island on the Nile, in Giza, in Helwan, in Qus, and in the Luxor, Aswan Minya and Sohag Governorates. On 3 November 2019, parliamentarian Ahmed Tantawi made online and parliamentary proposals for Sisi to step down in 2022 rather than stand for re-election in 2024. Background Mass protests in the Egyptian revolution of 2011 led to the demission of President Hosni Mubarak, the 2012 Egyptian presidential election won by Mohamed Morsi, the 2012‚Äì13 Egyptian protests against the Morsi presidency, the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat which overthrew Morsi, the August 2013 Rabaa massacre by the security forces and army led by general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and an authoritarian government under Sisi, who was elected president with no serious opponents in 2014 and 2018. Online anti-Sisi videos Starting on 2 September 2019, Mohamed Ali (also: Aly), an Egyptian construction contractor living in exile in Spain, claimed on online social networks that he had worked in the construction industry for 15 years under army contracts, building five villas for colleagues of Sisi and a palace for Sisi in a military camp. Ali accused Sisi of wasting public funds and \\"[taking] low-level corruption to a new level\\". Ali's videos outline specific incidents and directly accuse well-known military individuals, including Major-Generals Kamel al-Wazir and Essam al-Kholy. Egyptian authorities ran a media campaign attacking Ali. According to Said and Mamdouh writing in Mada Masr, the governmental campaign \\"did not refute the substance of [Ali's] claims.\\" After the first week of wide circulation of Ali's videos, Sisi denied the allegations at a session of the \\"National Youth Conference. Sisi stated that \\"all the intelligence agencies told me please do not talk about it. ... I told them, what's between me and the people is trust.\\" Within a few hours of Sisi's speech, Ali posted two hours of new videos, referring to Sisi's son Mahmoud and the Sinai insurgency. Mosaad Abu Fagr, a Sinai activist in exile, then released two videos in which he claimed that the Egyptian authorities refused an offer by North Sinai tribal leaders to remove the terrorist cells within a few weeks, and that he was asked by the tribal leaders to publish that information. Abu Fagr stated that Sisi cooperated with drug smugglers and dealers instead of working with the tribes and that Sisi and his son Mahmoud have business interests in smuggling between the Sinai and the Gaza Strip. Abu Fagr also accused the Egyptian security forces of the \\"wiping out of entire villages\\" along the border with Gaza. Lawyer Mohamed Hamdy Younes stated that he would request the Attorney-General to investigate Ali's accusations. He was then arrested and charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation.Former army officer and lawyer Ahmed Sarhan circulated a video supporting most of Ali's claims, calling for Younes to be released and making new accusations against people close to Sisi. Sarhan's video was viewed half a million times. A masked man circulated a video claiming that he had sensitive information about Sisi, that Ali's videos contain \\"factual information about the corruption in the upper ranks of the Armed Forces\\" and that \\"the events happening\\" constitute \\"retaliation\\" by the Mukhabarat against Military Intelligence, which was headed by Sisi until 2012. In another video, a masked man claiming to be an intelligence officer stated that Sisi changed commanders frequently in order to avoid any becoming too powerful and that Sisi coordinated intelligence information closely with Israel. Former Air Force pilot Hany Sharaf and former state security officer Hesham Sabry then circulated videos highly critical of Sisi. Wael Ghonim, who played a key online role in sparking the 2011 Egyptian revolution and lives in the United States, posted videos similar to the others, adding claims that Sisi's son Mahmoud played a strong role in managing Egyptian \\"daily politics\\". A representative of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C. telephoned Ghonim, asking him to stop criticising the Egyptian authorities, in exchange for which he would receive a payment and a guarantee to be able to \\"return to Egypt safely\\". Ghonim refused, and a few days later Ghonim's brother Hazem was arrested in Cairo. Ghonim interpreted this as a kidnapping in revenge for Ghonim having refused to remain silent. Ali was described in mid-September by Mohamed Elmasry of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies as being \\"probably the most popular man in Egypt\\" with millions of viewers of his online videos and millions of people using Ali's anti-Sisi hashtags. Elmasry described Ali as \\"a legitimate threat to the el-Sisi government.\\" On 21 September, following the previous day's protests, Ali called for a \\"million-man march\\" to fill all the \\"major squares\\" in Egypt on the following Friday, 27 September. Ali stated, \\"This is a people's revolution... We have to link up together as one... and organise going down to the major squares.\\" Late September 2019 protests =20 and 21 September= On Friday 20 September 2019, in response to Ali's call for anti-Sisi protests, two thousand people, mostly young, in Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta, Suez and four other Egyptian cities on 20 September 2019 carried out street protests calling for Sisi to be removed from power. Chants included \\"rise up, fear not, Sisi must go\\" and \\"the people demand the regime's fall\\". Street protests continued in Cairo, Suez, Giza and El Mahalla El Kubra on 21 September. In Suez, with 200 demonstrators, teargas, rubber bullets and live bullets were shot at protestors. The teargas spread to \\"a few\\" kilometres from the zone of the protest where a resident felt the gas making her nose feel as if it were burning. =27 September= On 26 September, exiled former presidential candidate Ayman Nour stated that the massive scale of the arrests showed that the Sisi government was \\"terrified\\" and that he expected protests to grow, with the fear barrier having been broken down and the mass arrests provoking anger in the context of socioeconomic difficulties. On the same day, actor Amr Waked tweeted to seven million followers that \\"Sisi is done ... it is over for him and anyone who supports him now will be making a huge mistake.\\" ;Anti-Sisi On 27 September itself, 1000 to 2000 people on Warraq Island on the Nile next to Cairo protested against Sisi and were attacked by police using tear gas. One of the slogans chanted by protestors was, \\"No matter how, we'll bring Sisi down\\". Using their rifles, police \\"beat the hell\\" out of six of the Warraq protestors. A protest of 24 people took place in Helwan in the Cairo Governorate in front of the al-Istiqama mosque. Police fired shots in the air in response. Anti-Sisi protests took place in Qus in Qena, where they were dispersed by police, in Luxor Governorate, in Aswan Governorate, in Minya Governorate, and in Sohag Governorate. A protest of 70 people took place in Giza and was dispersed by police. ;Clampdown Police organised \\"a huge show of force\\" in central Cairo and other Egyptian cities, with Tahrir Square heavily policed and four metro stations close to Tahrir Square were closed. All roads leading to Tahrir Square were blocked and checkpoints were established on 6th October Bridge, which had been a key route to Tahrir Square during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and 15th May Bridge. Instructions received by the Ministry of Interior had been to respond to demonstrations with limited force for \\"no more than a few minutes\\" and the to use all available violent measures against street protests. ;Pro-Sisi Pro-Sisi rallies were organised on 27 September with the National Security Agency instructing health, education, youth and sports ministries and agencies and oil companies to send their employees to the rallies. State companies bussed employees to a major road east of the centre of Cairo and to Alexandria. Free meals were given to a group of families from Beni Mazar in Minya Governorate who organised 30 buses to participate in the pro-Sisi Cairo rallies. The National Security Agency warned independent Members of Parliament from talking about the \\"ongoing events or the discussions around Sisi\\". Arrests and harassment In response to the first reports of arrests, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called for Egypt to respect the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which it is legally bound, guaranteeing freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. HRW called for the Egyptian security services to follow the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials by using \\"non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms\\". Arrests for the 20 and 21 September protests were estimated as 500 by the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) that published a list of the names of arrestees. Arrests were earlier reported by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) for 12 towns including Cairo, Giza, Alexandria, Suez and towns in Dakahlia Governorate, Qalyubia Governorate and Kafr el-Sheikh. ECRF stated that it had created an \\"emergency room\\" to provide support in relation to the sudden surge in arrests. Human rights lawyer Mahienour el-Massry was arrested by three plainclothes officers in front of the Supreme State Security Prosecution headquarters in Cairo while telephoning to a friend Noha Kamal on 22 September. She screamed to Kamal, \\"They're arresting me. I am being taken away\\" and was taken away in a microbus. HRW called on the Egyptian security forces to \\"immediately release all those arrested for solely exercising their rights\\". On 23 September, Mohamed Ali, whose videos sparked off the online discussion and street protests, stated that \\"officers\\" had been following him in Spain for two weeks, and that he had been \\"hiding and running away from them\\". Ali stated that the officers wished to kill him and that he was too tired to \\"run any more\\". Ali stated that Spanish authorities were responsible for his safety and that if he were \\"killed in Spain,\\" then that would \\"[prove] that Europe is a liar just like the United States and is willing to give up anybody.\\" By 25 September, the arrest count was estimated at by the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), ECESR and ECRF and by Middle East Eye.In addition to el- Massry, prominent arrestees included former leader of the Constitution Party Khaled Dawoud and two professors of political science at Cairo University, Hazem Hosny and Hassan Nafaa. Dawoud, Hosny and Nafaa were charged with \\"spreading fake news and joining terrorist organisations\\". Hazem Hosny was arrested without a warrant and held incommunicado. His legal defence team called for him to be released immediately. Hosny had earlier described Mohamed Ali as playing a \\"positive role\\" and described the new protest movement as having the potential to affect the \\"international formula that largely determines Sisi's continued rule\\". Hosny argued in favour of \\"[stripping] Sisi of his dictatorial control of the Egyptian state\\". Prior to his arrest, Hassan Nafaa had argued that \\"the continuation of Sisi's absolute rule [would] lead to disaster\\" and that \\"public pressure from the street\\" was needed to end Sisi's presidency. Nafaa stated that \\"the image Sisi has created for himself has been totally shaken and it has been replaced by the opposite image.\\" Khaled Dawoud, arrested on 25 September 2019, as former media spokesperson of the National Salvation Front, had supported the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat but later criticised Sisi. Following Mohamed Ali's video releases, Dawoud called for investigations of the corruption claims. The arrest count mounted to on 26 September, with the arrest of lawyers Mohamed Salah Agag, deputy head of the Lawyers' Syndicate; Ahmed Sarhan; Ahmed Abdel Azeem; Islam Khairy Nour Eddin and Mahmoud Moemen Naeem. Two Turks, two Jordanians, a Palestinian and a Dutchman were arrested and charged with \\"spreading violence against the state and publishing false news.\\" The arrests of five journalists, including Sayed Abdellah, who had been reporting on the protests in Suez, and Mohammed Ibrahim, author of the blog \\"Oxygen Egypt\\", were documented by Amnesty International. Labour leader Rashad Mohammed Kamal, who participated in the protests, was arrested at his home in Suez. Politicians, including Abed Aziz Husseini, vice-president of the Dignity Party (Karama) and Abdel Nasser Ismail, vice-president of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party were arrested. On 29 September, the Egyptian blogger, software developer and activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who had previously been arrested for his political activism during the Mubarak, Morsi and Sisi presidencies, and had not participated in the 2019 Egyptian protests, was arrested by State Security Prosecution on unknown charges. El-Fattah's lawyer Mohamed al-Baqer, director of the human rights organisation Adalah Center for Rights and Freedoms, was himself arrested at the prosecutor's office on 29 September. Both were tortured in welcome parades in Tora Prison. Arrested politicians included 11 members of the Independence Party that had called for citizens to participate in the street protests as proposed by Mohamed Ali. On 2 October, ECESR listed detainees grouped into six separate legal cases, among which almost all () are in Case 1338/2019. Alaa Abd el-Fattah and his lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer were detained under Case 1356/2019 or 1365/2019. On 6 October, ECRF listed about detainees, larger than any earlier arrest waves of the Sisi presidency. Three quarters had appeared in front of a prosecutor; 57 had been released without being charged; 100 people were listed as missing. Of those arrested for protesting, many prisoners appear to not have participated in this most recent wave of action. There are multiple cases of people claiming that their family members have never publicly protested, in 2011 or 2019, but were still arrested. Several human rights lawyers and advocates described the arrests as indiscriminate and arbitrary. Amnesty International stated that at least 111 children were arrested as well, often after having their phones searched at checkpoints. According to the New York Times, the arrested protestors were held in poor conditions. Due to the overflow in local prisons, some detainees have gone without food, water, or access to toilets. Most have not been allowed to contact their families. For this reason, families of those imprisoned rarely knew where their family members were being held. Some of the detained were placed in the bases of the Central Security Forces, a paramilitary group whose buildings are not made to hold citizen prisoners. =Internet censorship= In the week following the 20/21 September protests, Egyptian authorities blocked, restricted or temporarily disrupted online communication services including BBC News, WhatsApp, Signal. =Egyptian political party freeze threat= The Civil Democratic Movement, including the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, stated that it did not participate in the protests but did have a vision for political reforms. It objected to the mass arrests of protestors, lawyers, journalists and politicians, and stated that it was considering a freeze on public political activities in response to the crackdown. Further calls for political change =November parliamentary protest= On 3 November 2019, elected member of the House of Representatives Ahmed Tantawi made parliamentary and online social network protests calling for el-Sisi to step down in 2022, rather than in 2024 as defined in the 2019 constitutional amendment. Tantawi later discussed his video with Mada Masr, stating that his aim was to protect Egypt from the \\"imminent danger\\" of el- Sisi continuing in power too long, that it was consistent with el-Sisi's promises, and that this should satisfy el-Sisi's supporters. Tantawi submitted his formal request under parliamentary procedure to Ali Abdel Aal, Speaker of the House of Representatives, proposing that 12 parliamentary committees be created to \\"generate a national dialogue about the political, economic and social problems facing the country,\\" to solve \\"the real crisis Egypt is living through, which authorities should pay attention to before it is too late\\" and that the proposal would help to \\"absorb public outrage\\". Tantawi expressed his worry that a violent reaction by authorities to his initiative would discourage \\"the people\\" from choosing political methods of change. Member of parliament Mahmoud Badr called Tantawi's proposal an \\"outright violation of the constitution\\" and 95 members of parliament submitted a request to the Speaker, Abdel Aal, to refer Tantawi to the parliament's Ethics Committee, on the grounds that Tantawi's initiative \\"undermines the Egyptian state and its institutions\\". =December 2019 broad consensus= On 28 December 2019, Mohamed Ali, who had sparked off the September street protests, released the \\"Egyptian Consensus Document\\" with a list of four key principles and four key actions for replacing the existing system of government. Ali claimed that the document represented the consensus of a wide range of the Egyptian opposition. The following day, the Egyptian National Action Group (ENAG), including Ayman Nour as spokesperson, was launched. ENAG made a similar claim of representing the consensus of a broad array of the Egyptian opposition (\\"centrists, liberals, leftists [and] Islamists\\") with a consensus program for replacing the governmental system. =September 2020 anniversary= Protests restarted on the 2020 anniversary of the 2019 protests. The protests were decentralised and started on 20 September 2020, again calling for el-Sisi to resign. Protest locations included Cairo, Giza, Suez, Kafr El Dawwar, Alexandria, Aswan, El Qanater El Khayreya, Faiyum, Minya and Luxor. The sixth day of protests, on 25 September, was called a \\"Day of Rage\\". Sociopolitical analysis Dalia Fahmy of Long Island University said that the 20 September 2019 protests showed people \\"[breaking] the fear barrier\\", which she said was surprising but expected because of demographic change. She stated, \\"When you have much of the population that doesn't live with the post-revolution trauma or memories, you have a group of young people coming in with a different set of demands and different kinds of understanding of a future possibility. So those on the streets today are very different from the ones that were there eight years ago.\\" =Muslim Brotherhood role= According to American University in Cairo political science professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyed, the Muslim Brotherhood supported and amplified Mohamed Ali's criticisms against Sisi and Ali's calls for protests. Al-Sayyed stated, \\"the Brotherhood certainly benefited from his videos and their channels exploited what he was saying to portray a negative image of Sisi's leadership.\\" He expected that the Muslim Brotherhood as an \\"idea based on Islam [would] continue to attract many.\\" Former member of parliament and member of the al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, Amr el-Shobaki, judged the Brotherhood's role to be weak, stating that the Brotherhood does not \\"have the capacity to call for a rally [and its] capacity to recruit new members has been weakened.\\" He said that the 20 September protests were by \\"everyday youth, those economically marginalised\\" and that \\"the Brotherhood wasn't behind or even participated\\" in the protests. Reactions Writing in The Independent on 6 October 2019, Bel Trew criticised the lack of reactions of Western powers to the wave of arrests, stating \\"no major western ally of Egypt has breathed a word.\\" =Egypt= The Revolutionary Socialists stated that the protests \\"restored hope to the millions who were desperate\\". The Social Democratic Party, a supporter of the 2013 coup by Sisi, objected to the 2019 crackdown, stating that citizens had the right to \\"exercise their constitutional and legal right to peaceful demonstration\\". =International civil society protests= Demonstrations by expatriate Egyptians in support of the 21 September and 22 September protests took place in the United States, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and South Africa. ;Sudan On 26 September, two thousand people protested in support of Waleed Abdelrahman Hassan (or Walid, Abdulrahman), a Sudanese student arrested in Cairo for alleged participation in the 21 September protest. The protest took place in Khartoum in front of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Egyptian embassy. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) called for Abdelrahman Hassan to be able to contact his family, choose a lawyer and not be tortured or coerced. Abdelrahman Hassan's friends and relatives stated that an apparent confession by him broadcast by MBC Masr on 26 September, in which he stated support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, was a forced confession, given Abdelrahman Hassan's long-term opposition to Islamists in Sudan under the Omar al-Bashir government, for which he was arrested in 2013 and 2018, and during the Sudanese Revolution. Abdelrahman Hassan's friend Mohammed Saleh described the idea of Hassan supporting the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as \\"unbelievable\\". The SPA stated that the video broadcast was \\"shameful\\" and that, \\"We stress here that the era when Sudanese citizens were humiliated inside or outside their country has gone and will never return.\\" Another protest in front of the Egyptian embassy in Khartoum was held on 27 September, with protest banners stating that Abdelrahman Hassan was not a member of the Muslim brotherhood and that he didn't participate in the 2019 Egyptian protests. The Sudanese embassy in Cairo stated that it was in contact with Egyptian authorities and that Abdelrahman Hassan was charged with terrorism and membership of a banned organisation. On 29 September, the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum was summoned and informed of concerns about Abdelrahman Hassan. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry protested against the Egyptian refusal to allow the Sudanese embassy in Cairo to meet Abdelrahman Hassan and asked for Abdelrahman Hassan to be given his full legal rights by the Egyptian authorities. Abdelrahman Hassan was released on 2 October and the Sudanese embassy in Cairo said that he would depart Cairo the same evening to return to Khartoum. =International bodies= ;European Parliament According to the European Parliament (EP), as of 23 October 2019, there had been \\"no official, strong and united public response [forthcoming] from the [European Union] and its Member States to the September-October 2019 crackdown in Egypt\\". In Resolution 2019/2880(RSP), the EP strongly condemned the crackdown and \\"[reminded] Egypt that any response by the security forces should be in line with international norms and standards and its own Constitution.\\" In the resolution, the EP itemised 18 comments, requests, instructions and demands to Egyptian and European Union authorities and to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in relation to the crackdown and other human rights issues in Egypt. = The United States = On 23 September, between the two major protests in the fall of 2019, Sisi met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations General Assembly. In reference to the protests, Trump stated that \\"everybody has demonstrations\\" and that \\"Egypt has a great leader.\\" He reiterated his support for a strong relationship between Egypt and the United States. Trump said that Sisi has brought order and stability to his country. At the meeting, Sisi claimed that the cause of the protests was \\"political Islam.\\" See also *2019‚Äì20 Algerian protests *Human rights in Egypt *Sudanese Revolution *2019‚Äì20 Lebanese protests *2019‚Äì20 Iraqi protests References Category:2018‚Äì2020 Arab protests Category:2019 in Egypt Category:2019 protests Category:Arab Winter in Egypt Category:Protests in Egypt Category:September 2019 events in Africa ","title":"2019 Egyptian protests"},{"id":"61850712","text":"Richard David Boyle (March 26, 1942 ‚Äì September 1, 2016) was an American reporter, photojournalist and author best known for his video documentaries, Sir!

They are created when lava flows through an area of trees, coating their exterior. The lava cools just enough to create a solid crust around the trunk, but the tree inside burns away leaving a cavity. Molds of trees may be vertical or horizontal. In many cases, mold formation requires slow moving lava, as well as enough time for the mold to chill.  Methane explosions  A unique phenomenon may occur during the formation of vertical tree molds. As the lava-encased tree burns away, the roots are heated up and generate a \\"producer\\" gas, such as methane. If the roots penetrate into a cavity, such as a lava tube or tumulus crack, it may come into contact with oxygen. Because there is a source of heat already present, the charred root or the lava itself, a methane explosion may follow if the oxygen and producer gas mixture is between 5 and 15% (volume-percent fuel).

In October 1920, he departed from Istanbul and travelled to the region of the Kocgiri tribe in the Erzincan province, where he established several offices for the Society for the Rise of Kurdistan. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk soon was aware of his activities and called Dersimi responsible for the uprising. Following, Dersimi hid with Seyit Riza and taught people to write Kurdish in Latin letters and was a well received notable amongst the Kurdish community. In 1931 the Turkish Government pardoned Dersimi and gave him a farm in Holvenk. But the Turkish authorities still kept searching his house and friends then visited seldomly.

It's a dark story about affections and loyalties between prisoners, the search for sexual identity, love, violence, and the rise to power behind bars. Its world premiere was in the Critic‚Äôs Week section at Venice International Film Festival 2019, winning the prestigious Queer Lion Prize. The Prince was also selected to compete in San Sebastian International Film Festival, 2009 at the Horizontes Latinos section. . right Plot Within a prison in Santiago of the 70's, Jaime, a young prisoner who has been convicted for the violent and inexplicable crime of his best friend, has a definitive encounter with \\"the Stallion\\", an older man who inspires respect and holds the power behind bars. Searching for protection, Jaime develops with the man a relationship of affection and tenderness, discovers love and the need to be recognized, and later, becoming \\"The Prince\\", finally rethink his sexual identity, and the reason for the crime that took him to prison.

Cruz's homo-erotic novel has its heyday in the 70s, it was never available in bookstores and could only be acquired in the newsstands of San Diego Street, in Santiago, becoming a cult novel. Director Sebasti√°n Mu√±oz found it by chance and, along with Barrales himself, refined the script to its final form. Subsequently, the Chilean production team Ni√±a Ni√±o Films and El Otro Films, Argentine Le Tiro Cine, and Belgian Be Revolution Pictures joined the project. The cast was completed with veterans actors Alfredo Castro (From Afar, The Club) and Gast√≥n Pauls (Nine Queens), plus the young actors Juan Carlos Maldonado (from TV, in his first leading role in films), Sebasti√°n Ayala (theater actor and film director) and Lucas Balmaceda (theater and TV, and younger brother of the Chilean actor Pedro Pascal) Reception During the Venice festival, most of the Italian specialized press evaluated the film positively.

The Capel Street Theatre had two distinct periods in its history. The first theatre on the site was called the 'New Theatre in Capel Street' or 'City Theatre in Capel Street' and was built by William 'Harlequin' Phillips on a strip of land 50 feet by 100 feet that he leased on the West side of Capel Street between Little Strand Street and Mary's Abbey. In 1744 Phillips and his wife were members of the United Company in Dublin; they and other members of the troupe became increasingly dissatisfied with their treatment, so Phillips, his wife and members of the Company went to the small playhouse he had built and which opened in January 1745. The theatre stood some 50 feet back from the street behind Nos 136 and 137 Capel Street and was reached by way of a passageway. The theatre's auditorium had boxes, lattices, an orchestra pit and first and second floor galleries. However, the theatre had been built hastily causing concerns about its safety, forcing the manager to issue a statement that he would obtain the necessary certificates from Master Builders. This theatre closed in 1749 and the building was appropriated for other uses.John C. Greene, Gladys L. H.

Though he wrote several books regarding Vaishnav Hinduism, Choudhury is most well known for his monumental work on the history of the Sylhet region, the Srihatter Itibritta. Life Born in the village of Moina in Karimganj (then part of the District of Sylhet), he was the son of Aditya Charan Choudhury and his wife Kotimoni. Through his father, Choudhury was a descendant of the Zamindars of Jafargarh. As a child, while he received some primary education, Choudhury also taught himself history and religion, with a special focus on literature and Vaishnav theory. The latter proved of particular importance in adulthood when he converted to the faith, performing pilgrimages to holy sites in places such as Puri, Vrindavan and Dhakadakkhin. In the last of these, he established a temple out of his own expenses. In 1897, he began his career as a teacher in Girish Middle English School in Sylhet, before later being appointed treasurer of the landed estate in Patharkandi. In 1897, Choudhury establish a monthly newspaper called Srihatter Durpun, though this ceased publication after only two years. A decade later, he began his magnum opus, an extensive work on the history of Sylhet, termed the Srihatter Itibritta. The text was published in two volumes. The first, released in 1910, focused its early chapters on the geography of Sylhet before chronicling the development of the region. This continued on in the second volume, published six years later, which also included the genealogies of prominent Sylheti families, as well as over a hundred short biographies of notable personages. The work was widely praised at the time of its release, with the contemporary historian Jadunath Sarkar applauding its \\"ideal technique\\" in chronicling regional history. The Srihatter Itibritta remains a lauded and popular work to the present-day. Choudhury maintained an extensive personal library composed of three thousand books and manuscripts regarding history and religion. He also wrote a series of books on Vaishnav theology, with his devotion to the faith leading him to be regarded by local people as a guru. He died on 25 September 1953, aged eighty-seven.

It was compiled and published in a book under the name of Fortunio in 1838.Pierre Laubriet, Fortunio - Notice de Jean-Claude Brunon in Th√©ophile Gautier Romans, contes et nouvelles, tome 1, biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade, Gallimard, 2002, It deals with Orientalist themes, and satirizes wealth, worldliness, and idleness. It has been characterized as absurdist, eccentric, and Decadent, and is a Romantic fantasy. Gautier considered the novel to be \\"his last expression of a 'doctrine'\\" concerning artistic creation. Plot summary The novel opens with a dinner party, which has been referred to as an \\"orgy\\" by some critics. The reader is introduced to George, the host, as well as the women Musidora, Arabella, Phoebe, and Cynthia. The mysterious Fortunio was invited, but is nowhere to be seen, and gossip abounds. Musidora's interest is piqued, and she makes a bet with George that she will get Fortunio to fall in love with her within six weeks. Fortunio finally arrives, and ignores her the entire night. Musidora steals his purse and takes it home in despair. Musidora's servants, Jacinthe and Jack, as well as her white cat, are introduced as she struggles to get the purse open. She loses faith in the bet and falls in love with Fortunio in short order, but upon opening the purse finds a letter she cannot read and a strange needle. She decides to hunt down someone who can read the letter, and goes with Arabella to the houses of renowned professors of language. They are unsuccessful, and eventually track down an Indian man on the street who translates it as part of a poem. Upon her return home, she receives a letter from Fortunio informing her that she may keep the purse, and warning her that the needle is poisoned. She is angered that her theft has not produced an emotional reaction, and loses the will to live. A visit from George prompts her to go looking for Fortunio in the city, but to no avail. She returns, loses the will to live again, and plans to commit suicide by needle shortly before noon. She tests the poison on her white cat, and finds that it is a graceful death. A few minutes before noon, she receives another letter from Fortunio, summoning her to his home. She happily goes. Jack and Jacinthe find the cat shortly after, and worry about the consequences for letting it die. Musidora and Fortunio have a date, complete with a tiger, and Fortunio decides that he has fallen in love with her. They stay together for a while. During a night that they are spending at Musidora's house, Musidora wakes up to smoke and fire, and Fortunio takes her out of the house. He admits to setting the fire, and to extreme jealousy that made him hate anything that he had not given her himself. Anything that predated their relationship needed to go. He buys a new house for her, and she accepts his jealousy and feelings. Eventually, Fortunio begins to leave her alone for periods of time without telling her where he went. His true home in Paris is introduced: Eldorado, which he hollowed out of a block of townhouses and filled with an Indian hothouse environment and servant girls. His favorite, Soudja-Sara, is a young Indonesian girl whom he has trained as a courtesan to care about him above all else. None of the servants who live within Eldorado have any idea that they are in Paris, or indeed what Paris even is. When Fortunio leaves, they expect that he is off hunting tigers. Fortunio has decided that his jealousy for Musidora is too consuming, and that they would both be better off without the relationship. He writes her a letter in the guise of someone else, informing her that he has died. She will receive an annual income ever after. Musidora immediately goes to the old pouch and pricks herself with the poisoned needle, committing suicide. Fortunio returns to India, and writes a letter explaining his distaste with Paris and its culture and customs, which are so strange to him. Themes Fortunio is full of \\"absurdities and extravagances\\" and wholly without \\"dramatic force and effect.\\" Gautier relies on descriptive language, especially concerning the physical features, bodies, and clothing of characters. The settings are also sumptuously described and attired. Both men and women are reduced to their beauty (or lack of it), but the women especially are described as either doll-like or passionate, depending on the plot point. All of the main characters are described as extremely perfect physically, and differ only in personality. However, this would seem to be at least partially satirical, as Musidora's described traits are contradicting - she has blue eyes, she has green eyes; her hair is straight, her hair is perfectly wavy. Musidora's life and actions especially revolve around Fortunio, and she is not shown to have any other thoughts. However, the same could be said for every other character in the novel - Musidora is simply one of the main characters, and exhibits the trait most obviously. Fashion, textiles, and furniture are important to the narrator, and are carefully described at the beginning of every scene. He pointedly says that he dislikes modern men's fashion. One professor is described as wearing a wig, an item which went out of fashion decades previous, and Musidora at one point goes without a corset. Fabrics are mentioned to have come from all around the world, and very often allusions to classical tales or historical art are used in metaphor. Fortunio is an orientalist story, full of mystery and romance concerning the East. Treasures and customs are often mentioned, and much of Fortunio's mystery comes from the fact that he was not raised in Paris, and cannot be pinned down in the way that the Parisians are accustomed to. Exoticism and mystery are frequently occurring themes. Fortunio himself was raised with immense wealth and no restrictions, and much is made of his behavior and personality. It is noted that rich men have no cares for the law, but Fortunio does not do anything that the narrator himself considers immoral until he burns Musidora's house down.

It has also been known as Hollister Elementary. With The school was deemed significant as \\"it represents the early settlement of Twin Falls County and more specifically, the organization of the Salmon River irrigation project\\" which reclaimed a large area by use of Milner Dam (1904) and Salmon Dam (1909), the latter being the largest dam in the U.S. northwest and the third largest in the world, at the time. The irrigation project partly failed, in not providing enough water, in part because lava rock in the Salmon Dam leaked water. Hollister failed to thrive, and the local high school moved to the second floor of this building. The building included a gymnasium, which was damaged by 1925 by the large crowds during basketball games, so athletic events had to be moved elsewhere. The high school was consolidated with a school district based in Filer, Idaho in 1948; this building continued to be used as an elementary school thereafter.

Not only these individuals, but also the hearing members of the family and indeed all members of the villages where they live have developed a sign language for effective communication. This system ... remains to be scientifically researched. My initial investigations of one such family with three deaf adult children show that the sign system is capable of conveying quite abstract messages; for example, about events in the future, things witnessed in the past, or hopes and desires in the present. By virtue of the developed sign system, the deaf members of this family are fully integrated members of the village community. Two of them have married in the traditional way, involving complex exchanges of shell money between kin, and have children, some of whom are deaf, so the sign system will have a future utility, and is in effect a strand of cultural tradition in the making.Lauren Reed & Alan Rumsey (2019), 'Sign Languages in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon' References Category:Village sign languages Category:Languages of Papua New Guinea ","title":"Rossel Island Sign Language"},{"id":"61851476","text":"National Secondary Route 160, or just Route 160 (, or ) is a National Road Route of Costa Rica, located in the Guanacaste, Puntarenas provinces.

He won both the world amateur and world professional titles twice.  Early Career and English Amateur Championship Titles Dagley learned to play billiards from two brothers who were good amateur players, Reg and Jack Wright, in his home village of Earl Shilton. He served in the Korean War whilst on National Service, and once spent a night in a group on a dinghy after the American transport plane that they were on had to ditch. He said that this experience of not knowing what the dawn would bring gave him a perspective on the game: \\"After that, you don't get worked up over a game of billiards.\\" He was runner-up in the English Amateur Billiards championship in 1963, and from 1964 won the title fifteen times in twenty-one attempts, never again losing in the final. He set many records, including a world and English championship record break of 862 and session average of 116.6 in 1978. In the 1984 final, his average was 147.7. He also enjoyed success in the CIU championships, another major tournament in England, winning the title 11 times between 1964 and 1981.  IBSF World Amateur Championship  Dagley won the IBSF World Billiards Championship in 1971, defeating Mannie Francisco in the final, and again in 1975, with Michael Ferreira as runner-up. He received a cigarette box from the Mayor of Hinckley to commemorate the second of his world championship wins. He was also runner-up in 1979 to Paul Mifsud and in 1981 to Michael Ferreira. He did not turn professional until the age of 54, and even as a professional, retained his job as the manager of a snooker club in the town of Nuneaton.  Professional career  In his first attempt at the World Professional Championship, when the matches were played as the best of five games of 400-up, he proceeded to the 1985 final without losing a game, with 3‚Äì0 wins over Jack Fitzmaurice, Jack Karnehm and Robby Foldvari. Dagley finished as runner up to Ray Edmonds 3‚Äì1, with most games being close. The game scores (Edmonds first) were 400‚Äì395, 307‚Äì400, 400‚Äì315 and 400‚Äì386. The following year, 1986, he beat both Bernard Bennett and Eddie Charlton 3‚Äì0, before dropping his first game of the championship in a 3‚Äì1 defeat of the previous year's winner Ray Edmonds. In the final, he won the first game against Robby Foldvari but then lost the next three and the match. In 1987, he defeated Robert Close 3‚Äì0, Ian Williamson 3‚Äì1, and Mark Wildman 3‚Äì0 to set up a rematch of the previous years final against Foldvari. This time it was Dagley who lost the first game before going in to win the next three, and the title. Winning the 1987 professional championship meant that Dagley had completed a unique set of titles over his career ‚Äì English Amateur Champion, World Amateur champion, UK Professional Champion, and World Professional Champion. He won ¬£9,500, then the largest prize ever seen in billiards, for the world championship, and with his other successes that season, including the UK and European titles, pocketed almost ¬£20,000 of the nearly ¬£50,000 total prize money on the circuit that season. Dagley retained the title in 1988. With wins over Mike Russell 4‚Äì0, H. Griffiths 4‚Äì1 and Ian Williamson 4‚Äì1. He then defeated Australian veteran Eddie Charlton 7‚Äì4 in the final. Aged 61 in 1991, he won the British Open trophy at the Barbican Centre. It was held there as part of the celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the death of the composer Mozart, who was a keen player of billiards. He was married, to Nita. Dagley died in 1998 after suffering severe influenza. He is commemorated with a blue plaque in Earl Shilton, and there is also a street called Norman Dagley Close in the village.

Saunders joined the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and himself. They then met Marvin Minsky and other influential pioneers in what was then known as Artificial Intelligence. MIT: 1956‚Äì1962 From 1957‚Äì61, Robert Saunders worked with other undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed by Jack Dennis to develop programs for the then TX-0 experimental computer on permanent loan from Lincoln Laboratory. During these years, Saunders and his fellow TRMC members are described as the first true hackers in the book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy. At MIT, Saunders earned bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering. The TMRC group was heavily influenced by professors such as Jack Dennis and Uncle John McCarthy ‚Äì and by their continued involvement in the student group known as Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC). While a graduate student, Jack Dennis (former TMRC member) introduced students to the TX-0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory. In the spring of 1959, McCarthy taught the first course in programming that MIT offered to freshmen. and Outside classes, Saunders, along with fellow TMRC members Alan Kotok, David Gross, Peter Samson, and Robert A. Wagner, all friends from TMRC, reserved time on the TX-0.. Kotok begins at 0:53:50. Dennis enjoyed watching the young hackers work and allowed them to use the TX-0 for various personal projects. In 1961, DEC donated a PDP-1 to MIT. The PDP-1 had a Type 30 precision CRT display and you could see code run while you were working. Students from TMRC worked as support staff and used this new look at programming as a way to change the way computers were used, working the Lisp programming language and a number of other innovations at the time. Spacewar! One of these innovations was the first real digital game, called Spacewar!. Written by Saunders, Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell and Wayne Wiitanen in 1961, Spacewar! was inspired by Marvin Minsky's Three Position Display. After urging Russell to start the game for some time, the group had the first version running by early 1962, with some assistance from then DEC employee Alan Kotok. Primarily written by Russell, Spacewar! was one of the earliest interactive computer games. During this time, Saunders built the first game controllers, thus allowing two people to play against each other without using the control switches on the front of the computer. After his years at MIT, Saunders spent most of his professional career at Hewlett-Packard, working on computer operating systems. In 1993, he went to work for five years in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, helping to manage the computer system which deals with maintenance of the Royal Saudi Air Force's airplanes. Saunders devised a proof of Karl Popper's conjecture on refutability, showing that the potential information content of any proposition is equivalent to its refutability. In other words, if there does not exist a means by which a proposition could be shown to be wrong, it can convey no information.

Passage was born in Detroit, and moved to New York when she was 17 years old. Exotic dancing was just one of her jobs. At the time she met her second husband Kenneth I. Starr, a Wall Street hedge fund manager, her day job was at an ad agency. Passage quit dancing after marrying Starr, in 2007, and three years later Starr's investors learned he had been running a ponzi scheme. When her judge pronounced her husband's guilty verdict she proclaimed that ‚ÄúHe seemed to have lost his moral compass, partly as a result of infatuation with his young fourth wife.‚Äù After she separated from Starr, Passage was cast in a reality TV show that would have been called Wall Street Wives. The series did not end up being produced. According to press reports Passage only learned that Starr had three ex-wives, not two, during his trial. Wesley Snipes, a movie star who faced serious penalties for a tax evasion conviction, contacted Passage, seeking help getting his conviction overturned. Snipes had been one of her ex-husband's clients, and Starr had testified against him, and Snipes was concerned that the jury had not been informed that Starr had himself been under investigation when he testified against him. Passage described feeling worried for her safety, thinking shadowy men were following her, but they turned out to be private investigators working for Snipes. After her husband's arrest she says she befriended her neighbor, Catherine Hopper, the fiancee of the son of another ponzi schemer, Bernie Madoff. In 2011 Passage started writing a dating advice column that Gawker mocked for its cynicism. In 2012 Passage announced she would be writing a tell-all book about her ex-husband. Passage is a proponent of pole dancing. She has organized charity events focussed around pole dancing and worked to get it recognized as a sport, even suggesting it had a place at the Olympic Games.

In the field of personality psychology, Machiavellianism is a personality trait centered on manipulativeness, callousness, and indifference to morality.Jones, D. N., & Paulhus, D. L. (2009). Machiavellianism. In M. R. Leary & R. H. Hoyle (Eds.), Handbook of individual differences in social behavior (pp. 93‚Äì108). New York, NY, US: The Guilford Press. Though unrelated to the historical figure or his works, the trait is named after the political philosophy of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, as psychologists Richard Christie and Florence Geis used edited and truncated statements inspired by his works to study variations in human behaviors. Christie, R. Geis, F. \\"Some Consequences with Taking Machiavelli Seriously\\" in Edgar F. Borgatta and William W. Lambert (eds.). Handbook of Personality Theory and ResearchStudies in Machiavellianism, \\"Scale Construction\\", pg 10Rauthmann, J. F., & Will, T. (2011). Proposing a multidimensional Machiavellianism conceptualization. Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal, 39(3), 391-404. Their Mach IV test, a 20-question, Likert-scale personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool and scale of the Machiavellianism construct. Those who score high on the scale (High Machs) are more likely to have a high level of deceitfulness and a unempathetic temperament. It is one of the dark triad traits, along with narcissism and psychopathy.Paulhus, D., Williams, K.The Dark Triad of personality: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy Origin of the construct In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis wanted to analyze those who manipulated others, and developed a test using a selection of statements, including a few truncated and edited sentences from Machiavelli's works as test items, naming the construct \\"Machiavellianism\\" after Machiavelli.Christie, Richard \\"On being detached about Machiavellianism\\" They wanted to assess whether or not those who were in agreement with the statements would behave differently than others who disagreed, specifically in regards to manipulative actions. Their Mach IV test, a 20-question, Likert- scale personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool of the Machiavellianism construct. Using their scale, Christie and Geis conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of \\"high Machs\\" and \\"low Machs\\" differ.Christie, R. & Geis, F. (1970) \\"Studies in Machiavellianism\\". NY: Academic Press. Page 260 People scoring high on the scale (high Machs) tend to endorse manipulative statements, and behave accordingly, contrary to those who score lowly (low Machs). Their basic results have been widely replicated. Measured on the Mach - IV scale, males score, on average, slightly higher on Machiavellianism than females. =Etiology= A recent behavioral genetics study noted that Machiavellianism has both significantly genetic and environmental influences. There has also been extensive research on Machiavellianism in young children and adolescents, via a measure dubbed the \\"kiddie Mach\\" test. =Motivation= A 1992 review described the motivation of those high on the Machiavellianism scale as related to cold selfishness and pure instrumentality, and those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives (e.g. sex, achievement, sociality) in duplicitous ways. More recent research on the motivations of high Machs compared to low Machs found that they gave high priority to money, power, and competition and relatively low priority to community building, self-love, and family commitment. High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost. = Opportunism = In general, people high in Machiavellianism will attempt to achieve their goals by whatever means necessary. This includes things such as bending and breaking rules, cheating, and stealing. People high in Machiavellianism are able to easily switch between working with others and using others to achieve their goals. People high in Machiavellianism do not have the same level of emotions as others and as such are more willing to do things others see as terrible or immoral. In the pursuit of their goals, people high in Machiavellianism will even go so far as to hurt and manipulate others if they think it would be beneficial. =Abilities= Due to their skill at interpersonal manipulation, there has often been an assumption that high Machs possess superior intelligence, or ability to understand other people in social situations. However, some research has established that Machiavellianism is unrelated to IQ. Recently, new research gives support to a contrary viewpoint. Furthermore, studies on emotional intelligence have found that high Machiavellianism is usually associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both performance and questionnaire measures. Both emotional empathy and emotion recognition have been shown to have negative correlations with Machiavellianism. Additionally, research has shown that Machiavellianism is unrelated to a more advanced theory of mind, that is, the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social situations. If high Machs actually are skilled at manipulating others, this appears to be unrelated to any special cognitive abilities as such, and may simply be due to a greater willingness to engage in manipulation. Relations with other personality traits Machiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the dark triad, along with narcissism and psychopathy. Some psychologists consider Machiavellianism to be essentially a subclinical form of psychopathy, as they both share manipulative tendencies and cold callousness as their primary attributes. More recent research suggests that while Machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap heavily, they are distinct personality constructs. Psychopathy differs from Machiavellianism mainly in impulsivity, a lack of long term planning and self control. Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with agreeableness (r = ‚àí0.47) and conscientiousness (r = ‚àí0.34), two dimensions of the \\"big five\\" personality model (NEO-PI-R). However, Machiavellianism correlates more highly with the honesty-humility dimension of the six-factor HEXACO model than with any of the big five dimensions. Machiavellianism has also been located within the interpersonal circumplex, which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and communion. Agency refers to the motivation to succeed and to individuate the self, whereas communion refers to the motivation to merge with others and to support group interests. Machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the circumplex defined by high agency and low communion. Machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally opposite from a circumplex construct called self-construal, a tendency to prefer communion over agency. This suggests that people high in Machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve, they wish to do so at the expense of (or at least without regard to) others. =Game theory= In 2002, the Machiavellianism scale of Christie and Geis was applied by behavioral game theorists Anna Gunnthorsdottir, Kevin McCabe and Vernon L. Smith in their search for explanations for the spread of observed behavior in experimental games, in particular individual choices which do not correspond to assumptions of material self-interest captured by the standard Nash equilibrium prediction. It was found that in a trust game, those with high Mach-IV scores tended to follow homo economicus' equilibrium strategies while those with low Mach-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium, and instead made choices that reflected widely accepted moral standards and social preferences. =Dimensionality= Although there have been myriad proposed factor structures, two dimensions emerge most consistently within factor-analytic research ‚Äì differentiating Machiavellian views from behaviors.Fehr, B.; Samsom, D.; and Paulhus, D. L., 1992. The Construct of Machiavellianism: Twenty Years Later. In C. D. Spielberger & J. N. Butcher (Eds), Advances in Personality Assessment (Vol 9), pp. 77‚Äì116. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Although the Mach-IV scale is unable to reliably capture the two dimensions, a 10-item subset of the scale known as the \\"two-dimensional Mach-IV\\" (TDM-V), reproduces the views and tactics dimensions across countries, genders, sample types, and scale category length. The \\"views\\" dimension appears to capture the neurotic, narcissistic, pessimistic, and distrustful aspects of Machiavellianism, while the \\"tactics\\" component captures the more unconscientious, self-serving, and deceitful behavioral aspects. = Hot and cold empathy = There are two distinct types of empathy which people use to relate to each other which are referred to as hot and cold empathy. Cold empathy refers to the understanding of how others might react to one's actions or a certain event. Hot empathy refers to the emotional reaction others might have to an event. People high in machiavellianism tend to have a better understanding of cold empathy than hot empathy which can lead to the perception of them as cold and uncaring. This way of acting is referred to as a cold to hot empathy gap where someone with cold empathy does not realize the full effect of their actions on others. = Alexithymia = Alexithymia is considered a key trait associated with Machiavellianism. It is the lack of awareness of emotion, including one's own emotion and the emotion of others. Those with alexithymia, alexithymics, are unable to recognize emotion nor describe them. This can lead to problems figuring out one's own feelings as well as relating and connecting to how others feel. Alexithymia can manifest in various degrees, depending on the individual and their environment. It may be product of a limited understanding of an emotion after a shallow experience of said emotion. Alexithymia is suspected to be the reason why machiavellians focus so much mental energy towards manipulating people and situations. They do not recognize the feeling of guilt and empathy so there is little to no consequence. =In the workplace= Machiavellianism is also studied by organizational psychologists, especially those whom study manipulative behaviors in workplace settings. Workplace behaviors associated with this concept include flattery, deceit, coercion, and abusive supervision.In pursuit of power: The role of authoritarian leadership in the relationship between supervisors‚Äô Machiavellianism and subordinates' perceptions of supervisory behavior See also *Amorality *Confidence game *Crowd manipulation *Cynicism *Dark Triad Dirty Dozen *Deception *Egoism *Ends justify the means *Moral nihilism *Social dominance orientation *Strategy References External links Meet the Machiavellians article in Psychology Today Category:Dark triad Category:Personality Category:Psychological manipulation Category:Machiavellianism ","title":"Machiavellianism (psychology)"},{"id":"61851735","text":"Ajlan B√ºy√ºkbur√ß (13 November 1970 ‚Äì 22 July 1999) was a Turkish singer.

He is an Associate Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa. He is best known for his work that helped establish the evolution of evolvability and modularity in the genotype-phenotype map as areas of investigation in evolutionary biology, for moving theoretical concepts between the fields of evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, and for his mathematical unification and generalization of modifier gene models for the evolution of biological information transmission, putting under a single mathematical framework the evolution of mutation rates, recombination rates, sexual reproduction rates, and dispersal rates. Altenberg is an Associate Editor of the journal BioSystems, and serves on the Editorial Boards of the journals Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines and Artificial Life, and on the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Task Force on Artificial Life and Complex Adaptive Systems. Education Altenberg received his B.A. in Genetics in 1980 at the University of California, Berkeley with an honors thesis advised by Glenys Thomson on the theory of frequency-dependent selection. He received his Ph.D. in Biological Sciences in 1985 at Stanford University with advisor Marcus W. Feldman with a dissertation that unified models of modifier gene evolution. Career Altenberg held postdoctoral fellowships at Stanford University, North Carolina State University, and Duke University. While a postdoctoral fellow at Duke University, Altenberg offered the first course on evolutionary computation to be given there. When his father became ill with cryoglobulinemia, he moved with him to Hawaii for the warm temperatures. In 2002 Altenberg was appointed Associate Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawai\`i at MƒÅnoa. He again offered the first courses in evolutionary computation to be given there. In 2013 Altenberg was a Long-Term Visitor at the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at The Ohio State University and in 2014-2016 was a Senior Fellow at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research. The University of Hawai ªi Board of Regents approved his promotion to Full Professor in 2020. Research Altenberg's research focuses on uncovering the mathematical relationships within the dynamics of biological evolution, and evolutionary algorithms. He is particularly interested in higher order phenomena such as the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of genetic information transmission, and the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map. His chief accomplishments have been (1) to unify the theory for the evolution of genetic systems (recombination and mutation rates) by embedding them in the space of inclusive inheritance, which includes spatial as well as cultural information, and (2) to develop the concept of the variational properties of organisms as phenomena subject to evolutionary dynamics. This includes the discovery of mechanisms that lead to the evolution of evolvability, and modularity in the genotype-phenotype map. The mathematical inclusiveness of his theoretical work has made it applicable to problems in evolutionary computation. His work on the evolution of biological information transmission has required development of new spectral theorems for linear operators, including a unification of reaction-diffusion theory predicting the evolution of slow dispersal with the Reduction Principle predictions for models of mutation, recombination and migration rate evolution. He has applied spectral theory to understand the evolution of mutational robustness. Altenberg introduced a number of concepts which have been adopted in several fields: * introduction of the Price equation into evolutionary computation theory * mechanisms for the evolution of evolvability and modularity * the conceptual distinction of generative and variational properties of the genotype-phenotype map * brood selection in evolutionary algorithms * generalization of Stuart Kauffman's NK Landscapes, applied to technological evolution * generalization of the Reduction Principle to infinite dimensional spaces, which unified reaction-diffusion models for the evolution of dispersal, and has been applied to epidemic models.

Having narrowly avoided amputation of her left foot she traversed consecutively Mount Everest and Lhotse in May 2019.  Early life  Revol was born in the Dr√¥me area, France and her parents introduced her to mountaineering in the Ecrins massif. She began climbing at age of 19 and became a physical education teacher. Career and expeditions In 2007 Revol went on her first expedition to Nepal. In 2008, she made a solo ascent of the three Himalayan mountains Broad Peak ‚Äì Gasherbrum I ‚Äì Gasherbrum II ‚Äì within a 16-day period and without the aid of oxygen; her climbing partner Antoine Girard had fallen ill. In 2009, she attempted the Annapurna with Martin Minarik, but retreated in a storm on Roc Noir (7,485 m); her climbing partner died. In 2012, she participated in the Adventure Racing World Championships in France, which includes navigation, trekking, mountain biking, paddling and climbing. Revol joined Daniele Nardi in the winter of 2013, and Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz in the winter of 2015 to climb Nanga Parbat, known as the \\"Killer Mountain\\", in Pakistan; in 2015 Mackiewicz and Revol reached 7800m, and turned back because of bad weather. In January 2018, they succeeded to climb the Nanga Parbat in winter as the second team ever. Revol became the first woman to have climbed Nanga Parbat in winter. On 23 May 2019, she reached the summit of Mount Everest using oxygen from 8500m onward and climbed the adjacent Lhotse the following day..  Rescue  On 25 January 2018, during her fourth attempt of a winter ascent of Nanga Parbat, and Mackiewicz's seventh attempt, they reached the summit from the Diamer side. Revol noticed Mackiewicz's bad condition and started taking him down. According to Revol, he could not walk, see or communicate and was bleeding profusely from his mouth and nose; he had developed severe frostbite and snow blindness. She secured him from the wind in a crevasse, called for help and started the long descent. Another Polish team which attempted the nearby summit of K2 was called for rescue. On 27 January 2018 the rescue team, including Denis Urubko and Adam Bielecki, were dropped off by a helicopter of the Pakistani military at on the mountain, and climbed 1,200m through the night rescuing Revol at . Mackiewicz, who was believed to be in his tent at around , could not be rescued due to bad weather and a snowstorm. She weighed just 45 kg when the rescue team managed to evacuate her, and suffered from severe frostbite to her hands and left foot. Revol was later carried to Islamabad for treatment, but was able to avoid any amputations. Personal life Revol's partner is Jean-Christophe.

The station broadcast between 1984 and 1998. History On November 3, 1981, J.P. Robillard and his Ladybug Broadcasting Company, owners of KLUV (1580 AM), were granted a construction permit to build a sister FM station in Haynesville. The station signed on the air as KLVU-FM in 1984, after the stations engaged in a call letter swap with Dallas radio station KLVU, which became KLUV-FM. The station offered an easy listening format when it launched that September. In 1990, KLVU-AM-FM was sold for $200,000 to the Hawkins Broadcasting Company, headed by Ray Hawkins. Hawkins owned WWHN-AM-FM in the Chicago area, and the proceeds from the operation of WWHN subsidized the acquisition of the stations in Shreveport. Hawkins returned the FM station to air as urban contemporary KWHN- FM in 1991, giving KMJJ-FM its first competition in the format, though the station was a rimshot with a poor signal in Shreveport proper. The station had its FCC license deleted in 1998 for failure to renew.

The boats are based on AC50 boats and technology used in the America's Cup. The boats are the fastest racing class in history, with speeds exceeding 50 knots. Three boats from the 2017 America's Cup were converted to comply with a new one-design rule called F50, which was based on AC50 hulls and components to create the new SailGP fleet racing circuit. Core Builders Composites in Warkworth, NZ built more boats from scratch to create a fleet of four boats crewed by teams from the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and France‚Äîand two more boats for China and Japan. The boats use a two-element wingsail and jib for propulsion. Two removable sections in the wing can be used to achieve mast heights of , and to suit wind conditions. In SailGP races, the mast height and jib are selected in competitions by the race committee. Apart from the wingsheet, which is controlled by two grinders, all trimming is hydraulic powered by electric motors and batteries. This includes active pitch control of all appendages, daggerboard lifting/lowering, and the jibsheet. This reduces the crew to five. The beam of the boat is larger than the AC50 boats to to increase righting moment. The boats have a crew of five‚Äîa helmsman, wing trimmer, flight controller and two grinders. A dedicated crew member relieves the helmsman of flight controls so the helmsman can focus on tactics. This is similar to Team New Zealand's unique crew arrangement in the 2017 America's Cup. While racing, crew stay in the windward hull. The boats comprise a one-design development class. However, unlike most one-design sail classes, which have fixed rules, F50 boats are constantly developed with changes being implemented on all boats simultaneously. This prevents technological arms races, while allowing performance improvements.

Background Tadhg Barry was born in 1880 to a working-class family in Cork, Ireland. He was schooled at the Blarney Street National School and later the North Monastery. After school, Barry worked for four years at Our Lady's Asylum until 1909, when his interest in journalism led to him becoming a staff writer at the newly founded Cork Accent. Between 1910 and 1916 he worked at the Cork Free Press, a paper which competed with the Redmond aligned (Home Rule advocating) Cork Examiner. Barry had a keen interest in the Gaelic Athletic Association and often reported upon the sports of Hurling and Camogie under the pen name \\"An Ciotog\\" (meaning \\"The left- hander\\" or \\"The Clumsy one\\"). He was also a delegate to both county and national GAA boards, a referee, and he trained the first camogie team in Cork. In 1916 Barry wrote the first book on the subject of hurling, entitled ‚ÄòHurling and how to play it‚Äô. Entry into politics In the 1900s Barry began to be drawn into the world of politics. In 1906 he became a founding member and secretary of the Cork Branch of Sinn F√©in as well becoming a leading member of the Cork Branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. In 1911, alongside fellow prominent Nationalists in Cork Tomas MacCurtain and Sean O‚ÄôHegarty, he had become part of Fianna √âireann, a Boy Scout organisation with an Irish Nationalist political outlook. Taking his Fianna experience forward, In 1913 he helped found the Cork Corps of the Irish Volunteers, an armed Irish Nationalist organised primary founded to fight the Ulster Volunteers should they have attempted to resist Home Rule in Ireland. In 1914 when the Volunteers split into two factions, Barry aligned with rump Volunteers who vowed not to fight for the British Empire during World War I but instead remain in Ireland. Tadgh shared a platform with James Connolly in Cork on two separate occasions and was on active service during the 1916 Easter Rising, when Irish Nationalists rose up in rebellion in Dublin. In 1917 Barry was selected as a Cork delegate to the historic October Sinn F√©in convention in the Mansion House, a meeting which attempted to unify all elements of the now surging Nationalist movement into one force which would advocate (and fight) for an independent Irish Republic free of control from the British Empire. That same year Barry was arrested by British authorities on the ground he had delivered a \\"seditious speech\\" and was imprisoned for a time until he was freed following a hunger strike. Barry was once again arrested in 1918, charged with being a conspirator in the so-called German Plot, which British authorities alleged was a plan by members of Sinn F√©in to collude with the German Empire to bring firearms to Ireland. Upon his release in 1919, he became the full-time Branch Secretary to the ITGWU in Cork and was involved with the Irish soviets, a series of strikes by rural Irish workers mainly across Munster. In 1920 Barry was elected to the position of Alderman in Cork, placing him in a position of power alongside the now Lord Mayor Tomas MacCurtain and newly elected MP Terence MacSwiney. 1920 was a tumultuous year all around in Cork. The Irish War of Independence had erupted and Munster was a particular hotbed of activity. On March 20, 1920 Tom√°s Mac Curtain, whom had become an officer in the newly formed Irish Republican Army, was killed in front of his wife and children in an assassination by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, the British controlled police force in Ireland. This incident caused widespread unrest in Cork. Terence MacSwiney succeeded Mac Curtain as Lord Mayor of Cork, only to die in October following a hunger striker protesting his own arrest. MacSwiney's death was a matter not just of national but also of international news, particularly in the United States of America. Not much longer after MacSwiney's death, Cork was devastated by the Burning of Cork in December, when members of the Black and Tans torched the city in act of arson born out of anger from loses to the IRA. Amongst the many buildings damaged or destroyed in the fire was ITGWU's Connolly Memorial Hall, the headquarters of the Labour Movement in Cork. Imprisonment and death In the wake of MacSwiney's death, Cork's municipal bodies once again gathered to elect a new Lord Mayor. Barry and eight other councillors were arrested. Barry was transported to Ballykinlar internment camp in County Down, where he was placed with 2000 other arrested Irish Nationalists including Se√°n Lemass. Barry attempted to keep busy while incarcerated. He taught Irish to his fellow prisoners as well as preaching Socialism. He kept a Red flag flown over his quarters, much to his jailers' chagrin. On 15 November 1921 Barry was conversing with fellow inmates at the edge of the camp and bidding them farewell. What exactly followed is unknown, but the result is not: Barry was shot dead by a young sentry guard, Private A. Barrett, who later claimed Barry had been making an attempt to escape the camp. An eyewitness account of Barry's death was provided by another inmate, Se√°n D. MacLochlainn, who by his own account was standing next to Barry when he was shot. According to MacLochlainn's account Barry was standing in a line of inmates waving farewell to those leaving when they were asked to move back, when the group refused Barry was shot dead. The statement also describes the shooting of two other prisoners named as Tormey and Sloane. Barry's death was one of the last during the Irish War of Independence, which at that point was coming to a ceasefire. A coroner's inquest into his death was inconclusive, and a trial held on his death resulted in a jury unable to agree on a verdict. The British authorities failed to produce either the sentry or his superiors for cross-examination. A secret report on Barry's death, created by the army's 6th Division for the inquest, recalled him memorably as ‚Äòa mischievous socialist, Bolshevist, or Sinn F√©iner, as the occasion demanded‚Äô, and as an ‚Äòutter disloyalist‚Äô. Barry's subsequent funeral drew an enormous 30,000 in attendance, chief amongst them Cork's own Michael Collins, who had left the on-going Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations in order to attend.

Done in oil on canvas, My Bunkie depicts a martial scene in which the US cavalry battle an unseen Native American enemy in the American West. Schreyvogel's work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  Schreyvogel's work depicts a scene in which a group of US cavalrymen fight against a force of Native Americans, who are left unseen. One of the cavalrymen has been dismounted in the skirmish, prompting his comrade to rescue him by pulling him onto his own mount. The scene is based on an account told to Schreyvogel by a cavalry trooper the artist met while in Colorado. Following its 1899 presentation in New York, Schreyvogel's painting won the Thomas Clarke prize. As noted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's description of the painting, My Bunkie is comparable to Wounded Bunkie, a work by Frederic Remington. The Met describes My Bunkie as portraying \\"a combination of firsthand experience and masculine escapist fantasy\\" typical of Schreyvogel's style.

However, only days later, he returned to his previous club after failing to adapt to the new country, and joined M√°laga CF in February 2017. On 28 January 2018, Anto√±√≠n was loaned to Tercera Divisi√≥n side CD El Palo, until June. He made his senior debut just hours later, starting in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Loja CD.

Trejo Benavides served in the Mexican Army from 1991 to 1999, and was a member of the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the army's special forces. He joined the Gulf Cartel under kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n after leaving the army, becoming one of the first members of its newly-formed paramilitary wing, Los Zetas. Like Trejo Benavides, most of the first members of Los Zetas were ex-military. Los Zetas was responsible for providing security services to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and carrying out executions on the cartel's behalf. In 2002, Trejo Benavides was mortally wounded in a shootout with rival gangsters in Monterrey. His comrades took his body to a hotel in Matamoros, where they abandoned it after arranging the corpse and the room to simulate a suicide. His death triggered disagreements between Los Zetas leader Arturo Guzm√°n Decena and Gulf Cartel boss C√°rdenas Guill√©n. The Mexican government remained unaware that Trejo Benavides had died, and continued to issue charges against him along with other Zetas leaders. By 2009, a high-ranking Zetas member confessed to authorities that Trejo Benavides had been dead for several years. Early life and career Ra√∫l Alberto Trejo Benavides was born in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. He joined the Mexican Army on 3 May 1991, later becoming a member of the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the army's special forces. While with the GAFE, Trejo Benavides worked closely with the Federal Judicial Police (PJF), in their anti-narcotics unit. During his service, Trejo Benavides reportedly received military and counter-drug training in the United States. Rather than retaining military reserve status or deserting without notice, Trejo Benavides requested voluntary removal from active duty and left the Mexican Armed Forces on 16 March 1999. He then joined the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. He became a member of the cartel's newly-created paramilitary group, known as Los Zetas, which was largely composed of ex-commandos. He was hired by cartel boss Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, and was given the nickname \\"El Alvin\\". In Los Zetas, Trejo Benavides also used the code names \\"Z-6\\" and/or \\"Z9-HK24\\". When Trejo Benavides joined Los Zetas, the group's purpose was to provide security services to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and carry out executions on the cartel's behalf. Trejo Benavides was one of the founding members of Los Zetas who was reportedly part of the Grupo de los 14 (English: Group of 14), who were the first fourteen Zetas members. He was one of the most adept gunmen in the group. Over the years, Los Zetas underwent organizational changes and became increasingly involved in other criminal activities alongside the Gulf Cartel, including drug trafficking.  Injury and death  On 13 May 2002, Trejo Benavides and nearly twenty other members of Los Zetas mounted an operation in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n to kidnap Dionisio Rom√°n Garc√≠a S√°nchez (\\"El Chacho\\"), a former state police officer and the head of a Nuevo Laredo- based smuggling group known as Los Chachos. The commando was headed by V√≠ctor Manuel V√°zquez Mireles. They were acting on intelligence information provided by the police chief Arturo Pedroza Aguirre, who tipped off Garc√≠a S√°nchez's location to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and Los Zetas. During the attack, rival gangster Juvenal S√°nchez Torres (\\"El Juve\\") was killed, and Los Zetas successfully abducted Garc√≠a S√°nchez from his home along with three of his alleged henchmen. Garc√≠a S√°nchez was found dead later that day in R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas. Trejo Benavides was injured by Garc√≠a S√°nchez's associates, and died from gunshot wounds after failing to receive medical attention. His comrades transported his corpse from Monterrey to Matamoros, where they abandoned it in a hotel room. After learning that Trejo Benavides had died, his boss, Guzm√°n Decena, threatened C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Reportedly, Guzm√°n Decena did not support the idea of having Garc√≠a S√°nchez killed, and told C√°rdenas Guill√©n, \\"Either you fix this problem of [Garc√≠a S√°nchez] and [Trejo Benavides] or we will turn you in to the Army\\". C√°rdenas Guill√©n took the threat seriously, reportedly commissioning his lawyer, Galo Gaspar P√©rez Canales, to help him use the press to present Trejo Benavides' death as suicide. Several journalists helped the Gulf Cartel to fabricate the story. C√°rdenas Guill√©n also received the support of the Tamaulipas State Police chief stationed in Matamoros, Pl√°cido de Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez Gutierr√©z. = Investigation and reactions = Trejo Benavides' body was found at 3:00 p.m. when a hotel staff member entered the room for housekeeping after checkout time. His corpse was laid out on the bed, fully dressed, and holding a gun in his hand to indicate that he had committed suicide. Another hotel staff member stated that he did not know the name(s) of the individual(s) who had taken the room, that they had arrived by taxi, and that they did not look suspicious. Local authorities found two identity documents on the body: a Tamaulipas university ID and a state driver's license, both in the name of Ram√≥n Esparza Torres. El Bravo newspaper in Matamoros reported that the man was a professor, who had killed himself for sentimental reasons. The article was published in the police section, and the story circulated widely in Matamoros. The body was sent to a local funeral parlor, where a wake was held. Several organized crime members were in attendance. Los Zetas helped arrange transfer of the corpse to Tabasco, his home state. Guzm√°n Decena's death threats angered C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who reportedly spoke to Los Zetas members Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano and Omar Lorm√©ndez Pital√∫a about plans to eliminate him. In November 2002, after learning that Guzm√°n Decena was at his girlfriend's home in Matamoros, C√°rdenas Guill√©n reportedly called on the Mexican Army to arrest him. Guzm√°n Decena confronted the soldiers upon their arrival, and was killed by gunfire. After Guzm√°n Decena's death, C√°rdenas Guill√©n granted greater freedom and concessions to Los Zetas. He allowed several members to join his inner security circle, and granted others permission to coordinate marijuana and cocaine operations in Nuevo Laredo and Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas, two corridors previously under the Gulf Cartel's control. Trejo Benavides' position in Los Zetas was taken over by Mellado Cruz, who was also a former GAFE.  Bounty and charges  The Mexican government was unaware of Trejo Benavides' death for several years, and continued to issue charges against him. On 18 June 2003, Mexico's Attorney General's Office (PGR) placed an unspecified bounty on 31 members of Los Zetas, including Trejo Benavides. Authorities stated that Trejo Benavides was \\"highly dangerous\\", given his military background and his suspected role in homicides, drug trafficking, kidnappings, and carjackings. This announcement was made after the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO) identified him as a high-ranking member of Los Zetas following the 14 March arrest of C√°rdenas Guill√©n. On 25 November 2006, regional Mexican singer Valent√≠n Elizalde was killed after playing at a concert in Reynosa. According to investigators, he was killed for playing a narcocorrido called \\"A Mis Enemigos\\" (\\"To My Enemies\\"), whose lyrics made indirect antagonistic references to the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. Investigators suspected that Trejo Benavides was part of the commando that shot Elizalde, and he accordingly became a suspect in the murder investigation along with his colleague Hern√°ndez Barr√≥n. By 2009, Mexican authorities learned that Trejo Benavides was dead when former Zetas member Mateo D√≠az L√≥pez (\\"Comandante Mateo\\") confessed that fact to investigators after viewing the mug shots of wanted Zetas members.

The range lies in the watershed of the Wami River and its tributaries. The Nguru Mountains lie to the south, across an expanse of hilly country. The Maasai Steppe lies to the north and west. Climate The Nguru mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, which provide most of the rainfall in the mountains. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and eastern slopes, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler and rainfall is higher at higher elevations.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Geology The Nguu Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Flora and fauna About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as \\"islands\\" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Nguu and other Eastern Arc mountains have extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species).Newmark, W. D., 2002, Conserving Biodiversity in East African Forests, a Study of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Ecological Studies 155. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 197 The Nguu mountains mark the northernmost extent of the Eastern miombo woodlands. Drier Northern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets lie to the north and west. The mountains support enclaves of forest, mostly between 1000 and 1550 meters elevation. The forests vary in species composition with elevation and the direction of the slope.N. D. Burgess et al.

Lamon, the U.S. Marshall for the District of Columbia and a friend of President Lincoln. It was begun at Williamsport, Maryland, in June 1861, and continued through the end of that year. It was originally intended to be composed of Unionist Virginians, but mostly contained men from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Initial organization right Ward Hill Lamon had been born in Frederick County, Virginia, and at the start of the war he believed that there were enough Unionist Virginians in the counties along the Maryland border that he could raise a regiment of volunteers. He wrote to Lincoln about his project on May 27, 1861, and Lincoln gave his approval. Lamon began his regiment in Williamsport, Maryland, opposite the Virginia border. While there were some refugee Virginians already in Maryland, recruitment proved difficult.Current, Richard Nelson, Lincoln's Loyalists, Union Soldiers from the Confederacy, Northeastern Univ. Press, Boston, 1992, pgs. 11-12 On June 12 the New York Times reported Virginia and Maryland borders along the Potomac River showing Williamsport, Md., and Martinsburg, Va. The Baltimore Daily Exchange, an anti-administration newspaper, reported On July 22- Berkeley County is recorded as having contributed one company to Lamon's regiment of Virginia Volunteers, Co. B. Berkeley County raised six other companies during the war, five for the Confederacy and one other for the Union. Aler, F. Vernon, et. al., Aler's History of Martinsburg and Berkeley County, West Virginia, Mail Publ. Co., Hagerstown, Md., 1888, pg. 224 Under the terms of military service companies of less than 85 men could not be officially mustered and equipped by the government and Lamon was faced with the prospect of equipping the men from his own funds, but a personal exception was made for him and Lincoln cautioned Lamon on June 25 Recruitment did not meet Lamon's expectations and he began to look further west to meet his goal to reach a brigade-size force. 39th Illinois, \\"Yates' Phalanx\\" In September Lamon travelled west through Pennsylvania to Illinois and Missouri. In Pennsylvania he attached two independent companies of Pennsylvania artillery to his brigade, Cos. C and F. Company C, known as \\"Thompson's Battery\\", had been mostly recruited in Pittsburgh and added 23 Marylanders when they arrived at Williamsport.Independent Battery C, History of the Battery by Captain James Thompson Company F, known as \\"Hampton's Battery\\", was recruited in Pittsburgh. The four cavalry companies attached to Lamon's Virginia regiment, which were later incorporated into the 1st Maryland Cavalry, were recruited in Pennsylvania.Robert H. Patterson's Cavalry, Hancock, Md., Harper's Weekly 1862. Patterson's company was organized in Pittsburgh on April 5, 1861 and attached to Lamon's brigade. He met with the Illinois governor Richard Yates and asked to be allowed to raise recruits in Illinois for his brigade, informing the governor that he had already recruited some men in Chicago. Gov. Yates told him that he could not recruit in Illinois for regiments outside the state, but he offered to let Lamon have the 39th Illinois Infantry, nicknamed \\"Yates' Phalanx\\", since it had already been credited to the state. Lamon was reluctant, stating that he wanted to recruit them himself but he later accepted the regiment for the brigade. In the meantime Brig. Gen. Fremont had ordered the 39th to St. Louis. An exchange of letters between Gov. Yates and Fremont resulted in Fremont ordering the 39th Illinois to be sent by train from St. Louis to Williamsport, Md. The resulting expense of transporting the regiment drew a congressional inquiry and criticism of Lamon, as the cost was estimated to be about $30,000. Lamon was further criticized for reportedly representing himself as a brigadier general and wearing the uniform as such. Gov. Yates replied to Lamon's request for his recollection of their meeting, to which Yates replied Congressional testimony of railroad employees stated that Lamon was presented to them as a brigadier general and was wearing the uniform. He was supplied with free transportation to St. Louis, where he arrived on October 25, and from there to Springfield, Il. with his own railroad car. The committee suggested that Lamon should reimburse the government for the costs of transportation, but the matter was not pursued.Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives, Made During the Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress 1861-'62 Reassignment of the brigade Ward Lamon returned to his duties as U.S. Marshall for the District of Columbia in November. The units of his brigade were placed under the command of Col. S.H. Leonard, whose brigade came to include the 39th Illinois, 13th Massachusetts, 12th Indiana and...\\"a section of artillery with ten Parrott guns; three companies of cavalry; and six companies of the 1st Virginia volunteers, originally attempted to be recruited for Lamon. In all there are 3,524 men in the command...\\"Chicago Daily Times, Dec. 12, 1861 Lamon wanted his brigade to remain intact, but on January 15, 1862, the U.S. Adjutant General advised the governor of Maryland that Lamon's companies needed to be consolidated with the incomplete Maryland regiments.The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series III, Vol. I, pg. 799 The artillery companies recruited in Pennsylvania were eventually reassigned to Pennsylvania after spending some months as part of the 1st Maryland Brigade.A Short History of Independent Battery C The four cavalry companies of the 1st Virginia Volunteers were organized within the 1st Maryland Cavalry, the four infantry companies were organized within the 3rd Maryland Infantry.List of Synonyms of Organizations in the Volunteer Service of the United States During the Years 1861, '62, '63, '64, and '65, Compiled under the direction of Brigadier General Richard C. Drum, Government Printing Office, Washington, 1885, pg. 164 There is no further record of any Virginia companies organized for Lamon's brigade.

It is just south of Fermont, and is the source of the Carheil River, which runs south to the Aux P√©kans River. The lake has been polluted with phosphorus from wastewater effluent from Fermont, causing algal bloom. This is cause for concern since the lake is among the headwaters for the wild and unspoiled Moisie River. Location Carheil Lake is south of Fermont and of Quebec Route 389. It is in the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality near the western boundary of Labrador. The lake is in the Grenville Province in the southeast of the Canadian Shield plateau, composed of Precambrian rocks, on average above sea level. Carheil Lake's elongated shape and orientation indicate a glacial origin. The lake has a maximum depth of in its center and average depth of . Name The lake's name was made official on 5 December 1968. The Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec does not have information about its origin. The commission states that the canton of Carheil, far to the west, is named after the Jesuit missionary √âtienne de Carheil (1633-1726). Possibly there is a connection. Drainage basin Carheil Lake is at the head of the Moisie River drainage basin, and drains an area of . It is in an area of rounded hills and flat areas with peat bogs, wetlands and many lakes and small streams. The valleys show the influence of glacial action and contain undifferentiated glacial till and fluvioglacial deposits of sand and gravel. Lac Daviault is to the north of the lake, lying to the east and south of the town of Fermont, and draining via Lac Sans Nom into Carheil Lake. Lac de la Rue feeds through Lac Cladonie and Lac Low Ball into the northwest of the lake. Lac Jonquet is to the east of the lake. Lac Moir√© to the northeast also drains into the lake, as do other small lakes such as Lac Tupper, Lac Perchard and Lac en Croissant. The Carheil River leaves Carheil Lake from the southeast. The river is a tributary of the Aux P√©kans River, in turn a tributary of the Moisie River. It is estimated that the outflow from the lake is about . Environment The average annual temperature in the region is . The warmest month is July, when the average temperature is , and the coldest is January, with . There are scattered areas of permafrost. A measurement of lake temperature in late July 2011 gave near the surface, falling to at the lowest levels. A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the Carheil Lake rising to the south of Fermont just west of the Spruce/lichen domain of the boreal zone. It is in the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. The Carheil watershed is characterized by coniferous trees that are tolerant of prolonged contact with water. Even in the undergrowth, shrubs and herbaceous species are all tolerant of extreme moisture conditions, such as willow shrubs, heathers, bog-myrtle and grey alder. Black spruce stands replace the fir-white birch found at lower latitudes. Several broad leaved and coniferous tree species coexist with black spruce, such as yellow birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, balsam fir and tamarack. The undergrowth is mainly carpets of moss and ericaceous species. As of 2015 the lake's shoreline appeared to be in excellent natural condition. Human presence The surroundings of the lake include cottages and forest shelters. An existing road leads south from Fermont to the lake. A report issued in 2016 on improving Quebec Route 389 between Fire Lake and Fermont proposed as one option to leave the present Route 389 between km 507 and 566, branch northeast and cross the Pekans River and La Rue Lake, then run along the existing road along Carheil Lake and up to the present Route 389. Construction of the road would involve deforestation at the crossing of the P√©kans River and De La Rue Lake, and along the northwest shore of Carheil Lake. In September 2012 two men drowned in the lake when their canoe overturned. Neither was wearing a life jacket. A new quad (all-terrain vehicle) trail was built in 2015 from Fermont to the lake by the Club VTT du Grand Nord. In 2017 Metals Australia announced initial exploration results at their Lac Rainy Est graphite project, important in providing an input to lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The press release noted that a high grade deposit at Carheil Lake, less than from the Lac Rainy project area, had yielded samples of 35.49% Cg and 40.67% Cg. The Carheil Lake deposit is on the west shore of the south part of the lake. The graphite was found in a structural lineament that runs roughly north-south for about . A report by the same company in May 2019 stated that they had drilled 17 holes along the formation for a length of about and confirmed eastern and western extensions of the Carheil Graphitic Zone. Pollution The lake is classified a Lake of Concern by Quebec's Minist√®re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques. In April 2011 it was reported that water management experts in Sept-√éles were concerned about cyanobacteria, or blue- green algae, that had been found in Carheil Lake. The cause of excessive phosphorus in the lake was discharge from the Fermont treatment plant over a period of forty years. The plant had recently been modernized, reducing the phosphorus released by 80% to 90%. The lake is a tributary to the large wild river, the Moisie River. There was a lack of funding for a $150,000 study of the impact on the Moisie River. The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) told the OBV Duplessis to evaluate the situation of Carheil Lake, resulting in publication of a study in November 2011. The report noted that Lakes Daviault and Sans-Nom had also been affected with cyanobacterial efflorescence every year since 2005, and the Fermont treatment plant was the only known source of phosphorus. Until 2010 wastewater from Fermont was treated only by removal of solids. In 2010 a treatment system was installed with the purpose of removing phosphorus from the effluent, which in theory would reduce the phosphorus concentration from . Although less phosphorus is being added to the lakes, phosphorus tends to accumulate rather than flow away, so the lakes could continue to experience cyanobacterial efflorescence from existing phosphorus. The researchers found that little was known about flow rates, renewal times, levels of oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen, stratification, phytoplankton and fish populations in Carheil Lake or the other lakes. Almost the only information available was on the water quality in 1996 at the mouth of the Moisie River, downstream. To fill the gap, OBV Duplessis was conducting an ecosystem study of the three lakes. The 2011 report covered hydrodynamic and physicochemical aspects, and a second report on biological aspects was planned for 2012 subject to funding availability. Phosphorus concentration was in July and in October. By comparison, Lake Perchard, to the north of Fermont, supplies the town with drinking water. It had a phosphorus concentration in October of . A more complete report was issued in April 2015 giving information about the biota.

Its remains were discovered during diamond mining operations in 2006 on the coast near Oranjemund in Namibia. A geologist working for the De Beers diamond company discovered a copper ingot. An unusual trident-shaped mark on this aged metal was later identified as the hallmark of Anton Fugger, one of Renaissance Europe's wealthiest merchants. The ingots were used in trading for spices in the Indies in the first half of the 16th century. The shipwreck is the oldest and most valuable ever discovered on the coast of sub-Saharan Africa. The discovery was unusual in that all of the ship's contents were able to be recovered and cataloged without interference from scavengers due to the highly secure nature of De Beers mining operations. The cargo included 44,000 copper ingots which are credited with weighing the ship down and creating a deterrence to decaying insects and organisms; all of which helped to preserve the remains of the Bom Jesus. The identification of the ship is approximate due to the Portuguese archives being completely destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Rare Portuguese coins were discovered in the wreck which were only minted from 1525 and 1538, helping to date and identify the vessel. Work is underway to preserve and display the remains of the ship and all of its cargo in a public museum.

Members of the RPA agree to follow a standard code of research ethics and conduct and must be formally approved for membership by a panel of elected colleagues. Similar to organizations elsewhere, such as the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists or Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologists, the Register is a mechanism for enforcing archaeological standards, particularly among the large numbers working in cultural resources management. To be accepted into the RPA, applicants must hold a graduate degree in anthropological archaeology (or related discipline) from an accredited institution and have completed a thesis focused on an archaeological topic. Once approved, members who pay their annual dues are granted the title of Registered Professional Archaeologist (RPA), the initials of which are typically placed as post-nominal letters after their surname (e.g., Jane Doe, MA, RPA). This certifies that they meet the accepted training and experience to lead archaeological projects on their own (and are current with their annual membership). At the start of 2019, the RPA's directory contained 3012 RPAs worldwide, with 2811 located in the United States. Aside from maintaining the Code of Conduct (below), the RPA also maintains a list of certified archaeological field schools, a database of archaeological ethics (e.g., codes adopted by other archaeological organizations), and adjudicates on member misconduct (a process called the \\"grievance procedure\\"). As discussed below, the grievance procedure is a mechanism for holding archaeologists accountable for their conduct in the field (triggered by complaint only). History The history of archaeology in the US is rooted in the part-time enthusiasm of, usually wealthy, Antiquarians who formed the field's initial foundation. By the start of the Great Depression, the field was mostly practiced by a small group of elite academics with varying levels of research standards. Following large numbers of archaeologists trained and employed by the WPA and the subsequent swelling of many academic disciplines by GI Bill servicemen after WWII, the need for standards of conduct was increasing. By the 1960s, the New Archaeology was revolutionizing American archaeology to more statistically and scientifically-oriented methods, which carried over to the burgeoning sector of federally-mandated archaeological impact assessments, particularly after NHPA 1966 and subsidiary legislation. Since archaeology is controlled destruction, where the context of the materials is largely destroyed in the process, the rising number of those practicing archaeology increased the need for a professional certification process. In 1976, the Society of Professional Archaeologists (SOPA) was founded as a means of vetting and enforcing the accepted standards of archaeological research. These standards set the practical and ethical expectations for archaeological research (e.g., for scientifically-based field methods, prompt reporting, the treatment and curation of artifacts, and aversion to monetary valuation of artifacts). In 1998, SOPA was reorganized and renamed the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA), per a joint task-force en-paneled by the Society for American Archaeology, the Society for Historical Archaeology, and the American Institute of Archaeology. The change in name was intended to emphasize the organization's refocus towards professional members (rather than amateurs or students) and to de-emphasize conference and publication services already offered by sponsoring organizations. A representative of the RPA sits on the Board of these and other sponsoring organizations. Standards of Research and Code of Conduct The Register maintains the primary standards of research and conduct for archaeologists working in North America. As mentioned above, these standards set the practical and ethical considerations for behavior and research in office as well as in field and laboratory settings. The current (as of 2019) Code of Conduct lays out responsibilities of RPAs towards the public, the archaeological community, and employers/clients. RPAs responsibility to the public includes making results accessible upon completion, maintaining sensitivity towards affected tribes and groups, refraining from uninformed opinions in a professional capacity, refraining from fraud or illegal activities (including commercial sale or excavation of antiquities), and complying with national and international conventions such as UNESCO 1970. Additional responsibilities towards the archaeological community include properly crediting work by others, staying informed of recent developments in the field, refraining from maligning the reputation of colleagues, and providing a working environment free of any harassment (be it verbal, sexual, discriminatory, etc) and intervening when witnessing such behavior. With clients and employers, it is also critical to protect confidential information and refrain from any violation of RPA's ethical codes or standards. The current (as of 2019) Standards of Research lays out the baseline definition of legitimate archaeological research. Sections of the Standards include 1) adequate preparation (via background research, planning, staffing, and complying with local and national permissions), 2) methodological integrity, 3) survey and excavation procedures, 4) record keeping, 5) storage of written and material results, and 6) dissemination of results (e.g., within 10 years of field research). While not extensive, it is expected that qualified RPAs are aware of the relevant background literature for each of the points raised in both the Code and the Standards.

According to the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, clinical pharmacists specializing in infectious diseases are trained in the use of microbiology and pharmacology to develop, implement, and monitor drug regimens that incorporate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials for patients. According to SIDP, the organization was founded in 1990 and its 1500+ members are involved in patient care, research, teaching, pharmaceutical industry, and government. Its stated mission is to \\"Advance infectious diseases pharmacy and lead antimicrobial stewardship in order to optimize the care of patients.\\"  Advocacy for antimicrobial resistance  The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified antimicrobial resistance as one of the biggest public health threats of our time. SIDP has identified promoting the appropriate use of antimicrobials and decreasing resistance as priorities for the organization. In 2003, SIDP warned of an \\"exponential increase in resistance\\" by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Bob Groves, \\"Still searching for Kryptonite: Superbugs' march prompts expansion of a testing and database program\\", The Record (June 30, 2003), p. F-1. In 2009, the SIDP supported a study which identified antibiotics which appeared less likely to lead to antibiotic resistance.Alex Paul, \\"Hospital cuts MRSA infection\\", Albany Democrat-Herald (December 25, 2009), p. 3. = Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) = In January 2019, the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) convened to respond to the charge of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, to gather public input on combating antimicrobial resistance. SIDP president Kerry LaPlante presented public comments stating the need to prioritize accelerating research and development of new antimicrobials through innovative funding mechanisms, protecting the supply of existing drugs, and to develop strategies to mitigate anti-infective shortages. LaPlante said, \\"Together, we scramble to concoct mixtures of antibiotics, using in vitro data, hoping to override resistance and hoping for synergy to save our dying patients. Many of these patients have already endured and overcome months of chemotherapy, only to find themselves kicked down and fighting for their lives ‚Äì again.\\" = U.S. Government Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Challenge = The U.S. Government Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Challenge is a global initiative, launched in 2018, that charges pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, food animal producers and purchasers, medical professionals, government health officials, and other industry leaders from around the world to work together to address antibiotic resistance. The AMR Challenge is a way for organizations to make formal commitments to further the progress against antimicrobial resistance. SIDP has submitted a commitment to the AMR Challenge to promote appropriate antimicrobial use. As part of this commitment, in 2019, SIDP collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists to develop educational materials on how pharmacists can improve antimicrobial use. Healthcare providers can submit a formal commitment to adopt these practices. According to Secretary Azar, nearly 350 national and international organizations have committed to the AMR Challenge, including Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Academy of Emergency Medicine, American Cancer Society, Pew Charitable Trusts, and the U.S. Department of Defense = Legislative support = On June 4, 2019, the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms (DISARM) Act S. 1712 was introduced by United States Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Bob Casey (D-PA). The DISARM Act would promote antibiotic research and development and preserve existing antibiotics by improving Medicare reimbursement for antibiotics and promoting their appropriate use. SIDP joined other medical organizations such as Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and American Society for Microbiology in signing a letter of support for the DISARM Act. Similarly, SIDP and other infectious diseases organizations have signed a letter of support for the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act (STAAR) which is aimed at strengthening existing federal infrastructure for surveillance, data collection, and research efforts.  Publications and activities  Other activities SIDP engages in include clinical guidance, position statements, and education. SIDP has endorsed guidance for necessary skills for antimicrobial stewardship leaders, the essential role of pharmacists in antimicrobial stewardship, and the optimal use of polymyxins. In addition, SIDP has published position statements promoting the appropriate use of antimicrobials in various settings such as agricultural applications and ambulatory care settings. SIDP holds an annual meeting that precedes IDWeek, providing live educational sessions by specialists in infectious diseases, as well as original research abstracts. On October 3, 2019, IDSA announced that SIDP will become the fifth partner in IDWeek, joining IDSA, the HIV Medicine Association, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The partnership will begin with IDWeek 2020. SIDP also funds education grants for initiatives that provide public education, or support novel training mechanisms for healthcare professionals.

Fulton Boulevard in the East Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. It was built in 1927 as a larger home for the school of the same name, which was founded in 1911. Named for Lucy Flower, the school was the only all-female public high school in Chicago. Intended to parallel all-male schools such as Lane Tech and Crane Tech, Flower Tech combined vocational training and home economics in its curriculum. John C. Christensen, the Chicago Board of Education's chief architect, designed the school in the Collegiate Gothic style; inspired by English schools such as the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, the style was a popular choice for schools at the time. As the school accepted students from all parts of Chicago rather than a single neighborhood, it was one of the few schools to provide an integrated education in the heavily segregated city. The school still suffered from racial discrimination, however, as black girls could not specialize in beauty courses and the school had only white faculty. In addition, black students often viewed the home economics portion of the school's curriculum as preparation for domestic service work, leading to resentment between black students who sought vocational training and white students who specialized in home economics to become homemakers. Racial discrimination contributed to the decline of the school in the 1960s, as white flight and shifts in school funding left schools like Flower Tech that served black students underfunded. The school also changed its name and admission standards in the 1960s, resulting in a perceived decline in its prestige, and the opening of another nearby vocational school hurt its enrollment. The school became coeducational in 1978 and closed in 2004. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 2017.

Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. This book is one of the Five Megillot, a collection of short books, together with Book of Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther, within the Ketuvim, the third and the last part of the Hebrew Bible. Jewish tradition views Solomon as the author of this book, and this attribution influences the acceptance of this book as a canonical text, although this is at present largely disputed. This chapter contains a female song about her search for her lover at night and the poem describing King Solomon's procession. Text The original text is written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 11 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls: 4Q106 (4QCanta; 30 BCE-30 CE; extant verses 3-5, 7-11), 4Q107 (4QCantb; 30 BCE-30 CE; extant verses 1‚Äì2, 5, 9-11), and 4Q108 (4QCantc; 30 BCE-30 CE; extant verses 7-8).Dead sea scrolls - Song of Songs. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). Structure New King James Version (NKJV) groups this chapter into: * = A Troubled Night * = The Coming of Solomon Female: Search and seizure (3:1-5) The first part of this chapter is a tightly constructed song by the female protagonist describing how she looks for her lover at night (or in a dream) in the city streets, until she finds him and brings him into her mother's house. The setting of this poem progresses from the woman's bed (verse 1) to the public areas of the city (verses 2-4b) and finally to the privacy of her mother's bedroom (verses 4c-5). It closes with the second appeal to the 'daughters of Jerusalem'. =Verse 1= :On my bed by night I sought him ::whom my soul loves; ::I sought him, but found him not. MEV *\\"By night\\" (, ba-Hebrew Text Analysis: Song of Solomon 3:1. Biblehub): that is, \\"nightly\\" or \\"night after night\\". =Verse 5= :I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, :By the gazelles or by the does of the field, :Do not stir up nor awaken love :Until it pleases. NKJV *Cross references: Song of Songs 2:7; 8:4 *\\"Charge\\" or \\"adjure\\"Note [a] on Song 3:5 in NKJV The names of God are apparently substituted with similar sounding phrases depicting 'female gazelles' (, ') for [God of] hosts ( '), and 'does of the field'/'wild does/female deer' (, ha-) for God Almighty (, ). Male: Marriage scene (3:6-11) This section starts a poetic exposition of love and marriage which form the core of the book (Song 3:6-5:1). Hess applies these six verses to the man, whereas Fox prefers the daughter of Jerusalem as the speakers,Fox, Song, p. 119, apud Hess 2005, p.116 and the New King James Version assigns them to \\"the Shulamite\\" (= the woman). NKJV Solomon is the focus of this section, as his name is mentioned three times (verses 7, 9 and 11), and the suffix 'his' (-o) refers to him once in verse 7, another in verse 9 and four times in the second part of verse 11. The last word of this part is 'his heart' (libbo), referring directly to the essential aspect of King Solomon and the most relevant to the whole love poem. The mention of Solomon's mother in verse 11 is in line with the focus on mothers in the book, both the woman's (1:6; ; ; ) and the man's (8:5).

LHDC allows high-resolution audio streaming over Bluetooth. it is a high-quality Bluetooth codec based on the A2DP Bluetooth protocol and allows a bit-rate of up to 900 kbps compared to SBC‚Äôs bit rate of 345 kbps. LHDC is an alternative to Bluetooth SIG's SBC and LC3 codecs. Its main competitors are Qualcomm's aptX-HD/aptX Adaptive and Sony's LDAC codec. Starting from Android 10, enumeration constant symbols for LHDC and LLAC are part of the Android Open Source Project, enabling every OEM to integrate this standard into their own Android devices freely. Older versions of Android require LHDC/LLAC enumeration constant symbols to be implemented by the smartphone manufacturers or Android app. Android apps that support LHDC include Savitech's Hi-Res BT Player, FiiO Music, HIFIMAN Music and DA&T; Audio.  LHDC  LHDC supports bitrates of 400/560/900 kbit/s, bit-depth of up to 24 bit and sample rate of up to 96 kHz. The first Smartphone to support LHDC was the Huawei Mate 10.

Tuesdee won her first Thoroughbred race in March 1969 riding the second mount of her career. Most notable about her chosen profession at the time were the obstacles female jockeys had to overcome to be able to ride, none of which involved their ability to stay astride a powerful racehorse in a field dominated by competitive male jockeys. Male bias was one of the biggest obstacles for female jockeys. Males dominated positions of authority in the sport of racing, and many saw women as being weak and incapable of riding a powerful race horse; many expressed concern over the safety of other jockeys during a race. Male jockeys rejected their female counterparts and expressed their opposition by boycotting races. There were also occasions when spectators voiced their disapproval of female jockeys during the post parade. The women did not relent, and chose instead to work with people who believed in them and helped them find ways to achieve their goals. Early beginnings Born Helen Shipton from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Tuesdee was the name given to her by her grandmother. Tuesdee grew up next door to horse trainerEverett W. King, described by journalist Jim Murray (1969) as a \\"crusty old party\\". Tuesdee worked as an exercise rider for King but had her sights set on becoming a jockey. She barrel raced throughout her childhood. The late 1960s was a time in US history when the doors were closed to female jockeys. The Jockeys‚Äô Guild issued a statement expressing their concerns and reasons for their opposition to females competing against male jockeys. Nick Jemas, the Guild's national managing director at the time and a former jockey himself, said in reference to the \\"cool judgment and skill of a fellow jockey\\" during a race, ‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs emotional makeup might betray her at a time like that. It could also imperil the lives of the other jockeys, not to mention her own.‚Äù If a female jockey entered a race, the male jockeys would stage a boycott. Spectators also expressed their disapproval for female jockeys by booing and yelling insults as they rode onto the track during the rose parade. Women found various ways to overcome the obstacles that prevented them from receiving a jockey's license. They worked hard, and sought support by networking with people who could help them on their difficult journey to acceptance. Some even sued or threatened to sue for discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Attitudes changed as more females received their jockey's license and rode to the winner‚Äôs circle, proving their ability to be formidable competitors. On March 2, 1969 \\"The crowd gave Mrs. Testa a tremendous ovation when she came back to the winner's circle\\" after winning the third race at Santa Anita Park riding \\"Buz On\\", paying $9.20 to win, $6.00 to place and $3.80 to show. The year 2019 marks 50 years since the doors first opened to allow female jockeys to compete against male jockeys on major racetracks in the US. Female jockeys comprise only eight percent of the Jockeys' Guild membership. =Dark Mirage= At age 25, Tuesdee was the regular exercise rider for Dark Mirage (1965), a small, dark brown Thoroughbred filly referred to as \\"pint-sized\\" and affectionately known as an \\"equine prankster\\" which earned her the nickname \\"Tiny Tigress\\". Tuesdee also fed, walked and groomed the filly, and became quite attached to her. As a 3-year-old, Dark Mirage began the season with a defeat at Aqueduct, finishing fourth behind the winning horse ridden by Ron Turcotte; however, that defeat led to a remarkable turn-around and nine consecutive wins, including eight stakes races. Dark Mirage was the 1968 Champion Three-year-old Filly. She set track records, winning the Acorn Stakes by 6 lengths, Mother Goose by 10 lengths and Coaching Club American Oaks by 12 lengths, which comprised the 3 legs of the American Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing, formerly known as the Filly Triple Crown or New York Filly Triple Tiara that was originally hosted at Belmont Park (1957-2002 and 2007-2009). Her clocked time in the Acorn matched that of the Belmont track record at the time. Her finish in the CC American Oaks was the fastest ever clocked for that track. Steve Cady with the New York Times stated, ‚Äú‚Ä¶When she reached the finish, ears cocked and neck bowed, she was galloping along with no more apparent effort than a saddle horse out for leisurely bridle-path canter.‚Äù As a four-year-old, Dark Mirage ran the Santa Maria Handicap marking her 10th win. Her next race was the 1969 Santa Margarita Invitational Handicap. Bion Abbott of the Los Angeles Times described trainer Everett King's position going into that race as leading with \\"a couple of queens in his hand\\", referring to Dark Mirage, and Tuesdee Testa, who he described as \\"5 foot 2, eyes of blue, 35-23-36, a trim 112 pounds and the first feminine jockey in Santa Anita history.‚ÄùHe wrote that Tuesdee's jockey career at that moment was less important than what she had accomplished preparing Dark Mirage for that day's mile and one-eighth race. Unfortunately, it was the last race for Dark Mirage. She dislocated the sesamoid bone in her right front ankle and was retired with career earnings of $362,788. The surgeries to repair her injury were unsuccessful and in 1969, when she was no longer able to stand, she was euthanized. Dark Mirage was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974.

Joe Kernan defeated Republican Carl Baxmeyer. This is the closest that a Republican has come to the mayorality of South Bend since the last Republican victory in 1967. Background Incumbent mayor Roger Parent opted not to seek a third term as mayor. Rumors arose that internal polling had shown that, with controversy around the construction of Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium, Parent would not have been able to win a third term. Several allies of Parent on the Common Council with involvement in the stadium construction would ultimately lose their reelection bids in the May primaries. Primaries Primaries were held in May. =Democratic primary= Joe Kernan prevailed over several candidates in the Democratic primary. Kernan had previously served as City Compttroller from 1980 to 1984. The primary was ultimately divisive. Kernan won with 51% of the vote. =Republican primary= Carl Baxmeyer, a city planner, won the Republican nomination, defeating opponent Mike Waite. Waite was businessman who had never held public office, and had been original opponent of the stadium. Waite had informally withdrawn from the race after his ex-wife was murdered. General election Arguably the most recent truly competitive general election in South Bend mayoral history, and arguably the only truly competitive South Bend mayoral election since 1967 (when a Republican, Lloyd M. Allen, was last elected), the election saw Kernan defeat Baxmeyer by a mere 2,000 vote margin. This has been attributed to the Democratic party having been left fractured after a bitter Democratic mayoral primary. Baxmeyer made a campaign issue out of city attorney Rich Hill, criticizing the city's decision to hire him, ‚Äúon a part-time basis at almost twice his former salary‚Äù. Incumbent mayor Roger Parent disputed Baxmeyer's criticisms, arguing that it made sense to hire Hill due to the fact that he was already caught up on important issues including the city's stadium efforts. =Results= References 1987 South Bend South Bend ","title":"1987 South Bend, Indiana mayoral election"},{"id":"61853042","text":"The prehensile green tree skink (Prasinohaema prehensicauda) is a species of skink.
