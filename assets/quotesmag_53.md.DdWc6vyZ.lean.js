Life Holmes was born Mary Anne Emmet on 10 October 1773 in Dublin. She was one of the four surviving children of Dr Robert Emmet, state physician of Ireland, and Elizabeth Emmet (n√©e Mason). As a young woman she was noted for her intelligence and was a classical scholar. Her father lauded her \\"good character\\" and was very hopeful she would make a good wife. Much like her brothers, Robert and Thomas Addis, who were both to join the Society of United Irishmen, she was interested in politics and was a member of liberal intellectual circles. She was a correspondent of Margaret King about their common passion for the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft. In 1793, a family friend William Drennan described her as genteel but distant. He predicted her match with the barrister Robert Holmes, who she secretly married on 21 September 1799 in the Dublin Unitarian Church. The couple had at least 4 children, with Drennan attending all the births. One of their children was Elizabeth Emmet Lenox-Conyngham. Robert Holmes attended to the Emmet family legal affairs for a time, with the couple living with her parents at Casino, near Milltown, Dublin. Holmes helped to raise the children of her brother Thomas Addis, after he was sent to Fort George, Highland, Scotland for his involvement with the United Irishmen. During this time, their mother's letters to Thomas Addis note Holmes' devotion to her husband but also her delicate health and tendency towards low spirits. Holmes was the only surviving child of their 17 children who was still in Ireland, she was a comfort to her parents in their old age. Her father died in 1802, and her mother almost died in 1803 at the same time as the arrest and execution of her brother Robert. Some claim that Holmes attempted to recover her brother's body but failed. After the failed insurrection of 1803, her husband was arrested but she was allowed to spend approximately a week with him. It had long been claimed that she collapsed and died on her doorstep following his release in February 1804. In truth, she had given birth to a son at home, following which her health worsened and her hearing also deteriorated. Her son, Hugh, also later died. She was attended to by Drennan, who worried that she was succumbing to tuberculosis that December. Holmes died on 10 March 1805, and was buried with her parents in the graveyard of St. Peter's Church, Aungier Street, Dublin. There is a legend that her brother Robert's body was interred with her in secret, but this is unconfirmed. A portrait of Holmes by Thomas Hickey is held by Kilmainham Gaol. Poetry and writing Holmes wrote prose and verse for the Press, a publication associated with the Society of United Irishmen. In 1799 she was active, along with members of her extended family, in the movement opposed to the legislative union of Ireland with the United Kingdom. The pamphlet An address to the people of Ireland was attributed to her, but is now thought to have been written by Roger O'Connor. Holmes' poems were included in her daughter's 1833 book of verse The dream and other poems.

It was designed by John Colley and built in 1875 by John and James Marks, D. L. Dymock and W. Stewart. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The church building was sold to private interests in 2009.  History  The first white settlers came to the Jamberoo District during the 1820s following the initial granting of land rights, but it was not until the 1830s that the nucleus of a settlement evolved. Dr. Robert Menzies, a young Scottish naval doctor, and his wife Margaret, took up residence at Jamberoo on 6 May 1839, in a small cottage on their recently purchased property. They, in common with a number of other colonists from Scotland and from Northern Ireland, were of the Presbyterian communion. The importance they attached to their faith is illustrated by the fact that within a few months of their arrival Presbyterian services of worship were being conducted in Dr. Menzies' barn by the Rev. John Tait, MA, the first minister of the Church of Scotland in Illawarra. Mr. Tait preached from his home base in Wollongong as far south as the Shoalhaven from 1837 until his transfer to Parramatta in 1841. Dr. Menzies built \\"Minnamurra House\\" in the early 1840s, which still stands today. The barn in which the first Presbyterian service was held stood until 1940. The township of Jamberoo was subdivided from Michael Hyam's grant in 1841. Mr. Hyam, a Jew, gave blocks to some of the Churches, including the Presbyterian. In 1842 a church-school was built by the Presbyterians on their land at a cost of $70. It was made of slabs and plastered inside being constructed in the main by voluntary labour. The building was used on Sundays as church and Sunday School; other denominations used it at times. On weekdays it served as a school. It appears to have been the first Church building in the southern Illawarra. The Rev. Cunningham Atchison, who succeeded Mr. Tait in 1841, continued to minister to the whole of Illawarra and conducted services at Jamberoo as often as possible. Ministers of other denominations were also invited to conduct worship, and Dr. Menzies conducted the church services on occasions when no minister was available in Jamberoo. The Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843 was followed by a Disruption in the Synod of Australia. The Jamberoo and Kiama Presbyterians gave their allegiance to the Free Church party and waited for their own minister from that Church. Until their minister arrived the congregation received strong leadership from Mr. Robert Taylor, a divinity student of the Free Church of Scotland. The Rev. George Mackie, having arrived from Scotland, was inducted on 24 October 1849, at Jamberoo as Free Church minister of Leawarra and Shoalhaven, with Kiama as its centre. As the population grew, portions to the north and south were separated until the charge embraced only the districts centred upon Kiama and Jamberoo. Mr. Mackie exercised a fruitful ministry in the area until his translation to Victoria in 1857. He had resided at Jamberoo to late 1854 when he moved into the newly built Manse at Kiama. The second Minister of Kiama-Jamberoo was the Rev. John Kinross, B.A., later D.D. Newly arrived from Scotland, he was ordained and inducted into the charge on 29 December 1858, and proved to be an outstanding pastor as well as a scholar. In 1861 he married Elizabeth, one of the four daughters of Dr. Menzies. John Kinross never severed his link with the area, for, even after his translation to the office of the first Principal of St. Andrew's College, University of Sydney, in 1875, he spent the long vacations in his cottage overlooking the Jamberoo township and its people whom he loved. He retired to and died in this cottage on 16 October 1908. Early in the ministry of Dr. Kinross, 1862, the old Jamberoo Church was enlarged. In 1874 the congregation met and resolved to build a new and larger church to accommodate the increasing number of worshippers. John Colley, a member of one of the district's foremost pioneering families and a devout servant of the Church, drew up the plans and together with Messrs. John Marks, James Marks, D. L. Dymock, and W. Stewart superintended the construction of the present St. Stephen's which was opened and dedicated in the presence of over 1,500 people on Australia Day, 26 January 1876. The total cost was ¬£1,060/19/1. The only debt remaining, that of ¬£70, was cleared at the opening by a generous gift by the Messrs. Marks. The Church furnishings are made from some of the finest cedar to be seen anywhere. The original church included a wooden bell tower on top of the existing stone tower; however, this was demolished in the 1940s. Following the opening of the new church the old one was repaired and incorporated in a Sunday School Hall. It was unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1972. On 5 May 1979 the Presbyterian Church of Australia nominated St Stephen's Presbyterian Church Jamberoo. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the Church on 6 April 1981. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The strength of the Presbyterian cause in Jamberoo diminished along with the population of the valley in the late twentieth century. In 1970 services of worship ceased altogether and the Church building took on a forlorn neglected appearance. It reopened in 1971 due to the efforts of the local congregation and was restored for its centenary in 1976. Funding was received from the Heritage Council in 1984 for damp-proofing and associated works. Services at the church continued until . After four years of only being used for the occasional wedding, it was listed for sale in 2005 due to mounting costs for ground maintenance and insurance. Local residents initially hoped to buy the building to serve as a dairy museum; however, they were unsuccessful in obtaining government funding. After some controversy around claims that there were unmarked graves on the site, subsequently dispelled after an archaeological study, it was subsequently sold to a private buyer for $580,000 in June 2009. The church stated that the proceeds would be used towards repairing the bell tower at Scots Presbyterian Church, Kiama. In 2018, the former church was operating as holiday accommodation called \\"The Belltower\\".  Description  Tower ;Church St. Stephen's Church has a simple rectangular plan with a square-based tower incorporating the entry to the building at its eastern end and a small attached vestry at the western end. It construction employed coursed sandstone rubble with dressed quoining and weathering to buttresses and the tower's battlemented parapet. Openings feature simple label-moulded semi-circular heads. Internally, finishes and furniture are of local cedar. The building's substantial trussed gable-ended roof with elegant barge decoration has undergone replacement of its original shingle cladding with Marseilles tiles. ;Site Cemetery beside the church St. Stephen's Cemetery lies behind the church and adjacent to the Anglican and Uniting Church Cemeteries. The site is mown bare except for a small patch of crocus bulbs in the centre. A large blackberry bush which has engulfed several monuments dominates the south-west section. The stone church and large Araucaria pine trees form an appropriate back drop, which includes a small besser block amentieis block. There is no evidence of early layout.National Trust, 1985 A cemetery on this site dates from 1859.AHMS, 6 A white weatherboard house, formerly the early church is at the rear of the stone church (from a 1903 photograph). This was still extant in 1963.AHMS, 13, 14 The area to the rear of the 1876 church contains a small toilet block, the remains of an early cemetery on the site and a tree line which is set out as an indicative eastern boundary to the burials. The evident cemetery monuments are restricted to the western side of the rear allotment with both marble and sandstone stelae represented. Historical evidence from the 1860 cemetery regulations suggests that they were purposefully set out from the south and along the western boundary from an early period. The tree line eastern \\"boundary\\" of these burials runs north to south approximately 10m east of the western allotment boundary which is represented by a post and rail fence. All visible monuments of the Presbyterian cemetery are contained within the area bounded by this tree line and the western fence. To the east of this tree line is an open grassed area with some faint undulations observable in the surface. The distance from the tree line to the east boundary of the allotment is approximately . Closer to the church is the area which anecdotal evidence suggests may contain unmarked children's graves. This area also shows evidence of substantial disturbance from sewer lines associated with the toilet block and septic tank.AHMS, 19 Situated at the western end of Jamberoo and enclosed by a timber picket fence to its Allowrie Street frontage and enclosed by a timber picket fence to its Allowrie Street frontage, St Stephen's and it grounds, which include mature camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) are a distinctive element of Jamberoo's townscape, prominent in the western approach to the town from Churchill Street.Heritage Council, Branch Manager's Report, 26 September 1980  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Constructed in 1875, St Stephen's Presbyterian Church Jamberoo is of significance for its reflection of the settlement, focal point and community development within the Jamberoo Valley area.

The film stars Vanessa Hudgens, Sam Palladio and Nick Sagar. The film's concept of two people running into one another who look identical and switch places comes from Mark Twain's 1881 novel The Prince and the Pauper. It was released on November 16, 2018 by Netflix. Plot Stacy DeNovo is a talented young baker who runs a successful pastry shop in Chicago with her best friend Kevin Richards. Kevin has a daughter named Olivia, a precocious young girl who enjoys ballet dancing. Stacy has recently broken up with her boyfriend Paul. A week before Christmas, Stacy discovers that Kevin has entered their business in a prestigious baking competition in the Kingdom of Belgravia. Their submission was accepted, but Stacy is reluctant to attend since Christmas is an uncomfortable reminder of her relationship with Paul. Later, Stacy runs into Paul with his new girlfriend. A kindly man on the street reminds her that Christmas wishes can come true. Stacy agrees to compete and leaves for Belgravia, along with Kevin and Olivia. Once arrived in Belgravia, the trio goes sightseeing and encounters a Christmas stocking seller who looks very similar to the kindly man Stacy met back in Chicago. The seller advises her to live life more spontaneously. After settling in at their cottage, Stacy and Kevin go to the television studio where the competition will be held. There, Stacy encounters her former culinary classmate and rival Brianna, the competition's defending champion. Brianna \\"accidentally\\" spills coffee on Stacy's apron, and Stacy leaves to get a new one. Then, Stacy meets Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro and fianc√©e of Crown Prince Edward of Belgravia, and the two are struck by their identical looks. Desperate for time out of the spotlight, Margaret suggests that the two twin strangers switch places for two days, then switch back in time for Stacy's competition and Margaret and Edward's wedding. Initially reluctant, Stacy agrees, especially when Lady Margaret offers to sponsor Olivia as a student in Belgravia's acclaimed summer ballet program. Stacy and Margaret quickly teach each other about their lives, behaviors, and quirks to minimize suspicion and part ways. Olivia immediately finds out about the switch but helps to keep Margaret and Stacy's secret while bonding with Margaret. Meanwhile, Prince Edward ‚Äì who was supposed to be away on business for the two days of the switch ‚Äì changes his plans and wants to spend time with his fianc√©e, sending Stacy into a panic. King George senses something is afoot, and tasks his butler, Frank, to observe her. Stacy adapts to court life and begins to fall in love with Prince Edward, while Margaret falls in love with Kevin and realizes that she loves living a normal life. Despite this, both reunite and switch back after two days. Meanwhile, Brianna sneaks into the TV station and cuts off the power cord to Stacy's mixer as sabotage. Frank the butler takes pictures to prove Margaret and Stacy swapped identities and presents them to the Queen. The Queen encounters the same kindly man, who thinks Stacy looks like a princess despite her common status, and the Queen has a change of heart. Now aware of the switch, the Queen fakes illness to dispatch Edward and Margaret to attend the baking competition in her place. Margaret comes clean to Edward about the switch and admits she does not love him. The two rush to the competition to resolve matters. At the baking competition, Stacy discovers Brianna's vandalism and has to mix her ingredients by hand. Despite the setback, Stacy and Kevin manage to complete their cake and win first prize, with medals presented by Lady Margaret and Prince Edward. Stacy tries to avoid the medal presentation, and Kevin ‚Äì unaware of the switch ‚Äì insists that she accepts. Margaret and Stacy reveal their plot to the two men. Margaret professes her love for Kevin, while Stacy walks away, feeling out of place in Edward's royal life. Edward stops Stacy and says he is in love with her. He proposes, suggesting a Christmas wedding in a year if they are still in love. One year later, Stacy marries Prince Edward and becomes Princess of Belgravia, and both couples (and Olivia) celebrate at the wedding. Margaret catches Stacy's bridal bouquet, while Kevin asks her what she's doing for New Year‚Äôs. When Margaret states that she has no plans, Kevin replies, ‚ÄúYou might want to hang onto that [bouquet],\\" insinuating he plans to marry her.

They are owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The Metropolitan Water Supply & Drainage Board initially used water from the Cordeaux River, the nearest of the Upper Nepean tributaries to supply the South Coast, Wollongong and its suburbs. A series of dams were constructed on the Cordeaux River, the principal dams being completed in 1903, 1915 and 1926 respectively. Because of the height of the ridge (O'Briens Gap) above the coastal area, pressure in the trunk main was too high to be directly connected to reticulation mains. The pressure was broken down by the construction of 5 service reservoirs at the highest points on the coastal plain. The initial supply scheme from the Cordeaux River to Wollongong was constructed by the NSW Department of Public Works in 1902-1903. It was transferred to the MWS&DB; in 1903. The second major stage of development occurred in 1909 with extension to Port Kembla and Unanderra. The third stage of expansion was completed in 1915 with water supplied to Figtree, Mount Kembla, Kembla Heights, Mount Keira, Keiraville and town to the north of Wollongong, namely Balgownie, Corrimal, Bellambi, Russell Vale, Woonoona, Bulli, Thirroul, Austinmer, Coledale, Scarborough and Clifton. The extensions of supply to Dapto in 1920 and to Mount Drummond (now Mangerton), Tarrawanna, Reidtown, Fern Hill and Fairy Meadow, all in 1922, were supplementary to the third stage of expansion. Since that date, expansion has occurred in all of the South Coast water supply, although Kiama and Jamberoo, and other southern areas were not connected to the Avon supply until after 1961. In the 1960s, supply was made available from Avon Dam, this dam being originally completed in 1928. Water is now supplied from Avon Dam, via filtration plant, to Mount Keira, Berkeley and Dapto, from whence all other reservoirs receive their supply. The Kiama Reservoirs were not incorporated into the South Coast or Illawarra Region water supply until after 1961.

The governor ordered him to return to Danville and recruit an infantry regiment. Edmonds recruited a regiment by June 12 and returned to Richmond by rail, and on July 1 the regiment was included in the Confederate Army as the 38th Virginia Infantry. Edmonds became the colonel of this regiment. The regiment was attached to the Army of the Shenandoah under the command of Joseph E.

The regiment was positioned on the extreme left flank of the brigade, and when the left-leaning division of Isaac R. Trimble began to retreat, the regiment was threatened with a blow to the flank. Colonel Edmonds decided to turn the regiment to protect the flank, but was at that moment killed by a bullet in the head. Command passed to Major Joseph Cabbell, as Lieutenant-Colonel Powhatan Whittle was already wounded in the shoulder and arm, who was unable to deploy the regiment and ordered him to retreat behind the Emmitsberg road.

Arcadia Publishing. Page 119. . Egbert Starr Newbury and his wife Frances put the tent few feet from their home, providing local ranchers and their families with a site to pick up and drop off mail. Prior to the establishment of the post office, Conejo Valley residents had to ride a horse to Ventura to reach the nearest post office. The post office has had a variety of locations in the valley. It was first located at the current site of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, and was relocated numerous times before ending up at the present site of The Oaks mall in 1891. William Knowlton moved it to the original site of the Stagecoach Inn on Ventu Park Road in 1908, but it was moved to a 10-by-12 foot building at 1200 Newbury Road in 1942. It was moved to 1602 Newbury Road in 1968, and relocated to 3401 Grande Vista Drive in 2013. Although the post office changed locations multiple times, its name remained the same, which is why the Newbury Park city address is still used today. History A mailbox in 1909. Egbert Starr Newbury moved with his wife and child from Santa Barbara to the Conejo Valley in 1874, where he built his home at the present day site of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. As there was no official place to send or receive mail, Newbury decided to apply to the federal government for a post office. On July 16, 1875, the post office opened in a tent outside Newbury's home, and Newbury became the first postmaster in the Conejo Valley. When the stage company, Coast Line Stage Company, abandoned their route through Conejo Valley in 1876, mail was only a few times per week by various people on government contract. Following the devastating drought of 1876-77, the Newbury family left the Conejo Valley, and the location of the post office changed many times. For ten years it was located in the eastern end of the Conejo Valley, in the homes of various ranchers, however still called the Newbury Park Post Office. The Timberville Post Office was established in today's Newbury Park in 1888, in order to serve the small community of Timberville, centered around the Grand Union Hotel and the Timber School.Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). Tales and Voices of the Conejo. Newbury Park, CA: Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 97. . As there were two post offices in the Conejo Valley in 1891, postmasters James Skelton of the east end and G. W. Hepner of the west end, petitioned to have both offices consolidated with a proposed location half-way between the two. An agreement was reached on June 21, 1893, and the chosen location for the combed post offices was on Richard Orville Hunt's Salto Ranch, near the present-day Lynn Road and Hillcrest Drive. The name \\"Newbury Park Post Office\\" was retained, and Mr. Hunt was the postmaster with his wife Mary Jane as his assistant. After 17 years on the Hunt Ranch near present-day The Oaks mall, it was moved in 1908 to a shop owned by William Knowlton located near Conejo Hotel on Newbury Road. It was operated by William and his sister Sarah until 1924, when it moved into a tiny 10-by-12 foot structure at 1200 Newbury Road, with one electric light and no running water.Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). Tales and Voices of the Conejo. Newbury Park, CA: Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 98. . For 29 years the post office remained at the same Newbury Road location, until 1953 when it was moved farther north up Newbury Road into larger quarters. A new post office building was erected at 1602 Newbury Road, where the office was dedicated on May 26, 1968.Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). Tales and Voices of the Conejo.

He was based in Baltimore, Maryland. Early life A native of Prussia, Henry Berger was in business with Anton Dressel in Hollfeld, Bavaria and then had his own business in Bamberg, Bavaria by 1843. Baltimore Organ Builder Berger immigrated in 1849 to Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States and established his own organ building firm. Setting up a shop on the second floor of #75 E Baltimore street, Baltimore, Maryland. The firm's first major contract was to rebuild and enlarge the organ for Trinity German Lutheran Church, then located in the old Trinity Episcopal building at Trinity and High streets, Fells Point, Baltimore. By 1850 he had built several organs, most of which were small one and two manual affairs with an interesting mix of mid 19th century German design integrated with the prevailing English standards. While Berger and his workforce may have possessed the skills to make metal pipes, the equipment, facilities, and time required to establish a metal making pipe shop were not feasible. It is more likely that he secured his metal pipes from Philadelphia. However, there was an abundance of pine lumber in the region, and many suppliers, and so Berger's workers would have been able to fabricate the wood pipes required. Berger was said to be a born showman, and local newspapers heaped much praise and press on his operations and instruments. During his seven short years in Baltimore, the Sun Paper alone featured Henry and his works about a thirty times. In 1851, one effusive Sun paper article, said that Berger had a workforce of 20, that his shop, now on Frederick Street, was 100 feet deep, four stories tall and had an erecting room of 25 feet tall. Life in Pennsylvania In 1855 Henry moved his family to Jefferson, York Country, Pennsylvania, a small village on the outskirts of York. Here he was postmaster. His brother, George, was left behind to continue the pipe organ business and to finish contracts in the works. A short time later George followed Henry to Pennsylvania. The family moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1859, where Henry became the organist at St. Mary's and once again set up an organ building shop. After an 1861 fire in the shop, Berger moved to Tiffin, Pennsylvania, where he became the organist of St. Mary's Catholic church. He built a new organ for this church. In 1862 Henry died, and a notice of eviction and sale of Berger's property was posted in a Tiffin city newspaper. Musical Impresario Berger and his wife, Anna, had six children (three girls and three boys). From a very early age the children showed musical prowess, so much so that Henry would tour them around the country and even signed them on as members of an extant touring bell choir. By the late 1850s and 60s the child prodigies were playing musical instruments and singing in the great music halls of the United States and England. Opus List Though the Berger opus list is large, only a few of his instruments survive. These include a handsome one manual instrument organ in the Episcopal church, Fork, Virginia (not \\"Little Fork\\"), which contains at least some pipes marked by a Berger voicer. The case of his magnum opus, a three manual organ, for St. Augustine Catholic Church, Philadelphia, exists, though it now houses a newer organ. In the Baltimore area, the one manual instrument in Old Salem Lutheran Church, Catonsville, Maryland, still survives. This list was compiled from various sources, primarily newspaper reports of the day. It is not complete and new attributions continue to surface. * Ascension Episcopal, Baltimore, Maryland (1852) * Carroll Chapel, Montgomery County, Maryland (1854) * Charles Street Methodist, Baltimore, Maryland (1853) * Doughoregan Manor, Ellicott City, Maryland (1854) * Fork Episcopal, Doswell, Virginia (1854) * Georgetown College, Washington DC (1851) * German Lutheran, Cumberland, Maryland * Holy Trinity Catholic Georgetown, Washington DC (1850) * Immaculate Conception Catholic, Baltimore, Maryland (1854) * Lutheran Church, Cumberland, Maryland (1851) * Sacred Heart of Mary, Adams County, Pennsylvania (1854) * Second English Lutheran, Baltimore, Maryland (1854) * Second Reformed, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1854) * Sherwood Episcopal, Cockeysville, Maryland (1854) * St. Augustine Catholic, Philadelphia (1852) * St. Charles Catholic, Pikesville, Maryland (1852) * St. James Episcopal, Monkton (1855) * St. Joseph Catholic, Baltimore, Maryland (1852) * St. Luke's Episcopal, Baltimore, Maryland, (1854) * St. Matthew's Catholic, Washington DC (1854) * St. Matthew's Lutheran, Baltimore, Maryland * St. Paul's Cathedral, Pittsburgh (1852) * St. Peter & St. Paul, Philadelphia Pennsylvania) * St. Peter's Catholic, Portsmouth VA (1852) * St. Peter's Episcopal, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1852) * St. Peter's pro-Cathedral, Richmond Virginia (1852) * St. Timothy Episcopal, Catonsville, Maryland (1850) * St. Vincent de Paul, Baltimore, Maryland, (1852) * Trinity Episcopal, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania (1852) * Trinity German Lutheran, Baltimore, Maryland (1849) * US Naval Academy Chapel, Annapolis, Maryland (1854) * Zion Lutheran, Baltimore, Maryland (1850) * Other Catholic Churches in: Trenton, New Jersey; Bedford, Pennsylvania (1851); Eldorado, Arkansas (1851); Gettysburg, Pennsylvania (1853); Blackstone, Massachusetts (1852); Cumberland, Maryland (1853); Harmon's Bottom (New Baltimore), Pennsylvania (1851); Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1854); Troy, New York (1852); Bel Air, Maryland (1851); Lynchburg, Virginia (1854); Millerstown (now Fairfield), Adams County, Pennsylvania (1854) and Thibodaux, Louisiana (1851). * Other churches in: San Francisco, California (1851); New Brighton, Pennsylvania (1852); Princess Anne, Maryland (1851); Prince George's County, Maryland (1854); Frederick, Maryland (1850); New York City (1851) and a private residence, Baltimore, Maryland (1851).

Early life Khalifa was born in 1948 in Jarabulus, Syria. He spent his childhood in Aleppo where he began to participate in political activities as a teenager. Consequently, he was sent to prison twice. Upon his release, Khalifa studied art and film direction in France, and was arrested at Damascus airport when he returned from Paris. From 1982-1994, Khalifa was held without trial at various state security prisons, including the infamous Tadmur Prison. The National Academy of Sciences reported that he was imprisoned for suspected involvement in the prohibited Party for Communist Action. Amnesty International considered Khalifa to be a prisoner of conscience. Works =Autobiographical novels= The Shell: Memoirs of a Hidden Observer Khalifa's book The Shell: Memoirs of a Hidden Observer () was in 2008 his first novel to be published. Joseph Sassoon has described the book as one of the \\"most powerful\\" Arabic memories on prison literature. Khalifa has stated that he considers his prison novel to be \\"a document and a testimony.\\" Arab publishers were initially wary of printing the autobiographical novel, in which the main character, like the author, is imprisoned for thirteen years during Hafez al- Assad‚Äôs regime. However, the Franco-Syrian editor Farouk Mardam-Bey stepped in, releasing the book with the French publisher Actes Sud, having been translated into French by St√©phanie Dujols, entitled La Coquille: Prisonnier politique en Syrie. A year later the Arabic publisher Dar al-Adab in Beirut published the book in its original Arabic. The book was then translated into English by Paul Starkey and published by Interlink Books. It has also been translated into several other languages, including Italian and Spanish. In 2019 it was published in German, too.Mustafa Khalifa: Das Schneckenhaus (German). Retrieved 4 July 2019. =Other works= What if Bashar Assad wins? In 2012 Souria Houria published a paper by Khalifa entitled What if Bashar Assad wins? where the author considers a \\"hypothetical victory\\" of the Syrian regime. Khalifa considers what the implications would be on a domestic level, as well as on regional and international level, if the Syrian regime won over its people. The impossible partition of Syria In 2013 the Arab Reform Initiative published Khalifa's research paper entitled The impossible partition of Syria. Gary C. Gambill has described Khalifa's study as \\"an excellent discussion of demographic barriers to partition\\". In the study, Khalifa argues that the partition of Syria along sectarian boundaries would lead to disaster because it would fail to restore peace and will also be a danger for the stability of neighboring countries. Khalifa maps the ethnic and sectarian composition of Syrian society, and also discusses Syria's economy, to try to determine when and how fragmentation might occur. He argues that these factors had led to the failure of partition in 1922, which would have given the Alawites control over a smaller state, therefore, the partition of Syria remains an \\"impossible\\" prospect.

The Australasian Photo-Review was an English language magazine, published for photographers by Baker & Rouse and later Kodak (Australasia), and published in Sydney, Australia 1894‚Äì1956.  History  The magazine was first published in 1894 as the Australian edition of the British Photographic Review of Reviews, after the photographic supply company Baker & Rouse purchased the Australasian publishing rights. At this early stage of its publication, the magazine was issued as a short ten to fifteen page supplement to the British edition. In 1895 the magazine's name was changed to Australalasian Photographic Review, and in 1903, the title was shortened to Australalasian Photo-Review. The first editor-in-chief of the magazine was Edwin J. Welch F.R.G.S., F.R.C.I., who declared in the first issue that Australian photographic works would be reviewed with 'bluntness, perhaps, but no namby pamby'. Walter Burke F.R.P.S. was Editor. In 1922 Walter's son Eric Keast Burke became associate editor and, in 1943 editor, a position he held until the Review ceased publication in 1956.Australian Dictionary of Biography.. Retrieved 6 June 2014.  Content  The Review is notable for promoting the work of Australian photographers or 'camerists', as they were referred to in early editions, and for its inclusion of high-grade photographic prints. At a time when the nation's history of photography was scant and under-appreciated, Keast Burke's series of historical articles included articles on pioneering Australian photographers John William Lindt and Charles Kerry and on his 1953 discovery, in a shed in Chatswood, New South Wales, B. O. Holtermann‚Äôs collection of wet-plate negatives; all gold-fields photographs by Charles Bayliss and Beaufoy Merlin to whom he devoted several issues of AP-R, and later published Gold and silver : an album of Hill End and Gulgong photographs from the Holtermann Collection in 1973. His father Walter had also been historically minded and both Keast‚Äôs son Quentin, and wife Iris, assisted in research and article writing for the AP-R. Jack Cato consulted extensively with Keast in writing his 1955 history The Story of the Camera in Australia. Having formally retired in 1960, from 1961 to 1969 Burke was the first editor and then art director of Australian Popular Photography (later named Australian Photography)  Digitisation  The magazine has been digitised by the National Library of Australia.

She was a member the People's Justice Party (PKR) and sat on the central executive committee of PKR. Personal life Latheefa Koya was born in Kerala, India and later moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at the age of 3 months. She is a human rights activist, politician and lawyer. After moving to Malaysia, Latheefa settled down and grew up at the city of Petaling Jaya. Education Latheefa graduated from the University of London with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) (LL.B. (Hons.)) in 1997. She later obtained the Malaysian Certificate in Legal Practice in August 1999, enabling her to practice as a lawyer in Malaysia. Career Latheefa was called to the Malaysian Bar in 2001. Since May 2002, she has practiced law in Messrs Daim & Gamany, co-founded by Abdul Daim Zainuddin, former Minister of Finance of Malaysia, as an advocate and solicitor. Between June 2008 and July 2012, Latheefa was a member of the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ), but quit from her post after rumours emerged regarding her expulsion from the council. She later co-founded Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) alongside former Padang Serai Member of Parliament (MP), N. Surendran, in 2011. She served as its advisor until 2018 before becoming its executive director. =People's Justice Party= She has served as information bureau chief for PKR's Youth Wing and the legal affairs bureau chief for PKR in the past. Latheefa revealed the purpose behind the move orchestrated to remove Khalid Ibrahim as Menteri Besar of Selangor in 2014 by one of PKR's vice presidents, Rafizi Ramli, was to prevent PKR deputy president, Mohamed Azmin Ali, from becoming the Menteri Besar of Selangor. The Kajang move, however, failed to achieve its true motives. In June 2018, Latheefa criticised the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government for encouraging a young child to donate to the Tabung Harapan Malaysia (THM) fund. A month later, she criticised the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and former PKR president, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for allegedly delaying prosecution against a man who wanted to marry an underage girl. In November 2018, Latheefa called PKR president Wan Azizah's visit to Julau ahead of Sarawak PKR polls as \\"inappropriate\\" due to the usage of government machinery and announcement of allocations in the presence of one of the candidates, Julau MP Larry Sng. She then called for the party to suspend the upcoming polls for Julau following a massive spike in the division membership from 603 to over 13,000 just a day later, alleging that party leaders are \\"whitewashing\\" the episode and legitimising fraud. On 17 December 2018, Latheefa launched a scathing attack on her new PKR president, Anwar Ibrahim, over his appointments of PKR state liaison chiefs, alleging \\"cronyism and nepotism\\" after many of the selections did not receive majority support from respective state division chiefs. Her comments drew rebukes from her own party members, criticising her for openly criticising the party president and submitted a disciplinary complaint against her to the party. Latheefa responded by saying that using \\"UMNO (United Malay National Organisation)-style tactics\\" to silence her will not succeed. Soon after her comments, Anwar's daughter and Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar resigned from all party posts whilst Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim rejected the offer to become the Johor PKR state liaision chief. =MACC Chief Commissioner= On 4 June 2019, Latheefa was appointed as Mohamad Shukri Abdull's successor as chief commissioner of the MACC on a two-year contract effective 1 June 2019. Fellow PKR member and Lembah Pantai MP, Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, called for her resignation from the party to avoid conflict of interests. This was followed by a response from Latheefa herself, who tweeted that she had already submitted her resignation as an ordinary PKR member on 3 June 2019, after being informed of her impending appointment. LFL also released a statement announcing that its co-founder has relinquished her position and membership within the organisation. She became the first woman to be appointed to the post. Her appointment drew mixed reactions from politicians and members of the public alike, receiving praise for being known for her no-nonsense approach but criticised by others as her appointment did not go through parliament and due to her political background. Among those who praised her appointment but questioned the process of doing so included former Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih) chairperson, Petaling Jaya MP Maria Chin Abdullah, and Centre to Combat Corruption and Cronyism (C4) executive director Cynthia Gabriel. Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) president Wee Ka Siong called her appointment \\"mind-boggling\\" whilst Muara Tuang assemblyman Idris Buang from the United Bumiputera Heritage Party (PBB) labelled the appointment \\"repugnant\\". Other society leaders including Marina Mahathir and former Malaysian Bar Council president, Ambiga Sreenevasan, hailed her appointment. On 25 June 2019, Latheefa was sworn-in as the Chief Commissioner of the MACC before the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia). In her first press conference since taking office, Latheefa announced that the MACC had filed civil forfeiture suits against 41 entities amounting to 270 million allegedly related to the 1MDB scandal. The largest sum amounting to 212 million was attributed to the aggregate sum received by the various state branches of the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO). Other notable alleged recipients of misappropriate funds included the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP), Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), United Sabah People's Party (PBRS) and former ministers Kasitah Gaddam, Hasan Malek and Ismail Abdul Muttalib. Controversies The Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on Major Public Appointments chairman, Selayang MP William Leong, has initially confirmed that PSC was not consulted over Latheefa's appointment. Prominent lawyer and former Federal Court of Malaysia judge, Gopal Sri Ram, remarked that the legislature \\"has no role to play\\" in Latheefa's appointment as chief commissioner of MACC. Somehow on 4 July 2019, Latheefa has finally met with the PSC on her MACC appointment which both responded positively after the meeting and the report on the PSC meeting would be tabled in the Parliament. Latheefa was questioned over her \\"many\\" awards and medals on her MACC's chief uniform despite serving in the post for less than a month by the UMNO supreme council member Lokman Noor Adam and criticisms of her uniform went viral on social media on 28 June 2019. She in admitting she was just beginning learning about uniforms, rank badges and ribbon bars; also claimed they were essentially correct and acceptable although there were some minor discrepancies in the ribbon bars which have been rectified. She explained that the MACC's uniform and its paraphernalia were mandated according to the Standing Order of the MACC chief commissioner, Chapter A (Policy) No 1 of 2012. She also stressed her priority to combat corruption take precedence over appearance of her uniform.

The flowering stem is slightly taller than the leaves, bearing a striped yellow-brown flower wide. The long sepals form a tubular flower that opens at the end. The reddish eyespots of the small petals are located within the tube. These eyespots attract male bees to perform pseudocopulation with the orchid's blossom. The petals are ovoid and taper at the tip, and are similar in hue to the sepals. The lip and column are hidden within the tube.

He believes that he has been placed on the US kill list. He claims to have survived five drone assassination attempts by the US military, which killed random civilians that were present nearby, including two attacks on vehicles he was traveling in, including one where the car he was sitting in was blown up by a missile shot from a drone. He has been criticized by some observers for a perceived alignment with jihadi fighters in Syria, with The New York Times reporting that Kareem was considered a \\"jihadist propagandist\\" to some. RT criticized his reported \\"praise\\" of Malhama Tactical, a 'private military contractor' which trains militant groups. Early life and career Abdul Kareem, born Darrell Lamont Phelps, grew up in Mount Vernon, New York; he attended Mount Vernon High School, then studied creative writing at Purchase College SUNY, before going on to work in stand-up comedy. He converted to Islam, partly due to its \\"emphasis on clean living\\", travelled to Egypt to study Arabic, where he later obtained a presenting role with Saudi- funded television channel, Huda TV. After leaving Huda TV, due to \\"disagreements\\", he travelled to Rwanda and Libya to film documentaries, before arriving in Syria in 2012 where he was first hosted by Ahrar al-Sham. After initially working with Western mainstream news outlets, such as Sky News and the BBC, he helped found \\"On The Ground News\\". Publishing on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, its official website claims it is \\"committed to delivering accurate English language news to a Western audience regarding the Syrian crisis\\". He's married with five children. On 13 August 2020, it was reported that Abdul Kareem had been arrested by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in Atme, northern Idlib. Court case, initial refusal to dismiss In 2017, he filed a lawsuit against the United States government in the District of Columbia, claiming they had attempted to assassinate him, and requesting his removal from the Disposition Matrix, usually referred to as the \\"kill list\\". Another journalist, Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan, who is suspected of also being placed on the American kill list, co- sued with him. In June 2018, government lawyers asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit claiming Bilal could not provide proof he was being targeted as he could not substantiate his claims given the secrecy surrounding targeting decisions and that the government had complete authority in military operations outside of the United States. US District Judge Rosemary Collyer rejected the government request to dismiss the lawsuit and in the opinion paper wrote: ‚ÄúDue process is not merely an old and dusty procedural obligation. . . . It is a living, breathing concept that protects US persons from overreaching government action even, perhaps, on an occasion of war.‚Äù The judge also ruled that Bilal cannot challenge the laws that allows the US government to put someone on the \\"kill list\\" or target those on it, but as an American citizen he has the right to due process before being added and to know whether his speech as a reporter is protected by the first amendment or not, as the reason Bilal claims he is on the list is because of his speech. The judge also distinguished the case from previous killings of US citizens such as the drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, stating that Bilal is not challenging the \\"kill list\\" program or military operations but is challenging the process that places a citizen on the list without notice or a challenge. The judge also dismissed Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan from the lawsuit as his claims that he is a target were speculative. Ahmad is not a US citizen. Subsequent near misses In May 2019, he survived being shelled by a Syrian Army tank in Idlib but was wounded by shrapnel. He was with Sky News reporters during the attack. In July 2019, Bilal and his crew survived nearby shelling by a jet's autocannon on the Hama frontline. Dismissal of court case The government filed a subsequent motion to dismiss arguing that the case could not go forward because the relief sought by Kareem (information about whether he was on the kill list, presentation of the evidence that was used to put him there, a description of the process that was used to put him there, and removal from the list) along with any evidence that might be used in the case were all protected by the state secrets privilege. The court sided with the government and dismissed the case, leaving Kareem without any recourse: \\"Without access to the privileged information, Mr. Kareem is unable to establish whether he has targeted by the lethal force or what information was considered in reaching the alleged decision to target him. Mr. Kareem is \\"incapable of demonstrating that [he has] sustained a violation of\\" his constitutional rights without the information ... He 'has alleged, but ultimately cannot show, a concrete injury amounting to either a specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm. in this instance, in which the relevant information is solely in the control of the United States and is protected by the state secrets privilege, Mr. Kareem is left with no method to obtain it to pursue his case, which must therefore be dismissed. Arrest by Hay‚Äôat Tahrir al-Sham In August 2020, Bilal and British aid worker Tauqir Sharif were arrested by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and as of October 2020, their whereabouts and charges are unknown. Residents of Idlib, including family members of Sharif and associates of Bilal, have protested the arrests by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, citing the lack of any official charges and lack of any visits or information being afforded to family and friends.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Kaleetan Peak is situated four miles northwest of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. It's immediately west of Melakwa Pass and Chair Peak, and north of Melakwa Lake. Precipitation runoff on the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. The nearest higher peak is Snoqualmie Mountain, to the east. The mountain's name \\"Kaleetan\\" derives from Chinook Jargon which means \\"arrow\\".Chinook Jargon Dictionary Climate Kaleetan Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. Kaleetan Peak with Mount Roosevelt (left) The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

It was designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet. and built by W. R. Vaughan. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  =Background= The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of New South Wales. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW. In 1863 the Postmaster General W. H. Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in NSW in 1858. The NSW colonial government constructed two lines from the General Post Office, Sydney, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in NSW compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the Post Office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country NSW from the late 1880s onwards. Again the Post Office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the 1890s Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department. This was the creation of Telecom and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop-front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. =Kiama Post Office= The earliest record of a postal service to Kiama is a reference to a letter from the Colonial Secretary dated 10 May 1840 referring to an Alexander Wilson's letter proposing a post office for Kiama. Prior to this, mail was bought via steamer from Sydney, as circumstances permitted, or overland to Wollongong once a week from 1832. The Colonial Secretary informed Mr Wilson that the Post Master General, James Raymond, would bring forward a proposal for Kiama in the arrangements of 1841. Kiama's first post office opened on 1 January 1841, 13 years after the first offices outside of Sydney had been established, making it one of the oldest post services in the state. The first postmaster was George Hindmarsh, who held the position until 1844. The mail contract between Campbelltown and Wollongong was held by Ben Rixon who delivered to Wollongong once per week. By 1848 the Campbelltown to Wollongong service ran daily via Appin and Dapto, with an extension between Dapto, Kiama and Shoalhaven twice a week. By 1856 a steamer delivered the mail three times per week to Kiama. The telegraph line was extended to Kiama in 1862, with the Telegraph Office opening in a rented premises separate to the Post Office. The Station Master was William Camper whose yearly salary was ¬£150, over four times the salary of the Postmaster Thomas Fuller. At the time it was deemed that the telegraph master's job required greater technical skill, and so deserved a higher salary to reflect this. In 1868 Kiama Post Office was embroiled in a dispute between Postmaster Fuller and the local residents. In April 1868, the PMG received a letter from a Selina C. Cooper of Hartwell House, Kiama, complaining about Fuller and an apparent delay in the delivery of letters to residents. The letter expressed a general dissatisfaction with Fuller from the people of Kiama and called for an inquiry into his running of the post office. An investigation by the Superintendent of the Mail Branch found no evidence of the claims against Fuller and the matter was thought to be over. In May 1868 a second letter of complaint was received regarding Fuller, this time from a local doctor, Doctor Nolan. Another complaint was then received from a Mr Budd, of the Free Trade Stores, which in turn referred to further complaints from within the town. Following these letters, the Secretary at the GPO instructed Inspector Moyse to visit Kiama and report on the growing controversy. Moyse arrived in Kiama on 5 May 1868 and began to first interview those who had complained, then Postmaster Fuller. Moyse filed a report on his return to Goulburn in which he stated that it appeared that \\"Mr Fuller is much too independent in his manners for the position he holds, does not treat the inhabitants generally with the courtesy which is due from an official to the public, his office joins his brother's store (and) it is thought that Mr Fuller the storekeeper is at times in possession of information not participated in by other storekeepers\\". Moyse recommended that the post office be transferred to the telegraph office under the direction of the Telegraph master John Tyter and his wife Agnes. In 1867 the telegraph office had come under the ministerial control of the PMG, but amalgamation of the two offices did not commence until 1870. Following Moyse's report, the PMG moved the post office to the telegraph office with Agnes Tyter appointed as postmistress from 1 July 1868. In 1870 Agnes Tyter resigned as postmistress due to poor health and was replaced by her husband John, who became both post and telegraph master. Initially the office was located in a cottage in Shoalhaven Street, after which it was transferred to the Council Chambers. In July 1874, John Stewart, MP, made a representation on behalf of the residents of Kiama to the Parliament for an official post office building in the town. As a result, ¬£1500 was placed on the Estimates for 1875 and the search for a site began. The site selected for the new office was at the corner of Manning and Terralong Streets, which was part of the site reserved for the Town Hall, a point which had caused some delay in the site selection. The first suggestion for the new office was that it be based on the same design as the office in Carcoar that had cost ¬£1500. This was approved by the Postmaster-General, John Fitzgerald Burns. On 19 February 1877, James Barnet, the Colonial Architect, forwarded a plan for an office estimated to cost ¬£3000, a cost that was questioned by both the Secretary for the GPO and the Electric Telegraph Department, but was nonetheless approved by Burns' successor as Postmaster- General, Saul Samuel. On 9 July 1877, a further ¬£1700 was added to the estimates for the new building with the call for tenders being made in October. On 2 January 1878 the tender was awarded to W. R. Vaughan for ¬£3300 with the office being completed on 13 December 1878. On 17 December 1878 a further ¬£225.12.0 was requested for the erection of fencing, gates and other works for the office. On 12 January 1879 Postal Inspector Davies forwarded another list of required fittings, which was referred to the Colonial Architect. Davies reported again in April on the building stating that arrangements for posting letters in the new building were unsafe, and that there was no provision to transact money orders or Government Savings Bank business. By December 1879 the new building was still unoccupied despite having been completed for over a year. On 6 January 1880 the Postmaster Mr Tyter advised that he was preparing to occupy the building, but that the Telegraph arrangements were still not complete. He was ordered to occupy the building in any case, and the office opened for business on 19 January 1880. Throughout 1880, Postmaster Tyter kept up a correspondence with the department requesting a number of additional fittings to the office, including a stable and shed for storage, a 400-gallon water tank and extra lighting under the colonnade to light the post boxes at night. In September 1881, Tyter requested that a bathroom and wash house also be erected, an item that was not considered essential for official residences at the time. The request provoked the Secretary to prepare a lengthy minute in which the apparent extra expenses that had been incurred on the Kiama office were listed. It was noted that the combined postal and telegraph revenue for Kiama was only ¬£800 per annum and it was recommended that no further expenditure be approved beyond that already agreed to. It was not until April 1900 that approval for the erection of a wash house was given. In December 1895 John Tyter retired as Postmaster of Kiama after 25 years service. Luke Kingsmill, then Postmaster at Forbes, who had specifically requested the position, replaced Tyter as Postmaster. Tyter was granted a pension of ¬£151.5.0 per year by the Department from 1 February 1896. He died in October 1897 at the age of 62. The small size of Kiama created some problems for the office through the 1890s as a number of staff were transferred away. Following complaints from local residents, the post office and local press, an inquiry was held in 1898. The investigation found no reason to increase the staff at the office, adding that with proper management the staff problems could be resolved internally. In 1905 the Progress Association requested that a counter be provided for the transaction of business as the public were still being served via a delivery window. A cedar counter and writing slope were provided shortly afterwards. In 1911 the telephone exchange was opened at Kiama with a daytime-only service being provided. A full service was introduced from May 1914. Little remains in way of detail for any work carried out at Kiama after this date, although it appears that no significant external work has been carried out. Renovations in 1978 saw three downstairs rooms of the Postmasters residence absorbed for office use, with the residence being confined to the upstairs portion of the office. The exterior of Kiama Post Office was repainted from a white wash finish to the current colour scheme in the mid-1990s.  Description  Kiama Post Office is located within the central business and tourist district of Kiama. The building is situated on the prominent corner position of Terralong and Manning Streets and overlooks Kiama Harbour to the north. It is a two- storey, rendered brick Victorian Italianate building with a three-storey corner clock tower surmounted by a small belfry. It is the earliest surviving example of a corner clock tower as a design element in NSW. The roof is predominantly hipped, of corrugated steel, with a pyramidal roof on the corner tower and belfry, and a steel finial and lightning conductor at the apex. There is a skillion roof on the south-eastern single-storey additions. Four chimneys punctuate the roofline of the two-storey section, one at the southernmost end of the south-western wing, one either side of the southern edge of the main roof section and one at the north-western corner. Each chimney is rendered, with moulded tops and terracotta chimney pots. It appears that only a few major additions have occurred to the Post Office since first constructed in 1878. These are largely single-storey, towards the rear along the eastern boundary, including the hipped-roof section over the mail room and skillion roof over the current staff amenities. Verandahs on the first-floor northern facade and north-western corner comprise asphalt lined floors, raked board and batten, and boarded soffits, respectively, green painted vertical slat timber balustrades with timber posts and wall mounted globe lights. There is a small concrete porch on the north-western corner of the ground floor below the upper verandah, without a balustrade. To the eastern facade, there is a colonnade with burnt red, clay-tiled floor and steps, masonry arches and columns, board and batten soffit and pebblecrete curved ramp at the southern end. The clock tower is accessed internally via a recent steel vertical ladder from the ground-floor to the first, and via a timber ladder to the clock mechanism on the third-floor. French doors to the tower open out onto the northern facade first-floor verandah and the interior walls are rendered, with timber-boarded floors. The Post Office has been recently painted with a distinctive salmon-pink colour scheme including red detailing of arches, openings, posts and smooth columns. The exterior is distinguished by the use of Tuscan elements that include the slender column pilasters which flank the first floor windows. The eaves and a moulded string course below the first floor eaves which is continuous around the tower have been painted a tan colour. The bracketed eaves below the main roof of the tower have also been painted tan, and the rendered base course \\"skirting\\" is painted light brown. Below the bracketed eaves are four clock faces with black lettering on a white background, one to each side, with moulded circles either side of each clock face encircling the numbers 18 and 78 to the left and right sides respectively. Classically moulded detailing is also used on the uniformly spaced openings and the four bay, round arched colonnade, including slender pilasters to the sides of windows and prominent keystones within moulded arches. The ground-floor interior comprises four major areas. These incorporate the carpeted retail area in the north-eastern quarter, carpeted mail room and post boxes on the eastern side, carpeted lunch room on the western side and other tiled staff amenities in the south eastern corner, and carpeted office areas in the south-western corner. Ceilings of the ground- floor are predominantly plasterboard with coved cornices in the western side offices, mail room and retail areas. The north-western corner store room has a square set plaster ceiling with moulded cornice and a small ceiling rose; there is a raked board and batten ceiling in the rear office infill. Lighting comprises attached and suspended fluorescent tubing and air-conditioning is limited to a wall-mounted unit in the mail room. Architraves appear to be original, in the northern half of the building in particular, being stained and possibly restored. Later architraves appear in the rear centre infills. Original or early brown skirting is located on original fabric of the northern section, with modern black strip skirting in the retail area and offices. Windows of the ground floor include original arched, two pane upper and single pane lower sash windows; six pane upper and lower sash windows; and multi pane wide arched windows to the northern facade arcade infill. -60s louvred and top hung windows. The rear infills and additions feature doors to the ground-floor are mainly modern flush and sliding doors, with a few stained, four panel original doors retained. Ground-floor walls are painted the standard Australia Post grey colour scheme on the majority of the floors, with pale green and apricot schemes with brown trim on the north-western corner and western side. Walls are mainly painted rendered brick, with recent partition walls enclosing the south-western offices and store rooms. There are three chimney breasts retained, with only two surrounds. They are all bricked in or boarded over. The central staircase is of stained and polished timber, with a curved rail, spiral bottom post and squared balusters. There is vinyl sheet to the treads and there are carved brackets and timber panelling below the stair. Skirting to the stair appears original. The first-floor former residence currently disused, comprises three bedrooms, a sitting room, a kitchen in the south- western corner, and a bathroom on the western side. All rooms excepting the kitchen are off a central hallway and the floor is fully carpeted, with the exception of the sheet vinyl floor of the kitchen and modern bathroom tiling. First-floor ceilings comprise plaster with a coved cornice in the western side sitting room, plaster and wide batten ceilings in the north-western corner bedroom and bathroom, and flush plaster in the hall, kitchen and remaining bedrooms.

As with the ground-floor, the first-floor architraves are stained and possibly restored. Skirting is wide, excepting that in the kitchen, which has later, narrower skirting, all painted dark brown. Windows of the first-floor are predominantly original four pane upper and lower sash and six pane upper and lower sash windows. Doors are stained, featuring four panels and early hardware, and there are original French doors opening onto the verandahs. Walls on the first-floor are rendered and painted brick in an overall light green colour scheme with dark brown trim. Three fireplaces have been retained, each with marble surrounds, however all have been boarded over. Standard Australia Post signage is located at the southern end of the eastern colonnade and on the northern face, of the corner clock tower. Lettering to the building is limited to the eastern facade, with \\"Kiama Post Office 2533\\" centred over the arched bays, below the eaves of the eastern facade. The surrounding buildings are predominantly two-storey, twentieth century shopfronts and nineteenth century civic buildings such as the classically styled Council Chambers to the south. Fencing around the building comprises low picket and recent steel fencing and the rear yard is concrete with some areas of grass. The streets are landscaped with pedestrian islands and low shrubbery and to the north is a large grassed area sloping down to the harbour lined with large Norfolk Island pine trees that dominate the view. The only outbuilding associated with the Post Office is the timber boarded shed to the southern boundary of the site, with a recent hipped, corrugated steel roof. The building is painted a complementary salmon pink colour to the Post Office and has later windows and doors installed, including a roller door. This building is possibly the original shown to the left in the 1878 photograph, and is possibly the original stables, although substantially modified. Kiama Post Office was reported to be in very good condition as at 6 July 2000, with the archaeological potential of the site described as high. Kiama Post Office is substantially intact to its original form, and retains the features which make it culturally significant, including the prominent corner tower, Tuscan detailing and arcade, along with its overall style, scale and location. = Modifications and dates = * Kiama Post Office was completed in December 1878. The original building comprised the two-storey section and clock tower, without the crowning belfry of the tower. When first built, the clock faces had white lettering on a black background, and it appears from an early photograph that the building was not originally rendered, but face brick with rendered or stone detailing. The building was not occupied until January 1880 due to fitting and fixture problems. * A stable and outhouse were completed in August 1881. * It was not until April 1900 that a wash house was constructed for the residence. * The belfry appears to be an early addition, however the date of its construction is unknown. * Dates are unknown as to when the northern facade arcade was infilled and entry doors were installed to the eastern arch, and when the column matching those of the eastern colonnade supporting the north western ground floor porch was replaced. * In August 1977, the present white translucent clock faces were installed during general renovations and alterations of the building. * During the renovations of 1978, the three ground-floor rooms of the residence on the western side were incorporated into the Post Office. The residence was confined to the first- floor as a result. This was possibly the time when the south eastern single storey skillion wing, containing staff bathrooms, was constructed and the original wash house was modified. * Overall repainting of the building with the salmon pink colour scheme occurred during the mid 1990s, replacing an overall whitewash. * 1990s standard Australia Post fitout of the retail area, including the closing off of the ground floor northern entry.  Heritage listing  Kiama Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, aesthetic qualities and social meaning.

The Unit, based in Jaipur, is one of the few remaining cavalry units in the world that maintains its own stable of horses. The IPA's registered office is co-located with the 61 Cavalry's B Squadron. History The IPA was established in 1892. Legally, it is a non-profit association registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Prominent teams of the pre-World War II period included Alwar, Bhopal, Bikaner, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Patiala, Jodhpur, Kishengarh and Kashmir. The majority of the Cavalry regiments of the British Army and the British Indian Army also fielded teams, the most prominent amongst them were the Central India Horse (CHI), Prince Albert Victor Own Cavalry (PAVO‚Äôs Cav), the Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, the 10th Royal Hussars, the 15th Lancers, and the 17/21st Lancers. The outbreak of the second World War and the mechanization of cavalry units resulted in a decline in interest in Indian polo. The IPA invited the Argentine national polo team to visit India in 1950 and play an exhibition games across the country in a bid to revive interest in the sport. The Argentine team participated in tournaments in Jaipur, Delhi and Bombay. The Pakistan Army polo team visited India in 1955. The IPA also revived the Indian Polo Championship in 1956, after a gap of 17 years. The India national polo team participated in the 1957 World Championship in France and won the tournament. These events helped revive interest in polo in the country. Indian polo received another boost after the Indian Army officially adopted polo as a sport granting access to new grounds and stables of horses. Indian President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed consented to be the Patron-in-Chief of the IPA, resulting in the introduction of a new trophy called The President's Cup in 1975. The IPA marked its 100th anniversary in 1992. In the year 1992 the IPA completed 100 years and since then polo is on an upward trend in the country. Today we have 33 Polo Clubs registered with IPA. Polo has been revived at Leh in Jammu and Kashmir, at Udaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Hyderabad and Bangalore in South India. Polo is now not only the domain of the Army but a number of corporate and industrial houses are supporting teams in the domestic polo circuit. The Indian Polo Association has Chief of Army as its President and is the national governing body of Polo in the country.

It was designed by Thomas Rowe and built from 1860 to 1863 by builders Moon & Simmons and carpenters Walker Bros. It is also known as Kiama Presbyterian Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  This church is of early English architecture and was designed by Thomas Rowe of Sydney. Sandstone used in its construction was a gift from the Robb family on whose estate at Riversdale near the Minnamurra River it was quarried. Basalt for the foundations and inner walls came from Mr Carson's quarry in Kiama. Tenders for the construction of the Church (which replaced an earlier weatherboard structure used for worship) were called in December 1859, and the foundation stone laid in January 1860. The building was completed early in 1863, without the present spire and vestry, and the opening services took place on 4 March 1863. The minister at that time was the Rev. John Kinross. The opening was performed by the Rev. Dr William Grant of Shoalhaven, Moderator of the Eastern Synod of Australia. The sermon on that occasion was preached by the Rev. Dr Robert Steel of Sydney. The total cost of the church was A¬£1991/7/1 and the debt on completion was ¬£250. Messrs Moon and Simmons were the builders and Messrs Walker Bros, were the carpenters. The building opened without the spire or vestry, but it was completed to original plan by the addition of a vestry in 1895 and the bell tower spire in 1898. These two additions were substantially financed through funds obtained by the railway resuming approximately half the Church land and effectively bisecting the property. Stained glass windows were also installed at this time. In 1893 the railway resumed a portion of the Church land and largely spoiled the setting. Deliberations took place as to the advisability of building a new Church on another site, but this step was finally decided against. In 1897 a move was begun to complete the Church by the addition of the vestry and the spire above the tower. This project was completed in 1898.Harmer 1998 The bell tower was restored in 2010, having been funded by the sale of the little-used St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Jamberoo.  Description  A simple rectangular plan-form, the church is entered by two gabled porches, the whole covered by a slate-clad hammer-beam roof and complemented by the eccentrically placed square-based tower with its broad stone spire (now rendered), this latter feature was completed in 1898. The rough-dressed sandstone walls of the Church, built up on coursed basalt rubble foundations are enlivened by dressed quoins, parapets, buttresses and reveals to the building's lancet-form openings. Internal finishes comprise stone flagging, painted plastered walls with later sedar panelling (1953) and painted timber ceiling, complemented by fine cedar pews arranged in three banks. The geometric east windows contain noted examples of painted pictorial glass, installed in 1897. The manual pipe organ by Waller and Sonsi is an original example of the work of Charles Richardson (1907) and was donated to the Church in 1907. The Sunday School, a simple gable-roofed rendered masonry structure located to the north of the Church, was constructed in the same year. The building is constructed of basalt freestone walls faced externally with sandstone blocks including buttresses. The interior of the solid walls being plastered and lined to assemble block work. The roof is board lined internally and externally covered in Welsh Penryn Slates supported with hammer beam trusses supported on stone corbels. The physical condition of the church was reported as good as at 3 July 1998, with high archaeological potential. The integrity of the building is virtually complete as from effective completion in 1898, maintenance works have sought to retain materials or surfaces as close as practical to the original.  Heritage listing  It occupies a highly visible aspect in the Kiama Central Business District. It is a major component in the streetscape and is an unmodified example of the 19 Neo Gothic style of its architect / designer using local materials and featuring pleasing proportions in a location of significance and impact. Scots Presbyterian Church, Land and Trees was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is central to Kiama's development, built in 1863 to replace on earlier wooden building on the foreshore of the adjacent block beach. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It is an unaltered sample of early English gothic architecture as interpreted by its architect Thomas Rowe. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a central location in Kiama and has been in continuous use as a place of worship. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It has a wide variety of building materials both local and imported and employed a variety of trades and craftsman in its construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item is a rare example of the architects work in a basically unaltered form. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The item is a good example of a new gothic influence transported into an Australian setting.

Developed by botanist Garrick Hawkins, Mayfield has been inspired by the gardens of Europe, which features vast greenery vistas, an avenue of trees, dazzling seasonal colours and ornamental flowering. It is made up of two main garden areas, Mayfield Garden and the Hawkins‚Äô Family Private Garden.Discover a floral wonderland at Mayfield Garden History The site was originally a sheep farm, which was established in 1984. Garrick Hawkins started readying a small personal garden in 1984 in an association with local nurseryman and landscaper Peter D'Arcy. Three-decades later it evolved to become one of the largest and expensive gardens of its kind. Although agricultural activities still occur on the 2,025 hectares (5,000 acres) of land that encircles the garden, the garden has been refurbished, opening to visitors in 2008. Collections =Mayfield= The Water Garden is in size, displaying a canopy layer of red oaks and copper beech that are matched by an preponderant mid-layer of gaudy rhododendrons and maples, with hellebore and alchemilla ground covers and an ostentatious display of spring and summer flowering bulbs. There is a prominent stone cascade that was designed after the sandstone cliffs of proximate Kanangra Walls. There is a large collection maples, possibly the largest in Australia, which go with a collection of Hydrangeas and the flashy water lilies, which bloom in the summer. Shaped like a valley, the Valley of the Five Ponds contains woodland collection of deciduous oaks, maples, birch and beech, with a shrub groundcover of viburnum, Rhododendron molle and cornus, and winter-flowering Hellebore and summer-flowering heuchera.

Description Trigonidium obtusum is about tall with short flower stems. The pseudobulbs of the plant are compressed and oblong, with two lanceolate leaves. The scapes spring from the rhizome, and each scape ends with a single flower. The flower is yellowish to pinkish with purple veins and blue eyespots. The flower is approximately wide with sepals that are broader and taper less than other species. Flower development takes ten days, and flowers wither four to ten days after opening. During the hottest hours of the day, the flowers release a sweet fragrance similar to lemon. Pentadecane is the main component of the fragrance. Ecology Male Plebeia droryana bees pollinate the flowers by performing pseudocopulation. Bees become trapped in the tubular orchid after being attracted by the sepals or petals of the flower. Two types T. obtusum flowers exist, one with attractive sepals and one with attractive petals. The flowers are morphologically identical besides the sepals and flowers, and most likely discourage self-pollination by hindering the process of bee learning. Pollination of T. obtusum is unique in the fact that pollination does not only require pseudocopulation but also trapping the male bee. Bees carrying pollinarium occasionally revisit the same flower, but self-pollination does not occur. Though pentadecane produces the fragrance of the flower, pentadecane itself does not attract P. droryana bees.

Coal mining It was named for Matt France, who discovered lignite coal from six to fourteen feet below the surface. France was also instrumental in having the Denver and New Orleans Railroad opened to provide transportation of people and goods through the area, including the transportation of coal from the mine, which was purchased by the railroad from France. Colorado and Southern Railway had a station at Franceville, four miles east of the Franceville Junction station of the Denver and New Orleans Railroad. The mine opened mid-1882. In 1884, the mine hit its peak production of 56,000 tons. The mine closed in 1898, when it reported the average annual output was 20,000 tons. The Colorado Springs area was a center of coal mining activity that drew immigrants from Southern Europe, particularly Italy, to the mines in Franceville, Papeton and Pikeview.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 November 2010.  History  Catherine Hill Bay village is the oldest collection of buildings in Lake Macquarie, retaining distinctive historical townscapes and land/seascapes, with scale, fabric and interrelationship of the features largely retained and in good condition. Catherine Hill Bay takes its European name from the wreck of the schooner Catherine Hill, bound from the Richmond River, in 1867. In April 1865, Sydney merchants Jacob Levi Montefiore and Thomas Hale took out a mining lease on 265 acres, bordering the southern part of the bay. By the end of 1873, \\"splendid samples of coal\\" (SMH) had been mined, the original jetty, a mine manager's residence and \\"a number of good weatherboard shingled cottages for the workmen\\" were under construction in the new \\"Township of Cowper\\". In May, 1874, Thomas Hale wrote to the Postmaster General requesting a post office for the 100 people then in the township. In 1875, the company reduced miners' wages and the miners stopped work in protest, beginning a tradition of industrial disputes that was to characterise the community for a century to come. In March, 1876, the New Wallsend Coal Company, bankrupt and undercapitalised, suspended operations. By late 1880, the settlement was abandoned, many of its buildings dismantled and re-erected elsewhere. In 1888 the Wallarah Coal Company, an English venture with strong colonial connections, purchased land including the former Cowper Township and began construction of a jetty to replace the original wharf which had burned two years before. By January 1890, the mining community was firmly re- established as \\"Catherine Hill Bay\\" and the first shipment of coal left the new jetty. A brief industrial dispute the same year was resolved in the Company's favour. By 1892, Police services, a school, and rumours, at least of \\"telephonic connection with Wyee\\", joined several churches as harbingers of a lasting settlement. In 1899, several miners challenged their eviction from company housing in Court and won. By the turn of the century, Catherine Hill Bay's reputation as a \\"picturesque\\" beauty spot had been added to its underlying identity as a scene of industrial prosperity and occasional labour unrest. The township continued to grow and prosper through the first quarter of the 20th Century with expanding public services, a Court House, a School of Arts and a Brass Band. By 1908, miner's residences and mine-related services expanded to Middle Camp, a short distance up the bay, location of a pit-head and a large plant. In 1915, Catherine Hill Bay Public School, too, was shifted to Middle Camp, acknowledging this community as the new focus of Company development. In August, 1917, miners at Catherine Hill Bay struck in sympathy with striking Railway workers. The Government of New South Wales replied by taking over direct control of the state's coal mines, importing strike- breaking labourers to keep them in operation. At Catherine Hill Bay, a train was deliberately derailed and the jetty dynamited. Extra police were sent to the town to protect the railway, the jetty, a nearby armaments depot and the strike-breakers. Even when relations between miners and employers were peaceful, discontent and public concern mounted over the deteriorating conditions in which Company housing obliged the miners to live. By February 1929, coal miners across NSW were once again on strike and strike-breakers were imported to work the Wallarah colliery. The worldwide economic depression followed. Jobs across the state in coal mining plummeted by some 10 000, by 1933. Increasing mechanisation of the coal industry affected Catherine Hill Bay by 1937, even as economic conditions began to improve, keeping employment precarious and fuelling the decade of industrial unrest that preceded the Second World War. In 1941, public attention focussed again on Catherine Hill Bay, when 100 Wallarah miners staged a stay-in for a record 101 hours over a penalty clause in their award. Publicity surrounding the event called attention to the squalid living conditions in the company town, noting that it was completely owned \\"by shareholders who live in England.\\" During the ensuing decade, sporadic schemes to improve housing, services and facilities in the communities of the Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct stalled, failed, were indefinitely postponed or succumbed to token gestures such as the bowling green, tennis court and recreation area which graced Middle Camp in the early 50s. These modest amenities were the first substantial public works since the Public School, in 1915. They were also the last. In 1962, Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. absorbed the J & A Brown Abermain Seaham Collieries which had taken over the Wallarah Coal Company, in 1956. In 1964 Coal & Allied decided to sell the company cottages to their occupants. While this scheme provided greater incentive for the new owners to maintain and improve their homes, dwindling employment throughout the remainder of the 20th Century saw declining population and a corresponding disappearance of community services. The Public School closed in 1985. In 1992 Coal & Allied retrenched 280 workers and, the following year sold the operation to Lake Coal which cut jobs still further in preparation for closing down the mine. The Anglican Church and the Post Office both closed in 1993. Today, the remaining miners and descendants of miners in the Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct have been joined by relatively recent arrivals, attracted by the distinctive character of the built environment and the aesthetic appeal of its setting. That environment is a rare survivor among the state's former company towns, most of which are either abandoned (Joadja, Minmi) or changed beyond recognition. In 2000 mining began to decline due to geological issues and mining ceased in Catherine Hill Bay in 2002.Coal & Allied, 2010, quoted in LMCC, 2017, 7 In 2008 Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.  Description  The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct, 26 kilometres south of Newcastle and 100 kilometres north of Sydney, located on the Wallarah Peninsula, bordered by Lake Macquarie to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the East. The precinct is set in a wider coastal landscape, now largely dedicated as a National Park, which is distinctive both for its coastal topography and which creates a natural visual catchment. The area retains its open and undeveloped character, with slowly regenerating coastal scrub. Itand is highly sensitive, visually, to any new development due to a high degree of visibility from various vantage points across the landscape. Although the varied and dramatic juxtaposition of broader sea-land landscapes, ranging from exposed ridges and cliff forms to sheltered sloping gullies, does not lie within the Cultural Precinct, this setting contributes powerfully to the sense of the built environment's modest scale. The village's early buildings in the village are typically small, vernacular mining cottages, dating from the 1890s to the 1920s, located sporadically in, and constituting a significant part of, the open coastal landscape. Its two villages, Catherine Hill Bay and Middle Camp consist principally of modest miners' cottages lining both sides of the road through the towns. In the Cultural Precinct and its surroundings are the evident and easily accessible remnants of mining infrastructure from the 19th century to the present. From the south, at the corner of Clarke and Montefiore Streets, the dramatic landforms of the headland and beach dominate rows of small houses stepping down the hill. From the north, along Flowers Drive through Middle Camp, the jetty and headlands are visible. Against this striking backdrop, the character of the streets derives from the low-scale built form and highly consistent pattern of predominantly single storey weatherboard cottages. This reflects the historical association with the coal company. = Condition = The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct forms the oldest collection of buildings in Lake Macquarie with scale, fabric and interrelationship of the features largely retained and in good condition. The Precinct and its surroundings are significant archaeological resources for the investigation of the area's industrial heritage. The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct remains an exceptionally intact example of an early Australian company town. Ongoing additions and modifications to the original building stock over time have tended to respect the prevailing scale, materials and spatial relations that characterise the Precinct.  Heritage listing  The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct comprises picturesque and distinctive historic townscapes forming the oldest group of buildings in Lake Macquarie, set in land/seascapes of exceptional aesthetic and technical significance, both visually and as an archaeological resource for industrial heritage. The boundary established by the Independent Heritage Advisory Panel for the Catherine Hill Bay Heritage Cultural Precinct encompasses the distinctive dwellings and coal mining infrastructure of the villages of Catherine Hill Bay and Middle Camp. The original buildings, most of which are small vernacular cottages dating from the 1890s to the 1920s form pleasing streetscapes evoking the settlement's origins as a nineteenth century mining village. Although few buildings belong to a recognised style or period, each is distinctive, and all display a high degree of consistency in terms of size, scale, form, setbacks, siting and materials. The urban pattern of the Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct can be appreciated in its bush and coastal setting, particularly on the northern approach. The Precinct is set in a landscape, now largely dedicated as a National Park, which is distinctive both for its coastal topography which creates a natural visual catchment and for its evidence of coal mining dating from the 1890s. The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct is now rare, as an intact surviving example of \\"Company Town\\" development. In Lake Macquarie such developments generally evolved more informally than the company town infrastructures elsewhere in the Upper Hunter and other parts of Australia. Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 November 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Precinct's built environments, location and geological character are state significant because of the key role played by 19th Century company towns in the development of Australian resources. It is significant for the continuing association of the area with coal mining. This development is clearly evidenced by remnants of railways, the structures and extent in the immediate setting of untouched landscape typical of mining occupation of the foreshores. The jetty and other structures play a key role in reflecting the long term importance of CHB as a company town. The place's strong sense of history is evidenced by remnants and structures which commemorate the working activity of the town. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct is state significant for its associations with coal mining, organised labour, and early maritime industry in NSW. It is located on by the oldest coal mining lease in NSW, Consolidated Coal Lease 706. It is associated with the earliest examples of industrial action in NSW and with the evolution of unionised labour in the state. The Precinct's association with the Australian maritime industry is strong with regular shipping activity from the jetty stretching from its earliest days (1870s) to 2001, when shipping ceased. In 2004-5 the community subscribed $20,000 to build a memorial at the Bay for its citizens who died in war, most of whom were miners, jetty hands, seamen, or the family of those people. The Precinct is also associated with the State Heritage Register listed WW11 radar station RS208, near Mine Camp, which was a key unit in Australia's war time protection and was manned in part by Catherine Hill Bay women who were members of the WAAF. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The built form in Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct' s two villages is aesthetically significant at a state level as a highly intact late nineteenth century company town characterised by a varied range of finishes and scale typified by simple forms of predominately one storey height. The Precinct's setting exhibits visual significance owing to the diversity of landforms, vegetation communities and waterforms. The pervasive evidence of the Precinct's industrial history is technically and archaeologically significant. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Catherine Hill Bay exhibits a significant sense of place and history through a number of monuments and memorials and through its association with the development of company towns in NSW. The community remains closely integrated despite the aging and passing of older residents who worked in the mines, and their families. Some eight movies or TV shows have used the Bay as a location in the past 25 years and these form the core of the \\"Catho Classics Film Festival\\" inaugurated in 2004 with the screening of Mel Gibson's first starring film \\"Summer City\\" and a video documentary produced by local residents which recorded the memories of residents who participated in the movie. A current project by the Progress Association to produce a social history of Catherine Hill Bay miners' cottages focusses on the domestic life and extended networks of families who lived in the cottages from the 1890s to the present. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Precinct is an archaeological resource with potential to contribute to our understanding of the industrial heritage of Lake Macquarie and NSW. Lake Macquarie City Council's \\"Strategic Issues Study\\" on Wallarah South (1995) included a review of Aboriginal Archaeology which recommended that a field study should focus on the Middle Camp Gully. Further research and consultation are needed in order to formulate appropriate management strategies for the Aboriginal cultural heritage resource of the Precinct, its setting and the Wallarah Peninsula generally. The precinct also provides a rare living example of the scale, materials and spatial relations that typified Company Towns in NSW from the late nineteenth century onwards. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct is rare in NSW as coal mining company town that has retained integrity of scale, shape and size with in situ comprehensive remnants and memorials of century-long mining activity in a natural coastal location. No other mining locality contains such an intact and compact representation of 19th and 20th century coal mining, rail and sea transportation in an isolated coastal environment which remains in much the same natural state as it was in the 1880s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Catherine Hill Bay Cultural Precinct is state significant as a documented and widely acknowledged intact representative of the era of company towns in the development of Australia's resources. The integrity and intactness of the Precinct's built environment, industrial infrastructure landscape and seascape, from the 19th Century to the present, are largely due to underground mining by coal companies which owned freehold land, thus restraining surface development for more than a century.

It is known from Africa and Fiji. Taxonomy The genus was first erected by the French entomologist F√©licien Chapuis for a single species, Eurydemus insignis, reported from Australia and later Fiji. This species was later found to be a junior synonym of Rhyparida grandis, which itself was originally reported from New Caledonia. However, both the records from Australia and New Caledonia are possibly erroneous. In 1965, British entomologist Brian J. Selman revised the genus, transferring all African species in it seen by him to Afroeurydemus and other related African genera. He suggested that it was almost certain Eurydemus was restricted to Fiji.

History Most civilians could not afford to own horses in the period following India's independence, and equestrian sports were primarily practiced by Indian Army officers. The Army re-established several major horse shows across the country that had been halted during World War II. In 1950s, the Army began seeking opportunities to send riders to compete at international events. However, all international competitions were conducted by the F√©d√©ration √âquestre Internationale (FEI) which required participating riders to be sent by national federations. As India did not have such a federation, the Army established the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) in 1967. General P.P. Kumaramangalam, Major General R.K.R. Balasubramanian, and several senior army officers are credited with setting up the EFI. The Federation held its first meeting on 14 March 1967 and officially proclaimed \\"the birth of the national Equestrian Federation of India\\" and defined its objectives. One of the EFI's urgent tasks was to \\"promote equine breeding and care and management of equines\\" as the Partition of India had resulted in the loss of West Punjab, the best horse breeding territory in British India, to Pakistan. The EFI became affiliated with FEI in 1971. The EFI played an important role in establishing the Asian Equestrian Federation in 1978. The EFI convinced both Indian government officials and FEI to introduce equestrian events at the 1982 Asian Games which were to be hosted in India. Keen to develop equestrian sports in the country, FEI Secretary General Fritz O. Widmer agreed to the request and asked the EFI to host Show Jumping, Eventing and Dressage competitions at the 1982 Asian Games. The EFI agreed to hold the Show Jumping and Eventing competitions, but stated that it did not have enough experience to host the Dressage competition. Instead, the EFI proposed a new event called Tent Pegging and drafted rules for the competition which was approved by FEI. Equestrian sports (Show Jumping, Eventing and Tent Pegging) were included for the first time at the 1982 Asian Games.

It was built from 1895 to 1896. It has also been known as Northcott House and St Peter's Anglican Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Thomas McGregor was the owner of the land in 1872. He erected a hut and set about preparing the site for a residence. William and Jessie Northcott arrived in Lismore in 1879 and bought businesses and had a saddlery business in the already developed town. The expanding Northcott family lived above their \\"Trading Palace\\" in Molesworth Street, Lismore. He later purchased a farm of several hundred acres at Goonellabah. Tulloona House was built in 1895 for the Northcott family. William Northcott set out to establish an \\"English Park\\" setting and sited Tulloona on 4 acres at the highest point with wonderful views in all directions. The builder was Mr Brown, father of the late George Brown of Brown & Jolly. A schoolroom was built behind the house. All the buildings were painted white. An acetylene and generating plant supplied the lighting for the house and buildings. A two thousand gallon tank was erected between the house and the schoolroom, and the water was pumped to the tank by a windmill, erected beside a twenty eight feet deep, eighteen feet in diameter well. The water was piped to every part of the property, including pipes for hundreds of yards to the house, dairy and piggery on the farm on the northern end of the property overlooking Bexhill. Stables for 4 horses was built at the back of the 4 acre property, together with the carriage house for 2 buggies, a sulky and a \\"sociable\\", which held 9 people (3 in the front and 6 in the back with seats facing each other). The sulky was for the use of the staff on their days off. William Northcott drove to Lismore each day in the smaller buggy, which he called the phaeton. On Sundays he drove his family to Church in the \\"sociable\\" with 2 matching grey horses. This outfit was always made available when anyone of note came to Lismore, and the 2 horses, Beauchamp and Carrington, showed their paces on these important occasions. On their outings to Ballina, a 3rd horse Prince was harnessed with them. All members of the family were competent both as drivers and riders. In 1910 the family purchased their first car, a Model T Ford. They all learned to drive except William who loved to drive his horses, and after his first attempt was content to be a passenger. The house and high tank stand was a well known landmark and was a tourist attraction and could be seen from Casino and Dunoon. The walls could also be seen from Bangalow and Byron Bay lighthouse with binoculars. Three maids were employed in the house and always wore uniforms, caps and aprons. Two men were employed outside. In 1915 the family moved to Sydney and sold Tulloona to Dr Cahill. In 1961 the Anglican Church bought the property as new premises for St Peter's Anglican Church. The lower floor was converted into a chapel, while the upper floor served as a residence for the curate. In 1978 the Anglican Church advertised for demolition tenders for the house to sell as building materials. That same year an Interim Conservation Order was placed on Tulloona to prevent demolition. In 1980 Tulloona was purchased by a Mr Randall. He applied successfully to the Heritage Assistance Program for funding to conserve Tulloona. Conservation and restoration work was undertaken in the following years. In 1981 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed on Tulloona. The Heritage Council awarded $2,500 to the owners to contribute to a Conservation Management Plan which was produced in August 2005. It was subsequently sold by long-term owners Sue and Michael Dakin 2012 after having comprehensively restored the property.  Description  Tulloona was a farm originally comprising several hundred acres, with dairy and piggery on the northern end of the property overlooking Bexhill. Tulloona house is sited towards the centre of a 3788m2 block adjacent to the junction of Ballina Road, Rous Road and the Bruxner Highway. Significant plantings along the front boundary and within the articulation zone obscure views to Tullonna House from the street. Large trees, planted along the eastern boundary punctuate views from the residence to No. 564 and 566 Ballina Road. The land contains a circular drive and garden to the front, an early school house to the rear and a scattering of subtropical trees. =House= An impressive large scale house displaying all the exuberance of a high Victorian residence befitting that of a successful country gentleman. The house is a two-storey verandahed structure of local timber with weatherboard sheeting. The plan is basically a square with projecting bays to the main rooms. These bay windows contain rather distinctive shaped fenestration recalling the English Gothic-Revival. The galvanised steel verandah roofs have a distinctive ogee shape and the wide verandahs possess deep pointed timber valence boards with cast iron columns, panels and frieze which impart an air of lightness contrasting with the solid massing of the bays. The house interior is lined with horizontal beaded timber boards throughout which were originally stained. The major rooms are grand in scale (up to 10m by 9m) with the generous ceiling height of 4.8m throughout. All these rooms contain rich Victorian marble mantelpieces to the fireplaces with pattern inlays to sides and hearth. The central staircase is of impressive proportions with cedar balustrade and panelling surrounds reflecting a taste for \\"Old English\\" detailing (National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1978). =Garden= An \\"English Park\\" setting with the house on 4 acres set at the highest point of the farm with wonderful views in all directions. The house and high tank stand was a well known landmark and was a tourist attraction and could be seen from Casino and Dunoon. The walls could also be seen from Bangalow and Byron Bay lighthouse with binoculars. In the rear yard small garden beds are clustered around the School House, pool, and Residence. =Outbuildings and structures= ;Schoolroom A schoolroom was built behind (north of) the house. ;Generating Plant An acetylene and generating plant supplied the lighting for the house and buildings. ;Water Tank, Windmill and Well A two thousand gallon tank was erected between house and schoolroom, and water pumped to the tank by a windmill, erected beside a twenty eight feet deep, eighteen feet in diameter well.

History  The Skipton Football Club's earliest recorded match dates back to 1873-1874 against Streatham on a field east of the Emus' current Skipton Recreation Reserve and played against teams from the towns of Carngham, Haddon and Linton. A few years later, the recreation reserve was fenced with grass planted and games were played against more districts such as Camperdown and Lismore, with Ballarat official umpires officiating the matches. Skipton had a very strong team during this era and is believed that they had the best record of any Australian rules football club in Australia, playing for fifteen years without losing a game and for eighteen years without losing a home game. In Skipton's early years still, football games were often played in the form of scratch matches, with some of the earliest competition matches dating back to 1890 when Skipton played against clubs from Ararat, Lake Bolac and Streatham and competed for a trophy of twenty sovereigns. That year, in the final, Skipton and Ararat competed against each other at Streatham and Ararat won the game by a goal but Skipton were successful the following year. On several occasions, Skipton played fully representative teams from Ballarat and their undefeated home run was ended when a Ballarat team reportedly beat them after two drawn matches. Football from 1895 to 1900 saw Skipton continuing to play scratch matches against Carngham, Happy Valley and Linton and the club played mainly against the surrounding towns for the next couple of years. In 1908, Skipton defeated Beaufort in the decider in a triangular competition that had a team from Stockyard Hill. A football association was formed between the clubs of Skipton, Carngham, Linton and Scarsdale in 1909 that lasted until World War I. During the war there was no competition but the Skipton football team was still around to support a Queen Carnival in assistance of patriotic funding. In 1919, the Linton & District Football Association was founded and Skipton, Carngham and Linton played in the league and the Scarsdale club rejoined later. Over the years of competition in the LDFL, football fever was developing hatred and bitter rivalry between the local towns. Skipton won LDFL premierships in 1921, 1923 and 1924, beating Linton, Carngham and Linton. The competition was renamed the Linton-Scarsdale Association in 1925, with the addition of teams from the towns of Lismore and Bradvale. The name was changed again in 1927, to the Linton-Skipton Association after Carngham and Scarsdale transferred to the Rokewood-Cape Clear Association. Skipton ended the 1927 and 1929 seasons runner up to Lismore. The Emus joined the Rokewood-Cape Clear Association in 1930 and finished runner up to Illabarook in 1931 and 1932, which became the Cape Clear-Carngham Association from 1934, then the Linton- Carngham Association from 1936, with Skipton again ending the season runner up to Illabarook. In 1937, Skipton won a closely contested grand final against Carngham but the tables were turned in 1938 when Carngham beat Skipton. After 1940, the association went into recess due to World War II. After football resumed in the area in 1946, the Skipton Emus finished the season runner up to Carngham but went through 1949 undefeated and made it to the Grand Final, only to lose to Carngham by one point. In the last two years of the Linton-Carngham Football League, Skipton finished runner up two seasons in a row; in 1951 to Illabarook and 1952 to Carngham. Skipton Football Club joined the Western Plains Football League in 1953 but did not reach a grand final until 1996, in a close loss by six points to Derrinallum. The 1999 season saw the Emus transfer to the Lexton Plains Football League and won senior premierships in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009 and 2010. The Lexton Plains Football League's final season of existence was the 2010 season which was capped with the Skipton Football Club fielding teams in grand finals and coming away with the win for A-Grade, B-Grade ad U17 premierships. A-Grade beat Lexton 16.15.111 to 3.8.26. In 2011, the Skipton Emus moved to the Central Highlands Football League that they are currently affiliated with. In order to avoid a jumper clash with Bungaree FC, a new guernsey, red with a navy blue yoke and white vee was created. This jumper incorporated designs from two previous jumpers worn. These being red with a white vee as worn in the Western Plains Football League and navy blue with a red yoke in the Lexton Plains Football League.  Club Song  We are the red, white and blue, We are the good old red, white and blue, We're the team that comes from miles around, We'll play them on our home or any ground, Some come to cheer us, While others fear us, When they are near us, We are the good old red, white and blue, We are the Skipton football team.

H. brevicornis is of interest due to its endemism, unique ecology and basal position in the suborder Oniscidea. Description H. brevicornis is yellow-brown in colour and grows up to in length. This species has vestigial antennules, short antennae and a trapezoid telson. Each of its compound eyes consist of 19 ommatidia. Juveniles have bumps and setae while adults are almost smooth with light spots. In adults the plates of the posterior (pleonites) fuse with each other after moulting. Like all other members of the family Tylidae, it is capable of rolling up into a perfect ball with antennas tucked in. Distribution The species is found primarily in the oak forests of Corsica, from coastal areas up to an altitude of above sea level, and on Sardinia. It is also known to occur in isolated locations on islands of the Tuscan Archipelago (Elba, Pianosa & Capraia), the L√©rins Islands, the Italian coast (Monte Massoncello) the French coast (Massif de l'Est√©rel & Grasse region) up to an altitude of above sea level. Records of this species at Genoa and at Ospedaletti are uncorroborated. A molecular phylogenetic analysis found that the colonisation of the French and Italian mainland and of the Tuscan Archipelago occurred most recently but failed to conclusively determine whether the distribution was caused by climate change during the Late Pleistocene period or through accidental human transportation of the species. Ecology A detritivore, H. brevicornis lives amongst and feeds on the leaf litter and humus layers of forests soils and is known to dig burrows deep. It is found living in large subsocial groups and is known to engage in conspecific coprophagy. Like other peracarids, females of H. brevicornis provide developing embryos with water, oxygen and nutrients through a specialised structure known as the marsupium. They are semelparous, breeding only once in their lifetime. Its hindgut is host to the mesomycetozoean parasite Eccrinoides helleriae. =Mate guarding= H. brevicornis has followed a unique evolutionary path among terrestrial isopods, and is the only fully terrestrial isopod that has retained the ancestral behaviour of mate guarding which has been observed in all aquatic isopods and some supralittoral species of the genus Ligia. This may have been selected for because these woodlice are semelparous and females lack seminal receptacles. During the breeding period, a male will guard a female who is about to become sexually receptive by riding on top of and tightly gripping her. This precopulatory mate guarding begins 1 to 20 days before the parturial moult of the female. Copulation occurs within 5 to 12 hours after the female sheds the posterior part of her exoskeleton. The male continues the 'nuptial ride' after mating and stops when the female lays fertilised eggs in her newly formed marsupium. Taxonomic history The genus Helleria and type species Helleria brevicornis were first described by Dr. Victor von Ebner, in a publication dated 8 January 1868, from a specimen collected in Corsica. He named the genus Helleria after his friend Camill Heller, who was known for his work on crustacean anatomy, and the specific epithet brevicornis after the Latin for 'short-horned' in reference to the woodlouse's short antennae. Later that year, in a journal published in December, Rev. Alfred Norman described a new genus of amphipods which he also named Helleria, which would eventually be renamed Guernea. In 1879 Gustav Budde-Lund declared Helleria brevicornis a junior synonym to Syspastus brevicornis, a name which he popularised in his seminal 1885 catalog of terrestrial isopods. Meanwhile, Achille Costa had named a woodlouse he found in Sardinia in 1882 Synlomagaster dasypus and subsequently Syngastron dasypus in 1883 but subsequent investigation showed it to be the same as H. brevicornis. While other authors had previously pointed out the precedence of von Ebner's publication, an 1893 book by Rev. Thomas Stebbings ensured subsequent authors (with the notable exception of Karl Verhoeff) used Helleria brevicornis Ebner to describe this woodlouse. Since it was first described, some authors had placed Helleria and Tylos in the same family while others had separated them into two different families. The current taxonomy of placing the two genera in the family Tylidae has persisted since 1960 with Albert Vandel's publication of Isopodes terrestres.

She was the country's first woman Professor of Labor and Social Security Law. In 1998, she joined the Constitutional Court of Spain, becoming the youngest member in the history of the institution. In 2004, she was the Constitutional Court's first woman president, and she continued in that role until 2011. During her presidency, progress was made in anti-discrimination and equality law. Biography Originally from Monforte de Lemos, where a street is named for her grandfather Roberto Baamonde Robles, a politician and cavalry commander, Mar√≠a Emilia Casas was born in Le√≥n, where her father was the property registrar. She studied law at the Complutense University of Madrid, where she graduated Premio Extraordinario, and received a Ph.D. with the same qualification as a pupil of the Complutense professor emeritus of Law, . She also has a degree in Philosophy and Literature. Academic career Casas has been Professor of Labor Law and Social Security at the Law School of the Complutense University, the first woman with this chair in the country. She has taught classes in various postgraduate programs and specialization courses in different Spanish and foreign universities. She is a member of the management committee of Charles III University of Madrid, and has also been its vice-rector of International and Institutional Relations. She has been a member of the council of the Bartolom√© de las Casas International Institute of Political Sciences and Human Rights. Expert in labor relations Casas has made labor relations a key element in her professional career, participating in various international seminars and lecturing on the subject. In addition to holding the Chair of Labor Law and Social Security in Spain, she taught master's degree classes in Occupational Risk Management at the University of Salamanca. In 1998, shortly before becoming a member of the Constitutional Court at the request of the government, she was part of the group of experts on labor standards charged with drafting the law regulating stable part-time work. Career on the Constitutional Court On 16 December 1998, Casas was elected Magistrate of the Constitutional Court of Spain, becoming the youngest member in the institution's history, and in 2004 she was named its president, becoming the first woman to hold that office. For her appointment, she obtained the votes of the progressive magistrates and those of the conservatives Roberto Garc√≠a Calvo and . These were subsequently challenged by the debate on the constitutionality of the reform that the Socialist Party, IU-ICV, and CiU carried out to the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court. Popularly known as the , it established the automatic extension of the Presidency of the Court while there was no renewal of the judges whose term had expired. According to the appeals filed by the People's Party to the Plenary of the Constitutional Court, this usurped the mandate established in Article 160 of the Spanish Constitution, to elect the President of said Court every three years. This amendment, collected in article 16.3 of the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court (LOTC), was declared in accordance with the Constitution in Constitutional Court Decision 47/2008, of 9 April. In 2007, she was subjected to harsh criticism and accused of a crime of improper counseling. A woman contacted Casas by telephone, facilitated by a neighbor, to ask her opinion about the conflicts with her ex-husband and the recovery of custody of her daughter. It was the lawyer Mar√≠a Dolores Mart√≠n Pozo who told the Court President that she had gone through a judicial trial and wanted to regain custody of her daughter. Casas received documentation and maintained telephone conversations with the latter, telling her that she should \\"provoke a judicial action to reach the Constitutional Court en amparo\\", and that she should be called if she did appeal to the Court. Said woman was later arrested on charges of hiring a hitman to kill her ex-husband. The plot was discovered due to a wiretap, decreed by a judge, on the woman's telephone. Casas was accused of a crime of improper counseling. In June 2008, the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court closed the case. =Advances in anti-discrimination law and equality= As a Professor of Labor Law, during her Presidency the Constitutional Court consolidated the anti-discrimination protection for reasons of gender in its multiple aspects, and reinforced the protection of pregnant workers (STC 92/2008), while attributing the constitutional dimension to all those measures aimed at facilitating the reconciliation of work and family life of workers (STC 3/2007). It also set insurmountable limits based on the dignity of the person and on the free development of the personality, on the entrepreneurial capacity of employers to control the free time of workers (STC 192/2003). In short, it contributed to extending the protection of the rights to strike and freedom of association to the contexts of productive decentralization (STC 75/2010). During Casas' Presidency, the Court also endorsed the constitutionality of the , recognizing the specific characteristics of this criminal phenomenon, the needs of protection of the victim, and the greater social reproach of aggression against the wife or partner. In the application of the anti-discrimination law ‚Äì highlighted by Inmaculada Montalb√°n, president of the Observatory Against Gender Violence ‚Äì she followed the path marked by the commitments made by Spain at an international and European level. She was responsible for drafting the seventh and final version of the ruling on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, after not previously achieving sufficient support in the Plenary Session of the Court. She left the presidency of the Court in January 2011. In 2014, she joined the Ejaso Law Firm as an attorney.

It was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1907 by W. F. Oakes. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  =Timber truss bridges= Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Harvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". =Colemans Bridge= The bridge was built in 1907 by Sydney contractor W. F. Oakes, opening in November that year. It replaced an older bridge, which was demolished and replaced with a temporary bridge during construction. It was originally known as the Leycester Creek Bridge but was renamed after John Coleman, then a recently deceased state MP for the area, in December 1907 after a request from the local council. Unlike the nearby Fawcett Bridge, it included provision for pedestrian traffic, which was a popular feature of the new bridge.  Description  Coleman's Bridge is a Dare-type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are tow timber approach spans at one end and one at the other giving the bridge an overall length of . The bridge has a twin cylindrical cast iron central pier. Timber trestles provide the remaining sub structure. The bridge deck provides a dual lane carriage way and a footpath both sides of the roadway. The minimum width of the carriage way is . An Armco traffic guard rail provides protection to vehicular traffic and a timber post and rail barrier forms the pedestrian walkway handrail. Curved steel braces fixed to the top chord of the timber truss help strengthen the outer timber pedestrian barriers. It was reported to be in good physical condition as at 13 September 2005.  Heritage listing  Colemans Bridge is an early example of Dare timber truss bridges. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Colemans Bridge has particular technical significance, having iron piers, the only two-lane Dare truss, footways, and long spans. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Colemans Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Colemans Bridge over Leycester Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Colemans Bridge is valued by the people of the Lismore region. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare - Colemans Bridge contains many important technical and aesthetic features. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Also known as Sripura,≈örƒ´ Nagara and Devi Loka, it is an island situated in the middle of an ocean called the SudhƒÅ Samudra (The Ocean of Nectar). In the Devi Bhagavatam, Manidvipa is portrayed as the Sarvaloka, the highest world, superior to Kailasa, realm of Shiva, Vaikuntha, realm of Vishnu, and Goloka, realm of Krishna. This is consistent with the Devi Bhagavatam's portrayal of Goddess Bhuvaneswari Devi as higher than any of these other gods. In her form as Bhuvaneshvari or Tripurasundari, Devi is the Empress of Manidvipa. At the beginning of the creation, Supreme Goddess, in her form as Adi Parashakti or Mahakali, created this island according to her will.https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/manidvipa Description A description of Manidweepa can be found in the Devi Bhagavata Purana.http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/details/devibhagvatpurana79.html During the beginning of time the Tridevas ‚Äì Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra did not know who they were and what was their purpose. At this time a flying chariot appeared before them, and a heavenly voice directed them to board the chariot. As the Tridevas boarded the chariot and it started flowing with mind's speed and took them to a mysterious place, which was an island of gems surrounded by ocean of nectar and pristine sylvan forests. As they stepped out of the chariot, the Tridevas were transformed into women, much to their astonishment. As they explored the island they came across an Imperial city protected by nine enclosures and guarded by fierce Bhairavas, Matrikas, Kshetrapalas and Dikpalas. As they entered the city they were amazed by its prosperity and soaring infrastructure and finally reached the Imperial Palace known as Chintamanigriha, guarded by Yoginis. For this was ≈örƒ´p≈´ra (alias Devipattana), the capital of Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the Empress of Manidvipa, the abode of Adi Parashakti. When they entered the palace they witnessed Devi Bhuvaneshvari, the queen of all worlds. Her complexion was red. She had three eyes, four arms, braided hair and was clad in red ornaments. She wore a garland of lotuses and Her body was anointed with red sandalwood paste. She held a goad and a noose with Her left hands, while her right hands displayed abhaya and varada mudras. She was decked with ornaments and wore a crown with a digit of crescent moon as crest jewel. She was seated on the left lap of Bhuvaneshvara Mahadeva, who was of white complexion, wore white garments and was decked with ornaments. His hair was matted and was decorated by a crescent moon and Ganga. He had five faces each with three-eyes, and four arms, holding a trident and a battle-axe while displaying varada and abhaya mudras.Before creation while intending to sport, the Devi Bhagavati divided Her Body into two parts and from the right part created Bhuvaneshvara. The Divine Couple was seated on Panchapretasana, a throne which had Sadashiva as plank while Ishvara, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma were five legs. They were being served by many Yoginis, some fanning them, some holding mirror, some offering betel leaves flavoured with camphor, some offering a drink made by mixing honey, ghee, wine and coconut water. Some were ready to dress Bhuvaneshvari's hair, some ready to do makeup, some busy stringing garlands while some singing and dancing to entertain Devi. The Tridevas witnessed millions of universes each with their own Tridevas, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshvari's toe-nail. Some were getting created by Brahma, some getting sustained by Vishnu while others getting annihilated by Rudra. Bhuvaneshvari enlightened the Tridevas with Her greatness. Bhuvaneshvara is Brahman while Bhuvaneshvari is Brahmashakti. Though they appear distinct, both are of the nature of one another. Bhuvaneshvara is Adipurusha while Bhuvaneshvari is Mulaprakriti. To help Trayambaka perform his three-fold Lila, Devi created first the beautiful form of Gopala Sundari/Krishna. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva born from his body. Thus, Tridevas are forms of Bhuvaneshvari. Thereafter Goddess Radha created two shaktis calles Saraswati and Lakshmi. Bhuvaneshvari created goddess Durga shakti of shiva. Brahma with Saraswati created an cosmic egg and Rudra with Uma split it, exposing the Pancha Bhootas. Brahma with Saraswati fashioned the universe from Pancha Bhootas, and Vishnu and Lakshmi sustain it. At the end Rudra with Kali will annihilate the universe so that Brahma and Saraswati can start afresh. Once, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva were involved in an argument about who is the most powerful and supreme of the three. Their debate became so intense that it disturbed the peace of the heavens and worried the Gods. That was when the beautiful Goddess stepped in to intervene and cease the dispute. She took the Trinity of Gods to her idyllic abode and led them to her beautiful chamber. There, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari enlightens them that she is the creator of the entire universe as it is created out of her and ends in her. She is responsible for protecting it from devils. She has created many elements and gave life to all the Gods, sages and all living beings. She had also created many worlds, such as Satyalok, where Lord Brahma lives. It is the most supreme place of all the worlds where the inhabitants are free of life and death cycle. Then Taplok came into being, where the soul, including the body, resides. The inhabitants there wait for Satyalok to take shape. Gyanlok then was formed where the place had the presence of ascetics who were the inhabitants. Maharlok came into being where after the harsh penances, the sages and ascetics have a place to live. The sages who live in that place has the power equal to Gods. That is why all the sages live in that place. Then comes Anandlok, which is Swarglok, which is the residence of Gods and virtuous beings. Next, Bhuvarlok was formed where the sun and planets are positioned. After Bhuvarlok came Bhulok, where mortal and other living beings live. The worlds beneath Earth came into being, the first being Atal Lok in which it is the home of revelry and all the wealth of the planets in accumulated there. Then came Vital Lok, where the beings of the earth stay there to mine gold and other elements. Just like Atal Lok, Vital Lok is centred on earthly riches. Then through King Bali, the king of demons, Sutal Lok came into being. Talatal Lok came into existence and below that, Mahatal was created in which it is Naaglok, the home of all serpents and snake girls. Further down below is the realm of demons and monsters, named Rasatal. Finally, below all the worlds, then originated Patal Lok where Vasuki, the King of snakes lives. This is the foundation of all the other realms. Then, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev witnessed millions of universes each with their own person, in the sheen of Bhuvaneshwari's toe-nail. Some were getting created by Brahma, some getting sustained by Vishnu while others getting annihilated by Rudra. Bhuvaneshwari enlightened the Tridevas with Her greatness. Thereafter, Goddess Bhuvaneshwari gave her Shaktis Saraswati to Brahma, Lakshmi to Vishnu, and Gauri to Shiva. She informed Tridev that her Shaktis that they are given to will help them create and preserve the world, and when the appropriate time comes, it will be destroyed completely so that a new creation can be started afresh by Brahma and Saraswati.

History  The idea for Charles Wright Academy was developed in 1947, when Annie Wright Seminary, an all-girls school, took in some of the students from kindergarten, first, and second grade of Lowell Elementary in Tacoma when their school was damaged by an earthquake. Pleased with the functioning of the school the parents urged to continue the school as co-ed and further including higher grades, which was however declined. Sam and Nathalie Brown approached Bishop Stephen Bayne of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia who directed them to take the plan forward. They along with other interested parents purchased 127 acres on Chambers Creek Road and began functioning as a private boys school as approved by Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Their first year in 1957 included 40 boys and five faculty members. In 1970, Charles Wright Academy decided to admit girls and has been co-ed ever since. It was named Charles Wright Academy in honor of Charles Barstow Wright. They provide grades from Preschool to 12.

(SDAP, KP√ñ). She served as an undersecretary of state under Karl Renner between April and December 1945. That made her the first woman to serve as a member of a government in Austria. From that point till March 1966 she was also notable as the only woman to have been a member of an Austrian government.  Life  Postranecky was born into a working-class family in Vienna where she attended junior and middle school before entering domestic service as a housemaid. In 1919, aged 16, she moved on to become a support worker (\\"Hilfsarbeiterin\\"). That same year, despite her youth, she joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), the precursor of Austria's modern Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei √ñsterreichs\\" / SP√ñ). She participated actively in the party's women's movement, becoming \\"Women's Secretary\\" (\\"Frauensekret√§rin\\") of the regional party branch for Lower Austria in 1927. In October 1933 she was elected to membership of the national Party Executive. Political wrangling earlier in 1933 had given Chancellor Dollfuss the opportunity to impose a form of post-democratic one-party government in Austria. There was a brief but savagely crushed civil uprising in February 1934 which had the effect of confirming the exclusion of the SDAP from national politics in Austria's new \\"Austrofascist St√§ndestaat\\". During 1934 Helen Postranecky was briefly arrested. The political activism in which, between 1934 and 1938, she continued to engage was now deemed illegal, and during this four-year period she was re-arrested several times, spending a total of eight months in prison. The political context then changed abruptly in March 1938 with the annexation of Austria into an enlarged Nazi German state. Postranecky now joined the illegal Communist Party. There was a widespread belief among Austrian Social Democrats that the Communist Party had foreseen and prepared for the Nazi take-over since the 1920s, and was therefore much better prepared to convert itself into a national underground anti-Nazi resistance movement that the SDAP. Postranecky was one of many making the political switch to the Communists in 1938. During the period between 1938 and 1945 she played a leadership role in \\"anti-fascist resistance\\". The provisional national government took office on 27 April 1945. Under the leadership of the venerable Social Democratic, Karl Renner, it was a three party coalition of the SP√ñ, the Communists and the newly formed catholic-centrist People's Party (√ñVP). This government was backed by the military authorities in the Soviet occupation zone from the beginning, and by the end of 1945 it had also been recognised by the western allies who were occupying the central and western parts of Austria. Helene Postranecky was nominated as a member of the government, serving as Under-secretary of State for Food Supply (\\"Unterstaatssekret√§r f√ºr Volksern√§hrung\\"). She was the first woman to be a member of an Austrian government. It would be another 21 years before Grete Rehor became the second woman to serve as a member of an Austrian government (and the first woman to become a full departmental minister in Austria). In August 1947 Helene Postranecky finally married her longstanding partner, Karl Altmann (1904-1960), like her a Communist politician and a member of the Renner government. Between September 1945 and November 1948 Postranecky served as one of the deputy chairs of the Communist Party. She remained a member of the Party Central Committee till 1969. Till 1954 she was a member of the party's political office and thereby part of the inner leadership team. In April 1946 she was elected chair of the party's national women's committee. Between 1948 and 1952 she became involved in the secretariat of the \\"League of Democratic Women\\" (\\"Bund demokratischer Frauen\\" / BDF√ñ), a women's organisation founded by communist women, which saw itself as non-party entity, but in practice was always dominated by communists. The chair of the BDF√ñ at this time was the architect Margarete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky who had, like Postranecky, played an active role in the anti-fascist resistance movement during the Nazi years. Important priorities for the BDF√ñ were peace and global disarmament, along with improvements in rights for women. Till 1957 Helene Altmann-Postranecky worked as a full-time official with the Lower Austria regional party leadership. After that she continued to work on a voluntary basis in the trades union department. In 1968 or 1970 she resigned her party membership, however, unable to be reconciled to the crushing of the Prague Spring in neighbouring Czechoslovakia by a Warsaw pact military invasion. She died in Vienna a couple of months short of her 92nd birthday in 1995.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. History and architecture Interior view of the choir with murals and altarpiece The first written sources to indicate a church in Farstorp are from 1241, but the presently visible church was built already during the second half of the 12th century. The broad western tower, nave, and apse are from this period. A church porch was added to the church some time during the late Middle Ages but later destroyed. During the 15th century, the ceilings of the nave and choir were replaced with vaults; those of the nave were destroyed during a renovation in the 1830s and the present nave ceiling dates from 1941-42. The northern transept was also built in the 1830s. In contrast, the ceiling in the apse is original, dating from the time of the construction of the church. The operetta singer (1931-2002) is buried in the cemetery of the church. Murals The choir of the church is profusely decorated with medieval murals. The apse wall displays Christ in Majesty surrounded by scenes from the Bible. On the wall separating the choir from the nave there are depictions of Saint Olaf and Saint Eric together with Christ crucified. The choir vault is decorated with a third set of murals dating from the end of the 15th century and made by the same artist who made the paintings in Everl√∂v Church. They depict scenes from the New Testament. Elsewhere in the church, fragments of paintings exist in the ground floor of the tower, including a possible depiction of Saint Catherine. Furnishings A number of medieval wooden sculptures originally in Farstorp Church are today in the historical museum of Lund University, as well as an altar bell from 1586. The furnishings still in situ are all from after the Reformation. The lavish altarpiece was made at the end of the 16th century, possibly 1593, and was altered in 1733. The pulpit dates from 1593 and likewise altered in 1733, and again in 1921-23. The baptismal font from the 17th century was made locally. The present pews were made in 1732. The organ is from 1965 but uses the facade of the earlier organ, made in 1861.

It is the type species of the genus Sicarius. Its correct name has been the source of confusion. It has often been known by the synonym Sicarius terrosus, a name which has also often been used incorrectly for other species.  Description and behavior  It can grow between 12 and 20 mm in length, lives in desert areas of northern and central Chile and has nocturnal habits, building shelters under rocks on sandy substrate in northern Chile, it is extremely common in urban regions with a lot of household waste. Sicarius spiders have already been observed feeding on insects, scorpions and other spiders, but recently, a 20 mm long specimen of S. thomisoides was recorded in Mami√±a, in northern Chile, preying on a 28 mm gecko (Phyllodactylus gerrhopygus) long. The spider was reported feeding on the fluids of the lizard's digested body, the lizard's skin was damaged and dark, indicating possible dermonecrotic effects, since enzymes of hemolytic and dermonecrotic activity were reported in Sicarius, with an action similar to that of Loxosceles. Taxonomy There has been confusion over the correct name for this species. In 1847, Charles Athanase Walckenaer published the name Sicarius thomisoides, also erecting the genus Sicarius. He based the name on illustrations he had seen in a work still in preparation and so not then published, namely a section on spiders by Hercule Nicolet in the multivolume Historia f√≠sica y pol√≠tica de Chile. It was finally published in 1849. Nicolet called the species Thomisoides terrosus. In his earlier publication, Walckenaer had argued that Thomisoides was inappropriate as a genus name, as the species was not related to Thomisus, a crab spider. Although Walckenaer's name has priority, Thomisoides terrosus was used in subsequent descriptions, and even when the generic name Thomisoides was abandoned in favour of Sicarius, the specific name terrosus continued to be employed (e.g. in the World Spider Catalog in 2015). F.O. Pickard-Cambridge had argued in 1899 that if Walckenaer's Sicarius is used as the generic name, his specific name should be too. This argument was reinforced in 2017, and is now accepted, so that Sicarius thomisoides is the correct name for the species, which is the type species of the genus. Adding to the confusion, the specific name terrosus \\"was very seldom used in the literature to refer to the correct Chilean species\\", so that descriptions under this name may actually refer to species such as Sicarius levii.

He served as Dean of the UTMB Medical School and as President of the Texas Medical Association. Many of his anatomical drawings and paintings are preserved and displayed at the Blocker History of Medicine collection at UTMB Moody Medical Library. Auchendinny House, Midlothian, Scotland  Early life  William Keiller was born in Auchendinny House, Lasswade, Scotland, on 4 July 1861. He was the son of Mathewson Keiller (1805‚Äì1876) and Hannah Napier, who married in Montrose in 1865. He went to school at Montrose Academy (aged 10‚Äì11) then to Perth Academy (aged 11‚Äì15) before matriculating in Arts at the University of Edinburgh in 1877 at the age of 16 and graduating MA in 1881.  Career in Edinburgh  He then studied at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine, enrolling as a candidate for the Triple Qualification in 1881. He attended classes mainly at Surgeons' Hall, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and between 1887-88 showed an early interest in anatomy acting as part time student demonstrator in anatomy at Surgeons' Hall.TQ Examination schedule; William Keiller, 1888. Archive of Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh In 1888 he qualified in medicine having passed the examination for the Triple Qualification, awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. His first medical post was as assistant medical officer at the Provident Dispensary, which had been opened by Sophia Jex-Blake in 1878 at 73 Grove Street, Edinburgh. In 1885 the Dispensary opened a small number of hospital beds and changed its name to the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children. In addition to his post as assistant medical officer, he held posts as house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and demonstrator in pathology at Edinburgh University under Dr Alexander Bruce. Keiller then became physician for Diseases of Women in the Hospital and Dispensary which later became Bruntsfield Hospital. In July 1890 he was appointed Lecturer in Anatomy at the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. He was chloroformist at the Edinburgh Dental Hospital. In 1890, having passed the necessary examination, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) and was appointed lecturer in anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The following year he responded to an advertisement in the British Medical Journal for a post at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and was appointed as its first Professor of Anatomy.  Professor of Anatomy  Keiller taught anatomy at Galveston for forty years, with a particular interest in neuroanatomy. His initial brief was to set up a curriculum of anatomy teaching ‚Äòafter the Edinburgh method‚Äô and to establish an anatomy museum and laboratory. In his early years he contributed two articles based on his previous clinical experience in Edinburgh. His article on the use of traction forceps in obstetrics described his experience with their use at the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary. The use of such forceps had been popularised in Edinburgh and then throughout Britain by James Young Simpson, Professor of Midwifery in Edinburgh. His experience in Edinburgh as a chloroformist led to an interest in anesthetic techniques and he was an early advocate of spinal anesthesia. Keiller's 1900 paper on the use of cocaine in spinal anaesthesia was published within a year of the description of the first planned operation under spinal anesthesia by August Bier in Germany.Bier A: Versuche uber Cocainisirung des Ruckenmarkes. (Experiments on the cocainization of the spinal cord) Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Chirurgie 1899; 51:361-9 Keiller also delivered a paper entitled \\"Cocaine Anaesthesia by Lumbar Puncture\\" in 1900. When he arrived, the facilities were modest and he set out to create a fully equipped anatomy department and to establish an anatomy museum, which could be used for teaching and which was based on the Edinburgh model. Within a few years he had expanded anatomy teaching so that students dissected the entire human body, attended daily lectures and created large scale anatomical drawings and wet specimen preparations. He also introduced to Galveston the use of formalin for the preservation of bodies. He was a gifted draftsman and used this skill to produce blackboard drawings during his lectures. A more permanent legacy is his collection of colored anatomical sketches and colored paintings, some of which were life scale. Around two hundred of these drawings came under the possession of Truman G. Blocker, Jr. History of Medicine Moody Medical Library collections at UTMB. This collection of his anatomy drawings, colored and clearly labelled gives insights into the teaching of anatomy at the beginning of the twentieth century. It was digitised and became available online. In 1894 he wrote to the editor of the New York Medical Journal claiming that drawings and diagrams were superior to photographs in teaching anatomy. \\"Photographs teach nothing that could not be equally well or better taught by a good diagram . . \\" he wrote, \\"... how often is the very point of most importance in the illustration completely obscured by the photograph.!\\" Keiller was joint author of Textbook of Anatomy (1899), edited by Frederick Gerrish, to which he contributed chapters on the nervous system and sensory organs. This became available online. In 1927 he published a textbook, Nerve Tracts of the Brain and Cord, which received very favourable reviews and proved popular. Between 1922 and 1926 he served as Dean of the School of Medicine at UTMB.  Awards and honors  Keiller was President of the Texas State Medical Association (1926), President of the Texas Neurological Society (1931) and a member of the Galveston County Medical Society, the American Medical Association, and the International Association of Medical Museums. The Keiller building at UTMB is named for him. In 1916 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Texas Surgical Society. He has been described as \\"the leading American anatomist of his day\\".  Personal life and death  On 6 March 1883, he married Eliza Henrietta McLaughlin (1857‚Äì1894). They had two daughters, Mabel Mathewson Keiller (1884‚Äì1972), and Violet Hannah Keiller (1887‚Äì1958), Violet was born in Edinburgh, graduated from UTMB in 1914 and worked as pathologist at UTMB and at Houston. The year after the death of his first wife he married Jane Julia McLaughlin (1860‚Äì1935) on 27 June 1895. They had two more children, Eliza Margaret (1896‚Äì1966) and Thomas Mitchell (1898‚Äì1981). From 1922 until his death he lived at 1409 Market St, Galveston. William Keiller died in Galveston on 22 February 1931.

It was designed by Agabiti & Millane: Bolton Millane or Virgil Cizzio and built from 1936 to 1937 by H. A. Taylor. It is also known as Magna Theatre (1950s). The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 December 2003.  History  =Indigenous history= Although it was commonly said that Aboriginal people were not around the Oberon district much before Europeans settled there, and only in the summer, a strong Aboriginal presence in the region is evidenced by the numerous relics that have been and continue to be found in the district. Moreover the recorded observations of early explorers suggest that district was inhabited for much, if not all the year. The Gundungurra Land Council refers to the area in the catchment of the Fish and Campbells Rivers as Burra Burra. Both Gundungurra and Wiradjuri peoples were living in the area when Europeans began to move in during the 1830s. A local history describes a tense history of contact eventually leading to confrontations and warfare in the northern part of the shire at least. There are also stories of a variety of intercultural relationships. There are few residents now who claim Aboriginal descent.Gemmell-Smith, 2003, 6-19 =European history= When George Evans crossed the Blue Mountains in 1813, he was impressed with the pastoral potential of the Central Tablelands: \\"I am more pleased with the country every day. It is a great extent of Grazing land. . . And well watered by running streams in almost every Valley\\".HO & DUAP, 1996, 90 Early settlers from the plains began to bring their stock to the lush green high country during times of drought, and by the 1820s the Oberon area was attracting permanent settlers with grants of land being taken up around the Fish and Campbells Rivers. There was another boost in population when gold was discovered and a subsequent history of mining also for silver, copper and gemstones in the area. Oberon was known as Bullock Flat by early pioneers but when the village was declared in 1863 it was renamed Oberon (after Shakespeare's King of the Fairies). Native hardwood timbers were harvested from the 1930s and replantings with pine have enabled the locality's timber industry to prosper. The establishment of a rail link for the transport of timber also aided the industrial development of the region. Meanwhile, the eastern side of the shire encompasses national park land including Jenolan Caves and Kanangra-Boyd National Park, which are included in the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. =Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall= The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall was built in 1936-1937 by the local Oberon Catholic Church on land donated by the Gilmore family, a prominent local pioneer family. Malachi Gilmore (-1921) immigrated from Ireland when he was 38 years old. His brother, Michael Gilmore, had a property near Oberon and Malachi was a frequent visitor who helped run the property after his brother's death, although it appears he never actually lived in Oberon. He did buy a large block of land in the centre of town. He died in Redfern in 1921 aged 77. In 1936 his descendants subdivided his land and gave a large town allotment to the Catholic Church for the purpose of building a community hall.DP 17887, registered 1 October 1936 Construction of the hall was organised by Rev Dr Gummer and funded by money raised by the local community. The architect was Bolton Millane or Virgil Cizzio of Agabiti & Millane, a Sydney architectural firm known for their work for the Catholic Church. The builder was H. A. Taylor, also of Sydney. Curiously, the hall was built in reverse to the architect's plans. Construction began in August 1936 and was completed in 1937. Local red bricks from the Bathurst Brick Company were used to build the hall. The building was designed as both a community hall and cinema with a capacity to seat 500 people. It was officially opened on 22 February 1937. The first lessee was probably Les Anstiss, who showed movies on Wednesday and Saturday nights. The business was later taken over by Herb David, a local film collector who also took a travelling movie show to Rockley. Movies continued to be shown until the 1970s. From 1937 to 1977, the hall was also the venue for numerous local balls, dances, civic receptions and amateur theatricals, thus playing a central role in the social and cultural life of the town. Local historian Philippa Gemmell-Smith, who was commissioned in 2002 by Oberon Council to write a thematic history of the area, states, \\"I am impressed by the enormous significance the building had in the social life of Oberon. The local people were extremely isolated by poor roads and poverty until the 1950s and the social life of the town revolved around this building\\".Gemmell-Smith, 2003 In 1964 the Catholic Church offered the hall to the Oberon Shire Council, which declined the offer. The next year, long-term lessee Herb David bought the hall and renamed it the Magna Theatre. Following the death of Herb David, Oberon Shire Council again declined to buy the hall. In 1985 the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall was purchased by Betta Wool which uses the hall as a storage site for wool and leases the front, foyer section to an arts and crafts shop. In 1987 the facade was restored, attracting a \\"Heritage and Conservation Award\\" on 7 April 1987, \\"Presented to Betta Wool Handlers by R. J. Clough, local member for Bathurst\\" (according to the framed certificate hanging in the office). A Flickerfest Short Film Festival was held on the premises in 2001. The Oberon Council's Community Based Heritage Study named the Malachi Gilmore Hall as one of the two best-known buildings in the district.Oberon Council, 2003, 8 At the time of the opening of the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall a description of the Hall was reported as follows:  Description  The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall occupies a prominent position in the main street of Oberon. Its asymmetrical fa√ßade is a striking Inter-war Art Deco addition to the streetscape of Oberon Street and the town generally. The fa√ßade is rendered concrete with a complex massing of curving and rectangular shapes presenting a stepped skyline to the street. The emphasis is generally horizontal except for a central portion with a vertical pier rising to a height of nearly 14 metres. The metal-framed windows create a grid-like pattern and are stepped in size and proportion to match the stepped fa√ßade. Glass bricks form a large curved wall. The building's name is rendered in stylized lettering on the fa√ßade. The interior of the fa√ßade section of the building is largely intact and contains a foyer with fireplace, gallery, cloak rooms, bio-box and rewinding rooms at the front. In the main hall the walls are decorated with plasterwork, with some original Morene Art stucco work. The flooring of the foyer and main hall is West Australian jarrah hardwood. Under the main hall is another floor with slab concrete flooring supporting \\"supper rooms\\" and opening at ground level onto the large parking area at the rear of the property. The foyer is approximately 65 square metres (700 sq ft) and the hall has 279 square metres (3000 sq ft) of dancing space. Curiously, the hall was built in reverse of the architect's plans. Some major, although not structural changes were made during the 1980s, disconnecting the fa√ßade from the main hall section of the building. A stud wall now blocks the view that was formerly available from an upstairs viewing area onto the main hall (this vewing area has been converted in part to an office and in part left as open space). Similarly a stud wall blocks the view that was formerly available from the mezzanine level projection room into the main hall. At the time of renovation two new bathrooms were built in the fa√ßade section. A section of the stage in the main hall section was also cut out to make room for an elevator to convey goods from the rear parking area. Thorne, Tod and Cork point out that one of the building's eccentricities is that \\"the auditorium does not match the fa√ßade in any way. The former is a rather plain country hall with a stage, proscenium, stalls and small gallery\\" (1996, 302). According to Scott Robinson of the NSW Art Deco Society, \\"The Malchi Gilmore Hall is a most unusual combination of a diminiative (sic) Modern \\"picture palace\\" front (with its vertical fin and roof) and Modern Movement rectiliniarity of the stepped massing of the building behind the front\\" (quoted in the Heritage Inventory nomination form submitted by the Friends of the Malachi Gilmore Hall, 2001). Ross Thorne's 1983 \\"Theatres/Cinemas in NSW\\" states that the exterior of the hall is \\"unique in a kind of west-coast USA 1930s design style with a vague Frank Lloyd Wright influence produced by the feeling of horizontality (in parts). It also has a very strong vertical element at the front, and glass bricks in the manner of Depression Modern\\". Thorne, Tod and Cork's \\"Movie Theatre Heritage Register\\" states, \\"there is nothing quite like it elsewhere in New South Wales. Even by today's standards, the building is unusual and futuristic\\" (1996, 302). The architectural significance of the hall has been widely recognised and is reflected in the large number of heritage listings: Oberon Shire Council LEP, RAIA Register of Twentieth Century Buildings, the Register of the National Trust of Australia (NSW), the Register of the Art Deco Society, and Ross Thorne's Movie Theatre Heritage Register. = Condition = As at 16 June 2003, following restoration of the fa√ßade in 1987, the exterior is in good condition. During this restoration the original glass bricks were replaced with new glass bricks. Internally, the building has been slightly modified for use as a wool store, but remains intact and in good condition. The site is unlikely to display archaeological potential relating to former uses or occupation as it was the first building on the site and occupies most of the site. = Modifications and dates = The building was completed in 1937. The fa√ßade was restored in 1987. At some stage the original supper room and kitchen were converted into a stage and lower section. In 1985, following its purchase for use as a wool store, internal walls were constructed that divided the foyer from the main hall and also divided the balcony section from the main hall. A large hole was made in the stage to allow wool bales to be lowered into the section below, and two internal toilets were installed. = Further information = Lot 6 DP 17887  Heritage listing  As at 12 February 2009, the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall was of state significance as an outstanding example of Interwar Art Deco architecture in regional New South Wales. Designed by the Sydney office of Agabiti & Millane and completed in 1937, the facade features curved walls and rooflines, geometric windows, glass bricks, an asymmetrical, stepped skyline and other 1930s \\"picture palace\\" details. Built on land donated to the Catholic Church by a pioneering settler family, with funds raised by the congregation, it served as a community centre for the entire Oberon community between 1937 and 1977. The elaborate facade contrasts with the large \\"plain country hall\\" behind, which has low architectural significance but high social significance as an historic venue for numerous local balls, dances, civic receptions and amateur theatricals for 40 years. Situated in a prominent location in the main street of Oberon, the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is a well-known local landmark and makes an important contribution to the streetscape. Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of state significance as an outstanding example of Interwar Art Deco architecture in regional New South Wales. Built on land donated to the Catholic Church by Malachi Gilmmore's pioneering settler family, with funds raised by the congregation, it served as a community centre for the entire Oberon community between 1937 and 1977. As a venue for numerous local balls, dances, civic receptions and amateur theatricals for 40 years, it played a central role in the social and cultural life of Oberon. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of high local significance for its associations with the following people of note: GILMORE FAMILY: prominent early settlers in Oberon and benefactors of the Catholic Church. MILLANE AND AGABITI: Bolton Millane was the architect for the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Church. Millane and Agabiti were a Sydney design and architectural firm that specialised in church work, especially for the Catholic Church. Millane was a registered architect from 1924-1969 and Hamlet Agabiti, a designer of ecclesiastical interiors (altars, baldachinos etc). Little is known of the firm or the individual partners. Another known example of their work is the chapel at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Convent, Kensington, (1937). HERB DAVID: local cinema operator and long- term lessee and later owner of the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of state significance as an outstanding example of Interwar Art Deco architecture in regional New South Wales. Designed by Bolton Millane and completed in 1937, the hall features curved walls and rooflines, geometric windows, glass bricks, an asymmetrical, stepped fa√ßade and other 1930s \\"picture palace\\" details. The architectural significance of the hall has been widely recognised in heritage listings such as the Oberon Shire Council LEP, RAIA Register of Twentieth Century Buildings, the Register of the National Trust of Australia (NSW), the Register of the Art Deco Society, and Ross Thorne's Movie Theatre Heritage Register, where it is variously described as \\"unique\\", \\"unusual\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"futuristic\\". Situated in a prominent location in the main street of Oberon, the hall is a well-known local landmark and makes a important contribution to the streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of high local significance as the venue for numerous local balls, dances, civic receptions and amateur theatricals, thus playing a central role in the social and cultural life of the town for 40 years between 1937 and 1977. The significance of the hall to the town is also demonstrated by its listing on the Oberon Shire Council LEP, the award-winning conservation works to its fa√ßade in 1987, and the formation of the Friends of the Malachi Gilmore Hall, a local community group who wish to return the hall to community uses. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall has some research significance in relation to the expression of Art Deco style in regional NSW including the typical use of rendered bricks, glass bricks, metal railings, ornate interior plaster and stucco work. The site is unlikely to display archaeological potential relating to former uses or occupation as it was the first building on the site and occupies most of the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of state significance as a rare and highly unusual example of the Interwar Art Deco style. It makes a important contribution to the history of the Art Deco movement in New South Wales. Following restoration of the fa√ßade in 1987, the building is intact, both internally and externally. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is of high local significance as an example of a community hall and cinema, many of which built in the early-to-mid twentieth century throughout Sydney and regional New South Wales. The hall interior is typical of country halls. Though representative as a building type, the Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall is a highly unusual example because of the exuberance of the architectural detailing of its facade.

It was designed by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office and built from 1906 to 1959 by the Department of Public Works. The property is owned by the Department of Health. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Morisset Hospital is named after soldier James Morisset (1780-1852), the second commandant of the penal colony at Norfolk Island. On 25 August 1900, the government proclaimed 1300 acres on the shores of Lake Macquarie as reserved for an Asylum for the Insane. Approval for construction of the Morriset Hospital was provided by the Insanity Act in 1901.Suters et al, 1993 Clearing and construction for the hospital commenced in 1906, with a staff of three male attendants and six patients living side by side in tents. The first structure completed was a jetty, and then a dam, and then the first temporary ward. Building material was transported across the lake by barge. In 1907, the first manager, George Edwards was appointed. He supervised clearing the land and preparing the site. Arthur John Wilson was transferred from Kenmore Mental Hospital in Goulburn to supervise construction of roadways to enable access for building, including ‚ÄúThe Avenue‚Äù, now the main road leading to the township of Morisset. Construction of Ward 1 and the Recreation Hall commenced in 1908. The first patients arrived on 9 May 1909, and Ward 1 opened on 6 September. There were 78 male patients at that time. Construction of further buildings was well underway. By 1910, there were 157 male patients. Temporary calico dormitories were erected. These buildings consisted of a wooden frame, calico side panels, wooden floors and a canvas fly over the whole building. The manager's residence was constructed. The cricket oval, poultry yards and gardens were completed in 1911. The hospital had 243 male patients in 1912 (mostly housed in the calico wards), rising to 288 in 1913 and 375 in 1914. The first medical officer, Dr Samson, commenced duty in 1912, replacing a Gosford doctor visiting once a week. The building programme was largely suspended during World War I, although the hospital fishing fleet was assembled and the main store completed in 1916. By 1918, the population had reached 484 male patients, 93 in excess of the accommodation. By 1920, although a new ward had opened, the population had risen to 512 men, and overcrowding was very bad. In 1930, land was set aside for the establishment of a Hospital for the Criminally Insane, the first prison specifically set up for the criminally insane. It commenced operation in 1933, by which time 672 men were at Morriset. The first female patients and nursing staff arrived in March 1934. New Male Refractory wards were opened in March 1938. World War II resulted in another halt to construction work due to a lack of funds. A serious drought in 1939 resulted in an acute water shortage at Morriset, requiring the construction of an emergency service from Pourmalong Creek. The chapel was opened and dedicated in August 1957, and the dairy opened in July 1962. By 1963, there was a patient population of 1490. In 1965, the integration of male and female wards commenced. The number of admissions decreased and there was a rise in the discharge rate, resulting in a decrease in pressure on hospital beds. Large wards began to reduce the number of beds. By 1970, patient numbers were declining due to more patients being eligible for disability pensions, more effective medications, treatment programs, and a change in community attitudes. Early 1970s, the \\"boys\\" from Peat & Milson Islands started being transferred to Morisset. Patient work gangs ceased operation in 1974. In 1985, the hospital was divided into two distinct and separate entities ‚Äì Psychiatric Services and Development Disability. Wards 16, 18, 19 and 20 closed. In 1991, Ward 21 (‚ÄúThe Crim‚Äù) was closed, and Wards 19 and 20 were demolished. In 1992, Ward 9 closed, Ward 11 patients moved into the old doctors and paramedical staff cottages, and a new state of the art forensic psychiatry security unit was built on the site of the demolished wards 19 and 20. The new Morriset Multipurpose Centre opened in November 2004.  Description  Chapel The overall Morriset Hospital site comprises almost 100 historic buildings on a 1,244 hectare site. It is approximately 3km south-east of the township of Morisset south of Duck Hole Creek and facing east.Treeology P/L, 2014, 6 The developed hospital grounds are in two quite distinct sections, being: the large area of the general Hospital for the Insane, beautifully land-scaped & sloping down to the waters of the lake on the east; and the much smaller area of the Hospital for the Criminally Insane, isolated in a cleared patch of bushland, and walled like a medieval city. The Hospital farms are located north of Duck Hole Creek. The site extends as far west as the railway line, east to Charles Avenue, Kendall Grange, north to Fishery Point Road and approximately half a kilometer south of the Forensic Psychiatry Wards (which are south-west of the main hospital campus, inside a 6m high walled enclosureNSW PWD, 1988, 2on the western side of Lake Macquarie, which forms a natural (eastern) boundary. The eastern side of the grounds is bounded by the Lake Macquarie State Recreation Area, managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The eastern side adjoins the Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council. The Hospital Precinct comprises: * MS-12 Wards 5 & 6 * MS-13 Ward 9, Clinical Department * MS-14 Ward 10 * MS-15 The Chapel * MS-16 Recreation Hall, 1909 * MS-17 The Main Store * MS-19 Residence no.1 * MS-20 Ward 17, General Psychiatry * MS-23 Ward 12 * MS-24 Residence no.3 * MS-26 Cottage Row Residence no.s 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 The site is close to the suburban areas of the Morisset peninsula, with a densely vegetated zone surrounding the hospital of either natural or regenerated bushland. Remnant native vegetation communities are still present. On the lake fring, Casuarina sp. dominate the littoral (shore) zone. Forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) and rough-barked apple gum (Angophora floribunda) plant communities are found with existing trees likely to pre-date the site's 1909 development. Scribbly gum and bloodwood (E.haemostoma) forest dominate the sandstone-based soil zones on higher ground. The site has been extensively planted over many years with a diversity of species still present. Remnants of previous gardens that would have been shaped and planted with site development occur. There are approximately 80 different species of trees and palms on the site, including remnant (native) species. The oldest planted trees and palms present are about the Recreation Hall and Chapel grounds, the zone between Jacaranda Avenue and Grevillea Road, along Palm Way and on the north eastern side of Waratah Way. Some remnant trees on the northern side of the Recreation Hall and southern end of Eucalyptus Drive are likely to predate development of the site, based on trunk diameters. The site has a diverse population of mature trees, in areas about buildings occupied by clients, used by staff, open space areas frequently used by visitors to the grounds and along roadways and pedestrian zones. A total of 745 trees have been assessed. A cemetery formerly associated with the Hospital is off Nentoura Road, Morisset on an isolated bushland site. Its Anglican section has a lych gate and the oldest headstone is dated 1911. The cemetery has been managed by Lake Macquarie City Council since 1974. Older sections of the cemetery are set aside in General, Catholic, Anglican, and Uniting (Presbyterian/Methodist) rows. There are many unmarked graves of patients from the Morisset Hospital buried throughout the eastern side of the cemetery.http://www.lakemac.com.au/services/cemeteries/morisset This cemetery has a Memorial Wall, made of grey granite with a large black granite memorial plaque with a dedication to the former Morisset Hospital patients who are buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery. It also has spaces available for filling on either side for families wishing to memorialise their relatives individually.http://www.lakemac.com.au/downloads/A13C7DCC8E859A8D8C89781612A77453BA13919B.pdf  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Morisset Hospital Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The street runs between Westbourne Bridge in the north and the junction of Westbourne Crescent and Sussex Gardens in the south and was developed between 1839 and the late 1850s. It has been described as the \\"most spacious and dignified avenue\\" in Bayswater and \\"unrivalled in its class in London or even Great Britain\\". The street is not to be confused with Westbourne Terrace Road which runs north from Westbourne Bridge into Little Venice, and a large number of other Westbourne streets in the area. History Westbourne Terrace is named after the local River Westbourne, a tributary of the River Thames, and is one of a large number of Westbourne streets in the area. In 1868, Cusack Roney wrote in Rambles on Railways, that there were 19 \\"Westbourne\\" streets listed in the London Postal Guide. The street was developed between 1839 and the late 1850s. Architects working in the area included Matthew Wyatt, George Ledwell Taylor, and Thomas Marsh Nelson who was particularly active in Westbourne Terrace in the 1840s on behalf of the builder William Kingdom. Buildings Westbourne Terrace is a long tree-lined avenue, almost wholly made up of four storey stucco-fronted terraced houses divided by the cross streets, Bishop's Bridge Road, Cleveland Terrace (formerly James Street), Chilworth Street, and Craven Road. The street has more modern buildings north of Bishop's Bridge Road, including the Enterprise House at numbers 167-169, which is occupied by Network Rail. Westbourne Terrace Mews runs north from Cleveland Terrace but does not join Westbourne Terrace. Each terrace has its own private access road at the front. According to Nikolaus Pevsner, the architecture of Westbourne Terrace shows the transition from the classical style to the Italianate. Originally occupied by wealthy merchants, admirals, governors, and statesmen, the terrace has been home to many renowned people.

It is a planned amalgamation of two existing institutes of technology in the region - Waterford IT and IT Carlow. Waterford is the only Irish city which does not have a university. Background Waterford Institute of Technology opened in 1970 as a Regional Technical College and adopted its present name on May 7, 1997. It first made an unsuccessful application to become a university in 2006, under the Universities Act 1997. Institute of Technology, Carlow was founded in 1960. The proposal is supported by the southern region's, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy. Timeline IT Carlow has been planning a joint application with Waterford IT for the formation of a technological university for the south east region since the mid-2010s. A vision document, \\"Technological University for the South East\\" (TUSE) was published in 2015, and a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2017. In May 2018, a spokesperson for the Higher Education Authority (HEA) expressed a belief that a formal application will be made in Autumn 2018, with an approval expected in spring 2019. At the launch of TU Dublin in July 2018, the Taoiseach expressed regret that this TUSE bid had not progressed sufficiently following the \\"Technological Universities Act 2018\\". The TUSE bid was due to be submitted in September 2018. In November 2018 Dr. Patricia Mulcahy, President of IT Carlow described the goal for TUSE as \\"a leading European technological university recognised for regional connectedness and global impact\\".

The group was led by Sergio Armend√°riz Diaz (born 1980) and Juan Contreras Jurado. Three other members of the group were sentenced in 2005: Carlos Barriento Vidales, Gerardo Fern√°ndez Molina and Romel Omar Ceniceros Garcia. All of the members were convicted of eight murders, but their victim count is suspected to be between 10 and 14. According to the detainees themselves, they worked as hitmen for Abdul Latif Sharif, a convicted murderer suspected of homicides in the city, but this could not be verified.  Crimes  On April 7, 1996, the torso of a woman was found in a vacant lot on the outskirts of the city, in a property called Lomas de Poleo, as well as several bones belonging to other victims. The torso belonged to Rosario Garc√≠a Leal, a 17-year-old employee at a Philips store who disappeared on December 7, 1995; she allegedly died of a craniecephalic contusion, while still alive she was raped and tortured. There were cuts on her body from a sharp weapon and sperm was found in her vagina. On the victim's clothes the letter \\"R\\" was found had been marked through rips, and a business card of a man named \\"Hector\\" was also found. The exact day of Garc√≠a's death is not known, but it is believed to have been sometime around February 1996. Her murder was atypical to other related cases because they had kept her alive for a relatively long time, which had not happened in other cases. After their arrests, the five men confessed to having murdered eight women, although they later recanted and claimed to have been tortured by the police to plead guilty. Erika Fierro, a woman member of the gang who came to be related to the killings but could not be held accountable, would declare that Armend√°riz once told her that he wanted her to present a friend of hers, to whom she only referred to as \\"Mausy\\":  Apprehension  On April 8, 1996, a member of a local gang called \\"Los Rebeldes\\", H√©ctor Olivares Villalba, was arrested. He eventually confessed to having participated in the kidnapping of Garc√≠a on December 7, 1995, and her subsequent murder by several members of the gang, including Armend√°riz, nicknamed \\"El Diablo\\". That same year, 10 members of the gang were arrested, among them Carlos Hern√°ndez Molina Mariscal, H√©ctor Olivares Villalba, Romel Omar Garcia Ceniceros, Erika Fierro and Fernando Gremes Aguirre. The latter were later released because there was no evidence of their responsibility in the kidnappings, rapes and murders.

A recognized expert on the art of the Renaissance, he was lauded for his evaluation of claims of authenticity for works from that period, correctly debunking Wilhelm von Bode's assertion that a bust of Flora was sculpted by Leonardo da Vinci. During World War I, Konody became interested in the representation of war in the arts, and directed an effort to commemorate Canadian participation in that war. Early life Konody was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1872. He received his education in Vienna,Who's Who in the World, 1912 (1912), p. 668. and in 1889 emigrated to the United Kingdom, settling in London.Sophie Bowness, Clive Phillpot, Britain at the Venice Biennale, 1895-1995 (1995), p. 33. Career =Early writing and opinions= Konody was the art critic for The Daily Mail and The Observer, writing for the latter until his death.\\"A Paul Konody Memorial\\", The Observer (October 7, 1934), p. 26. He was also the editor of The Artist from 1900 to 1902, and wrote numerous articles for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and the Dictionary of National Biography. He was a master of the Junior Art Worker's Guild from 1903 to 1904. He wrote volumes on Walter Crane and Diego Vel√°zquez in 1902 and 1903, respectively, and described the works of Filippino Lippi for a 1905 volume published by the Newnes's Art Library,\\"Literary Notes\\", New-York Tribune (12 June 1905), p. 10. writing of Lippi that \\"some of his qualities show him to be the most subtle psychologist of his time, the most modern in spirit of all the artists of the Renaissance\\".Jennie Irene Mix, \\"Great Pictures and Their Painters\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post (11 September 1910), p. 32. In 1908, Konody published a volume on Raphael for the a series of \\"The Masterpieces in Color\\" for the publishing company of Frederick A. Stokes.\\"Fiction and Art for January\\", The New York Times (11 January 1908), p. 22. In 1910, Konody notably dismissed some of the paintings of Vincent van Gogh as \\"merely the ravings of a maniac\\". That same year, Konody disputed the claims of German art historian Wilhelm von Bode that a bust of Flora acquired by Bode's Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin was an original work of Leonardo da Vinci. Konody \\"waged war on Dr. Bode's claims through the columns of the London Daily Mail\\".\\"Showing Swindlers in the World of Art Never Lack Victims\\", New York Herald (22 June 1919), p. 72. Konody's evaluation was proven correct, as it was later exposed that the sculpture was likely created by English sculptor Richard Cockle Lucas, centuries after the time of Leonardo. Konody's 1911 book, The Louvre, with Maurice W. Brockwell, was well-reviewed in The Guardian, which found it to be \\"a large and substantial volume\\" with \\"scholarly and well balanced\\" accounts of the painters.\\"New Books\\", The Guardian (9 January 1911), p. 5. =Response to Futurism and evaluation of the Isleworth Mona Lisa= Konody was not so well-disposed towards certain artistic trends of his own time, joining other critics in dismissing Post- Impressionism and Futurism, describing some works of Cubism as \\"unintelligible\\", and referring to a 1912 showing of Futurist works as a \\"nightmare exhibition\\".Luca Somigli, Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915 (2003), p. 179. He similarly objected to a growing trend inspired by Post-impressionism of decorating children's nursery rooms with colorful designs, which he suggested would \\"delight the infant who can scribble on the wall in perfect harmony with the design\\", but which adults would find distracting, and eventually boring.Victoria Rosner, Modernism and the Architecture of Private Life (2005), p. 18. In 1914, Konody was one of a handful of critics who received \\"BLESSes\\" from the Vorticist literary magazine, Blast, asserted to be for supporting the magazine and other recent developments in art.Alan Munton, \\"Lewis and Cultural Criticism\\", in Andrzej Gasiorek and Nathan Waddell, eds., Wyndham Lewis: A Critical Guide (2015), p. 70. The honor was ironic, given that Konody, along with J. C. Squire, were noted to have been more hostile than favorable to Blast,Nathan Waddell, Modernist Nowheres: Politics and Utopia in Early Modernist Writing, 1900-1920 (2012), p. 132. with Konody describing it as \\"a strange mixture of seriousness and facetiousness, common sense and absurdity\\".Michael Shallcross, Rethinking G.K. Chesterton and Literary Modernism (2017), p. 11. Konody was, however, impressed with the Futurist wartime painting, The First Searchlights at Charing Cross by Christopher R. W. Nevinson.G√ºnter Berghaus, Handbook of International Futurism (2018), p. 800. Towards the beginning of 1914, Konody examined the recently rediscovered Isleworth Mona Lisa, and concluded that, unlike Bode's bust of Flora, it was in fact by Leonardo da Vinci.John R. Eyre, The Two Mona Lisas: Which was Giacondo's Picture? (J.M. Ouseley and Son, Ltd., 1923), p. 37-38.Paul George Konody, \\"Another 'Mona Lisa' Found in London?\\", The New York Times (15 February 1914), p. 25. The painting had been proposed by its owner, art collector Hugh Blaker, to have been painted by Leonardo, perhaps prior to the painting of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. Konody wrote that the reception of the painting had been marred by \\"some press agent who sent out the news broadcast, with wrong statements, misquotations, and other blunders galore\\", but nonetheless found that \\"though not altogether from the hand of Leonardo da Vinci himself, it emanates most certainly from his studio and was very largely worked up by the master himself\\". Konody further stated of the painting that \\"[t]he hands, with their careful and somewhat hard drawing and terra cotta coloring, suggest at once the name of Leonardo's pupil, Marco d' Oggionno; whereas the inimitably soft and lovely painting of the head and bust, the exquisite subtlety of the expression, the golden glow of the general coloring, can be due only to Leonardo\\". Konody found the painting to have features \\"far more pleasing and beautiful than in the Louvre version\\". Blaker's father in law, John R. Eyre, wrote in a monograph defending the authenticity of the Isleworth Mona Lisa, \\"when this opinion was endorsed by an art critic of Mr. P. G. Konody's standing, I felt convinced there was at least good ground for investigation\\".John R. Eyre, Monograph on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (1915), Preface. =World War I and interest in the art of wartime= In 1915, Konody \\"was commissioned to make a critical inventory of all the works of art in the national repositories of Constantinople\\", but this project was cancelled due to the escalation of World War I.\\"P. G. Konody; A Personal Tribute\\", The Observer (3 December 1933), p. 17. In 1917, Konody was appointed honorary secretary and art director of a committee to commemorate Canadian participation in that war. For this purpose, he participated in selecting artists to be commissioned to travel to the war zone and to prepare works recording the battles, ranging from etchings and portraits to colossal paintings, with the works later being displayed in venues such as the Anderson Galleries in New York City.Percy F. Godenrath, \\"Canadian War Paintings Unfold an Epic Story\\", The New York Herald (15 July 1919), p. 17.Paul G. Konody, \\"Canada In War To Be Seen On Canvas\\", New York Herald (3 June 1919), p. 13. Years after his death, Konody was praised for being \\"able to get the committee to accept so many radical paintings, for instance those of Paul Nash, Wyndham Lewis and the then unknown David Milne\\",Virginia Lambe, \\"War paintings prove valuable records\\", The Gazette (14 June 1969), p. 52. though it was also asserted that Konody initially \\"ignored Canadian artists in favor of Europeans to memorialize the Canadian effort\\".Tony Atherton, \\"CBC production moving tribute to war's soldiers, artists\\", The Ottawa Citizen (6 November 1996), p. C8. During and after the war, Konody developed a general interest in artwork depicting wartime, publishing a book, On War Memorials in 1919. In 1919, the New York Herald described Konody, then visiting the United States while directing the Canadian War Memorial Exhibition, as \\"[o]ne of the men best qualified to speak\\" on the authenticity of several contested paintings then being disputed which were claimed to have been produced during the Renaissance. For several years later in his life, Konody was honorary secretary of a committee that oversaw the British pavilion at the annual International Art Exhibition in Venice (now the Venice Biennale).\\"Art Exhibition At Venice\\", The Guardian (15 April 1932), p. 5. Personal life and death In October 1901, Konody married watercolor painter Isabel Codrington. The couple had two daughters during the following five years. They lived in London and enjoyed a social scene that featured many artists, poets and writers. They divorced in 1912, and Codrington later married art dealer Gustavus Mayer. One of Konody's daughters, Pauline Konody, had some success as a watercolor painter as well.Louise Morgan Sill, \\"Paris Notes\\", The American Magazine of Art, Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 1929), p. 57-59. Konody was noted to have been a practicing Catholic.\\"British Catholic Writers and Artists\\", The Catholic Advance (14 July 1917), p. 13. Konody died in November 1933, following a lengthy illness and an operation. In October of the following year, the Bethnal Green Museum honored Konody with the establishment of the Paul Konody Memorial Library, to include Konody's substantial collection of \\"more than 2,000 volumes, dealing principally with his special subjects, painting, architecture, sculpture, and the history of art, particularly of the fine arts\\".

It runs west of the Englischer Garten from the Von-der-Tann-Stra√üe in the district of Maxvorstadt, to the north and to the Maria-Josepha-Stra√üe and Mandlstra√üe in the Ensemble Alt-Schwabing.  Description  At K√∂niginstra√üe 5, is the American Consulate General. Due to the security precautions, entry into the K√∂niginstra√üe from the Von-der-Tann- Stra√üe is no longer possible for vehicles. On the estate of today's house number 28, was the Zoologischer Garten Benedikt (private zoological garden) from 1862, then still known as Wiesenstra√üe. In the former Wiesenstra√üe 6 (now also K√∂niginstra√üe) was the homeopathic hospital of Joseph Buchner, homeopathic family doctor at the court of King Maximilian II of Bavaria and honorary professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, for the purpose of \\"free treatment of poor servants, family members and workers\\". Further north, is the ancestral site of the veterinary faculty (still listed with the address Veterin√§rstra√üe 13). Already in Schwabing, with the house number 34, lies the Universit√§ts Reitschule M√ºnchen (university riding school Munich). The headquarters of BayBG Bayerische Beteiligungsgesellschaft is located in K√∂niginstra√üe 23 in a richly structured historically listed Neo- Baroque building. With the historically listed main building containing the Schmuckhof of the Munich Re on K√∂niginstra√üe 107 and the, also historically listed, headquarters of Allianz SE at number 28, K√∂niginstra√üe is the only German street in which two DAX companies have their headquarters. Other renowned financial service providers in the street are the LfA F√∂rderbank Bayern and the Bayerische Beteiligungsgesellschaft (BayBG) The Nanosystems Initiative Munich is also located in the K√∂niginstra√üe, the building emerged from an implementation competition with an urban planning and landscape planning component. The new building was controversial, since the around 1900 Veterinary Clinic of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, including a 1902 -built Art Nouveau building with Jurassic marble staircases with wrought iron Art Nouveau railings, had to be demolished. The building was classified as \\"worthy of a memorial\\" in the assessment of the state building authority of Munich but was not set by the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection on the list of buildings worth protecting. Altogether, 21 buildings are listed on the list of historical monuments in Maxvorstadt and Schwabing on the 1.45 km long road. At the corner of K√∂niginstra√üe - Mary Josepha Stra√üe ‚Äì Mandlstra√üe, begins the protected building ensemble Altschwabing. At K√∂niginstra√üe 85, is an Art Nouveau building built in 1906 by Martin D√ºlfer, which is protected together with the buildings at Ohmstra√üe 13, 15 and 17 as \\"Ensemble Ohmstra√üe\\". In 2016, the K√∂niginstra√üe became a Pilot experiment for a new joint project between BMW and the city of Munich, where street lamps were used as charging stations for electric cars.

Career Eassie was born at Lochee near Dundee in 1805. Little is known of his early life, but he was involved in construction of the East Lancashire Railway in 1840. In 1849 he moved to Gloucestershire and worked on the Gloucester and Dean Forest Railway, securing a contract to supply and install wooden sleepers and to lay iron rails. He subsequently worked on the docks branch of this railway on the west side of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, and on the Vale of Neath Railway in south Wales. Eassie established a factory in Gloucester in 1849, and became one of the city's major employers, employing over 1,000 men, working in shifts.'Gloucester, 1835-1985: Economic development to 1914', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 4, the City of Gloucester, ed. N M Herbert (London, 1988), pp. 170-183. British History Online (accessed 20 July 2018). In delivering contracts, Eassie worked often with Richard Potter of Price & Co, a Gloucester-based timber importer, and in 1851 he set up a steam-powered saw mill on land beside the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal that Price & Co leased from Gloucester Corporation. From this mill, Eassie also supplied other contractors, including those working on rail projects for Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Eassie's work diversified from rail projects into supply of wood for buildings, including greenhouses for a Royal Agricultural Society show in Gloucester in July 1853, and doors, windows and complete buildings for export to Australia to house gold prospectors. This experience in prefabricated buildings led to an 1854 commission to supply huts to house British troops engaged in the Crimean War,The Gloucester hut, by William Eassie, 1855. Great Britain, War Department, Report of a Board of Officers ... on Different Principles and Methods of Hutting Troops (London 1856)Portable wooden barracks for the Crimea, supplied by William Eassie & Co, Gloucester. Illustrated London News, XXV, 716 (9 December 1854), p 57. followed by a similar order from the French government. Shortly after completion of these orders in early 1855, Eassie was approached by Brunel to work on designs for prefabricated buildings to form the Renkioi military hospital near the Dardanelles. The hospital was designed as 16 buildings, each holding 50 patients in two wards, and were shipped direct from Gloucester Docks to Balaklava. After the Crimean War, Eassie's business expanded its engineering capabilities, forging scrap iron to manufacture ship anchors and other components, and developing a piling machine to work at the Millwall Iron Works in London where Brunel's SS Great Eastern was being built. However, Eassie's business got into financial difficulties, and he was forced to restructure the business, giving his sons (William and Peter Boyd Eassie) formal roles in William Eassie & Sons. The company continued to make wooden buildings for UK and overseas customers, later expanding into the supply of wood for the manufacture of railway wagons in an adjacent works in Gloucester. Legacy Eassie died in May 1861, but the company was continued by his sons, becoming a limited company in 1868. In 1875, Eassie & Co was acquired by its neighbour, the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and in 1900 became the Gloucester Joinery Co. Ltd, making shop fronts, shop fittings, staircases, greenhouses and church and school furniture until the mid 1940s. William Eassie Jr became a prominent civil engineer engaged on public health projects, and an advocate of cremation, writing a book Cremation: Its History and Bearings upon Public Health (published in 1875) and serving as honorary secretary of the Cremation Society.

He was the son of the politician and planter Henry Darnall, who was the Proprietary Agent of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, and served for a time as Deputy Governor of the Province. During the Protestant Revolution of 1689, Henry Darnall I's proprietarial army was defeated by the Puritan army of Colonel John Coode, and he was stripped of his numerous colonial offices. After his father's death, Henry Darnall II did not enjoy political power in Maryland, but he remained wealthy thanks to his family's extensive estates. He married twice, fathering many children. His eldest son Henry Darnall III (c1702-c1783) inherited the bulk of what remained of his estates, and one of his grandchildren, Daniel Carroll, would become one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A small portion of Darnall's former property, now called Darnall's Chance, can still be visited today. Early life Henry Darnall's father, Henry Darnall I Henry Darnall II was born in 1682 in Maryland, the son of the wealthy Roman Catholic planter and politician Henry Darnall (1645 ‚Äì 17 June 1711) and his wife Eleanor Hatton Brooke (1642‚Äì1725). During the Protestant Revolution of 1689 Darnall was defeated in battle by the Puritan John Coode, who seized power in the Province and barred Roman Catholics from holding public office. Career Henry Darnall I died in 1711, leaving his eldest son the bulk of his extensive estates. However, being a Roman Catholic, Henry Darnall II could not hold public office in Maryland. Worse, despite being born to great wealth, by the 1720s Henry Darnall II was in financial trouble, and sometime between 1727 and 1730 he had sold much of his property, including 6,700 acres of His Lordship's Kindness. In 1729 Henry Darnall II transferred around 1,500 acres of land to his son, Henry Darnall III, including 300 acres of His Lordship's Kindness.

It was designed by James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon and built during 1880. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Constructed in 1880 and designed by Colonial Architect, James Barnet. Major alterations were completed by his successor, Colonial Architect Walter Liberty Vernon that altered its appearance and further minor alterations were made in 1901-1903. The Post Office is one of an important group of buildings, including the Courthouse, Police Station and churches, which make up the civic heart of Parkes. The building was one of the first \\"grand\\" buildings erected in Parkes and a hub of activity. During its lifetime the building has evolved - catering to the needs of the community. Modifications over time are symbolic of the growth of Parkes - from a pioneering miners' settlement to a contemporary centre in the Central West. For just over 100 years (from 1880-1989) the building was continuously used as a postal and telecommunications facility and an integral part of the Parkes community.Jayet, 2016, 7 On 28 April 1989 the Parkes Shire Council wrote to the Heritage Council requesting that it give consideration to placing a Permanent Conservation Order over Parkes Post Office as Australia Post was constructing a new premises which would render the Post Office obsolete. Australia Post advised that it would make prospective buyers aware of the possibility of the Heritage Council making a Permanent Conservation Order. The site ceased operating as a post office in 1990 following the opening of a new facility in Welcome Street. To protect the original post office it was heritage listed and has been used since as offices. On 6 February 1990 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the Post Office. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The current owners Peter and Maddalena Sgarlata bought the post office in 1990 and have carried out major works including re-slating the roof, a mammoth taks. A facelift to the exterior of the building has recently been completed, with the assistance of the Heritage Council of NSW, Parkes Shire Council, heritage advisers and contractors. Future works will include a disability access ramp, designed to complement the building, lighting of the upstairs balcony, spot-lighting, repairing the clock and minor paint work. = Modifications and dates = 10 December 1999 Heritage Council approval for internal partitions and external signage.  Heritage listing  As at 13 September 2005, Parkes Post Office is considered to be an item of the State's environmental heritage for its historical value and association with the development of Parkes. For its landmark value and its contribution to the streetscape. For its architectural value as an example of the work of the Colonial Architect and the Government Architect.

On the first affair, the newspaper Le Monde identified him on 18 July 2018 in footage as the person who beat up a young protester during the 2018 May Day demonstrations in Paris while impersonating a police officer. Following the publication of the report, the Paris public prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation on 19 July concerning \\"violence, usurpation of the functions of a police officer and using signs reserved for public authorities\\". On 20 July, the √âlys√©e announced that Benalla would be dismissed. On 22 July, Benalla was placed under formal investigation additionally for \\"concealment of a violation of professional secrecy\\" and \\"concealment of the misuse of images from a video surveillance system\\". An accomplice, Vincent Crase, was also placed under formal investigation, as well as three police officers for illegally transmitting video surveillance to Benalla. Parts of the French political class media questioned the √âlys√©e's responsibility in the case for its apparent concealment of the case from the public prosecutor. On the second affair, it was revealed by the French online journal Mediapart at the end of 2018 that Benalla was still in possession of several Diplomatic passports several months after he was fired from the √âlys√©e staff. These passports allowed him to meet several African leaders, including the Chad President, Idriss D√©by. On the third affair, also called The Russian Contracts by the French press, it was revealed again by Mediapart that Benalla had contracted financial ties with two Russian oligarchs during his tenure in the √âlys√©e, including Iskander Makhmudov, a businessman who is said to have ties with the Russian mafia. Both the National Assembly and Senate launched parliamentary inquiries into the affairs, with Interior Minister G√©rard Collomb, Paris police chief Michel Delpuech, Department of Public Order and Traffic (DOPC) director Alain Gibelin, Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe, and √âlys√©e chief of staff Patrick Strzoda among those called to testify. Opposition lawmakers in the National Assembly also announced their intention to submit a motion of no confidence against the government.  Background  Alexandre Benalla in 2013 On 1 May 2018, violence during May Day demonstrations led to significant damage and the arrests of 283 people with 109 taken into custody in Paris, in addition to several injuries. In the group of 1,200 \\"black bloc\\" protesters present that day a group of them destroyed a Mac Donalds, making the police use tear gaz grenades(GLIF4) on the Austerlitz bridge and the Hospital Boulevard. Protesters tried to escape the gaz by getting into the Jardin des Plantes, a few of them were arrested by the police there. At the same time, firefighters opened the gate of the park to free them. Alexandre Benalla (born 8 September 1991 in √âvreux) was reportedly a Socialist Party (PS) activist in Eure, his home department, before offering his services as a bodyguard with the PS, which assigned him to the entourage of Martine Aubry from 2008 to 2012, during which time Aubry was First Secretary of the party. He was later assigned to protect Fran√ßois Hollande as well as, briefly, Arnaud Montebourg. A week into his assignment, he was dismissed after causing a car accident and wanting to flee from the scene. Following his dismissal, he protected artists before joining the security force of Emmanuel Macron, whom Benalla supported, during his presidential campaign. He also worked with PS deputy Pascale Boistard as an unpaid parliamentary assistant in 2012 and had access to some areas of the Palais Bourbon. From 2010 to 2013, Benalla began his career as a reservist gendarme in Eure under then-platoon commander S√©bastien Lecornu, who at the time was a member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and member of the cabinet of then-agriculture minister Bruno Le Maire. Both Lecornu and Le Maire were appointed as ministers in the government assembled after the election of Macron, with Lecornu serving as Secretary of State to the Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition and Le Maire becoming Minister of Economy and Finance. Benalla would later support Le Maire in his bid to lead the party in its 2014 leadership election. On 18 March 2016, Benalla was acquitted following a complaint of violence filed against him in Boulogne-Billancourt in August 2015 by a woman who stated that she was unable to work for more than 8 days as a result. His name appeared numerous times in the 2017 Macron e-mail leaks, dubbed \\"MacronLeaks\\", having procured several non-lethal weapons and riot shields. At the request of the √âlys√©e to aide him in his capacity as a security officer, Benalla was granted a carry license by the Paris police prefecture in October 2017. Karim Achoui, the founder of the Muslim Judicial Defense League with whom Benalla was close, made a previous request for a carry permit that was denied in 2013 in his capacity as a lawyer. During a March 2017 campaign event in Caen, he allegedly pushed a Public S√©nat journalist 50 meters and seized his press badge, which granted close access to Macron and his supporters, without giving any explanation. Benalla seemed to maintain a close relationship with Macron as he was the only member of his cabinet to join a skiing trip at the end of 2017, the only other invitees being his security detail.  Case  On 18 July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that 26-year-old Alexandre Benalla, who served as a security officer to President of France Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 presidential campaign and was later hired as deputy chief of staff to the president under Fran√ßois- Xavier Lauch, was the person who grabbed a young man by the neck during the May Day demonstrations before hitting him several times in a video taken at the Place de la Contrescarpe published on Facebook by a La France Insoumise activist. In the video, Benalla wore a police helmet despite not being a police officer. According to Patrick Strzoda, Benalla asked him for permission to join the police during May Day to observe how a large demonstration was managed. After Strzoda was informed that Benalla had been seen in the videos, Benalla said that he was the individual shown in the videos and Strzoda informed Macron, then in Australia, of the situation. As a result, Benalla was temporarily suspended from 4 to 19 May before being reassigned to the security of events at the √âlys√©e Palace, including the celebration of the victory of the national football team after winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup just days before the publication of the report. However, these claims were questioned by journalists who uncovered photos after the supposed reassignment as part of Macron's entourage. A second video, showing a different angle of the incident, was posted to Twitter on 19 July, showing Benalla grabbing a woman by the neck and dragging her away before leaving towards the other protester. Benalla was accompanied by Vincent Crase, a reservist gendarme hired by La R√©publique En Marche!, who likewise served as a security officer for Macron during the 2017 presidential campaign. Crase, like Benalla, received a 15-day suspension for his conduct in the May Day demonstrations, and remained employed by the party, but unlike Benalla, had ended \\"any collaboration\\" with the office of the presidency. A third individual, Philippe Mizerski, was identified; Mizerski, a member of the Department of Public Order and Traffic (DOPC) in Paris was responsible for supervising Benalla's role as an \\"observer\\" but did not attempt to stop Benalla from assaulting the protesters. On 19 July, the Paris prosecutor announced that it opened a preliminary investigation into incidents of \\"violence, usurpation of the functions of a police officer and using insignia reserved for public authorities\\" concerning Alexandre Benalla. Strzoda was heard as a witness in the investigation the same day. Minister of the Interior G√©rard Collomb also announced that he referred the case to the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN) and that its report would be published publicly, with the IGPN charged with investigating how Benalla and Crase were allowed to participate in overseeing the demonstrations alongside the police. The interior ministry, however, said that no immediate action had been taken against either of the two on 1 May despite having been aware of the incident, and France Inter revealed that Collomb himself was informed about the incident on 2 May before the √âlys√©e took action to suspend Benalla on 3 May. On 20 July, the √âlys√©e announced that it had initiated a dismissal procedure against Benalla following the discovery of \\"new facts\\" of the case related to the suspension of three police officers ‚Äì Laurent Simonin, Maxence Creusat, and Jean-Yves Hunault ‚Äì for apparently passing on surveillance footage to Benella, presumably to help him prepare his defense in what Collomb described as a potentially \\"serious breach of ethics\\". The footage, which was copied by the officers and sent to Benalla the evening the article in Le Monde was published, depicts another angle not shown by the other videos and should theoretically not have existed, given that video footage older than a month was supposed to be automatically erased. After obtaining the footage, Benalla reportedly shared it with Isma√´l Emelien, a political advisor close to Macron, and other √âlys√©e officials viewed this footage as well. The Paris prosecutor office took both Benella and Crase into custody in the morning. A photo obtained of Benalla's official car in a parking lot before it was removed on 19 July showed the vehicle equipped with police devices despite not belonging to the police. Le Monde reported on 20 July that Benalla declared his official residence from 9 July as the Palais de l'Alma at 11 quai Branly, a dependency of the √âlys√©e, with 180,000 euros earmarked to house Benalla, according to a report in L'Express. On 22 July, Benalla was placed under formal investigation additionally for \\"concealment of a violation of professional secrecy\\" and \\"concealment of the misuse of images from a video surveillance system\\", in addition to Crase and the three suspended police officers. The apparent victims in the videos were also identified and asked to testify at a later date. On 23 July, Benalla's lawyers (Laurent-Franck Lienard and Audrey Gadot) issued a statement ‚Äì the first since the beginning of the affair ‚Äì saying that Benalla was \\"stunned by the media and political usage\\" of his actions during the May Day demonstrations and that he \\"took the initiative to lend a hand\\" by helping to \\"control\\" what they described as \\"two particularly virulent individuals\\". Benalla's office at the √âlys√©e was subject to a police raid lasting several hours on 25 July. On 27 July, Lib√©ration published a video showing that Benalla and Crase were involved in another demonstrator's arrest several hours before, in the Jardin des plantes, ordering one of the demonstrators to remove photographs and videos she filmed. On , Benalla was in remand for one week.  Reactions  Members of the majority in the National Assembly were reportedly \\"stunned\\" by the revelations. While many avoided contact with the press and others deflected media inquiries by referring them to the √âlys√©e, some La R√©publique En Marche deputies suggesting the two-week suspension of Benalla was too lenient a response. The revelations came amid the examination in the National Assembly of amendments to the proposed constitutional revision on 19 July, with opposition deputies frequently interrupting the session to demand the creation of an investigative committee into the case. The opposition accused the government of being too lenient in its sanctions against Benalla, and of failing to inform the public prosecutor as required under article 40 of the code of criminal procedure, which stipulates that any public official or civil servant who becomes aware of a crime or misdemeanor must immediately inform the public prosecutor of the incident. The affair eventually forced the government to suspend the examination of the constitutional revision on 22 July. Asked about the case while visiting Dordogne, Emmanuel Macron responded that the Republic was \\"unalterable\\" and told a journalist that \\"I did not come to see you, I came here to see Mr. Mayor.\\" After meeting with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on 20 July, Macron failed to hold a joint press conference, as customary following visits from other heads of state. A video of less than two minutes was sent to media representatives by √âlys√©e spokesman Bruno Roger-Petit on 19 July, prompting criticism regarding the √âlys√©e's communication strategy throughout the affair, and journalists and commentators castigated Macron for failing to explain himself. Macron called a crisis meeting with members of the government on the evening of 22 July. His Twitter account, usually active, fell silent for four days until returning to express solidarity with Greece during the 2018 Attica wildfires. On 24 July, Macron broke his silence on the affair and spoke before lawmakers from his party, stating that he alone bore responsibility and that no members of his cabinet had ever been above the law. Beno√Æt Hamon demanded the resignation of Collomb as interior minister, while Socialist leader Olivier Faure did not exclude the possibility of pressing for him to resign should he fail to give a sufficient explanation. Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, president of the La France Insoumise group in the National Assembly, announced that he intended to attempt to submit a vote of no confidence against the government, and said that the affair was \\"at the level of Watergate\\". Faure also favored a motion of no confidence unless a clear explanation was given, but appeared reluctant to sign on to any motion proposed by M√©lenchon. On 24 July, Christian Jacob of The Republicans (LR) announced that his group, with 103 members, would submit a motion of no confidence (which requires 58 signatures) against the government, though he acknowledged that the vote would not succeed given the government's majority. M√©lenchon's group, with 17 deputies, would not have been able to submit one without the support of other deputies, and FI deputy Alexis Corbi√®re subsequently announced that the group would be prepared to sign a LR-submitted motion. The LR group officially submitted a motion of no confidence on 26 July, followed by the three groups on the left ‚Äì the New Left, La France Insoumise, and Democratic and Republican Left ‚Äì filing a joint motion on 27 July to be debated on 31 July, followed by the right's on 2 August. In his first public interview since the story broke, Benalla said that he made a \\"mistake\\", that he was qualified to carry a weapon as a reservist gendarme, acknowledged tensions with the Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic (GSPR), that he requested housing of only 80 square meters as opposed the 300 reported by L'Express, that he was invited by Simonin to observe the May Day protests, and that he did not request the video surveillance footage of the incident procured by three police officers. SMS messages obtained by Le Monde published on 26 July appeared to indicate that Simonin invited Benalla to the May Day protests. Interviewed on TF1 on 27 July, Benalla insisted he did nothing wrong and that he was acting as a \\"citizen\\" against those he considered to be \\"delinquents\\".  Parliamentary inquiries  = National assembly = On the evening of 19 July, the Law Committee of the National Assembly headed by Ya√´l Braun-Pivet voted to open a parliamentary inquiry into the case lasting one month with the agreement of all group presidents in the National Assembly. Minister of the Interior G√©rard Collomb was to be called to testify before the National Assembly for its inquiry; however, the majority and opposition on 20 July failed to agree on a timetable, with the prior proposing 21 July and the latter 23 July. Eventually, the committee agreed to hear Collomb on 23 July, followed by Paris police chief Michel Delpuech several hours later, though co-rapporteur Guillaume Larriv√© of The Republicans (LR) wished to also interview both Benalla and Crase as well as Christophe Castaner, Alexis Kohler, and Bruno Roger-Petit. The groups disagreed on the publicity of the hearings, with the opposition calling for open hearings. Though the opposition also called for Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe to speak before the National Assembly, he demurred, justifying his absence by citing his scheduled travel to watch the 2018 Tour de France. Though numerous opposition politicians also called for Macron himself to testify, legal experts disagreed on whether such an intervention was permitted under the constitution. In his testimony on 23 July, Collomb blamed the Paris police, saying that he was aware of Benalla's actions but did not alert the judiciary because it was not within his responsibility to do so. He said that he believed that appropriate action (i.e., the two-week suspension of Benalla) had been taken by the √âlys√©e, and also said that he had never discussed the affair with Macron until the day before his testimony, instead saying that Macron was \\"preoccupied by the constitutional reform\\", triggering laughter among the deputies present. Article 40 of the code of criminal procedure, however, makes no hierarchical stipulations, and there exists no such limitation prohibiting officials from reporting crimes not committed by subordinates. According to Delpuech, Laurent Simonin ‚Äì one of the officers suspended for transmitting video surveillance footage to Benalla ‚Äì granted permission to Benalla to observe the demonstration of the police while he himself was unaware until being informed of the incident at a later point, and pinned the transmission of these tapes upon \\"unhealthy cronyism\\". Le Monde identified several contradictions between the testimony of Collomb and Delpuech, namely related to when and how the prior was informed about the incident. Alain Gibelin, director of the DOPC, stated that Benalla had \\"no authorization\\" to be present as an observer at the demonstration, countering previous claims, though later rescinded his initial response indicating that the √âlys√©e had lied about Benalla's suspension and affirmed that he had misheard the dates. Speaking before both chambers on 24 July, Philippe argued that the penalty imposed upon Benalla was appropriate and said that the case did not constitute a state scandal. In the following hearing, chief of staff Strzoda said that he was the individual who made the decision suspend Benalla, with the suspension implemented after Macron was later informed by Kohler while in Australia. He also said that he did not deem the information he received from the IGPN regarding Benalla sufficient to report under article 40, and categorically denied the \\"rumors\\" regarding benefits and privileges reportedly afforded to Benalla; however, he refused to give the amount of his salary or the details of his apartment. Testifying before the Senate on 25 July, Strzoda revealed that Benalla received a full salary for the month of May during which he was suspended, and his days of leave were instead reduced to compensate for this. Kohler echoed earlier answers, saying he believed that Benalla's punishment was sufficient given the facts known at the time and that article 40 did not need to be invoked; he also declined to provide Benalla's salary, details of his housing, carry permit, and other assets. Meanwhile, the atmosphere of the National Assembly's investigation deteriorated as tensions grew between members of the majority and opposition, with the latter alleging that Braun-Pivet attempted to impede its progress and avoid hearing staff at the √âlys√©e, Interior Ministry, La R√©publique En Marche, and police unions, some of which had been already interviewed by the Senate. On 26 July, Larriv√© announced that he suspended his participation in the investigation, considering it a farce faced against the √âlys√©e's apparent efforts to hinder its progress, and the rest of the opposition subsequently quit the inquiry. = Senate = The Law Committee in the Senate, presided over by Philippe Bas, also opened a parliamentary inquiry into the case and interviewed Collomb in a public hearing on 24 July; unlike the assembly's inquiry, the Senate's had six months to investigate. The Senate committee also interviewed Delpuech, √âric Morvan, Alexis Kohler, Patrick Strzoda, Christophe Castaner, and other related individuals in the course of its investigation. On 20 February 2019, the Senate publishes their report about the Benalla affair. The report was considered by the French press and medias as scathing about major dysfunctions of the √âlys√©e Palace and the top of the French state.

It consists of 300-1000 local fighters and led by Abu Suhaib al- Joulani. The group was alleged to receive Israeli assistance of cash, ammunition and other forms of aid. It is described as a \\"local\\" rebel group, \\"non-Islamist\\" and independent of the Southern Front (the main Free Syrian Army group in the area).Seth Frantzman Myths and Misconceptions about Israel and Syrian rebels, Jerusalem Post 6 July 2017 Israel did admit of providing humanitarian aid to Syrians in coordination with the group, including water pumps, medical supplies and cash for fuel. A bakery was built in the group's town with the help of Israel. It allegedly feeds 60k people in rebel-held areas in southwestern Syria. In August 2017, sources told the pro- government/pro-Hezbollah Al Mayadeen that the group was driven out of its stronghold in Jubata al-Khashab after it was accused of collaborating with the Israeli army. On 19 July 2018, violent clashes erupted in Qahtaniyah region after the group rejected the deal of evacuation to Idlib of which the opposition reached with the Syrian government. Syrian activists circulated a voice recording which was sent by a Russian officer to the group, in which he threateningly told them: \\"I warn you if you do not stop shooting at the bulldozer, we will strike at your positions. We agreed with the Israelis. I personally will ride this turquoise and move it. I just spoke with Tel Aviv. I ask you very quickly to stop the shooting\\". A military source told Al Modon that the group's leader, Abu Suhaib, hopes to reach an agreement with the Russian side, similar to the agreement that was concluded by the former leader of the opposition factions in Beit Jann, Ayad Kamal, nicknamed \\"Moro\\", after an Israeli insistence on his survival as a local force that ensures the protection of the borders. On 21 July 2018, Al Quds Al Arabi reported that after negotiation with Israel, the group and two other militias joined to form the Israeli-led Army of the South on the southern border of Syria in the demilitarized zone in order to ensure the removal of Iranian forces. The army is expected to have around 2,000 members. On 22 July 2018, it was reported that the group will remain in the region with an understanding between Russia and Israel to act as a border guard force. Haaretz reported that the group coordinated with Israel the evacuation of 800 White Helmets members.

The town was established in 1830. The reservoir was designed by the Snowy Hydro Electric Authority and built from 1956 to 1958 by the Authority. It is also known as Old Adaminaby and Lake Eucumbene, including relics and movable objects, Eucumbene River, Eucumbene Valley, Old Adaminaby Remains, Old Adaminaby Ruins and Old Adaminaby Drowned Landscape. The property is owned by Snowy Hydro Limited, a statutory corporation owned by the governments of Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. The site was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 June 2008.  History  =Indigenous history= The Ngarigo people occupied the country from Canberra south to just below the NSW/Victorian border, west to Tumbarumba and east to the coast. This group name is that of the plains turkey or Australian bustard, Ardeotis australis, which was common on the Monaro grasslands before the arrival of Europeans. The Ngarigo tribe is made up of a number of individual clans, each of which has rights and responsibilities to a particular part of the country. They are generally named after a local plant, animal or landscape feature which characterises that country and this name plus the suffix -gal identifies the people of that area. The Bemerangal had responsibility for the area which now includes the towns and villages of Adaminaby, Bredbo, Numeralla, Cooma and Jindabyne. The Bemerangal seasonally travelled to and from the coast, through the country of relatives, along traditional travel routes which took them down the Tuross River to Bodalla. The highest mountains were not the country of any specific group but were sites of important secret meetings and ceremonies in which qualified individuals from many neighbouring groups took part. Major camps were established in areas such as Jindabyne and Adaminaby where the groups assembled for summer hunting and gathering and also preparation for the mountain ceremonies. The flooding of the Eucumbene and Jindabyne valleys has hidden many of these campsites. However the large numbers of stone tools which can be seen around the edges of the lakes indicate that many camps were established higher up the valley sides to escape cold air drainage in the valleys. The arrival of Europeans led to the deaths of many of the people through disease and violence and most were gradually forced off their country. Some remained working on properties so that they could try to care for their country, others settled elsewhere or were forced on to Aboriginal reserves.Rod Mason, Indigenous Education and Community Liaison Officer, Kosciuszko National Park =Pastoral Settlement, 1827-1957= Richard Brooks, the first European settler to the Monaro, attracted by the vast areas of open, treeless countryside, brought cattle grazing to the Eucumbene valley and Adaminaby Plain in 1827. By 1831 he had been joined by William Faithfull and Captain Joseph Thompson. The census taken in 1839 by the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Monaro District recorded a handful of settlements around the Eucumbene River, including Charles York and Henry Cosgrove in the vicinity of the area that became the town of Adaminaby. In 1848 York and Cosgrove applied for the Adumindumee run of . George Young Mould, a physician from Edinburgh who had arrived in Sydney in 1840, reached the Monaro district in 1846. In 1853 he took up acreage, establishing his property Boconnoc in the Eucumbene valley. He also established one of the first stores in the earliest township of Old Adaminaby in 1862. In 1866 he built Boconnoc homestead which the Mould family continued to occupy until the Snowy Hydro Electric Authority (the Authority) acquired it in the 1950s. In the second half of the nineteenth century significant pastoral enterprises developed in the Eucumbene valley. With good grazing land available and proximity to the town of Old Adaminaby, the area became well populated by a thriving community living and working on small and large pastoral holdings. Other families in the district who farmed the land for generations were the Herberts, Reynolds, Mackays, Delanys, McPhies and Haslingdens. Some of the earliest properties were established at Old Adaminaby, Eucumbene, Frying Pan and Buckenderra. In the twentieth century others such as Studlands, Wainui, Warwick and Hemsby were built up. Along the Eucumbene River most pastoral holdings were on the eastern side of the river where the country was an open, undulating plain. Some grazing was carried out on the western side but land there was more treed, rocky and rugged. Traditionally, lower pastures were used for winter grazing and stock were taken to higher country for summer grazing on what became known as the \\"snow leases\\". The lease season was from 1 December to 31 May and it was a race to get stock up there to claim the best pastures. The lives of these stockmen, their horses and horsemanship has become one of Australia's most significant legends. Transhumance was an important practice for the pastoralists of the Snowy Mountains. =Development of the town of Old Adaminaby, 1859-1949= Charles York had left the Adaminaby area by 1859, leaving his property in the hands of his three stockmen who lived in a small group of huts on the eastern side of the Eucumbene valley, overlooking the river. In 1858 that there was only one homestead between Cooma and Adaminaby, which was Mr Harnett's Eucumbene. The discovery of gold at nearby Kiandra in 1859 led to a sudden influx of miners travelling the tracks from Cooma or Jindabyne, all of whom passed by the little group of slab and bark buildings on their way to the Eucumbene river crossing. The little settlement became a staging post for travellers during the Kiandra gold rush. In 1860, one of York's stockmen, Joseph Chalker, built the first hotel in the hamlet, directly opposite his original hut. A post office was also established, with two stores following in 1861and 1862 in the hamlet that was initially known as Chalker's. A village was surveyed and noted in the NSW Government Gazette in 1861, when it was renamed Seymour by the surveyor (the maiden name of his wife). That year the first blocks of land were sold, the first purchaser being Joseph Chalker. Sparked by the Kiandra gold rush, the town continued to grow steadily and by 1877 its population of 400 supported three hotels and three stores. In 1886 the name was altered to Adaminaby (to avoid confusion with Seymour in Victoria). Adaminaby became a thriving small town supported by local pastoralists and travellers crossing the high ranges. In 1892 there were five general stores, two butchers, a baker and two blacksmiths. A butter factory was built in 1895 and a stone court house in 1895. By the beginning of the 20th century a picture theatre, five general stores, a racecourse and a showground had been established and there was a ball each Friday night and a dance on Saturday nights. The Kyloe Copper Mine boosted the town's economy and Adaminaby was starting to look as if it would rival Cooma in size. By the 1920s Adaminaby could boast a watchmaker, cafes and tea rooms, a cabinet maker, a local paper, a hospital, a doctor, two schools, a showground and a racecourse. The population during the 1940s was 750, although the town also provided for hundreds of people living in the nearby rural areas. Over original Adaminaby's century of life the town grew but changed little and never had modern amenities. There was no connection to the electricity grid, water supply or sewerage system. People supplied their own light, usually kerosene lamps and candles and a number of businesses had diesel generators. Rain water was collected in tanks and some people had wells. Cans were collected weekly from the outside dunnies. Residents remember it as a close- knit, happy community where the winters were \\"harsh, cold, wet and windy\\" and heavy snowfalls were a regular occurrence. =Roads and bridges= In the mid 1850s a better road system was required for rural areas and local communities agitated for properly made roads and bridges to be built to cross creeks and rivers instead of having to rely on punts and unreliable causeways. Financial constraints resulted in most bridges being simply designed and made of hardwood. For long spans a timber laminated arch had to be built which was difficult construct and costly to maintain. The truss system, which developed from ancient timber roof truss designs, proved to be a good option. The first truss system used in Australia, known as the Old PWD Truss, was soon recognised as having some intrinsic problems, such as sourcing the large timber sections required. In 1879 John A. McDonald, one of the first specialist bridge engineers to join the PWD (Public Works Department), started designing a new timber truss bridge which was easier and less costly to build, cheaper to maintain and with greater carrying capacity. His design became known as the McDonald Truss which differentiated McDonald bridges from later truss designs, such as the Allan Truss and the DeBurgh Truss. According to the NSW Roads & Traffic Authority between 1886 and 1893, 91 McDonald Truss bridges were built. Newspapers reported a McDonald Truss bridge was built over the Snowy River at Jindabyne in 1893. The Six Mile Bridge, across the Eucumbene River, is believed to have been constructed about the same time as the Jindabyne bridge and, similarly, is a McDonald type truss design. The bridge served its purpose for half a century until it was partly demolished in 1957. The trusses were removed and the bridge was expected to collapse but it didn't fall down as predicted. A fire was started in an effort to burn it down but again the bridge resisted. The structure remained standing while the waters rose around it. Roads had sprawled out across the country side linking farms and settlements as circumstance required. In the early days there was little official planning and well worn tracks developed into roads. Adaminaby was at the junction of roads coming from Cooma and Jindabyne and the main road that travelled up the mountains to Kiandra and across the range. When the Eucumbene River was dammed these old routes were cut, isolating some communities from others and disrupting social and commercial interaction. =Industrial development= Growth of the Adaminaby township was stimulated by two major mining booms. First was the gold rush to Kiandra, about 30 km west of Old Adaminaby, which began in 1859 and only lasted a few years. Thousands of miners travelled along the one track that passed through the original township of Old Adaminaby. Despite some lucrative finds, the harsh environment and diminishing returns resulted in Kiandra's once populous gold field being suddenly deserted after 1860. By August 1863, following another severe winter, it was reported that the township was \\"tenantless\\" and the buildings were \\"falling into decay\\". In 1900 a gold dredging company commenced operations on the Kiandra plain with some reasonable results. Their activities lasted for three years until the site was deemed worked out and the dredging equipment moved over the range to Tumbarumba. At the same time as the 1860s Kiandra gold rush, copper was discovered at Kyloe, across the Eucumbene River from old Adaminaby. A shaft was sunk in 1872 but after a few attempts at obtaining ore the mine was abandoned. No real work proceeded until 1901 when Litchfield and Hassal extracted of copper. The Shaeffer Bros took over the lease in 1904 and, in the next three years, sent some of ore to a smelting company. The Shaeffers sold the mine to the Kyloe Mining Company in 1907 and work began to improve the site, extend the shaft and build furnaces and other facilities to enable processing. With all the extra business and activity associated with copper mining, Adaminaby became a thriving centre. By 1910 there were 110 men and boys employed at the Kyloe mine. This number quickly expanded to 195 including those who carted the ore to Cooma and teams who provided timber for the furnaces. Electric light was provided at the site so mining could go on 24 hours a day. There were a number of houses although it would seem most men slept in tents. The ore had to go through a series of complicated processes requiring a lot of machinery. In 1910 a huge boiler was sent by train from Sydney to Cooma and then dragged by a team of 76 bullocks to the mine site. Five bullock drivers were employed as well as a number of other men whose jobs were to dig the wheels out of bogs, build up roads and move sleepers which had to be placed on soft ground. Going was very slow and the first day from Cooma they only progressed .8 km. The boiler took six weeks to complete the journey of . The boiler and other improvements resulted in increased copper production and employment of more men. In 1911 there were 30 school age children living at the mining site and a school was established. But by April 1913 the payable ore had been worked out and, despite further prospecting, the Kyloe mine was abandoned. The company transferred their operations to a mine at Tenterfield which they also called Kyloe. The boiler was dismantled and believed to have been hauled to one of the local sawmills, possibly Alpine Creek, in one day. At first the waters of Lake Eucumbene obliterated most of the Kyloe mining site, but many relics have reappeared as water levels have decreased. =The Snowy Scheme 1949-73= Taking advantage of melted snow and diverting the waters of the Snowy River was first discussed in the middle of the 19th century after Australia's new pastoralists had experienced a succession of droughts and had begun to acknowledge how dry the continent really was. One of the first schemes conceived, in 1884, was to divert the Snowy into the Murrumbidgee River and send water north to Lake George which could become a massive reservoir. Interest in the idea fluctuated according to the seasons. Power shortages during World War I lead to a proposal to use the Snowy River's waters to generate hydro electricity and supplement Sydney's power stations. The NSW government carried out surveys assessing the viability of the plan and this developed into a scheme which would also send water to augment Sydney's supplies as well as the supplies of towns and villages along the route. Other districts then made claim for water and power and finally, in 1940, a detailed study of the potential of a hydro-electricity scheme was undertaken by the NSW Government. The resulting proposal was for a scheme which would supply both water and power and in 1949 the Commonwealth Government passed the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Power Act. The Scheme was considered the greatest engineering feat of its time and is still rated as one of the world's greatest engineering achievements being compared with similar major hydro-electric works in Canada and the US and projects like the Suez Canal and Panama Canal. The Scheme comprised two main parts i) The Snowy Murray Development, which involved the diversion of the Snowy River, and ii) the Snowy-Tumut Development, which involved the diversion and damming of the Eucumbene River. This water storage was initially called Adaminaby Dam, Reservoir or Storage and was seen as the heart of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The name was then changed to Eucumbene Dam, now known as Lake Eucumbene. In mid October 1949 a ceremony was held near old Adaminaby, in a deep gorge on the Eucumbene River, where the Governor General, Sir William McKell, set off an explosive charge in the presence of the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, Sir William Hudson, (later to become the first commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority), and other dignitaries and their wives. 1,200 guests attended the ceremony, including nearly everyone from the old town. The site was near the proposed dam wall where a commemorative plaque was erected. Originally the dam waters were to rise to just below the town and only some of the buildings were to be removed and relocated to higher ground. In June 1953 the Australian Geographical Walkabout Magazine reported that the dam was only going to be near Adaminaby and that the town would have the advantage of being sited at the edge of a large and attractive lake. A major road was built to carry heavy earthmoving equipment from Adaminaby down to the river, a construction township established and work began on the dam site while preparations were being made for a diversion tunnel. However, further investigations were carried out and it was found that building the dam wall some further down the Eucumbene Valley would enable the dam to hold a far greater volume of water and even though there were substantially increased costs these were partly off-set by a decrease in the length of the tunnel to Tumut. The dam wall was built at the new location and works for the additional capacity were completed in 1967. Following the increased capacity of the dam, the ceremonial plaque ended up a number of metres under water. There were 120 camp sites established during the course of building the Snowy Scheme. Some were in the Eucumbene valley and four of these are now below the high water mark of the lake. They are Adaminaby Portal Camp near the original dam wall site, Adaminaby Transit Camp established near the old town between the school and the sawmill, Coles's Camp on the west side of the river near an old swing on what had been the Coles's property and Eucumbene Portal camp which was built for contractors. The first to be constructed, in 1949, was Adaminaby Portal camp at Addicumbene where barracks and huts were erected about 6 km upstream from the current dam. This was abandoned in 1953 as the new dam wall was constructed and a more permanent camp was set up at Eaglehawk near the dam wall. =Relocating Adaminaby 1956-57= The new dam meant that the Eucumbene valley, the Adaminaby Plain and most of the town of Adaminaby would be flooded, a total area of about , resulting in the loss of homes, businesses and properties. Valuable grazing land, which produced fat cattle, fat lambs and high priced wool, was to be submerged. Questions arose regarding adequate compensation for all the years of work taken to develop businesses and properties as well as the loss of homes where several generations of families had lived. Most residents of the town and valley did not want to move. There was talk that the forced acquisition of land and businesses was illegal and some people agitated to commence legal action against the Authority. Graziers around Jindabyne and Adaminaby, who would be affected by the proposed dams, formed the Graziers Protection Association and sought legal opinion from Sir Garfield Barwick who advised that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act was invalid. The Authority, which was treated with suspicion, was keen to avoid litigation. They met with the Graziers Protection Association and came to an agreement to buy land based on current market rates, with a potential of a lease back for 3 years to allow graziers time to find replacement properties. Surprisingly the acquisitions were carried out with little friction and limited legal action. Most graziers moved away from the area because there was virtually no land available for purchase at that time. Professor Denis Winston, the Authority's town planner, was commissioned to draw up a new town and the people were given the choice of three locations, one of which looked over the new lake incorporating what was left of the old town. Surprisingly, the inhabitants chose a location on the main road, known as Bolairo View, forfeiting any water views, arguing that the position would ensure the town had a secure future on the highway and that the site was warmer, being lower, and more sheltered. In January 1954 the residents endorsed Adaminaby's new location in a referendum. This was the Authority's first experience of relocating a community which had been established a century earlier. There were people in the town and district who had never been to , let alone a big city. Families had lived, worked and developed businesses in the town and surrounding rural areas for generations. In the 1950s Adaminaby comprised a main street lined with Victorian buildings including some graceful two-storyed verandahed shops and hotels and a number of single-storey colonial stores. There were houses and cottages dating back to the mid-Victorian era and many masonry buildings indicating that people had built to stay. It was virtually no different to other Australian rural towns which had the support of a strong local rural economy. After a century of development, the town and established community were uprooted and relocated. The Authority was aware that this relocation was a very sensitive issue with residents and took great care to make it as easy as possible and avoid any legal issues. If people wanted to move elsewhere the Authority bought their property at market value and gave them an allowance for moving. If they wanted to relocate their buildings to the new town, the Authority was prepared to pay for all relocation costs and temporary accommodation. If people wanted to move into a new building the Authority supplied one, although if it was larger than their original then payments had to be made. The Authority built the new township of Adaminaby comprising a modern shopping centre, hotel, theatre, two schools, sporting clubs and facilities, a race course and a show ground. Thousands of trees were planted, roads built, allotments created and modern services provided to all the new blocks. Houses in the old town did not have electricity, water or sewerage and some older residents claimed that they did not want to be connected to these services. The first house relocation took place in 1956 and within 18 months all the buildings to be relocated had been removed. Weatherboard buildings were slowly transported across the countryside. There were reports of problems with wet weather and snow and some structures encountering mishaps along the way. People found they had to borrow money for the first time in their lives to pay for larger houses allocated to them with electricity and water connected. Two brick and stone churches were dismantled and rebuilt. 102 buildings were removed from Old Adaminaby, most to the new town. One notable legal case was pursued by Geoff Yen, whose family had been in town since the 1860s. He refused to cooperate and sign a contract for the new buildings the Authority was offering as compensation for his old buildings. Legal action ensued for thirty years until the Authority agreed to drop the case and Yen agreed to withdraw despite receiving nothing. The inundation affected most of the township except for four buildings that were located higher up the hill and allowed to stay in situ and the cemetery, sited on a hill, overlooking the old town. Organisations interested in preserving Australia's heritage, such as the National Library, were dismayed when virtually no efforts were taken to record the town, collate historical records and salvage items of cultural value. Many significant items and places were destroyed when the Authority bulldozed historic cottages which were not considered to be good enough to relocate. Construction of Eucumbene Dam was completed in 1958, the first and largest in the series of 16 dams comprising the Snowy Scheme. The Authority demolished homesteads and sheds at Old Adaminaby and in the surrounding districts which were going to be under water and sold the materials to other graziers for farm buildings. Some buildings that were considered too old and worthless to be useful were bulldozed. Even though the town's street pattern was still visible the original town resembled a heap of rubble with a few surviving chimneys and stone walls. By the end of 1959 water had risen to the outskirts of town. The flooding of the town and valley was a traumatic time for local residents. There was a great deal of bitterness and resentment regarding the destruction of cherished homes and farms as well as the breakdown of old social connections and affiliations. These feelings are still evident in the community today. Most farming families were reluctant to leave their properties and some stayed until water was lapping at their doorsteps. The Authority warned that the lake could rise quite quickly and people found they had to abandon all sorts of items such as stoves and farm equipment when the water cut off-road access to their properties. Lake Eucumbene finally reached capacity in 1973 but when the Snowy Scheme became fully operational the level was dropped to lower. A number of negative impacts resulted from the flooding. The new town of Adaminaby was cut off from traditional routes to Jindabyne, Cooma and Berridale. A lot of good quality grazing land was lost and jobs were affected by the decrease. It is estimated that half the population of the town and immediate district left due to lack of job opportunities. The old town blocks were often , where a family could keep a cow or a horse, but the new blocks were only a suburban quarter acre. The other town to be submerged by the Scheme was Jindabyne on the banks of the Snowy River with 250 residents. It had started as a good place for a cattle crossing the river and, during the 1840s, an inn and a water driven flourmill was built. A McDonald Truss timber bridge was constructed across the Snowy River in 1893 which encouraged the town to expand. When it came time to abandon original Jindabyne and relocate the residents, the Authority had learned from its previous experience with Adaminaby and put in place a simpler process, giving residents little input into the selection of their new town site. At the same time the Authority involved the townspeople in the design of the town and undertook a systematic collation of historical records and items of cultural heritage. The site chosen overlooked newly created Lake Jindabyne. No buildings were relocated to the new town. People were given plenty of warning about the relocation and no new houses were built in the old town for some years. Residents starting moving long before the rising water threatened their homes and businesses. The whole process was undertaken in a far more positive spirit than that which had been engendered at Adaminaby. =Lake Eucumbene, 1957 to present= The lake provided good opportunities for water sports and a number of tourism ventures were established around its shores. It was also stocked with trout and became a popular fishing location boosted by its proximity to the Murrumbidgee River, already well known by anglers. Several areas around the lake were set aside for holiday cabins. An unforeseen occurrence was that native animals were trapped on islands with the water rising around them. People remember the islands covered with kangaroos and seething with snakes. There were some efforts to relocate the kangaroos but reports were that success was limited. Sir Edward Hallstrom, benefactor and active trustee of Sydney's Taronga Park Zoo, together with Sir William Hudson, established a kangaroo refuge on one of the islands in Lake Eucumbene, not far from the dam wall. Hallstrom Island, as it became known, was primarily for the seven albino kangaroos which he donated but there were also some Great Eastern Grey kangaroos there as well. The Authority promoted the island, as well as Grace Lea Island which was a refuge for kangaroos and emus, as tourist attractions and people could take a launch from Old Adaminaby over to the islands, feed the animals, continue to the dam wall and then return to Old Adaminaby. The refuges were closed down in 1987 after many animals were killed illegally by shooters and an attempted relocation resulted in the death of many others. There were other tours around the lake and, at one stage, regular bus trips up Happy Jacks Road to visit the Queen's Lookout and appreciate the lake scenery. The Eucumbene Tea House was established, overlooking the lake and dam wall, which became a major attraction but burnt down in the late 1980s. Since 1996 the Monaro and the Alpine region have experienced a prolonged and serious drought. Precipitation has been lower than at any time on record and snow levels are only medium to low owing to generally higher temperatures and fewer moisture- bearing clouds. The 2007 snow melt was the lowest on record. It is anticipated that only minimum water releases will be allowed into the Murray River for irrigation in 2008 which is expected to reduce dam levels yet again. The low water line has attracted passing sightseers but has decreased the number of fishermen. The caravan parks were virtually empty in the middle of 2007 when Eucumbene Lake levels were at their lowest. During the early 1980s lake levels were quite depleted and many artefacts appeared as the water receded. At that time there were no reports of interference or removal. This was not the case in the first six months of 2007 when there were numerous reports of large objects, such as sulkies, drays and farm machinery, as well as an entire stone and brick house at Braemar Bay, being removed. In the early part of 2007 the community became alarmed about the continuing removal of objects and agitated for some action to be taken. The Snowy River Shire requested that an Interim Heritage Order be made over Lake Eucumbene to prohibit interference with the site or relics. The Interim Heritage Order was gazetted for 12 months on 4 June 2008. Council erected signs on the foreshores alerting the public to the fact that Lake Eucumbene was a heritage site and that removing or damaging any relics was an offence punishable by law with the possibility of fines up to $1.1 million.  Description  The remains of Old Adaminaby, which lie on the floor of Lake Eucumbene, fall into five categories, each group being represented by a number of relics: #Old Adaminaby - brick & stone building foundations, domestic ephemera, car chassis, brick pit, exotic plantings #Pastoral - homestead foundations, farming machinery, fence posts, exotic plantings, gardens, graves #Industrial - mining infrastructure, slag heap, shafts, boiler, machinery, Waterous boiler #Roads & Bridges - main roads, tracks, Six Mile Bridge #Snowy Scheme - camp site foundations, rubbish dumps, car chassis, discarded domestic and work items, tunnel spoil. =Old Adaminaby= When the lake waters rose to engulf the remains of the original town of Adaminaby all things perceived to have had value, at that time, had been removed, leaving only abandoned and useless objects. Bulldozers had flattened many of the old buildings believed to be too fragile and dilapidated to move. Masonry relics such as concrete slabs, bricks and stones, indicate the location of many buildings, old vehicles, stoves and general household items left behind after the move that were covered with water. Many moveable relics have been pilfered, although piles of rubble, remnants of building foundations and other masonry relics remain that indicate specific building sites and street layouts. Depending on lake levels, former inhabitants of Old Adaminaby have been able to identify the steps of St Mary's Church on Denison Street, foundations of St Joseph's Convent and School on Chalker Street, steps of the post office on the corner of Chalker and Druitt Streets, foundations of St John's Parish Hall on Stoke Street, foundations of the Presbyterian Church on Chalker Street, the steps of the Commercial Bank and a number of old house sites. Four buildings of Old Adaminaby, that were located further up the hill slope, escaped the inundation. They are all intact externally. The cemetery was also sited on a hill, overlooking the old town, and was not in the path of the rising waters. None of these four buildings nor the cemetery is within the draft curtilage for this site: #The former Methodist Church, now owned by council and used as a community hall. #The former public school, now used as an office building by the Angler's Retreat Campsite. #Denison Cottage (brick) now used for holiday lets. #The former Police Station and Courthouse, now used as a private residence. This two storey concrete building was relocated further up the hill to escape the rising lake waters. =Pastoral sites and relics= Braemar Norwegian Jens Olsen (who changed his name to James Holston) was an early settler in the Eucumbene valley in the late 1850s. With his Scottish wife he built Braemar, a house and post office of stone and brick. Holston's house was abandoned in the 1950s and covered by the waters of Lake Eucumbene until it reappeared during the 1980s at a time when the lake was quite low. Recently the original 140-year-old structure has been dismantled and all the stones and bricks illegally removed leaving little evidence other than old orchard trees and a fuel stove. Burnside A weatherboard homestead with a separate weatherboard kitchen, Burnside was originally owned by William and Caroline Russell in the late 19th century. The main house comprised a living room, one large bedroom, two smaller bedrooms and a front verandah with a bathroom at one end. During the 1930s or early 1940s the original kitchen block was demolished and a new kitchen was constructed attached to the main house, for the then owner, Mrs Bernie Mansfield, built by mason Billy Locker of local basalt and \\"liver\\" bricks that were popular during that era. The extension comprised a kitchen and living room with a corner chimney, an alcove for a fuel stove, an inglenook beside the fire and a separate laundry. The kitchen fireplace and chimney, laundry copper and demolished stone walls of the house remain. On the site are timber fence posts (evidence of sheds) and remains of horse-operated chaff-cutting farm machinery. Boconnoc and Buckenderra The site of George Yonge Mould's Boconnoc homestead is now completely overgrown, having been out of the lake water for many years. It is identifiable by exotic plantings such as elm and pine trees, relics of an extensive garden that includes plants and shrubs such as elderberries and other fruit trees. According to local evidence, there are stones and bricks indicating the house site which was demolished by the Authority in the 1970s. Stone foundations indicate the location of shearers' quarters at Boconnoc. Descendants of the Mould family had declined the Authority's offer to have four family graves exhumed and the remains, along with the headstones, relocated before the lake started filling in the late 1950s. Over the next 50 years the three grave sites with marble head stones and surrounding stone walls were regularly inundated then exposed and wave action, along with debris such as tree branches washed onto the sites, severely eroded the graves and damaged the headstones. The stone walls collapsed and there were concerns that the remains may be revealed. In June 1998 an agreement was reached between the Authority and the Mould family to remove the headstones, dismantle the walls, entomb the graves in concrete and use the stones from the walls to create protective embankments. The objective was to limit further erosion of the site and stop the graves being uncovered in the future. Some unmarked graves of the Mackay family, at Frying Pan, have been left undisturbed and to date have not been eroded by water movements. Since the lake level dropped, an old stone sheep dip with a stone paved area at one end where the sheep were stood to dry has reappeared close to Buckenderra Creek, which runs into Lake Eucumbene. It is unknown when this was constructed but the use of granite, instead of concrete, would indicate at least early 20th century, possibly earlier. Tryvilla A brick tank stand and some foundations are all that remains of Tryvilla, once located beside Buckenderra Creek. Old maps show that there were once three buildings at this location. The Delany family had held property at Buckenderra since 1866 although it is unknown when the homestead, which was demolished during the 1950s, was built. Remnants of foundations made of very sandy poured concrete indicate an early 20th century building date. A pile of stones nearby could have been part of a chimney. Eucumbene The property dates back to earliest settlement, The first claimant, Daniel Driscoll, was living there in the 1840s. During the 1850s it passed to Mr Harnett and at the time it was recorded as the only homestead between Cooma and the fledgling town of Adaminaby. When the Herbert family bought the property in the early 20th century improvements comprised, among other things, the original homestead, stone and timber stables and sheep yards. In 1930 a new homestead was built and the old one demolished in 1943, although the materials were recycled to another of the family's properties. In 1955, when the waters of Lake Eucumbene were rising, the 1930 homestead was demolished, along with farm buildings and many materials were taken over to Kybean, some to be reused for the Kybean hall. Hemsby One of the Mackay properties, Hemsby, adjoined Eucumbene. The Mackay family had been in the district since Samuel Mackay went to the Kiandra goldfields in 1861. They were a large family and at times owned many properties in the district. Samuel lived at Frying Pan Creek, at his Earl's Court property. George Watkins Mackay, son of Samuel, bought the Hembsy property, not far from Kyloe copper mine, in 1912. He built a weatherboard house with corrugated iron roof surrounded by a number of outbuildings. The homestead was later extended in brick. It is remembered for having a large formal garden laid out by a landscape gardener from Andersons Seeds with a small watercourse running through it and many brick and stone edged beds and paths. =Industrial sites and relics= Kyloe Copper Mine Most of the Kyloe mine and town was submerged but there were three main visible sites near the waters edge. In 1995/96 some concrete pillars, concrete slabs, a stone track leading in the direction of old Adaminaby and several hut and shed sites could still be seen.Barry McGowan \\"Lost Mines Revisited\\",1996 About away an old boiler, stone, bricks and concrete indicate a processing site. Nearby was a tailings site, a slag dump and a brick floor where the smelters where located. Four other huts or shed sites were also able to be identified. These sites are probably below high water level but above the general level at which the lake is operated. In January 2007 many more relics had been exposed by the receding water of the lake. They included concrete slabs and other structures, probably processing sites, machinery parts, mine shafts, a brick plinth and a rubbish dump. Waterous steam engine This lies in the silt on the lake's edge between Old Adaminaby and Anglers Reach. Its approximate location is opposite the Kyloe Cooper Mine site and some people have assumed that the boiler was located on the Eucumbene River and used to pump water up to the mine site. In about 1948 Alice Reynolds, who lived at the neighbouring Grace Lea property, wrote in a school project that there was a pump on the Eucumbene River which supplied water to the copper mine up until it closed in 1913 (original material provided by David Kennedy). This could possibly be that pump. But Barry McGowanLost Mines Revisited, 1996, p. 28 argues that water was pumped from the Eucumbene River away from the mine site and the pumping plant was located on Frying Pan Creek. The Waterous boiler is some kilometres away from that location. Taking into account the difficulty of moving such a heavy piece of equipment it is more likely that it was used on a property to drive shearing or chaff cutting equipment. The engine is identified by its Waterous Brantford stamp on the firebox door. The boiler is in diameter and high. The whole engine is about long. The Waterous Engine Works, which built the engine, was at Brantford, Ontario, Canada, and this model was known as the Champion type. It had a unique vertical boiler and an ability to raise steam from cold water in about half the time of the standard horizontal types. The rights were patented during the 1870s although it is unknown when this example was manufactured.Max Gregory, The Old Machinery Magazine, December/January 2008, p. 8 Only a very few of the 1800 engines originally built are known to have survived. It is believed there are only two others in Australia: one still operating in Inverell, NSW and one in pieces at another location. There is only one other known in the world, which is located in the northern hemisphere. =Roads and Bridges= Since the lake level has dropped, several old roads which were Adaminaby's link with the rest of the district have reappeared. A number of other tracks head into the lake waters, stopping abruptly at the waters edge, indicating previous accesses to rural properties. Part of the road which ran between Jindabyne and Adaminaby has resurfaced not far from Braemar. The sign erected, probably at the time of the lake filling, warns motorists that the road was flooded. The closing of this road and the filling of the lake left part of the original Adaminaby community suddenly geographically belonging to Jindabyne. The original Cooma Adaminaby road can now be seen around the Buckenderra area, leading in and out of the low water at several locations. Prior to the filling of Lake Eucumbene, efforts were made to demolish the Six Mile Bridge over the Eucumbene River. It was built of hardwood, most likely milled locally. Its hardwood trusses and handrails were removed and a fire lit under the centre span which did burn part of the timber decking but the bridge failed to catch fire properly. The bridge is still standing and vehicles could drive across, although stability and safety are an issue. The bottom chords are mostly intact but the central span has sagged without its supporting trusses and as a result of the fire. All the piers are in place with their cross bracing and both abutments are relatively stable. Detailed measurements have not been taken as the water level of Lake Eucumbene has risen again since June 2007 and made access to the bridge impossible. The NSW Roads & Traffic Authority, Heritage Branch, even though they have details of most McDonald Truss bridges constructed in the state, has no records referring to the Six Mile Bridge on the Eucumbene River. =Snowy Scheme camp sites and relics= Two of the four Snowy camp sites known to be around Lake Eucumbene have been revealed since lake levels have receded: the Eucumbene Portal Camp and, what is believed to be, the Adaminaby Portal Camp. At the Adaminaby Portal site a well-made road heads up the hill through the camp and back down into the water, passing two large ablution blocks comprising shower and toilet stalls and a separate laundry block. A concrete tank could have been a septic system. Several series of concrete steps lead up the hill where two more large concrete pads and other concrete relics indicate the possible location of accommodation huts. A group of bottles lie on the ground, the beer bottles stamped 1952 and 1953. It is believed that the camp was closed in 1953 following the decision to relocate the proposed dam wall further down river. According to Frank Rodwell's \\"Homes on the Range\\" the camp consisted of Vandyke prefabricated barracks and huts erected by Architon Construction Co. of Cooma for the Public Works Department. Another camp at Eucumbene Portal was built for contractors and appears to have provided better quality accommodation. This site ended up partly below water. Old beer bottles, relics from the rubbish dump, well below high water mark, have 1957 stamped on the bottom indicating that it was around that year that the camp was closed. Other relics in the dump are boots, shoes, rubber gloves and helmets. Outside the actual rubbish trench is the chassis of an old vehicle with wooden spoke wheels and an Olympic tyre. At the same location are tonnes of tunnel spoil (granite rock) which has been excavated from the tunnel and dumped. The camp site itself is identifiable by a number of terra cotta drainage pipes and until relatively recently the one surviving building was used as a scout hall. =Hallstrom Island= A few yards and sheds survive on the island above high water mark as evidence of the previous animal refuge. Presently out of the water are the remains of the high kangaroo fence which was erected to keep kangaroos on the island although there are many reports of the animals swimming over to the mainland when water was low. = Condition = As at 14 March 2008, the condition of the relics was poor due to many years immersion in water followed by exposure to weather as well as wind and wave action, which washes debris onto relics or moves relics about. Filling of the lake started in 1957 and was completed in 1973. Up until recent years the lake was at 80 per cent capacity. In June 2007, due to severe drought, the lake dropped to the record low level of 10 per cent capacity. This revealed (for the first time since the lake was flooded) much of the remaining infrastructure of the town of Old Adaminaby, the surrounding pastoral area, former industrial sites, and infrastructure relating to transport and camps for workers on the Snowy Scheme. Lake Eucumbene was at 20 per cent capacity. The very nature and circumstances of these relics mean that their degree of intactness and integrity is quite low although these conditions are not crucially relevant to their heritage significance. It is remarkable that this rich and varied collection is today available for inspection and recording. There is still adequate fabric to undertake useful interpretation and research. = Modifications and dates = *1956-7Relocation of 100 houses and two churches from Old Adaminaby. *1957Snowy Hydro Electric Authority demolished homesteads and buildings that were to be submerged. *1957Flooding of the Eucumbene valley started, to create Lake Eucumbene. *1958Construction of Eucumbene dam completed. *1959Water level reached the outskirts of Old Adaminaby. *1973Lake Eucumbene at full capacity. *June 2007Lake Eucumbene at record low level of 10 per cent capacity.  Heritage listing  As at 18 March 2008, the remains of the original town of Adaminaby (known as Old Adaminaby) and the surrounding pastoral region, now located below Lake Eucumbene, are of State heritage significance. They demonstrate more than a century of pastoral development, the growth of a town, early 20th century copper mining and mid 20th century transient labour camps as well as lifestyles, commerce, transport routes, social connections and traditions that were abruptly obliterated by the filling of Lake Eucumbene dam in 1957. Lake Eucumbene was the first and largest of the dams comprising the Snowy Scheme. It was a critical component of the Scheme that was one of Australia's greatest engineering achievements, a marker of the optimism of Australia's postwar reconstruction and a project of national historical and economic significance. The impact that the flooding of the Eucumbene Valley to create Lake Eucumbene dam had on a small local community gained national prominence as the events surrounding the relocation of the inhabitants of Adaminaby and the surrounding pastoral region were followed all around Australia. The exposed relics of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding region are important for their associations with an identifiable group‚Äîthe displaced inhabitants who carried with them to new locations a sense of loss and deprivation, and their descendants who today have great cultural regard for the exposed sites and relics. These are evidence of a discontinued way of life, customs, associations and traditions that were abruptly terminated. They represent a particular consequence of the development of the Snowy Scheme, for the displaced community of 1957 and their descendants. The places and relics have potential to reveal further information regarding the century of European pastoral, urban and industrial development in the valley as well as serving as evidence of events which shaped the economic development of the nation and the nature of the lives of its population. Only two towns have been purposely flooded to create dams for the Snowy Scheme. Adaminaby was the larger and more significant of the two towns, and the flooding of Lake Eucumbene impacted on the greater number of people. The exposure of the sites and relics of Old Adaminaby and surrounding districts half a century after their inundation is unexpected, remarkable and unique and has vested in the revealed relics a high level of significance, both for the immediate descendants and for the wider community. One exposed relic, the Waterous steam engine, is rare worldwide, and is one of only two other known complete examples: one located in Australia at Inverell and the other in the northern hemisphere. Old Adaminaby and Lake Eucumbene was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 June 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of Old Adaminaby, which now lies on the lakebed of Lake Eucumbene, represents a significant historical phase of over a century's development of the town of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding pastoral districts. The site demonstrates 130 years of development of the wealthy pastoral industry of the Eucumbene valley, the growth of a thriving small rural town (that started with three small huts) over 100 years, as well as lifestyles, commerce, transport routes, social connections and traditions, all of which were abruptly halted in 1957 by the flooding of the Eucumbene valley to create Lake Eucumbene. The site also demonstrates other historical activities that had ceased by 1957, including the development of a thriving copper mining and processing industry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and mid twentieth century transit labour camps associated with the Snowy Scheme. The inundation of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding pastoral districts to create the Lake Eucumbene dam is associated with the significant historical activity of the Snowy Scheme. Lake Eucumbene was the first and largest of the 16 dams constructed by the Scheme to provide integrated irrigation and hydro electric power to three states. Lake Eucumbene was a critical component of the Snowy Scheme which was a landmark engineering achievement in Australia's history that influenced the economies and communities of NSW, Victoria and South Australia. The Snowy Scheme has become one of Australia's legendary icons. It is one of only two sites in Australia that has been recognised as an international Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers (the other being the Sydney Harbour Bridge). The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site meets this criterion of State significance for its associations with the community of displaced inhabitants of 1957 and their descendants, and for its significance to that present community of descendants. The inhabitants of the Eucumbene Valley and Old Adaminaby who were displaced by the Snowy Scheme's development of Lake Eucumbene (some of whom were obliged to move away from the area) have great regard for their past demonstrated at this site and for the events which led to the immense change in their lives. The termination of lifestyles, associations, customs, and traditions has left many among this community marked by long standing sadness, resentment and bitterness for the events that gave rise to their removal, and for the way in which it was managed. Furthermore, the emergence of submerged sites and relics in the recent drought has compounded the disenfranchisement felt by many original residents and their descendants who now feel proprietorial with regard to the exposed sites and relics that are significant evidence of their past lives and culture. Their negative feelings have been reinforced by the illegal removal of some relics in 2007. The site also has significance to a community beyond those affected by the relocation of 1957, as the land resumptions and relocation process were followed around Australia in the late 1950s and public interest has refocussed with the re-emergence of relics in the drought. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The relics of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding districts on Lake Eucumbene's floor are evidence of more than a century of pastoral life, development of a hamlet into a town, previous mining practices and the lives and working conditions of men employed on the Snowy Scheme, which was one of Australia's greatest engineering achievements. The relics represent a variety of previous customs, lifestyles and processes which were abruptly terminated in an unusual way. They serve as a benchmark for the Scheme's construction and illustrate the optimism of Australia's postwar reconstruction. Many sites would have archaeological potential. The Waterous steam engine is a significant and rare piece of engineering heritage. The site may also provide useful research for predicting the future impacts of climate change and flooding on coastal communities and the impacts of long- term immersion in water on buildings and other structures. The site meets this criterion of State significance for research potential because the Snowy Scheme is one of Australia's greatest engineering achievements. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site meets this criterion of State significance as one of only two similar sites in Australia. The other is the nearby Lake Jindabyne. Old Adaminaby and Jindabyne were the two towns flooded in 1957 and 1967 respectively to create dams for the Snowy Scheme. Old Adaminably is the only one of the two towns to be revealed again in drought conditions. Old Adaminaby was the first and the larger of the two towns to be flooded. Jindabyne was a much smaller township than Old Adaminaby and Lake Jindabyne is approximately one quarter of the size of Lake Eucumbene. The flooding of the Eucumbene Valley resulted in momentous life changes for a larger number of people. Moreover, Jindabyne did not have the same rich variety of artefacts dating from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century as did Adaminaby. Following the experience of flooding Old Adaminaby, the process of relocating the inhabitants of Jindabyne was handled differently. Exceptionally, and unexpectedly, as a consequence of severe and prolonged drought, Old Adaminaby and parts of the surrounding districts have been revealed again, 50 years after the commencement of their inundation. The places and objects which have survived the processes of inundation followed by desiccation and the subsequent damage which occurred are a unique group of rare items. Jindabyne, however, is located in deeper water and unlikely ever to be revealed again. One revealed item at Lake Eucumbene, the Waterous boiler (a rare vertical boiler), is one of only three complete known examples in the world. The others are in Inverell, NSW and in the Northern Hemisphere. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The remnant structures and relics of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding districts, grouped under the categories of former township, pastoral, industrial, transport and Snowy Mountains Scheme development are representative of similar NSW settlements that can display remnant structures of over a century of similar development. In this case, however, all further development abruptly ceased at a certain point in time so that the remnant structures and relics of Old Adaminaby and the surrounding districts are cast in a late 1950s time warp.

It generally occurs in fish that live in aquariums and it becomes prominent whenever there is a change in temperature and pressure in natural environments, aquatic turbulence, and a disturbance in biotic metabolisms. Bubbles of gas may form in the eyes, skin, gills, and fins.  Signs and symptoms  The Gas Bubble Disease can be detected by the formation of small gas bubbles under the epidermis which includes the formation of gas bubbles in the skin, the gills and eyeballs causing exophtalmia. Gas bubbles may also form in extremities (fins), in the vascular system where they often cause embolism and in their mouth opening. The Gas Bubble Disease may cause floating problems due to the excessive amount of gas in their bodies, ultimately leading to upside-down swimming and death. Gas Bubble Disease may also occur in humans and is commonly known as ‚ÄúDecompression sickness‚Äù, it generally occurs in divers when they resurface without using proper decompression procedures. The supersaturation of nitrogen in the body tissues is causing an unbalanced gas saturation in blood vessels and organs. The main concern with this disease in particular is when it develops and transforms into air embolism, which causes severe blockades in the lung and in the blood vessels, which is especially dangerous in arteries. Expanding gases can rupture the small air-cavities located in the lungs (alveoli), thus causing pulmonary barotrauma which can ultimately lead to death due to pulmonary failure.  Origin and causes  The Gas Bubble Disease is a result of an over-saturation of nitrogen in the body tissues caused by a supersaturation of gases in the water. This supersaturation is mainly caused by the changes of abiotic environmental factors including pressure, temperature and salinity since these factors influence the amount of gases dissolving in water. = Pressure = The decrease in the pressure of the environment will causes the supersaturation of the water. = Temperature = An increase in temperature of the environment will cause a supersaturation of the water. Due to the lower density of the water at higher temperatures a lower amount of gases can be dissolved in the water. = Salinity = An increase in salinity of water will cause a supersaturation since the concentration of dissolved salt ions in water increases and takes up the space for the dissolved gases in the water. Therefore a difference in the salinity levels of lakes or rivers is one of the causes of the gas bubble disease. = Other natural causes = Other natural causes of Gas Bubble Disease the gas saturation caused by an increase of the concentration of nitrogen in natural water resources due to the increasing nitrogen concentration in underground rivers and lakes or the supersaturation of water caused by cascades or waterfalls. When the water falls into the pool it is forcing the nitrogen into the water of the pool.  Diagnosis  ‚ÄúThe resulting abnormal physical presence of gases can block blood vessels (hemostasis) or tear tissues, and may result in death.‚Äù (Bouck 2011). Gas Bubble Disease may develop in three different stages: * Pressure unequilibrium resulting in excess gas formation. * Metabolic and functional system decreases. * Complete system dysfunction (death).  Prevention  The gas Bubble Disease can generally be prevented by avoiding the factor that cause the disease. Small gas bubbles in fish can be prevented and somewhat cured by relocating fish into deep water that contains higher pressures and therefore a higher amount of gases can be dissolved in the water. This will cause nitrogen excess to be dissolved into the body tissues and the gas bubbles will eventually disappear. Aeration is an effective method to stabilise nitrogen and oxygen in water, since it is able to absorb equal quantities of oxygen and nitrogen and forces them into the water to maintain a balance for ‚Äúrearing fish‚Äù (Rucker, 1972).

Born in Parepare, he studied agricultural science in Japan's Kyushu University and returned home, running his own business and teaching before becoming the regent of Bantaeng for two terms. His time as regent saw significant economic growth within the regency, in addition to improvements in health. In the last year of his second term, he participated in the province's gubernatorial election and won. Early life Nurdin was born on 7 February 1963 as the eldest child of six. His father, Andi Abdullah, was a member of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Her mother Nuareny Abdullah originated from Soppeng. He claimed that he is a descendant of the Bantaeng kings - specifically, that his grandfather was the 35th King of Bantaeng. Education He went to junior high school (Sekolah Menengah Pertama/SMPN) in his hometown of Parepare, before going to Ujung Pandang for his senior high school studies, graduating in 1986. He continued his education in Hasanuddin University, studying agriculture and forestry. After obtaining his bachelors, he continued to Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, earning his masters and doctorate by 1994.Saldy (25 November 2017). \\"Nurdin Abdullah reunian bareng teman sekolah di Parepare, begini kisah masa kecilnya\\". Tribun Timur (in Indonesian). Retrieved 20 July 2018. Career In 1997, he returned to South Sulawesi and established a company (PT Tokai Material Indonesia, later renamed PT Maruki Internasional) producing butsudan from wood for export to Japan in Makassar with the help of Japanese investors. He also held the post of president-director in three other Japanese companies. =Regent (2008-2018)= In 2008, Nurdin Abdullah ran with Andi Asli Mustajab in Bantaeng's regency election. The pair handily won the election, polling about 46 percent of the votes in a four-pair race in which they were supported by 10 political parties. Following the victory, Nurdin resigned from his teaching position at Hasanuddin University and from PT Maruki Internasional. They were sworn in on 6 August 2008. When he took office, Bantaeng was one of 199 regencies across the country (and 13 in the province) to be classified as \\"undeveloped\\". Nurdin established a health service system, based on modified Nissan Elgrand cars received as aid from Japan, which was credited with significantly reducing the maternal mortality ratio. In economic terms, the regency's agricultural sector experienced a significant increase in crop yields and improved diversification under his tenure. Unemployment fell from 12 to 2.3 percent, with absolute poverty dropping from 21 to 5 percent. A 3,000-hectare industrial park was also set up, which was to include a nickel- alloy smelter. Annual income rose from IDR 5 million to IDR 27 million in 2015. Said smelter would be delayed in its operation, causing some controversy as Nurdin was accused of utilizing its (cancelled) opening as a false campaigning premise. Implementing the lelang jabatan system also used by then- Surakarta mayor and later president Joko Widodo since 2009, Nurdin would win four Adipura awards in a row in addition to multiple other accolades from central government ministries. He was reelected in 2013, winning 84 percent of the votes. His second term expired on 15 August 2018. He was also made a full professor at his alma mater Hasanuddin University in November 2017. =Governor (2018-)= In 2018, he registered to run in the province's gubernatorial election, with his tenure expiring the same year. He ran with Andi Sudirman Sulaiman, the younger brother of agriculture minister Amran Sulaiman. Supported by PDI-P, PKS and PAN, the pair would win the four- candidate election, securing victory in 16 regencies and cities within the province with a total of 1,867,303 votes (43.87%).

The property is owned by the Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site of Matthews' Cottage, Lot 4, Section 12 of Kiandra, was initially sold at an auction of Crown land to George Venterman on 29 June 1874. George, who is recorded as a \\"miner of Kiandra\\" paid the sum of 20 shillings 3 pence for the land. In March 1879 the land was sold to Frederick Blaxland of Binjura, and subsequently to William John Foley of Kiandra. \\"Bill\\" Foley was born at Goulburn Jail in 1879, the son of a warden. By the age of sixteen, Bill was working on the mail coach from Kiandra to . This work often proved to be exciting to the young Bill, particularly as the coach frequently carried gold for the banks. At these times a gold escort of six to eight armed men would accompany the coach. Bill was later employed on mining dredges, initially at Adelong and later at in Victoria. His departure from Myrtleford was by pushbike; he rode all the way to Grahamstown, near , for his wedding with Jenny Bradley. The Bradley family has a long association with the Snowy Mountains, various branches of the family having settled at , the Yarrangobilly Hotel, Yarrangobilly Caves as the first caretakers, and Kiandra. During 1900 the Foleys moved to Kiandra where Bill found work at Oliver Harris' store. Work comprised the butchering of livestock and subsequent transportation of the meat by packhorses to miners at Lobbs Hole. Photographic evidence indicates that the original cottage was constructed by the Foleys at some time between 1900 and 1906.  Description  The Cottage was a simple three-roomed building with a verandah facing the street. Construction was of weatherboards with a corrugated iron gable roof and the interior was lined with timber boards. The construction utilised modern techniques and materials, due to the technology available within a typical rural town at the time and the easy access to major centres via reasonable roads. The builder is not known. It is likely that the sawn timber framing would have been obtained from one of the local sawmills such as Alpine Creek. Lining boards, windows and doors are likely to have been obtained from outside the region. The use of basalt stonework in the fireplace is relatively uncommon, although the Kiandra Courthouse and Police Lockup were constructed entirely of basalt.

It has hairless inverted lance- shaped to oblong leaves tipped with three to five teeth and globe-shaped to flattened light yellow to coppery flowerheads of 5‚Äì8 cm (2.0‚Äì3.2 in) in diameter. From the center of the flowers emerge almost straight styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Breede River pincushion in English. Although flower heads may occur on and off between May and March, the peak season is from September to November. It is known from the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum utriculosum is an upright or spreading shrub of 1‚Äì2 m (3‚Äì6¬Ω ft) high and 2‚Äì3 m (6¬Ω‚Äì10 ft) across, with an informal habit. Its branches grow out at an angle up to the horizontal and often droop to the ground. It grows from a stout single main stem that branches low down, and is covered in a smooth, grey bark. The flowering stems are about 3¬Ω mm (0.14 in) thick, and covered in fine crisped hairs and long, straight, silky hairs. The hairless leaves are inverted lance-shaped with a wedge-shaped base narrowing to a stalk, the tip cut-off, with three to five stout teeth of 4¬Ω‚Äì7 cm (1.8‚Äì2.8 in) long and 1‚Äì2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) wide. The more or less flattened globe-shaped flowerheads of 5‚Äì8 cm (2.0‚Äì3.2 in) in diameter have a stalk of about 1 cm (0.4 in) long, are usual set individually but sometimes grouped in twos or threes. The common base of the flowers in the same head is broadly cone-shaped, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and approximately ¬æ cm across. The bracts that subtend each flower head are greyish because they are covered with densely matted silky hairs, tightly overlapping and pressed against the flower head, oval with a pointy tip, about 8 mm (0.3 in) long and 5 mm (0.2 in) wide, and cartilaginous in consistency. The bract that subtends each flower individually encloses the perianth at its base, has an extended pointed tip (cuspidate), about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) wide, very densely set with woolly hairs at the base and silky hairy near the tip. As in all Proteaceae, the perianth is 4-merous, and either pale yellow (in the south) or orange to copper-coloured (in the north of its distribution). The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube, is about 7 mm (0.28 in) long, at 1 mm (0.04 in) narrow and hairless at its base, but greatly expanded to about 4 mm (0.16 in) wide and powdery hairy higher up, to become suddenly constricted where it merges into the middle part. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise, is about 2 mm (0.08 in) long and covered in spreading to erect, silky hairs. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four elliptic lobes of about long, which are covered in straight, white to rust-coloured silky hairs. The elliptic anthers are directly fused to the limbs. From the perianth emerges a style of 3¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1.4‚Äì2.0 in) long, bent slightly in upper third in the direction of the centre of the head. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is narrowly cone- to egg-shaped and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 mm (0.06‚Äì0.08 in) long, greenish (in the south) and crimson (in the north of its distribution), with a groove acting as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four line- to awl-shaped scales of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long. = Differences with related species = The Breede River pincushion differs in its lax habit with many horizontal branches, broad cone-shaped receptacle, narrow based perianth tube that is inflated higher up, to be suddenly much inflated where it merges in the silky hairy perianth claws, and the egg-shaped pollen- presenter.  Taxonomy  Carl Thunberg was the first who collected the Breede River pincushion for science, but did not give a description, nor did he give a location. He labeled it Protea conocarpa Œ≤. It is likely that the specimen was picked on Thunberg‚Äôs journey when passing through Storms Vlei when he was heading for a cattle post at Tygerhoek, near present-day Caledon, in 1772. It was only found again by Robert Harold Compton in 1924 near McGregor. The species was only described in 1970 by John Patrick Rourke. The species name utriculosum means \\"having a bladder\\".  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The Breederiver pincushion can be primarily found in the area of McGregor, Robertson and Stormsvlei, and along the north slopes of the Potberg, all the way to the mouth of the Breede River. L. utriculosum exclusively grows on north facing, dry and very rocky slopes at 60‚Äì600 m (200‚Äì2000 ft) altitude. Along its distribution range, average annual precipitation is 250‚Äì380 mm (10‚Äì15 in), most of which falls during the winter half year. The soil it grows on is weathered Table Mountain Sandstone/Quartzite in the southeast and either Table Mountain Sandstone or Witteberg Quartzite to the northwest. The species may form quite dense stands locally. Some of the locations have such sparse vegetation that fire is not sustained, and many old plants can be found, their main stems tightly wedged in the crevices between the rocks.  Conservation  The Breede River pincushion is considered a species of least concern, with a stable population size.

It is also known as Kiandra Courthouse/Chalet. The property is owned by the Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Kiandra Courthouse was severely damaged by fire during the 2020 Kosciuszko National Park bushfires  History  This was the site of the courthouse and gaol established as part of Kiandra Township with a gold rush in the area in 1859-60. Evidence of the gold rush phenomenon and the former Kiandra Township is represented in the landscape, through the extant remains spread across the former town site. Kiandra is significant as the site of the first Australian ski club and as probably the first Australian place which promoted snow sports. The 1958 and 1962 Kiandra Chalet building extensions to the original courthouse is a typical example of the KSPT promoted State Park Alpine style. The remnant chalet is important as one of the few remnant buildings of Kiandra's resort/Snowy Mountains Scheme era, and therefore is a twentieth century link with the nineteenth century pioneer snow sports in Australia. Later, the building was used as a place of accommodation for generations who stayed at the chalet for recreation or during the construction of the Snowy Hydro Scheme. In 2000 Heritage Council approval was given for the removal of single storey additions, to return the building to the original courthouse, as well as to repair roofing and guttering to reduce water ingress. In 2013 the Heritage Council approved the adaptive re-use of the courthouse and chalet, including a new accommodation and services building, including removal of the existing shed structures surrounding it.  Description  = Setting = A large mature Western Yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa) survives on the road frontage of the former courthouse / chalet. This is one of three such trees in this location. Due to deteriorating condition, two of these pines were removed after a 2009 inspection (Tumut Region Tree Surgery, 27/10/2017). This remaining pine tree retains value as a landmark, literally marking the site of the courthouse/chalet on the flattish road landscape. The courthouse is on the eastern side of the Snowy Mountains Highway, Kiandra, within the Kosciuszko National Park. = Buildings = The former courthouse at Kiandra, New South Wales, in 2016 The stone building fronting the highway consists of the 1890s courthouse and associated police quarters (police cell) the courtroom and the chalet living room. The original courthouse was the first substantial public building in the town and the product of the office of the noted late-nineteenth century NSW Colonial Architect, James Barnet. In the 1950s and 1960s the building was modified and expanded and the original courthouse fabric was subsumed entirely by extensions to the ground floor and addition of a first floor. These additions were timber clad with skillion roofs, in the established Kosciuszko State Park Trust Style. The Department of Main Roads started using the building as the base for its snow clearing operations from 1971 until they vacated the building around 1999. From 1999 the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service removed some sections of the deteriorated 1960s fabric and boarded up the building. The courthouse remained unused until 2010 when the courtroom at the front of the building was restored. = Modifications = In the 1950s and 1960s the building was modified and expanded and the original courthouse fabric was subsumed entirely by extensions to the ground floor and addition of a first floor.

Pugin.Dover - St Paul from English Heritage, retrieved 20 July 2018 History =Origin= In 1822, a mission started in the town that ministered to Catholics in the area and Mass was said in a house, 45 Snargate Street.Old Dover in Words & Pictures, retrieved 20 July 2018 In 1834, a location had to be bought, because Mass was being said in the loft of a house on St James' Street, and it was not large to hold everybody there. A former Wesleyan chapel in Elizabeth Street was bought for the Catholics to worship in. It was bought for ¬£425 and it cost ¬£400 to renovate. A further ¬£350 was paid for an adjacent presbytery. In May 1935, new chapel was opened.

After marrying Anne he decided in 1696 to demolish Wrottesley Hall, fill-in its moat, and on the site built a new 'H' plan house designed by Christopher Wren. The money for the rebuilding came from his first wife, parts of whose Archer arms overlapped those of Wrottesley on the hall front pediment. This new house burnt down in 1897 destroying all estate records. During the rebuilding of Wrottesley Hall the 3rd Baronet lived at Somerford Hall in Brewood, the house, manor and estate, which included Horsebrook (in Brewood) and Stretton, he had acquired by buying the mortgages of John Somerford. Wrottesley died at Somerford in 1712. His will stated a wish to be buried in Brewood church or churchyard [St Mary and St Chad], where also his wife Anne was buried in 1732; he also stipulated that Somerford Hall be left to his second wife and her issue.

He was the member of national team and won titles at 1990 Asian Games and the 1991 ABC Championship.https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%8E%E6%98%A5%E6%B1%9F/80845 In the following year, Li along with the national team competed in the men's tournament at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Three years after announcing his retirement from professional basketball in 1998, he has since launched a distinguished coaching career. Early life Li was born on 11 March 1963 in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province in Northeast China. He began his basketball career in 1977 when entered Liaoning Sports School for training. He subsequently entered the Liaoning Youth Yeam at the age of 17. He was then selected into the national youth team in 1982 and the Liaoning team in 1983, where he became the small forward. Because there was no professional league before 1995, the players retired relatively early. Li Chunjiang himself was forced to retire from Liaoning in 1993 and worked in the real estate bureau of Huanggu District, Shenyang. At this time, Li resolutely gave up his working and went south to join Guangdong Hongyuan, where he played his second spring of career. Coaching career =Dormancy period (2001‚Äì2002)= In the first year of Li Chunjiang's coaching, the team has suffered a rare five consecutive losses, which is undoubtedly a big blow for Li. The final result of Guangdong Southern Tigers in the regular season was 12‚Äì10, and the first round of the playoffs was out. In the subsequent competition of the 9th National Games in 2001, as the host, the original goal was to enter the top three Guangdong men's basketball team, and finally only won the fourth place. In the 2001-02 season, Hongyuan finished seventh in the regular season, and was swept by the Shanghai Sharks with Yao Ming in Playoffs. =Rising period (2002‚Äì2006)= In 2002‚Äì03 season, Guangdong Southern Tigers entered the stage of blowout. In the regular season, he entered the playoffs with 23‚Äì3‚Äìno.1, but lost the championship in the finals. In the 2003‚Äì04 season, Guangdong finally won the championship by defeating the old opponent Bayi in the finals. Li Chunjiang stood at the top of the CBA stage and opened the prelude of Hongyuan Dynasty. In the 2004‚Äì05 season finals against Jiangsu, Guangdong was 1‚Äì2 behind in the first three games, especially Nanjing in the fifth game. They miraculously turned back the defeat to win the championship after 16 points in the fourth quarter. Li Chunjiang's on-the-spot command ability at critical moments is admirable. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Guangdong won 4‚Äì1 in the finals over the old opponent Bayi Rockets, ushering in the team's first three consecutive titles. At the same time, Yi Jianlian decided to participate in the 2007 NBA draft. =Charging period (2006‚Äì2007)= In 2006, Li handed his position of head coach to Assistant coach Li Qun and traveled alone to the United States for further athletic study. Li Chunjiang's study abroad was not gilded, but he watched the game video day and night; he drove around the west coast of the United States alone, traveling among Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings; he watched the NCAA at Oregon State University and Oregon University and asked the University coaches for advice. =Brilliant period (2008‚Äì2011)= At the beginning of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Li Chunjiang returned to the position of head coach of Guangdong Southern Tigers. From the 2007‚Äì08 season, Guangdong began to rule the CBA for four years. They defeated Liaoning Flying Leopards (4‚Äì1), beat Xinjiang Flying Tigers (4‚Äì1, 4‚Äì1, 4‚Äì2) three times in a row, and won four consecutive titles, which opened the Guangdong Dynasty. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, five trainees of Li Chunjiang were represented in the Chinese men's basketball team. In the 11th National Games of China, Guangdong men's basketball team successively defeated Shandong, which won the titles of the National Games.Coach Li also became the most successful basketball coach in China. =New challenges (2013‚Äìpresent)= After being eliminated by Beijing, which lead by Stephon Marbury, Li Chunjiang chose to resign. A few months later, Li Chunjiang took over Zhejiang Lions and led the team to the 2018 CBA Finals and finished as runner-up. In November, 18-year-old Li Jinglong, son of Coach Li, also made his CBA debut with 2 points and one rebound in nine minutes.https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2013-11/29/content_17140055.htm References Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of China Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Asian Games medalists in basketball Category:Asian Games gold medalists for China Category:Basketball players at the 1990 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1990 Asian Games ","title":"Li Chunjiang"},{"id":"57948778","text":"Wang Zhidan (born 19 December 1970) is a Chinese basketball player.

After showing promise when winning the Troy Stakes as a juvenile in 1879, he recorded a major upset when defeating his more fancied opponents to take the 2000 Guineas in the following spring. He had never been entered in the other British Classic Races, but won at Royal Ascot and in several other top-class races that year. In 1881 he was one of the best staying horses in England, winning seven races including the Epsom Stakes, Rous Memorial Stakes, Great Yorkshire Handicap and Doncaster Cup as well as Queen's Plates at Stockbridge, Newmaket and Liverpool. He developed breathing problems and was never as good again, although he won Queen's Plates at Stockbridge and Newcastle in 1882. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Petronel was a black or brown horse bred in England by his owner Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort. He was sent into training with Joseph Cannon at Bedford Cottage in Newmarket, Suffolk. He could be difficult to handle and was described as \\"not a boy's horse to ride\\". His sire Musket was a stayer whose most important success came in the Ascot Stakes. He had some success as a breeding stallion in England but had his biggest impact after being exported to Australasia in 1878. Petronel's dam Crytheia was a half-sister of the 2000 Guineas winner Vauban. Crytheia and her female-line ancestors have been traditionally placed in Thoroughbred Family 2 but recent research suggest that they may have belonged Family 28. Racing career =1879: two-year-old season= Petronel began his racing career in the Middle Park Stakes, then the most prestigious race for two-year-old, over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October, and finished unplaced behind the favourite Beaudesert. On his only subsequent start of 1879 he contested the ¬£425 Troy Stakes at the same track and won easily from the filly Strathardle. A correspondent for Bell's Life wrote \\"Petronel a tough sort of colt and he should train on, as he possesses plenty of size, good limbs and will probably prove as good a stayer as his sire.\\" =1880: three-year-old season= Vanity Fair On 28 April Petronel, ridden by George Fordham, was one of seventeen colts to contest the 72nd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket and started at odds 20/1. Despite his relatively modest form, and conflicting reports about his performances in training, he had been backed by some professional gamblers of the strength of inside information. Brotherhood started the 9/4 favourite, ahead of the Duke of Westminster's Muncaster on 9/2, with Beauminet, The Abbot and Zealot on 10/1. Petronel was not among the early leaders as Beauminet set the pace, but moved into contention as the runners entered the last quarter mile. Entering the final furlong, Beauminet weakened abruptly, leaving Muncaster in front from Petronel and the rapidly closing The Abbot. In a \\"close and exciting struggle\\" Petronel overhauled Muncaster in the final strides to win by a head, with The Abbot three quarters of a length back in third. The Duke of Beaufort initially thought that his colt had narrowly failed to catch Muncaster, saying \\"ten yards farther and I should have won\\", before the official result was posted. Petronel had no chance to challenge for the Triple Crown as he had not been entered for either the Derby Stakes or the St Leger. He returned to the track on the opening day of the Royal Ascot in June where he finished third to Zealot and The Abbot in the Prince of Wales's Stakes conceding fifteen pounds to the winner. On the following afternoon he won the ¬£880 Biennial Stakes \\"in a canter\\" from Bladud, Brotherhood and Pride of the Ocean. He turned out again on the third day of the meeting and came home third behind the filly Cipolata and the four-year- old Discord in the New Biennial Stakes. In October Petronel was assigned a weight of 103 pounds for the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket and started the 5/1 favourite. He came home seventh of the 18 runners in a race won by Robert the Devil from Cipolata and The Star. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap two weeks later at the same track the colt started a 50/1 outsider under a weight of 112 pounds and finished unplaced behind the four-year-old filly Lucetta. On his final appearance of the season, Petronel ran a close third to Prestonpans and Philammon in the Autumn Cup at Liverpool Racecourse on 10 November. Petronel ended the year with winnings of ¬£5,641 making him the fifth most financially successful horse of the year behind Robert the Devil, Bal Gal, Bend Or and Thebais. =1881: four-year-old season= Vanity Fair Petronel began his third campaign by finishing fourth behind Bend Or, Foxhall and Post Obit in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom Racecourse on 27 April. On 31 May Petronel was assigned top weight of 124 pounds for the ¬£500 for the one and a half mile Epsom Stakes Handicap at the same track and started the 13/8 favourite. Ridden by Fred Archer he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Lord Bradford's Retreat. At the Ascot meeting in June he ran three times, as he had done in 1880. In the Royal Hunt Cup he finished third behind Peter and Sword Dance before turning out for the two and a half mile Gold Cup on the following day. He never looked likely to win but stayed on strongly in the straight to take second place behind Robert the Devil. On the next afternoon he carried 130 pounds in the ¬£1000 Rous Memorial Plate and won from Ishmael and Toastmaster. On 30 June,with Archer in the saddle, he added a win in the Queen's Plate (worth ¬£200) at Stockbridge Racecourse, beating the favourite Exeter by a neck. The death of the Duke of Beaufort's son Fitzroy Somerset, led to Petronel being withrawn from his engagements at the Goodwood meeting. On 14 September Petronel carried top weight of 124 pounds in the ¬£300 Great Yorkshire Handicap at Doncaster Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite against thirteen opponents. Ridden by Archer, he took the lead in the straight and won a \\"good race\\" by a neck from Teviotdale with Syracuse three lengths back in third. At the same meeting he started the 4/11 favourite for the Doncaster Cup and won from Tristan. In October Petronel ran for the second time in the Cesarewitch, but carrying top weight of 132 pounds he finished unplaced behind Foxhall. At the same Newmarket meeting however he won the ¬£300 Queen's Plate over two miles, beating Lord Bradford's Chippendale by three quarters of a length at level weight with the pair finishing well clear of the other two runners. At the next Newmarket meeting he ran unplaced behind Foxhall in the Cambridgeshire. In the ¬£200 Queen's Plate over two miles at Liverpool on 11 November he started the 4/7 favourite, led from the start and won by two lengths from Victor Emmanuel. He ended his season at Manchester Racecourse with a \\"great game\\" performance to finish third in the November Handicap when conceding more that 50 pounds to the winner Gladstone. Petronel's seven victories as a four year old earned his owner a total of ¬£2,677. =1882: five-year-old season= In June 1882 Petronel made his second attempt to win the Ascot Gold Cup. He raced in second place for most of the way but was unable to make any progress in the straight and came home last of the three runners behind Foxhall and Faugh-A-Ballagh. On the following afternoon he stated a 100/1 outsider for the three-mile Alexandra Plate and ran third behind Fiddler and Foxhall. He barely completed the course, finishing \\"very distressed\\" in a \\"slow canter\\". Despite his poor performances at Ascot he returned to winning form three weeks later when he took the ¬£200 Queen's Plate at Newcastle Racecourse. By this time he had developed respiratory problems, being described as a \\"roarer\\" but he was able to win the Queen's Plate at Stockbridge for the second time. At Brighton Racecourse on 1 August he finished third to Fenelon and Isabel in the Brighton Cup over two miles, conceding 42 pounds and 25 pounds to the winner and runner-up respectively. At some point before the autumn of 1882, Petronel appears to have enabled the Duke of Beaufort to gain possession of \\"The Whip\\", an unusual challenge trophy said to be fashioned from the tail-hairs of Eclipse and open only to horses owned by members of the Jockey Club. It is unclear if Petronel won the trophy in a match race or by forfeit. =1883: six-year-old season= At Manchester on 16 May 1883, Petronel ran unplaced as a 20/1 outsider in the Manchester Cup over one and three quarter miles. On 22 October he finished unplaced behind Bendigo in the Cambridgeshire. Stud record At the end of his racing career Petronel was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Duke of Beaufort's stud at Badminton House. The most successful of his offspring were Ragimunde (won Cesarewitch and Great Metropolitan Handicap) and Son of a Gun (won Newmarket Derby, second in Sussex Stakes and Chester Cup). He also sired two important broodmares: Miss Gunning (IRE) whose descendants have included American Flag, Nashua, King of Kings and Dance Partner; and Parting Shot, a half-bred mare whose descendants have included Quashed, Sonic Lady, Attraction and Jet Setting. Petronel died on 3 July 1897 at Badminton House.

On the westbound carriageway of the M20, the hard shoulder was converted to a running lane, giving that carriageway a total of four lanes, all remarked with white lines. A steel barrier now separates these lanes, giving two in each direction. Operation Brock is scheduled to be ready for activation no later than the date of the UK's exit from the EU, 31 January 2020. Road marking reworkings began on or around the night of 26 October 2019. Phases There are four phases of Operation Brock, each trying to cope with more traffic than the last. =Phase 1= The initial phase only concerns heavy goods vehicles (\\"HGVs\\") queuing for the Port of Dover. At this stage Dover TAP is activated and all HGVs using the Port must use the A20 from Folkestone, queuing in the left hand lane. The road will be reduced to 40 mph and all other traffic will use the right hand lane. HGVs will be released in intervals at Western Heights Roundabout to the west of Dover, in order to avoid clogging up the only main road through the town. =Phase 2= Phase 2 encompasses the contraflow between Junctions 8 & 9 on the M20 and now applies to HGVs for both the Port of Dover and Channel Tunnel. Both directions of motorway traffic are directed onto the westbound carriageway contraflow at a speed limit of 50 mph. The eastbound carriageway will then be closed and used for HGV queuing in two lanes (the hard shoulder and 3rd lane) with the other two lanes are reserved for emergency vehicles, maintenance vehicles and amenities. This would be marked out with cones and subjected to a 30 mph speed limit. Due to the contraflow setup, non-HGV traffic cannot join the M20 eastbound at junction 8. =Phase 3= Phase 3 separates the HGVs for the Port of Dover and Channel Tunnel. All HGVs for the Channel Tunnel use the contraflow on the M20, whereas HGVs for the port of Dover head to Manston Airport via the M2, A249 & A299 (advertised routes by Highways England). HGVs will queue here until space is made available on the A256, where the TAP256 will control HGVs in the same way the Dover TAP does on the A20. =Phase 4= Phase 4 only affects HGVs for the Channel Tunnel. The M26 is now closed entirely and HGVs are parked on both carriageways until space at the contraflow on the M20 becomes available. Problems In January 2019, a rehearsal for part of Operation Brock was carried out, using the former Manston Airport as a lorry park. It was criticised for being unrepresentative of the actual situation that would occur in reality. On the first day of the test, only 89 of the planned 150 lorries turned up for the rehearsal. The contraflow has been the height of issues however. As Operation Brock was not used due to Brexit being delayed, the decision was made to partially revert the M20 back to its original state. This was done by reopening the eastbound carriageway fully, and keeping the steel barrier in the event that Operation Brock would have to be activated again in the following months due to the uncertainty of Brexit. The westbound carriageway has stayed at 50 mph. This has decreased safety to motorists travelling on the M20 whether Operation Brock is in force or not, as if they breakdown they are in a live lane and there are no warnings to other traffic like there are on Smart Motorways. In the first few weeks of the contraflow in force, many accidents happened on the stretch, and with no hard shoulder emergency vehicles found it hard to get to the scene.

The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on February 20, 2017. The series follows the adventures and endeavors of SpongeBob and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs seek business advice from an ad executive in Mr. Krabs' endeavor to launch a line of frozen Krabby Patties. Once Mr. Krabs gains success from this, he stops selling fresh Krabby Patties and turns the Krusty Krab into a museum, which means SpongeBob must save the Krabby Patty, as well as his friendship with Patrick. There were five shorts that were shown on February 18, 2017 for the special before it aired. This episode was the only one aired in 2017 during Season 9 as well as the last aired episode of Season 9. The episode was written by Kyle McCulloch, storyboarded by Fred Osmond, and directed by Sherm Cohen and Dave Cunningham, with Alan Smart and Tom Yasumi serving as animation directors. The episode features the guest appearance of Jon Hamm as the voice of Don Grouper. Upon release, the episode drew 2.67 million viewers, and was met with positive reviews. Plot SpongeBob and Patrick are having a fun day when they decide to go to the Barg'N-Mart to buy ice cream. Mr. Krabs then walks by and grabs a box full of frozen food, at which he marvels because of its convenience. SpongeBob sees this and gets the idea to sell frozen Krabby Patties, speculating that people will love them because of how convenient they are. Mr. Krabs hears this and decides to carry out with this idea. Mr. Krabs, along with the help of SpongeBob and his daughter Pearl, create their own cheaply made advertisement for the Frozen Krabby Patty, which he presents to the businessman Don Grouper, who, despite not being impressed with their \\"commercial,\\" decides to help Mr. Krabs create an ad campaign to promote the Frozen Krabby Patties due to the immense potential that the idea has. Grouper hypothesizes that to create a successful ad, they would need someone who could represent the target audience for this new product, which would make the commercial itself more relatable, and therefore memorable. The new face of Frozen Krabby Patties ends up being Patrick Star. After the first commercial airs, Grouper tells Mr. Krabs that he will make even more money if he changes the recipe and adds some \\"filler,\\" much to SpongeBob's dismay. While touring the factory, SpongeBob notices sand being used in the recipe for Patties, which Mr. Krabs tells him to ignore. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs gets his first huge revenue check for the Frozen Krabby Patties. The new Patties are a monstrous success, and everyone seems to be enjoying them, despite some noticeable side effects. Mr. Krabs fires SpongeBob from his fry cook job, and then immediately rehires him to work in the Krusty Krab museum, which documents the complete history of the Krusty Krab, complete with animatronic versions of the employees, and merchandise, which includes the Frozen Krabby Patties themselves. Squidward is also fired by Mr. Krabs, but unlike SpongeBob, he doesn't get a job at the museum. Squidward takes solace in the fact that he can finally live out his dreams. SpongeBob is noticeably disheartened, but he decides to make the best of this situation. Patrick becomes a major celebrity due to the success of the new commercials, but because of this, his friendship with SpongeBob seems to be slowly fading. SpongeBob visits Patrick in his lavish new home but is ridiculed by the snooty new people that are associating themselves with him. SpongeBob tries to have some fun with his friend, but Patrick is pulled away for an important photo shoot. Also, Patrick's 400th commercial is coming up soon, which makes everyone else very excited. SpongeBob heads back to the museum, where he finds Squidward, who gets hired after he wasn't successful in his quest to make his dreams. Later on, Plankton comes by and tries to take the formula and realizes that all traces of the old Krusty Krab are souvenirs. SpongeBob eats a frozen Krabby Patty and discovers that they're made of sand, which was the \\"filler\\" that SpongeBob heard about before from Don Grouper. SpongeBob reads the real secret formula and cooks up a fresh one, and then runs over to Patrick. SpongeBob tells Patrick that the patties are made of sand. SpongeBob then gives Patrick the one he just cooked, which rekindles his love for the sandwich. Patrick says he has a shareholders meeting in a few hours and doesn't know how he'll be able to talk positively about the new Krabby Patties because they taste so bad. At the shareholders meeting, Grouper and Mr. Krabs are proud that the Frozen Krabby Patty ad campaign has been such a success, and are about to unveil their long-awaited, 400th commercial. However, Patrick reveals that the Patties are made of sand, which exposes Don Grouper as a fraud. Soon, everyone begins to vomit up the sand. The depressed Mr. Krabs wanders over to the Krusty Krab, where he's confused when he sees that it is filled with customers enjoying the homemade patties that they love. He goes in the kitchen, where he sees SpongeBob and Patrick cooking the fresh patties. Mr. Krabs asks SpongeBob how much him and Patrick are charging for the patties, which turns out to be nothing at all. Mr. Krabs then makes a deal with SpongeBob that he can be their boss again, and charge actual money for the patties. SpongeBob happily agrees and everything returns to normal.

The basic structure of Homburg's old town dates back to this time. The fortifications were first demolished in 1697, and finally in 1714 when they served as a quarry for the construction of Karlsberg Castle. From 1981 the ruins were excavated and partially restored.

She was part of the Bloomsbury Group and best known for editing the diaries of Virginia Woolf. As a member of the Monuments Men, she was responsible for the protection of cultural artefacts in Europe during the Second World War. Early life Anne Olivier Popham was born in London to Arthur Popham, an expert in Italian art, and Brynhild, daughter of Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier and a cousin of Laurence Olivier. Anne had three brothers, one of whom died young. Her parents divorced in 1924. After her mother's remarriage to F. R. G. N. Sherrard,Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage, ed. Arthur Hesilrige, Kelly's Directories, 1931, p. 737 she moved with them to Dorset. Her mother had three more children with Sherrard. Anne's mother died in 1935, after which she lived with her father. She attended St Paul's Girls' School, then went to Germany to train as an opera singer. Unsuccessful in this, she returned to London to join the Central School of Speech and Drama. Her audition for the Royal Albert Hall failed, and she enrolled at the Courtauld Institute. In 1937 she was in Paris for the World's Fair, where she met and had a relationship with Graham Bell. He painted a portrait of her, which is now at the Tate Museum. After the Second World War, Anne met Quentin Bell, who asked her to model for him. They married in 1952. In 1967, they moved to Cobbe Place in Beddingham, when Bell was made Professor of Art History and Theory at the University of Sussex. The couple had three children, two daughters and a son. Career =Second World War= Anne was compiling a study of Rubens as a research associate of a German historian in London when the war broke out. Her employer was interned and she joined the Ministry of Information, working with Laurie Lee. She was a research assistant in the photographs division and then in the publications department, where she published documentation on the British war effort. She was also an air raid warden in London. In 1945, Anne became one of the Monuments Men, seeking to prevent the destruction of cultural artefacts in Germany, and to restore artworks stolen by the Nazis. She travelled to B√ºnde, the only female member of the programme and the only civilian, albeit with a rank of major. While the men sought out hidden art, she was responsible for organisation and documentation. Anne invited Franz Wolff-Metternich, a curator of historical monuments and an art professor, to the officers' club. She wanted to discuss the restitution of stolen artworks to museums, but her colleagues refused to dine with him. She was to become unpopular with her colleagues for her willingness to socialise with the Germans. Anne's diaries of her time with the Monument Men are now at the Imperial War Museum archives. =Arts Council= Anne joined the Arts Council in 1947. She was responsible for the publication of exhibition catalogues. She also escorted paintings from the Alte Pinakothek in Munich for an exhibition at the National Gallery, London. =Virginia Woolf= Anne assisted her husband, Quentin Bell, in his monumental biography of Virginia Woolf by compiling index cards for each month of her life, and copying Leonard Woolf's diaries. The biography was published to acclaim in 1972. Anne then edited the diaries of Virginia Woolf, publishing them in five volumes starting in 1977. She then published a book Editing Virginia Woolf's Diary, detailing her work as editor. Anne Olivier Bell received honorary doctorates from the University of Sussex and University of York. In 1984, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. =Charleston= The Charleston Farmhouse was the country seat of the Bloomsbury group. After the death of Duncan Grant in 1978, Anne was instrumental in establishing a charitable trust to preserve the property. The artistic influence of the Bloomsbury group was fading by then, and the farmhouse itself was in a poor state of repair. It took six years of fundraising to monetise the trust. Charleston became open to the public in the 1980s, presented in the period style of the Bloomsbury group. Till her death, she was the president of the trust. She was also an expert on the artworks preserved there, and an editor of Canvas, the publication of the Friends of Charleston. Later life While the British government did not initially acknowledge the efforts of the Monument Men, the US established a foundation to recognise them, and Anne was lauded in 2007 for her contributions. She received an MBE in the New Year's Honours list of 2014 for services to Literature and the Arts. Her husband Quentin died in 1996. Anne Olivier Bell died on 18 July 2018.

The artist used his own image in a number of other paintings, including the version of As the Old Sing, So the Young Pipe in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Valenciennes, which dates from a slightly later date than the Bagpipe player. There are at least three more works by the master (or his workshop) in which the artist's own image appears. As Jordaens was already a successful artist when he painted the work it is not obvious why he depicted himself as a humble player of a bagpipe, an instrument used in popular music. In more formal self-portraits, Jordaens has represented himself with a lute, which in the 17th century was regarded as the noblest musical instrument. Jordaens' depiction of himself as a bagpipe player may be interpreted as a form of self-mockery.

The title has been translated as \\"Useful for the Kitchen\\". The text is contained in the Hans Sloane collection of manuscripts in the British Library and is numbered Sloane MS 468.  Author  The author's name is unknown. It has been theorised that he was \\"the high- ranking chef of a large kitchen\\", though not one as large as that of Richard II (for example, compare this text to The Forme of Cury). It is accordingly assumed that he was a man. The resemblance of some of the author's recipes to early French recipes indicates the author may have had a reading knowledge of Middle French. The author's references to \\"fyssh day\\" and Lent indicate that the author cooked for a Christian household.  Text  = Contents = The manuscript contains recipes for things such as butter of almond milk, roasted duck, a meat pottage and a sweet-and-sour fish preparation, among others. The manuscript has been described as loosely organised and having no real system beyond a basic grouping of recipes for cooking birds, blancmange, and fruits and flowers. = Purpose = It has been suggested that the text was not intended as a cookbook for the layperson since the level of lay literacy at the time was still relatively low and distribution of manuscripts was a \\"patchy affair\\". Several alternative purposes for its creation have been proposed, including: serving as testimony to the author's culinary skill, presenting and influencing trends, securing the status of the chef as a professional, and serving as a tool for professionals (e.g. doctors and lawyers) aspiring to raise their class status by learning about higher-class meals. The latter theory has been proposed in part due to the text's location in the Sloane collection of manuscripts, where it is placed in a selection of medical recipes described as \\"utilitarian\\". = Modern study = The text is notable to both culinary historians and linguists, containing several examples of unique recipes and vocabulary.  Historical interest  Of historical interest, the work contains the only references to recipes such as pyany (a poultry dish garnished with peonies) and heppee (a rose-hip broth). The text was written in the time of Geoffrey Chaucer and provides insight into the types of food Chaucer may have eaten and written about. As was the case with most late medieval cooking, the author did not associate colours with specific flavours, but he did occasionally use colour to denote contrasts in flavour. For example, one of the included fish recipes uses saffron in part of the dish flavoured with sugar and ginger (giving that part a reddish, saffron colour), and leaves the remaining part of the dish white to denote that it is flavoured with sugar only.  Linguistic interest  Of linguistic interest, it contains the only known references in fourteenth-century English texts to cormorants and finches. Additionally, it contains the only references to woodcocks, botores (bittern), pluuers (plovers), and teals in fourteenth- century English cookbooks, though all are found elsewhere in menus of that era.

History Some sources attribute the founding of the monastery to a Norman princess, Aloara, but another claim is that it was founded in 1050 by Donna Riccarda, sister of Riccardo I, Prince of Capua and Count of Aversa. However the Codex of San Biagio from 1043 already mentions the monastery. It was built adjacent or within the walls of a moated castle. The monastery gave name to this Borgo of the ancient town, although remaining outside of the main walls till 1382. The Benedictine monastery was dependant to the Monastery of San Lorenzo Fuori Le MuraAversa a Domenico Cimarosa nel primo centenario dalla sua morte: XI gennaio, By Aversa Comitato italiano per le onoranze a Domenico Cimarosa, Aversa, published Naples (1901); page 29. Over the centuries the rule and structure of the monastery changed. It became a site of local pilgrimage, and for example was visited in 1734 by the Bourbon Charles IV of Naples. In 1806, the monastery was suppressed. Over the years since the monastery has been used as a jail, barracks, school and other functions. It kept a diminished house of worship housing a small number of nuns, who from 1932 to 1954, were under the leadership of the abbess Maria Concetta De Pietro. The structures suffered much damage during the second world war. On August 20, 1943, the paintings of Malinconico and Caracciolo, were destroyed by an allied bombardment. Further damage occurred during an earthquake of 1980. The cloister was originally romanesque and rebuilt in a baroque style. Of the church, the pronaos still remains with Two 18th century stucco medallions depicting Saints Benedetto and Biagio. The church contains 18 canvases depicting the Life of St Benedict painted (1701) by Pietro Martino. The counterfacade has five canvases by Giovanni Battista Lama, depicting: St Phillip baptizes a Eunuch, St Catherine of Alexandria, St Benedict of Norsia and Santa Scholastica, and Santa Dorotea and St Ambrosius and St Theodosius. Both Martino and Lama were pupils of Luca Giordano. The Maiolica pavement dates to early 18th century. The chapels on the right (back to front) also contain original artworks: *1st chapel: Adoration of the Magy (16th century) by Fabrizio Santafede *2nd chapel: St Peter freed by the Angel *3rd chapel: Adoration by the Shepherds (1767) by Andrea Starace *4th chapel: 15th century wooden crucifix *4th & 5th chapels: contain elements of the organ and an 18th century wooden choir *5th chapel: Assumption of the Virgin with Saints Secondino & Phillip Neri by Andrea Vaccaro (1604 - 1670), pupil of Girolamo Imparato. The sacristy houses a St Cajetan (XVII sec.), attributed to Agostino Beltrano, and an Incredulity of St Thomas(16th century). The main altar, which shows the influence of Vanvitelli with marbles by Paolo Persico, houses an altarpiece depicting a Martyrdom of San Biagio (1588) once attributed to Marco da Siena but more likely to later to Giovanni Battista Graziano, a local painter. The chapels on the right (front to back) also contain original artworks: *6th chapel: San Benedict with the Rule-book, corvus, and the Abbey of Montecassino in background (late 16th century) by Giovanni Vincenzo Forli *7th chapel of SS.

Origins Rastafariansm was brought to Dominica in the early 1970s by students returning from studying abroad in the United States and Trinidad. The Rasta ideology spread through the ranks of educated young men and then down into the lower classes. Government officials became alarmed by the movement's anti-Catholic stance, use of marijuana and acceptance of socialism. Provisions According to the law, adherents of Rastafarianism wearing their hair in dreadlocks (referred to as \\"Dreads\\") were subject to arrest without a warrant, were not permitted bail and could be held without charges for at least 48 hours. The law also prohibited the prosecution of any individual who killed or injured a \\"Dread\\" inside a place of residence. Legislative history Prime Minister Patrick John and the Dominica Labour Party spearheaded the effort to pass the bill in the House of Assembly of Dominica. The bill was passed unopposed by members of the Dominica Freedom Party. Impact As a result of the act, Dominica residents and law enforcement were granted immunity from prosecution for assaulting or murdering Rastafarians. During the years the act was in effect, Rastafarians were arrested, beaten and killed. Some sources also report that adherents had their dreadlocks forcibly cut off during this time, while others cut their own hair and left the movement to avoid persecution. Many Rastafarians fled into the rainforest to escape the effects of the Dread Act. In 1975, the government announced an amnesty for \\"Dreads\\" living in the forests. However, these groups did not trust the government and refused to accept. The government then established an eight-person task force to decide on the matter. The committee, led by Reverend A. Didier, concluded that the majority of Dominica's \\"Dread\\" population was made up of peaceful activists and that the Dread Act should be annulled and replaced by a new law designed to combat terrorism. However, the government rejected the committee's findings. Repeal Eugenia Charles voiced opposition to the bill shortly after it was passed, but took no steps to repeal it during her tenure as a House representative. When Charles became prime minister in 1980, she initially decided not to repeal the act. However, after \\"Dreads\\" living in the woods kidnapped a prominent citizen, the government decided to revamp the strict parameters of the Dread Act. On February 16, 1981, the House of Assembly passed the Prevention of Terrorism Temporary Provisions Act, finally acting on the recommendation of the Didier Committee. Section 18 of the new legislation repealed the Dread Act.

It is managed by the Department of Nature Conservation. Fort Klapperkop, completed in 1897, is situated inside the reserve. The reserve is named for the prominent Klapperkop, a hill (or kopje) vegetated with klapper trees (Strychnos pungens) on its northern slopes. Activities It has become popular with cyclists, joggers and sightseers. Self-guided hikes are permitted. Visiting hours and safety Despite the recommended daylight visiting hours, the two entrances in Johann Rissik Drive are not currently closed at night. This has however come under review due to repeated crime incidents. Criminals posing as joggers have in the past robbed visitors during the day, and occupants of cars have been attacked at view sites. As of 2018, three gangs were believed to be targeting visitors to the reserve, and 30 muggings were recorded in a fortnight. Location and habitat It is situated near the Voortrekker Monument and Groenkloof Nature Reserves at the southern entrance to Pretoria. It is situated on a spur running west to east, and can be explored from Johann Rissik drive which connects Nelson Mandela Drive in the west to Waterkloof Ridge residential area in the east. In aggregate these reserves conserve some 1,400 ha of bankenveld vegetation which is threatened in Gauteng. Wildlife The reserve was stocked with various game species since the late 1990s. These include zebra, blue wildebeest and red hartebeest. Small mammals include jackal, mongooses, hedgehogs, hares and porcupines. At the same time the extensive plantations of black wattle were removed, allowing the grassland vegetation to recover.

History Gerard van Honthorst, Artemisia Drinking the Ashes of Mausoleus, c.1635, Princeton University Art Museum - collected by Frederick Henry's widow and shown in the Huis ten Bosch The Huis ten Bosch, now a Dutch royal residence, was built on a site near The Hague given to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange in 1645 by the Dutch Republic Max Rooses, Jordaens: sa vie et ses oeuvres, Amsterdam, 1906, pp. 160-174.. In 1647, before it was completed, Frederick Henry died and his devoted widow Amalia of Solms-Braunfels designed to make substantial changes to the design, turning it into a memorial to her late husband Barbara Gaehtgens and Aude Virey-Wallon, L'Art√©mise de G√©rard van Honthorst ou les deux corps de la reine, in Revue de l'Art, 1995, n. 109, pp. 13-25.. She also acquired a painting of Artemisia, who raised the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus as a memorial to her dead husband Mausolus. The Huis ten Bosch's dedication to Frederick Henry's memory can also be seen in its main hall, the Oranjezaal, which contains a vast cycle of paintings celebrating his deeds and virtues, inspired by Peter Paul Rubens' Marie de Medici cycle in Paris and the paintings allegorical ceiling paintings of James I of England in the Banqueting House in London. Several painters were taken on to contribute to the cycle, from both the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. Triumph was the culmination of the cycle - Jordaens had already received a commission for the room's Allegory of Time in 1650. After the death of both Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, Jordaens was now the leading painter of the Spanish Netherlands. Amalia took on her husband's former secretary Constantijn Huygens and the architect Jacob van Campen to supervise the painting of the Oranjezaal cycle. Letters survive from Jordaens to Huygens, showing that Van Campen sent a plan of the room to the painter and that he proposed a number of modifications to his original idea. Three oil sketches for the ceiling by Jordaens also survive, probably produced for Amalia's and Van Campen's approval Lidwien Speleers e Margriet van Eikema Hommes, Jordaens and the Oranjezaal in Huis ten Bosch Palace, the paintings and the letters, in Birgit Ulrike M√ºnch and Zita √Ågota Pataki (ed.), Jordaens: Genius of Grand Scale, Stoccarda, 2012, pp. 131-140.. None of the sketches totally matches the final painting, probably showing that not all of the painter's proposals were approved. Another letter survives from Jordaens to Amalia, explaining the allegorical meanings of the finished workPublished in Max Rooses, Jordaens: sa vie et ses oeuvres, 1906.

This drawing was an allegory of Frederick Henry's triumphal entry into the Hague after the victories of Wesel and 's-Hertogenbosch, his two great successes in the Eighty Years' War. In Jordaens' work, Frederick Henry is shown wearing armour and a deep red cloak (reminiscent of ancient Roman triumphal dress) seated on a throne in a triumphal chariot. A golden sculpture of Victory behind him holds two crowns, placing the one in her right hand on Frederick Henry's head and holding the other towards Frederick Henry's son William II of Orange, shown as a young horseman in the bottom right. The nude Hymen) behind William crowns him with a golden garland surmounted by a crown - within that wreath are two joined hands, symbolising William's marriage to Charles I's daughter Mary. The Oranjezaal Frederick Henry's chariot is drawn by four white horses with golden harness. A male figure wearing only a pseudo- Turkish dress rides one of them, holding a cornucopia of fruits and ears of grain, a symbol of abundance. Beside the horses Minerva (left) and Mercury (right, in a winged hat and sandals) act as grooms and symbolise Frederick Henry's virtues of wisdom, martial virtue and cunning. Under their hooves the horses trample two terrible serpents (Discord) and a figure biting a heart (Envy). Two lions in front of the horses symbolise bravery and courage, whilst four of the Muses to the far left symbolise the four provinces of the Dutch Republic. In the background is a triumphal arch flanked by two golden statues on pedestals, representing Frederick Henry's father William the Silent and his half-brother Maurice of Nassau (right), who both preceded him as Statolder. People gather around the statues to watch the triumphal procession. Above the horses a winged figure with a trumpet (Fame) beats back a skeleton, whilst higher still a woman in a white robe holds palm branches in both hands. She is surrounded by putti unrolling a long scroll inscribed ULTIMUS ANTE OMNES DE PARTA PACE TRIUMPHUS (Fairest above all triumphs is that through which peace is gained), shown by a letter in the National Library of the Netherlands to have been invented by Huygens Cfr. Inge Broekman, Constantijn Huygens, de kunst en het hof, PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2017, p. 149.. This refers to the Peace of Munster, the section of the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 which guaranteed the Dutch Republic's independence and abandoned all Spanish claims to its lands \\\\- Frederick died before the Treaty but his military victories had decisively paved the way for it. Several other putti at the very top of the painting hold a long festoon full of fruit, whilst others tip another cornucopia of coins and jewelry over Frederick Henry, symbolising riches and prosperity.

The park has a wooded river valley that follows the course of the River Alyn and high cliffs from within the Clwydian Range of mountains, with views of the range's tallest mountain Moel Famau. The park has a visitor centre, woodland walks, and two landmarks‚Äîa historic corn mill called Pentre Mill, and a gorge called Devil's Gorge. History The site was the location of Pentre Mill, a corn mill dating to the early 19th century. The mill was powered by a water wheel near the River Alyn; the water wheel was closed in the 1940s and restored in the 1990s. The park was also the location of lead mining and quarrying. In 1926, the Crosville Motor Bus Company acquired land at Loggerheads and constructed tea rooms and gardens for visitors who often arrived at the park by bus. Other amenities included a bandstand, boating lake, and refreshment kiosks. Loggerheads was popular in the 1920s and 1930s but declined after the Second World War. In 1974, Clwyd County Council bought the land and the gardens for use as a country park. In 1984 a wooden tea room burned down. Facilities Loggerheads visitor centre The park includes a visitor centre, corn mill, cafe, picnic area, nature trails, and walking tours. One of the mill buildings has been turned into an interactive audiovisual display explaining the landscape of the Clwydian Range and the Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Landmarks =Pentre Mill= John Ingleby Pentre Mill is a Grade II* listed corn mill at the park. A 1796 painting of Loggerheads by John Ingleby depicts a mill and water wheel at Loggerheads. The name of this mill is unconfirmed and Cadw, the Welsh Heritage Body, has confirmed Pentre as early 19th century. The mill was used to grind corn and cereal into flour and also as a circular saw to cut wood. The mill was powered by a water wheel fed from the nearby River Alyn. It was in continuous use until 1942, when it was closed. After closure, the mill fell into disrepair. It was restored to working order in 1995. However, due to degradation of the sluice gate, weir, and water course, there was no water reaching the wheel. In 2012 the water course was repaired and the water wheel turns once more. =Devil's Gorge= Devil's Gorge Devil's Gorge is a gorge located in the park with two solid limestone walls that are high. Walkers cross a bridge over the gorge as part of a route through the park; it is also a destination for rock climbing and abseiling. One climbing route is called the Devil's Haircut.

Distribution E. bungii is found in the north Pacific, and is considered to be an expatriate to Arctic waters. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= There are two peaks of reproduction in E. bungii. At Station P, these peaks were observed to occur in early May and early June. At Site H, off of the east coast of Hokkaido, on the other hand, reproduction occurred from April to June or July, and in August. Spawning occurs at night, when the females migrate to the mixed layer. Nauplii through stage II copepodites are found almost exclusively in the top of depth, and they are particularly abundant above the thermocline. During the peak of their abundance, stage III through V copepodites and stage VI female copepodites are found above the thermocline. Stage VI male copepodites, on the other hand, are primarily found between when they peak in abundance. It has been proposed that at Site H, the young spawned earlier in the year enter diapause as stage IV copepodites, and thus have an annual lifecycle, and those spawned later enter diapause as stage III copepodites, and then enter diapause again as stage V copepodites, rendering their life cycle biennial. At Station P, the life cycle of E. bungii seems to be biennial, with stage III or IV copepodites entering diapause in their first summer, and then entering diapause again, usually as stage V copepodites, their second summer.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. First marketed as the Bayfield 30, the name was eventually change to the Bayfield 32 due to pressure from United States dealers who insisted on calling the boat a \\"32\\" based on its LOA, which included the clipper bow and bowsprit. The combination of traditional design, modern construction, and roomy interiors for this size of the boat was popular from the start. More than 300 Bayfield 30/32s were built during their long production run. Production The design was built by Bayfield Boat Yard, first in Bayfield, Ontario, and later in Clinton, Ontario, Canada, but it is now out of production. Design Bayfield 32 The Bayfield 30/32 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. Most were built with a cutter rig, though a few ketches were produced, with a sail area of . A small number of special, tall-rig sloops were built, with of additional mast height, and an extended bowsprit increasing the total sail area to . This version was sold as the Bayfield 32C. The 30/32 featured a clipper bow, a bowsprit, wooden decorative trailboards on the bow, a keel- mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel. The hulls were solid fiberglass in a fairly heavy lay up with mat and woven roving. The deck was cored with 3/8th-inch balsa, while some high-load areas were cored with plywood. The 30/32 displaces and carries of internally mounted lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and most boats were fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of two cylinders and or, less commonly three cylinders and , though a few early Bayfield 30/32s were fitted with a unique Sperry Vickers hydraulic drive and a few with Mercedes-Benz diesels.

The galley is located on the starboard side and has a stainless steel sink with a pressurized water supply, a two burner stove with oven, and a ice box that has a teak ice grate. Originally the cabin was fitted with dorade vents and an opening hatch, along with five fixed ports, and one opening port in the heads, though later boats had the number of port lights increased to eight. Operational history In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"The Bayfield line of sailboats are dedicated cruising boats and aren't known for their outstanding performance. However, the Bayfield 32 equipped with a tall rig is supposed to be quite fast, although it will not point as high as a club racer with a fin keel. This boat has a shallow draft, a wide beam, and plenty of living space down below. The Bayfield 32 is a good looking boat with a distinctive appearance which sets it apart from the many look-alike boats that were manufactured in Canada in large numbers in the 1970s and 1980s.\\" A 2010 review in Sailing magazine concluded, \\"the Bayfield 32 is another example of why there's no excuse not to get out on the water.

They killed seven people there in a mass shooting which has been referred to as the Sofitel massacre. Four of those killed were employees and three were customers. Police believed the gunmen were three robbers who attempted to break into the hotel's safe deposit boxes, and that they killed the victims to eliminate any witnesses. The robbers also took some staff members hostage, apparently to search for a master key of the boxes. The French government was criticised by hotel and restaurant unions as well as the police, demanding tougher action against crime. In addition, it happened after the government abolished the death penalty for murder and in another move made it easier for long-term prisoners to win parole. Jean Roussel, a 38-year-old robber, was arrested soon after whilst the other suspects escaped. Roussel barely spoke amid the investigation and he died from a heart attack in 1985. In June 1987, Fran√ßois Arpinot, a scrap dealer, and G√©rard Rolland, a nightclub bouncer, were sentenced to 18 and 15 years in prison, respectively.

The stadium was built next door (on the east side) to the All England Sports Ground, it was owned by Jack Bingham and Charles Sampey. Greyhound Racing The stadium opened to greyhound racing on 11 June 1946 and the racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club). Racing took place every Thursday and Saturday and the hare system used was an inside electric sledge hare. Speedway The stadium hosted speedway which was held during 1949 and 1950.

He painted several works with this title, a Dutch proverb - this is the earliest of them, whilst another is now in Valenciennes.  History  The painting is an expression of the age-old Dutch proverb 'Soo d'oude song soo pepen de jong'. The proverb can also be read at the top of the work. It meanstthat the young always follow the example set by the old. Jacob Jordaens I has depicted the proverb several times in the course of his career. This painting, signed in 1638, is the earliest known version.  Description  The painting shows a domestic scene of a family at a set table. In the center the mother is sitting with the baby on her lap. On the right, grandmother puts on her spectacles to read the lyrics of the song and sing along. On the left, the grandfather sits in an armchair singing along with a songbook in his hand. At the back the father blows with full force on a bagpipes. Not only the elderly make music, also the children participate. The baby blows on the whistle of his rattle and his big brother plays a recorder. Even the dog has pricked its ears to the sound of the music. Jordaens has possibly depicted acquaintances from his surroundings in this family scene. In the old man one recognizes Adam van Noort, tutor and father in law of the painter. Jordaens drew various studies by Van Noort, making it easy to identify. There is less certainty about the other figures. It has been suggested that the piper might be Jordaens himself.

He is best known for leading a pirate settlement and trading post on Madagascar. History The privateering ship Charming Mary left New York in 1694, bound for Madagascar under captain Richard Glover. It was captured by pirates under John Ireland and Richard Bobbington and cruised against Moors in the Indian Ocean for several years. Collins had been aboard the Charming Mary, either as one of the original New York crew, or having joined when the ship put into Ile Ste Marie to trade and take on additional crew to continue its piracy. Alternately, Collins may have come to the area with Henry Every before transferring to the Charming Mary. Every's ship Fancy left London in 1693 and was in the Indian Ocean when he captured the treasure ship Gunsway in 1695. A Malagasy ruler named Ratsimilaho (purportedly born in 1694) was said to be the son of a native Queen and an English pirate named ‚ÄúTom,‚Äù often cited as Thomas Tew; it's also possible Thomas Collins was the father. By 1699 Collins had joined Evan Jones aboard his ship Beckford Galley. Working with pirate trader Abraham Samuel at his Port Dauphin settlement, they captured the ship Prophet Daniel, among whose crew was future New York City alderman and mayor John Cruger. Jones tried to recruit additional pirates but some declined so they could return to England or America and seek a pardon. Collins may have returned with them, as he was next listed as carpenter of the Degrave, a ship which left England in early 1701 but was lost off Madagascar that June. Most of the crew made their way among the Malagasy natives, leaving aboard other ships or settling with local tribes. Collins joined the crew of pirate George Booth and helped him capture the Speaker late that year. Later he sailed with Thomas Howard aboard the Prosperous but was wounded and left behind when Howard's sailors started a fight at the plantation of ex-pirate Aert Van Tuyl. Escaping from Van Tuyl, Collins had made his way back to Port Dauphin by 1707. Abraham Samuel had died the previous year and Collins took over his settlement and trading post, remaining there for over a decade. Historian Charles Grey writes, ‚ÄúThe position was very valuable, for Collins, like Samuells, held the monopoly of the slave trade and, like Samuells, charged ~1oo to each ship that called in for that purpose, or to provision and shelter.‚Äù Future Bahamas Governor Woodes Rogers visited Collins there in 1714. Robert Drury, a fellow castaway from the Degrave, came to Port Dauphin in 1716 and found Collins there with fellow ex-pirate trader John Pro, noting that they ‚Äúhad lived without pirating for nine years.‚Äù By 1718 there were only a few ex-pirates left at Port Dauphin so Collins and John Pro left for Ile Ste Marie, where they died in 1719. Royal Navy ships ousted the last of the Madagascar pirates in 1723.

GK 966 Kneeling Leda with Her Children is a 16th-century painting by Leonardo da Vinci's pupil Giampietrino. It is now in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel).  Description  It is based on sketches for Leonardo's own Leda and the Swan, now in the collections of Windsor Castle, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and Chatsworth House. The beautiful princess Leda is seduced by Zeus who transformed himself to a magnificent swan. On the same night, Leda would also sleep with her husband, King Tyndareus of Sparta. The result is a pair of twins, the beautiful Helen and the immortal Pollux as children of Zeus, Clytemnestra and the mortal Castor as offspring of Tyndareus. While Giampietrino omitted the swan in the Kassel painting, the eggshells betray the divine liaison. Infrared spectroscopy has revealed two different underdrawings: one underdrawing corresponding with the figure of Leda and her children, and a second one, using the spolvero technique, exactly repeating The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne of the Louvre. This states the existence of an original cartoon by Leonardo accessible to his pupil Giampietrino. If Giampietrino also used a cartoon of the Leda by his master is still unknown. A probable model could have been the antique statue of the Crouching Venus. The figurative parts with their monumental and dominant appearance are painted in 1512/20 by Giampietrino. The Nordic landscape with its rich details is attributed to the landscape painter Cesare Bernazzano, who also collaborated with other pupils of Leonardo. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe admired the painting in Kassel in 1779, 1783, 1792 and 1801 considering it an original Leonardo painting.  Provenance  William VIII, landgrave of Hesse-Kassel acquired the painting in 1756 at a Paris auction as a depiction of Caritas by Leonardo da Vinci, because one of the children and the eggshells were overpainted. In 1806, in the Coalition Wars it was stored by William I in the Sababurg to hide it from the advancing Grand Arm√©e. Yet the hideout was revealed and general Joseph Lagrange seized it as loot. The painting should never reach its final destination, Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, home of the Empress Jos√©phine. It was lost in the chaos of war and came instead on the French art market. It subsequently came to light in a Parisian private collection in 1821. The Mannheim art dealer Artaria offered it to William I who strictly refused to rebuy stolen works of his art collection. Through mediation of the Belgian painter and art dealer Pierre Joseph Lafontaine it joined the art collection of King William II in The Hague. After his death the painting came in the possession of his brother Prince Frederick of Orange-Nassau and thereupon to the house of Nassau-Weilburg in Neuwied. In 1940 it was acquired for 150.000 Reichsmark by Gauleiter Erich Koch as a gift to Hermann G√∂ring who already possessed a large art collection of nudes of the Gothic and Renaissance period in Carinhall. In 1943 he organised its storage in the Salzbergwerk Altaussee in Styria. After the end of the Second World War the Leda was brought to the Central Collecting Point in Munich and in 1962 reacquired by the Land Hesse. Sources *J√ºrgen M.

Its founder, Kristi Lehtis, is an established Estonian chocolate maker and chocolate art collector. The objective of the museum is to show and inform visitors about the history of the Estonian chocolate industry and traditions since 1806.  Building  The museum is located in a historical building bordering on Suur-Karja Street 20 / P√§rnu Road 12.

The premises are located around a courtyard, the main hall is located on Suur-Karja street. The building was remodeled in 1922, 1928 and 1938 according to plans by architect Edgar Johan Kuusik. By then, the building was housing Krediit Bank and the main Post Office. In the basement of the building, parallel to P√§rnu maantee, there was a bowling alley.

Chocolala Chocolate Museum is located in the basement of the building that used to serve as the vault of a local bank.  Collections  The collections of the museum are categorized into boxes, wrappings, and molds for chocolate and marzipan. There are approximately 1,500 items, exposed in a 150 square meters dedicated space. Movies on Estonian chocolate making from the 1930s and 1950s are projected. The museum exposes also original art pieces from Estonian artists, such as a large chocolate sculpture inspired from a work by Simson von Seakyl, a dress made from chocolate wrappings, a wall painting of the Mayan God Quetzalcoatl and a cocoa tree. Prepare your visit Tallinn confectionery industry is over two centuries old. A guild of sugar bakers, making cakes, chocolate, marmalade and marzipan existed at the beginning of the 18 century. Marzipan particularly was made in Tallinn since the Middle Ages and was sold at the Town council pharmacy of Tallinn for pains of unrequited love and for stimulating mental activity. =19th Century= Lorenz Cawiezel, a sugar baker who had trained in Switzerland bought a house in Tallinn Pikk Street and established a confectionery shop there in 1806. The house stood at the place where the Caf√© Maiasmokk is located now. In 1864, Georg Stude bought the property and extended it to the neighbouring building. The new chocolate and marzipan confectionery became known far and wide, even the Tsar's court in Saint Petersburg sent for these sweets. =The Golden Age (1900-1940)= The Golden Age of Estonian confectioners was the period of the Independent Republic of Estonia (1918-40). The local confectionery industry developed rapidly in the mid-1920s, although slowing down during the 1929 economic crisis (1929-33). It picked up quickly again beginning from 1934/35 because customs policies put into place at that time favored the local industry. Protective customs tariffs discouraged the import of manufactured sweets and at the same time, low tariffs were set for raw ingredients used in confectionery. Very quickly, Estonian confectionery producers became very competitive. About ten major confectioneries were active in Tallinn in the 1920s and the 1930s. Kawe, Ginovker, Brandmann and Klausson were the largest but the smaller businesses like G. Stude, Riola, Efekt, Endla, Eelis, Soliid and some others were worthy rivals to the big ones. In 1937, Kawe produced 1,416 tonnes of sweets, followed by Ginovker at 573 tonnes and Brandmann at 483 tonnes. The total production of the sweets industry was of more than 3,000 tonnes in 1937. Kawe Kawe was established by two brothers Karl and Kolla Wellner of Sangaste, Estonia who had owned the chocolate factory Renom√©e in St Petersburg before the 1917 Russian Revolution. They launched their Tallinn business at 62, M√º√ºrivahe Street first as chocolate makers, later adding caramel, marmalade and candy to their assortment. As the brothers had got lots of experience already from their Petersburgian business, they produced high quality sweets that were in demand both at home and in foreign markets. They began to export their production in 1925. To stay competitive, the enterprise was extended and modernized continuously - new buildings were erected, equipment renewed, new shops opened in Tallinn, Tartu and other Estonian towns. As export increased, trade agencies were opened in London, New York, Stockholm, Riga, Paris, Montreal, Casablanca and Cape Town. The Kawe sweets were especially popular in Sweden, England and the USA. In the late 1930s, Kawe employed nearly 500 people and its production represented 43 % of the whole Estonian confectionery production. Ginovker The Ginovkers' family business, initially called Orjol, started in Tallinn at 6, Laulupeo Street in 1906. A small workshop at start with only a couple of workers, it evolved into a considerable business in the early 1920s. They also began to make biscuits and cookies. From 1929, chocolate sweets were produced at the Chocolate and Biscuit Confectionery Ginovker & Ko. By the early 1930s Ginovker had become the main biscuit producer in Estonia with an extensive assortment. The best known sweets were toffees and caramel candy V√§hjad (Crawfish) and Barbarissi-segu (Barberry mix). Candy jars were popular containing candies filled with liqueur, peppermint and monpansjee (a local name for fruit drops). Biscuits were tea-, milk-, cocoa-, and chocolate- flavored. The Ginovkers‚Äô production was exported to Europe, South-Asia, Middle East and elsewhere. 250 people were employed by the company. Brandmann August Brandmann's Confectionery was established at 4, V√§ike-Tartu Road in 1901 with only four workers. Success came quickly and in 1913, the Grand Prix was brought home from an international exhibition in Rome. In 1933, the company moved its premises to 27-29 Sakala street in Tallinn and in 1936, the son of August, Elmar, took over the management of the company. British educated, Elmar made of Brandmann one of the most innovative Estonian chocolate makers. Brandmann's Confectionary was the first enterprise in Estonia to produce cocoa powder and cocoa butter, The business employed 165 people by the end of 1939. Klausson Rudolf Klausson's Confectionery was established in 1920 and some years later it worked at 1, Toomvaestekool Street in Tallinn. In 1930 the assortment included over 30 kinds of fruit drops and lozenges, chocolate and biscuits. In 1927 coffee making was launched. In 1927 the Klausson's Confectionery was awarded the grand prix of the Tallinn fair- the gold medal. Riola Robert Weinreich founded Riola (initially called Chocolate Confectionery Gloria) in 1922. When the business went bankrupt in 1927, AS Robert Holst & Ko acquired Riola. The peak period of Riola was in 1937/38 when the business bought a large building at 150, P√§rnu Road. The factory had modern equipment and employed 124 people. Riola produced fruit drops, lozenges, caramel, drag√©e and chocolate in bars and sweets. A big part of the production (especially caramel) went for export to the USA, South America, Canada, Africa, India, Palestine and several European countries. =The Market (1918-1940)= When competition increased, advertising and design acquired and more importance. The shops became really attractive with their beautifully designed chocolate bars and boxes in variegated shapes and sizes, the many colored jars in spiral rows and single jars of sweet-smelling caramel. The atmosphere in these shops was quite special. The firms representative shops were modern with glittering showcases and glass shelves. In 1936, Kawe opened a new shop in the building of the House-Owners Bank (Tallinna Majaomanike Pank) on Vabaduse (Freedom) Square. Meta Kelgo, the 1929 Estonian beauty queen, was the shop assistant there. The interior of the luxurious Stude shop, the above-mentioned Maiasmokk Caf√©, retained its initial design, but was emphasized with the distinguished design of the chocolate boxes and painted Marzipan figures. Product design was considered important. The design of chocolate boxes and bars as well as advertising, give us a good idea of the past fashions, tastes and changing styles. We can witness the changes of styles beginning from the eclectic Juugend (local term for Art Nouveau from the German Jugendstil) and shifting to Art Deco that suited the then urban mode of life. People of all ages were fond of sweets. Thus the market and various buyers determined a rather wide scope of topics for the design. Smaller kids were offered fairy-tale characters, older ones popular film stars like Shirley Temple or contemporary news items like the Canadian quintuplets. Along with the never- fading national romantic heroes, the modern Art Deco man and woman were represented. The topics were well planned like for example the Brandmann series, Vilsandi Birds, or People's Candy. There were humorous series like the Ermos lazybones or Brandmann's Max and Moorits, Society and European People, where the Russians were depicted with the Red Star and the Germans with the Swastika. World events were reflected ‚Äî Brandmann, for example, made a chocolate bar dedicated to the 1940 Helsinki Olympic Games that were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II. The sweets had names like Princess, Ballerina, Mermaid, Cabaret, Boxing, Lazybones, Sultan, Haiti, Hummingbird, Max and Moorits, Youth, Kiss-kiss, Netti, Maie, Gita, Eve, Crawfish... =The Soviet Era (1940-1991)= In 1940, all the existing confectionery businesses were nationalized. Five enterprises ‚Äî Efekt, Eelis, Endla, Soliid and Ermos ‚Äî were merged with Kawe. The merged enterprise continued to operate under the name Kawe until 1948. On 1 April 1948, the company was renamed Kalev Confectionery Factory. Also, Riola, Stude and Brandmann were merged into a new confectionery company, Karamell. In 1958, a new company, Uus Kalev, opened a year earlier at 139, P√§rnu Road, absorbed Karamell. In 1962, Uus Kalev and Kalev merged into what became known as the Kalev confectionery factory. During the Soviet period, Kalev produced sweets for Estonia and the whole of the former Soviet Union.

It was built from 1875 to 1890. It is also known as Duntryleague with Lodge, Park, Gates, Stables and Orange Golf Club. The property is owned by The Orange Golf Club Ltd and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In the 1820s surveyors of the interior of the New South Wales colony were required to select, survey and map out one mile square areas of land which were to be reserved for future villages as population numbers increased. In 1829 surveyor J. B. Richards reserved land for the town of Orange. This remained empty through the 1830s, although it was surrounded by three substantial land grants to Simeon Lord and Joseph Moulder (to the north, south and east of the reserve), and to the west to William Ealy Sampson. Sampson's 1836 of grant of contained the property which became known as Campdale, and this contained the property which later became Duntryleague. Sampson did not remain at Campdale, but settled in Mudgee. By 1846 these three original grantees were already leasing some of their land and dividing other parts for sale. George Mills opened the Boree Inn about to the west of Campdale's southwest corner on the main road boundary of Sampson's grant. This building was situated on land that later incorporated part of the Duntryleague property, and remained until it was demolished in the mid 20th century. =Dalton family= In 1847 James Dalton Senior opened a store at the village of Summerhill (a short distance from the site of the village of Orange).Hughes Trueman Ludlow, Orange City Council, 1986. James Dalton was a shopkeeper, part-owner of the Dalton Brothers' Store, a prominent institution in the town of Orange, on its main street, Summer Street. Originally Dalton was from Galbally, County Limerick, Ireland. Initially he set up a store in an earlier settlement (before Orange was established) outside (east of the present) Orange. After the town of Orange was proclaimed in 1845, he began trading in the town on the corner of Post Office Lane in 1849, in a small store which was replaced by 1865 by the easternmost section of the present Myers Store (formerly named Grace Brothers, and originally named the Dalton Brothers Store). A second building was built in 1870 on the western side of the existing three-storey building, and the gap between the two was in-filled in 1895, forming a large general store. The Dalton Brothers boasted they could fit out a man with everything. James lived at 70 Byng Street Orange, building a house there in 1860 where eleven of his twelve children were born.Aitken, 2003 By the 1850s Campdale had already been subdivided and continually leased, with a major part of the property being sold to the Flanagan family with Michael's daughters Emily, Henrietta and Margaret each owning a share. In 1851 gold was discovered in nearby Ophir. James Dalton Senior's store flourished with the passing miners. By this time he had also set up a \\"relatively substantial slab store\\" in the village of Blackman's Swamp (Orange) which he had built in 1849, 3 years after its gazettal. In 1853 James Dalton Senior's store was established in Orange - he was just 19. During the gold rush of the 1850s Dalton's store bought gold, and gradually expanded to provide all necessary commodities: including the ironmongery and grocery departments of the Western Stores. During the mid 1850s James Dalton had acquired Spirits Licenses (although his father had already gained a license to sell liquor in his stores in 1851) and in 1853 became the proprietor of the Daniell O'Connor Inn in Byng Street, Orange. In 1860 Orange incorporated as a city. During the 1860s it developed into a significant commercial centre including three flour mills, a foundry, three banks, 14 hotels and a daily coach mail service along the Penrith to Wellington Highway. By 1864 the population had increased to over 1000, rendering it eligible to become a borough with a mayor and 8 aldermen. One of those nominated to be amongst the first of the aldermen was James Dalton. By 1860 the Dalton Bros business was flourishing and a new building was erected on the Summer Street site. In 1861 the Dalton Bros opened a coffee mill in Orange, and James also built a steam flourmill on the corner of Summer and Sale Streets. This was a highly profitable venture and flour produced here won many international prizes for its quality. By the 1870s Dalton Brothers' Stores had become the most significant merchant business in western NSW, with wool as a major commodity. Wool was brought to the Stores in Orange from farms by bullock teams and sent to Tarana in horse-drawn wagons, then to Sydney by rail. When the railway was extended west to Orange it was James Dalton who turned the first sod to commence work for the extension, and Thomas, as Orange's mayor, who officially opened the line in 1877. In 1872 James Dalton began to acquire the of the original Campdale grant off the Flanagan family, which would become his Duntryleague property. Between 1875 and 1879 Dalton consolidated ownership of . In 1879 he applied for Torrens Title before he commenced work on construction of his family residence. He named it Duntryleague after his birthplace in Ireland. As originally built, Duntryleague had no third-storey dormer windows (these were added later by James Dalton).Central Western Weekly. 16 May 2008, p.29. By the time James commenced building his home, the property extended across Forbes Road and as far as the Collins Orchard on the Molong Road. He engaged the well known architect Benjamin Backhouse to design the house. Backhouse designed many significant buildings in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, and had an office in Bathurst at the time. Local stonemasons Robert Scott and J. J. McMurtrie were responsible for the considerable amount of stonework in and around Duntryleague. The stone was quarried from Coffey Hill, from Orange. The bricks were handmade on the property and laid by Mr James Lindsay. The family moved in 1876 into the newly completed house which was named after his Irish birthplace. The place Duntryleague in near Galbally in County Limerick, Ireland and means \\"the Fort of the three pillar stones\\". It refers to the burial of King Cormack, who was King of Munster in the 11th century. The original spelling was Doon-tri-liag.https://www.duntryleague.com.au/history At the time of its completion, the house was \\"said to rank among the finest in the colony\\" and \\"showed the vision and foresightedness of its owner.\\" Included in the design was a family chapel and substantial central staircase into which Dalton had built the stained glass window which commemorated his investiture as a Papal Knight in recognition of his services to the Catholic Church. The window was presented to Dalton by Pope Gregory and carries his papal crest and motto, \\"Inter Cruces Triumphans in Cruces\\". Several outbuildings were built on the estate, including two gate houses, on Forbes and Woodward Roads. The gatekeeper employed by Dalton, Leon Ravat, was a French vintner who made wines from the grapes grown in the extensive vineyards of the property. Irrigation was facilitated by a deep well and windmill that dew water from below the ground. The Banjo Patterson Memorial on the road off to Clifton Grove is one of the original gate posts of Duntryleague. Two inns were located on Duntryleague - the Coach & Horse Inn (later the Boree Inn) and the Limerick Castle.Central Western Weekly, 16/5/08, 29 By 1880 the property expanded to with the realignment of Cargo Road and subsequent purchase of this portion by James Dalton. When Dalton's children were grown he had other substantial homes built for them in the area, including the stately Kangaroobie and Ammerdown, among others. The Dalton Bros. firm had expanded to include warehouses and stores in Sydney - the large emporium Dalton House, in Pitt Street and Dalton Wharf at Millers Point. They began to acquire pastoral interests in the Orange area. In Dalton employed Alfred Andrew Patterson (1859-1932) as a gardener at Duntryleague which had magnificent grounds. Through Dalton's influence Patterson became the inaugural gardener (in 1887) at Cook Park and was subsequently head gardener at Machattie Park, Bathurst, for twenty years of a formative period in its development.Aitken & Looker, 2002, 465 1895 the grand new Dalton Brothers Emporium was opened on the original Store site in Summer Street, by now the Dalton Brothers had become renowned as one of the most important commercial enterprises in eastern Australia. In 1901 Clover Hill, Orange Golf Club's first course, was officially opened (on a different site to Duntryleague). In 1906 land to north of Forbes Road transferred to ownership of the Dalton estate. In 1908 transferred back to James Dalton. During Dalton's ownership most of the native trees on the land were cleared and imported trees, primarily pines (Pinus spp.) had been planted along the drive, near the hose and along the Woodward Street boundary. While by far the majority of pines used were Monterey pine (P.radiata), other species are still on Duntryleague such as America's long-needled Southern pitch pine (P.palustris) on the entrance drive, Western yellow pine (P.ponderosa) and the stone pine (P.pinea) from the Mediterranean near the Pro-Golf Shop.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2006 Much of the property had been used to grow feed for the Dalton's dairy cattle. The farm had also included a substantial orchard, a vegetable garden and a vineyard. To overcome the problems associated with flooding on the farm, the Daltons had constructed a drainage system of rubble drains in the paddock on the Woodward Street boundary. James Dalton lived at Duntryleague until his death in 1919. The property was left to his son Patrick Dalton who had become a Jesuit priest. James had wished that the house become a provincial Jesuit college, but this was rejected by the Bishop of Bathurst. Patrick's brother Michael who managed the Dalton Bros. Store moved in with his family. In 1928 Patrick Dalton and family returned to their home of Kangaroobie when Dalton Bros. was sold to Western Stores Ltd. Duntryleague stood empty for many years and the property was left under the management of a caretaker. =Alfred Andrew Patterson= Alfred Andrew Patterson, -1932, a surveyor and gardener, was born in Drottningholm, Sweden and graduated from Uppsala University. Aged only 18 he was appointed lecturer at Hamburg University, Germany and afterwards left for England. He migrated to Australia, working variously as surveyor on the Mount Bischoff railway, Tasmania and the Nyngan-Byrock railway, interspersed with botanical collecting in Qld. Patterson was employed by Dalton who was MLA for Orange, probably at his property \\"Kangaroobie\\" and probably in 1885 as this is the year the NSW contingent left for the Sudan War, to which Patterson was travelling when put off the train in Orange, with typhoid. Following a severe illness he worked as a gardener for merchant James Dalton, at Duntryleague, Orange, an 1870s mansion set in magnificent grounds. Through Dalton's influence he became the head gardener at Cook Park, Orange. When Cook Park was opened in 1887, he became the first head gardener, a position he held for three years. The site had been a swamp. An editorial in the Bathurst Times of 14 April 1890 noted that Patterson had \\"by dint of hard work and exercise of skill, brought Cook Park, Orange to its present state of perfection\\". In early 1890 a deputation from Bathurst, including Mayor Ald. Simmons and local MLA, W. H. Paul, went to Orange, ostensibly to examine the gravitational water supply scheme, and were taken to Cook Park where they met Patterson, and happened to mention Bathurst was seeking a Head Gardener to lay out the new Machattie Park in Bathurst and that a competition was first being held to find a design for the park. In March 1890 Bathurst Council advertised for a Head Gardener and in April Patterson was appointed. This caused some disquiet amongst the Aldermen of Orange. He was subsequently head gardener at Machattie Park, Bathurst, for 20 years of a formative period in its development. He spent the remainder of his career as a shire engineer in country NSW.Aitken, 2002, 465. In 1900 and 1901 Patterson was seconded by the NSW Government to organise the floral displays for the Federation celebrations in Centennial Park, Sydney and the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of York (the future King & Queen). Patterson published a regular gardening column in the Bathurst Daily Times and his reputation as a gardener flourished throughout the Central West of NSW.Harvey, undated. =Subdivision and development as a golf course= In 1929 land was resumed on the western boundary. In 1933‚Äì4, Duntryleague was subdivided by the family into the names of Michael Francis (eastern ) and Thomas Dalton (western ).Aitken, 2003, 8-36 The most significant assistance to the pleasant environment of Orange given by sport has been the creation of Duntryleague Golf Club. The Presbyterian Church, though never dominant in Orange, brought golf to the town in the 1890s when the Revd. W. G. Maconochie with some Scots emigres, established a small, informal course on what is now Moulder Park. A club was formed in 1901 and the first official golf course, with sand greens, was created in the area of Bletchington, called Clover Hill, directly north of the town up to Kearney's Drive. Most of this area was sub-dividable and the club moved south east in 1919 to outside the town on the Icely Road, opposite the present Canobolas High School. The clubhouse of 1924‚Äì5 at Icely Road, a very good example of its kind, still survives as a spacious residence. The decisive move came in 1935 when the Catholic Church decided to sell the entire Duntryleague estate of 180 acres, including the mansion (which had come into church hands through Father Patrick Dalton, a Jesuit, who had inherited the land from his father James in 1919). An exceedingly shrewd case was made in a pamphlet distributed to the golf club members when they met to discuss the desirability of purchasing Duntryleague and ways and means to raise the $50,000 needed for the purchase ($24,000) and expenses of creating a course and converting the mansion to a hotel. The pamphlet stressed the tourist value of such a facility. A properly designed golf course on the \\"Duntryleague\\" estate dominating as it does the Western approaches to the town with its picturesque old mansion, handsome drive and magnificent trees could very easily be made not only an outstanding feature of the town, but a place of note throughout the whole State. It would be a verifiable Mecca for golfers both in summer and winter. Orange has long needed a really first-class guest house and it is estimated by those in the town who are conversant with the tourist influx during the season that no difficulty would be experienced in keeping such a place full for a good proportion of the year for tourists who are continually coming to Orange in search of similar accommodation and going away disappointed. So despite the depression, the money was raised by a bank loan, individual debentures and the subdivision over a period of 40 acres at the west end of the estate. The creation of Duntryleague Golf Course in 1935-6 has both conserved and modified the environment in this highly important space just to the west of the main town. On the one hand, the land was saved from subdivision, most of the Dalton's exotic trees planted in the 1880s and 1890s were preserved and the superb house, along with its large stables and its original Woodward Street lodge and gateway, was maintained in remarkably intact condition. The Daltons' complex system of rubble drains laid on the east section of the estate was, moreover, rediscovered in the 1950s, cleaned out and put to efficient use to drain the second, sixth and eighth fairways. On the other hand, much of the 2.6 meter high hedge which passed the 16th green has been largely cut away; the Daltons' orchard (in the area including the practice green, 13th tee and 18th green) was gradually removed and its last mulberries dug out in 1975; and the original vegetable garden near the 9th green has also gone. 1935 Michael Francis Dalton's eastern were purchased by the Orange Golf Club from the Catholic Church. An area of on the Cargo Road side was divided into building blocks and sold to provide revenue for repayment of the club's bank loan. The Orange Golf Club had been inaugurated in 1901, when James Dalton had struck the first ball at the original course at Clover Hill, near Orange Base Hospital. In 1919 the club moved from Clover Hill to a new site at Icely Road opposite the present Canobolas Rural Technology High School, setting up a 12-hole golf course on . The course here was small and quite rugged with steep slopes and rocky outcrops. By 1935 the club members felt it was unsuitable and sought a new location. Under the club's ownership the last traces of Daltons' farming activities were gradually removed as the golf course was constructed. The course had originally been designed in 1935 by the club's professional John Irving, who drew up plans. These were modified and their implementation supervised by prominent golf course architect Eric Apperly, a prolific designer at the time who designed golf courses in NSW including Sydney's The Lakes, Pymble and Manly courses and the Newcastle Golf Course. The Eric Apperly Shield Competition is named in his honour. In 1935-6 architects E. E. Fallick and S. C. van Breda were employed to design additions to the mansion, now a guest house and to design a new clubhouse. This was intended to enhance Orange's attractiveness as a tourist destination. A two-storey wing was added to the mansion's northern side. On the top storey this included additional bedrooms for the guesthouse and the ground floor became the clubhouse, consisting of assembly room, bar, locker room, kitchen and small office. Four tennis courts were built to the north of the clubhouse. All the handsome trees on the course do not belong to the Dalton period. The fine stand of Atlantic cedars (Cedrus atlantica) behind the 8th green were planted by Tom Hood in 1936. When the Club bought Duntryleague it contained, as well as the mansion, four other dwellings. Three were demolished - the old inn in 1938 and two others in 1966 and 1973. The remaining dwelling is the original gate keeper's cottage located at the Woodward Street Gates, which was the main entrance to Duntryleague. This is a mid Victorian brick residence with a slate roof and some decorative timberwork. It became the rent-free home of the club professional, John Irving. Since that time it has been occupied by staff of the club. In 1936 the guesthouse was leased by Mrs Wallen. In 1938 the old inn on the property was demolished. In 1939 the windmill which had pumped water from a well to the house was disposed of, and bores sunk from which water was pumped to irrigate the golf course. From 1942 to 1946 Mrs Wallen was given permission to sublet the guesthouse to the Red Cross Society \\"for the duration of the war and six months thereafter\\". Duntryleague was used as a convalescent depot, staffed by the Red Cross until 15 January 1946. In 1946, on termination of the Red Cross' lease of the guesthouse, the Golf Club took over its running. In 1947 an ex army \\"hut\\" was purchased and reconstructed as an addition to the clubhouse (lower floor of the north wing addition). A bowling green was constructed and officially opened on 11 October 1947. The Club became affiliated with the NSW Bowling Association, an affiliation that was later ended. The guesthouse was again leased, to Mrs Rhea. In 1949 the Club engaged landscape architect Ilmar Berzins to undertake a master plan of the course, setting out the existing tree species and specifying future plantings. The fairways were planted with African couch, a drought-resistant grass. Berzins supervised the planting himself, and after he had taken up employment in Sydney, continued to make an annual trip to Orange to supervise planting until it had progressed to a point where he could allow its continuation under the direction of a greenkeeper. Among the species planted were Atlantic cedars (Cedrus atlantica & C.a.'Glauca'), claret ash (Fraxinus oxycarpa 'Raywood'), Prunus spp., Japanese maples (Acer palmatum), copper beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea') and golden elms (Ulmus x hollandica 'Louis van Houttei') strategically sited. By 1975's end approximately 12,000 trees and shrubs had been planted on the course. The course had undergone major extensions between 1950 and 1975. The Berzins plan has been followed out. In 1953 architect Colin Brewster was commissioned to design extensions to the army hut, which were undertaken that year. The old hut was pushed west and became the Professional's shop (previously housed in the old hexagonal building). A new lounge was built to replace the Army Hut. A two-roomed office and vestibule with entrance steps and members' locker room were built on the western end of this new building. In 1954 the vegetable garden once used by the Daltons was replaced by a practice green. In 1956 Mrs Rhea sold her lease of the guesthouse to Mr W. Doherty. A club flagpole was erected in memory of L. M. Brennan. In 1960 a halfway house ('Gawler's Folly') was built. About this time a verandah was built adjacent to the upstairs dining room of the clubhouse. A new fence was constructed along the property's boundary with the Orange High School. In 1961 the guesthouse lease was taken over by Mr and Mrs H Gear, who at their own expense converted a number of rooms into bathrooms and toilets. These were designed by architect Fred Nolan. In 1963 corrugated iron garages located near the stables were demolished - previously these had been used by members for parking. In 1964 extensions to the clubhouse were made. The members' bar was enlarged by twice its size and turned into a U shape. A roof was put over the verandah adjacent to the upstairs dining room. A skillion was added to the old stables building, now used to store machinery, to increase garage space. A practice net was erected behind the pro's shop. architect Mr R. Greene was commissioned to draw up plans for further additions to the clubhouse, retaining its single storey nature and lounge room, moving the entrance to the south side of the building, adding a billiards room. The contract went to local firm Gregory and Macleod. The present parking area for the club was constructed then also. One of the original dwellings on the property (situated to the right of the second green) was demolished. The Himalayan cedars (C.deodara) marking the border with Orange High School in the south were planted in 1966 by Miss Edith Robinson. The landscape architect and nurseryman Paul Sorensen and his son Ib were involved, doing a design for the Golf Club using nurse trees. This was by then standard practice of the Sorensens in landscapes particularly in the harsher climates of the Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands, and Ib was a great believer in this practice. At Duntryleague their nurse trees were supposed to be pulled out (later) but this did not occur - the huge pines have ruined the finer trees.McMaugh, 2005,457 In 1972 the old building on the right of the fairway was demolished. The clumps of flowering cherries were given in 1974-5 by Neville Hawke. Altogether some 15,000 trees and shrubs have been planted at Duntryleague by the golf club, supplementing the pines, elms, monkey puzzle (actually it is a Bunya pine, (Araucaria bidwillii), not a monkey puzzle)S.Read, pers.comm. and redwoods of the 19th century. In 1975 the last remaining trees of the Dalton's former orchard were removed. Approximately 12,000 trees have by now been planted by the Golf Club. In 1976 the Club celebrated the centenary of Duntryleague with a week long programme of festivities. Duntryleague was listed on the Register of the National Estate. In 1980 Orange Golf Club sold portions on southern boundary for Orange High School and new residential development, leaving . In 1981 financial assistance from the NSW Heritage Council was sought to paint and do exterior maintenance of the guesthouse, gate house and front gates. Between 1982 and 1985 the clubhouse was refurbished, including the dining room, a new bar was installed, recarpeting the bar and the Brennan Room's dance floor, refurbishing the guesthouse including bedrooms with period furniture, new carpet and modernised facilities. The guesthouse kitchen was renovated. Designers Cairncross, Scheer & Associates were responsible for the work. Five blocks of land on the property were sold to help finance improvements. In 1984 Duntryleague was made subject to a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage Act. This was transferred onto the NSW State Heritage Register on its creation with amendment of the legislation in 1998. In 2002 architect Christo Aitken was engaged to assist with grant funding and to prepare a conservation management plan for the property.

The first trees were planted on Duntryleague Golf Course, then a treeless cropping and dairy property, in the late 1930s, under the instruction of Tom Hood but most were planted in the 1950s under the direction of Ilmar Berzins. By 1980 about 12,000 trees and shrubs had been planted (estimate from 'The History of Duntryleague 1876-1986') with the help of Jack Wetzler, Dennis Mullen and many others. Overall, 130 varieties, mainly trees have been identified but a number of shrub species have not been included (in the book \\"The Trees of Duntryleague Golf Course\\" by Armstrong & Mullen, 2008, 3).

Significant older, or larger specimens, and rare or unusual species include: *1st tee: redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum, Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), linden (Tilia europaea), coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Ponderosa or Western yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa); *2nd tee: incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens); Himalayan or deodar cedar (Cedrus deodara); *4th tee: Antarctic beech (Nothofagus sp.), southern blue gums (Eucalyptus bicostata); 4th-5th tee: maidenhair tree (Ginkgo biloba); *5th tee: blue spruce (Picea pungens), silk tree (Albizzia julibrissen), coastal redwoods; *8th tee: pin oaks (Quercus palustris) - fine specimens, large, blue Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica 'Glauca'); *9-10th tee: rare species of strawberry tree (Arbutus andrachnoides)(another older one is near the Woodward St. gate house); 10th tee: a 1.5m diameter trunked Himalayan or deodar cedar, a lone pine (Pinus brutia) commemorating the Anzacs, carob bean (Ceratonia siliqua); *13th tee: Japanese cedar/ tsugi, (Cryptomeria japonica), golden chain tree, (Laburnum √ó watereri 'Vossii'; *15th tee: linden species with larger leaves than Tilia europaea - Tilia sp.; *16th tee: coastal redwoods, 2 dawn redwoods (Taxodium distichum), holly/holm/evergreen oak (Quercus ilex), guava (Psidium sp.), giant redwood; *18th tee: Mexican pine (Pinus patula), incense cedar, stone pine (Pinus pinea) - large mature specimen Duntryleague has a considerable collection of mature exotic trees. The main entrance drive off Woodward Street in particular is richly planted from the gate house up to the mansion, as is the area around the mansion, with a mixture of conifers, evergreen and deciduous trees. Going from the mansion down the drive these include: English elms (Ulmus procera)(lots), Wellingtonia/big tree (Sequoiadendron giganteum), Coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Himalayan or deodar cedars (Cedrus deodara)(lots), blue Atlas cedars (C.atlantica 'Glauca'), Monterey pines (Pinus radiata)(lots), Photinia glabra, linden (Tilia cordata), Mediterranean cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens)(lots), Monterey cypresses (C.macrocarpa)(lots), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus), English oak (Quercus robur), Bhutan cypress (C.torulosa), Rhododendron spp., cherry laurels (Prunus laurocerasus), Arizona cypress (C.glabra), golden chain tree (Laburnum anagyroides), Meyer's juniper (Juniperus squamata 'Meyeri'), ashes (Fraxinus excelsior), Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus). Behind the gate house is a large specimen of Osmanthus (O.heterophyllus / H.aquifolium) about 8m tall - specimens this large are rare. Also nearby is a rare species of strawberry tree (Arbutus andrachnoides). Near the gate house is a hedge of Photinia glabra and 2 large Western Yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa) and another hedge of privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium). On the southern side of the drive are a number of young Himalayan or deodar cedars, next to the school grounds. North of the mansion are four tennis courts (earthen), netted, on two terraces, edged by Cotoneaster sp. hedges. Steps in brick lead down the terraces to the courts. Other old plantings north of the mansion include lindens, English oak (several), incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens)(3), a Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), strawberry tree, Cupressus sp., Himalayan cedar, English elms, hazelnuts (Corylus avellana cv.s)(several), and a carob (Ceratonia siliqua). These could be remnant plantings of a Dalton era orchard. Other plantings north of the mansion include: tree tulip (Magnolia soulangeana), grape holly (Mahonia lomariifolia), Photinia glabra, Bhutan cypresses, silver birches (Betula pendula), ashes, copper beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea'), Wellingtonia/big trees, pin oaks (Quercus palustris), blue spruces (Picea pungens 'Glauca'), Bunya pine, flowering peach (Prunus persica cv.), Arizona cypress, Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), tarata/lemonwood (Pittosporum eugenioides).

The golf course at least near the mansion is predominantly planted with Monterey pines (P.radiata), Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra 'Italica') and golden willows (Salix matsudana 'Aurea'). 1980s plantings in the grounds and golf course include blue Atlas cedars, bottlebrushes (Callistemon spp.), golden Japanese laurel (Euonymus japonicus 'Aureo-Variegata'), red and Mexican hawthorns (Crataegus oxycantha and C.mexicana), flowering cherries (Prunus serrulata cv.s), golden Himalayan cedars (Cedrus deodara 'Aurea'), variegated tarata/lemonwood (Pittosporum eugenioides 'Variegata'), golden Monterey cypresses, strawberry trees and coastal redwoods.Stuart Read, pers.comm. from visit, 6 August 2005. =Mansion/Clubhouse= Duntryleague Guesthouse and Golf Club in winter 2019 Built in 1876, designed by Benjamin Backhouse, a good example of mid Victorian era Filigree style, with very high standards of construction and high quality craftsmanship in joinery and ironwork. A three-storey house of hand-made sandstock bricks in multi-bond and at the rear are two storeyed wings with splayed corners. The predominant feature of the front facade is a portico and a double storey verandah which returns down the sides. The square cast iron posts of the portico and verandas were made by Fletcher Brothers of Park Street, Sydney, and the verandah have ornate cast iron lace to the balustrades and brackets. There is also ornate lace to the gables, brackets and frieze of the portico which has multiple columns to each corner. The verandah floor is flagged with large blocks of sandstone, and the vestibule is tiled. There are two decorative towers and a square tower room in centre front which was the original chapel. The two asymmetrically placed towers are skyline features and have rusticated quoins. In the front centre of the upper floor is a square tower room with round arched windows; this was the original chapel. On either side dormer windows (later additions) are set into the slate, hipped roof. Eaves are bracketed, which, with the towers, gives the house an Italianate feel. An elongated double front door is flanked by stained glass reveals and a fanlight. Inside, there are fourteen foot ceilings in all rooms. An elaborately carved cedar staircase, very wide and generous was created by Richard Albon of Sydney with barley sugar balusters dominates the central hall. A large stained glass window on its first landing was presented to James Dalton when he was invested as a papal knight in 1877. The stair finishes at the top with a stained glass skylight in the form of a small tower with finial on the roof. There are three marble fireplaces. The dining and drawing rooms are divided by an arch with cedar fitted panelled folding doors. Present kitchen has marble floor and was the dairy. Addition on north side of house is of similar brick and is not offensive. There also have been added four dormer windows on top floor.NTA, 1976 =Duntryleague Gate-keeper's Lodge= At the entrance to the drive stands the gatekeeper's lodge which has a gabled, patterned slate roof with decorative bargeboards and tall, corbelled chimneys. The lodge has decorative traceried bargeboards, a patterned slate roof and tall, corbelled chimneys. To the rear of the main gabled section is a skillion, and at the front is a small, corrugated iron roofed verandah. Walling is apparently brick. The building is protected from Woodward Road by an elegantly curved cast iron fence and there are mature trees close by. Duntryleague's brick stables are some distance away. =Stables= Further away (south-west of the house) are the stables which are built of sandstock brick with an iron roof. = Modifications and dates = The following modifications have been made to the house and surrounds: *1836Sampson's grant of contained the property which became known as Campdale. *1872James Dalton began acquiring of the Campdale grant, which would become Duntryleague. *1875-9 - ownership consolidation by Dalton. In 1879 he commenced construction of his family residence. Included was a family chapel and substantial central staircase. Several outbuildings were built on the estate, including two gate houses, on Forbes and Woodward Roads. The gatekeeper was a French vintner who made wines from the grapes grown in the extensive vineyards of the property. Irrigation was facilitated by a deep well and windmill that dew water from 90 feet below the ground. *1880property expanded to with realignment of Cargo Road and subsequent purchase of this portion. As originally built, Duntryleague had no third-storey dormer windows (these were added later by James Dalton). The stained glass window on the upper level (set behind an archway) was presented to James Dalton, on his becoming a papal Knight, by Pope Gregory and carried his Papal crest and motto \\"Inter Cruces Triumphans in Cruces\\". This motto is repeated in the lead light above the front door of the mansion. *1906land to north of Forbes Road transferred to ownership of the Dalton estate. Most of the native trees on the land were cleared and imported trees, primarily pines (Pinus spp.) had been planted along the drive, near the hose and along the Woodward Street boundary. While by far the majority of pines used were Monterey pine (P.radiata), other species are still on Duntryleague such as America's long-needled Southern pitch pine (P.palustris) on the entrance drive, Western yellow pine (P.ponderosa) and the stone pine (P.pinea) from the Mediterranean near the Pro-Golf Shop. Much of the property had been used to grow feed for the Dalton's dairy cattle. The farm had also included a substantial orchard, a vegetable garden and a vineyard. To overcome the problems associated with flooding on the farm, the Daltons had constructed a drainage system of rubble drains in the paddock on the Woodward Street boundary. *1929land resumed on the western boundary. *1933/4Duntryleague subdivided into names of Michael Francis (eastern ) and Thomas Dalton (western ) *1935Michael Francis Dalton's eastern purchased by the Orange Golf Club from the Catholic Church. An area of on the Cargo Road side was divided into building blocks and sold to provide revenue for repayment of the club's bank loan. Under the club's ownership the last traces of Daltons' farming activities were gradually removed as the golf course was constructed. The course had originally been designed in 1935 by the club's professional John Irving. These were modified and their implementation supervised by prominent golf course architect Eric Apperly. *1935-6additions to the mansion, now a guest house and a new clubhouse. A two-storey wing was added to the mansion's northern side. On the top storey this included additional bedrooms for the guesthouse and the ground floor became the clubhouse, consisting of assembly room, bar, locker room, kitchen and small office. Four tennis courts were built to the north of the clubhouse. When the Club bought Duntryleague it contained, as well as the mansion, four other dwellings. Three were demolished - the old inn in 1938 and two others in 1966 and 1973. The fourth is the existing gate house inside the Woodward Street entrance. *1938old inn on the property demolished. *1939the windmill which had pumped water from a well to the house was disposed of, and bores sunk from which water was pumped to irrigate the golf course. The creation of Duntryleague Golf Course in 1935-6 has both conserved and modified the environment. On the one hand, the land was saved from subdivision, most of the Dalton's exotic trees planted in the 1880s and 1890s were preserved and the superb house, along with its large stables and its original Woodward Street lodge and gateway, was maintained in remarkably intact condition. The Daltons' complex system of rubble drains laid on the east section of the estate was, moreover, rediscovered in the 1950s, cleaned out and put to efficient use to drain the second, sixth and eighth fairways. On the other hand, much of the high hedge which passed the 16th green has been largely cut away; the Daltons' orchard (in the area including the practice green, 13th tee and 18th green) was gradually removed and its last mulberries dug out in 1975; and the original vegetable garden near the 9th green has also gone. All the handsome trees on the course do not belong to the Dalton period. The fine stand of Atlantic cedars (Cedrus atlantica) behind the 8th green were planted by Tom Hood in 1936 and in 1950 a landscape architect, Ilmar Berzins, prepared a master plan for tree planting. The Berzins plan has been followed out and the course contains many Atlantic cedars, claret ashes, Prunus, Japanese maples, copper beeches and golden elms strategically sited. The Himalayan cedars (C.deodara) marking the border with Orange High School in the south were planted in 1966 by Miss Edith Robinson and the clumps of flowering cherries were given in 1974-5 by Neville Hawke. Altogether some 15,000 trees and shrubs have been planted at Duntryleague by the golf club, supplementing the pines, elms, monkey puzzle (actually it is a Bunya pine, Araucaria bidwillii, not a monkey puzzle (S.Read, pers.comm.)) and redwoods of the 19th century. *1947an ex army \\"hut\\" was purchased and reconstructed as an addition to the clubhouse (lower floor of the north wing addition). A bowling green was constructed. *1949the Club engaged landscape architect Ilmar Berzins to undertake a masterplan of the course, setting out the existing tree species and specifying future plantings. The fairways were planted with African couch, a drought-resistant grass. Berzins supervised the planting himself, and after he had taken up employment in Sydney, continued to make an annual trip to Orange to supervise planting until it had progressed to a point where he could allow its continuation under the direction of a greenkeeper. Among the species planted were Atlantic cedars (Cedrus atlantica & C.a.'Glauca'), claret ash (Fraxinus oxycarpa 'Raywood') Japanese maples (Acer palmatum), copper beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea') and golden elms (Ulmus x hollandica 'Louis van Houttei'). By 1975's end approximately 12,000 trees and shrubs had been planted on the course. The course had undergone major extensions between 1950 and 1975. *1953extensions to the army hut were undertaken. The old hut was pushed west and became the Professional's shop (previously housed in the old hexagonal building). A new lounge was built to replace the Army Hut. A two-roomed office and vestibule with entrance steps and members' locker room were built on the western end of this new building. *1954the vegetable garden once used by the Daltons was replaced by a practice green. *1956a club flagpole was erected in memory of L. M. Brennan. *1960a halfway house ('Gawler's Folly') was built. About ths time a verandah was built adjacent to the upstairs dining room of the clubhouse. A new fence was constructed along the property's boundary with the Orange High School. *1961the guesthouse lease was taken over by Mr and Mrs H Gear, who at their own expense converted a number of rooms into bathrooms and toilets. These were designed by architect Fred Nolan. *1963corrugated iron garages located near the stables were demolished - previously these had been used by members for parking. *1964extensions to the clubhouse were made. The members' bar was enlarged by twice its size and turned into a U shape. A roof was put over the verandah adjacent to the upstairs dining room. A skillion was added to the old stables building, now used to store machinery, to increase garage space. A practice net was erected behind the pro's shop. *architect Mr R. Greene was commissioned to draw up plans for further additions to the clubhouse, retaining its single storey nature and lounge room, moving the entrance to the south side of the building, adding a billiards room. The contract went to local firm Gregory and Maclead. The present parking area for the club was constructed then also. One of the original dwellings on the property (situated to the right of the second green) was demolished. *1972/3the old building on the right of the fairway was demolished. *1975the last remaining trees of the Dalton's former orchard were removed. Approximately 12,000 trees have by now been planted by the Golf Club *1980Orange Golf Club sold portions on southern boundary for Orange High School and new residential development - leaving (current land area (2003). *1981painting and exterior maintenance of the guesthouse, gate house and front gates. *1982-5the clubhouse was refurbished, including the dining room, a new bar was installed, recarpeting the bar and the Brennan Room's dance floor, refurbishing the guesthouse including bedrooms with period furniture, new carpet and modernised facilities. The guesthouse kitchen was renovated. Five blocks of land on the property were sold to help finance improvements.  Heritage listing  The property now known as Duntryleague was part of one of the first land grants in the Orange area in 1834, located adjacent to the later gazetted township of Orange and comprising a full square mile. The property was grazed for many years by various owners and tenants, but William Sampson, the first grantee who was himself an absent land owner with interests in the Mudgee area, also established his early property called Campdale on the land. The property also included other early buildings important in the history of Orange such as John Peisley's the Coach and Horses which is regarded as the first inn in the Blackman's Swamp (Orange) area. James Dalton, the prominent Orange merchant, purchased sections of the land from 187205 to establish a substantial family estate of 311 acres that he named Duntryleague after his birthplace in Ireland. In 1876 he commissioned the design and construction of a mansion located on a prominent ridge of the property from Sydney architect Benjamin Backhouse. The house is a splendid example of mid Victorian splendour designed in the Victorian Filigree style with a richness of detail befitting the man of wealth and influence that James had become by that time. The estate included two gatehouses, an ornate entrance and gates, a stables, a dairy, 2-3 workers' cottages, a fern house, orchards, vegetable gardens for the household and extensive pastures for grazing. James initially assisted his father in their first shop in Orange after arriving from Ireland at the age of 15. In 1853 he set up his own store at the corner of Post Office Lane which he later managed with his brother Thomas who arrived in Australia in 1858. His father went on to manage the well known Daniel O'Connell Inn in Orange. The Dalton Bros. business grew to become the largest wholesale merchanting business west of the Blue Mountains with interests throughout the Central West, eastwards to Sydney and northwards to the Queensland border at the height of their success in the late 1800s. The store building that James built in Summer Street was significantly added to over the years and was to become one of the landmark buildings in town. The Sydney side of the business was managed by Thomas who lived at Wheatleigh in North Sydney and the company was notable in the city for Dalton House in Pitt Street and the Dalton Wharf at Millers Point. Over the years up to 1925 in Orange the family have been associated with a large number of significant homes and also owned and managed a number of extensive pastoral properties. Many of these buildings remain today as testimony to the importance of the family in the region. The Dalton family was among New South Wales' most influential and wealthy Catholic families. The Irish-Catholic community in Orange was relatively large and particularly wealthy enough to play a dominant role in politics and the social and spiritual development of the town. The Daltons were instrumental in the financing of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Orange and James Dalton had built Australia Hall in Lord's Place to provide the controversial venue for a group of visiting Irish Nationalists in 1883. James may also have provided funds and leadership for the Irish Nationalist Movement in NSW. Some of the Dalton children later studied in Ireland and returned to Australia to work. The Dalton family were involved in the early civic development of Orange. Some stood on local Council (James Dalton Mayor 1869, Michael Francis Dalton Councillor from 1906 for many years). In 1877 James was awarded the rare honour of being made a Papal Knight by Pope Gregory for his services to the Catholic Church and the large stained glass window in the hall of Duntryleague commemorates his investiture. After James' death the house and grounds were retained briefly in family ownership and also used as a large convalescent hospital run by the Red Cross. The property was then purchased by the Orange Golf Club in 1935 as a home for the club, which had originally been established in Orange in 1909, but had outgrown earlier Club premises. James Dalton had in fact opened the Club in 1901. The club has made some alterations to the house and grounds over the years but both still retain significant aspects of their history that are still able to demonstrate the original design and use of the once splendid property. The club has established itself at Duntryleague over the past 70 years as an important golf club in NSW with an exceptional setting for its courses and attracting local, state and international players and visitors.Christo Aitken & Associates, 2003, 66-67 Duntryleague property has strong historic associations with prominent merchant, pastoralist and townsman, James Dalton, and architect Benjamin Backhouse, its designer, R Scott & JJ McMurtrie, stonemasons. Duntryleague has aesthetic significance with its prominent hilltop location, extensive grounds now a golf course, fine collection of magnificent mature trees, original estate elements including an axial entry driveway with gate keeper's lodge, notable house, terraced former gardens and tennis courts. Duntryleague contains a house of mid Victorian splendour, a good example of Victorian Filigree style by virtue of its ornate cast iron work to the portico and verandahs. It displays high standards of construction and high quality craftsmanship in its joinery an ironwork. ;Gate Keeper's Lodge This simple building is relieved by its decorative traceried bargeboards. It is of additional interest for its association with the wealthy and influential Dalton family, former owners of the Duntryleague property.Register of the National Estate, modified Read, S., 8/2005 ;Estate Duntryleague's grounds while modified into a notable golf course have considerable historic, aesthetic and social significance. They have historic associations with the Dalton family, the Orange Golf Club and a series of gardeners, golf course and landscape designers notable within NSW, including Andrew Alfred Patterson, John Irving, Richard Apperly & Ilmar Berzins. The grounds have a considerable collection of mature exotic trees. The main entrance drive off Woodward Street in particular is richly planted from the gate house up to the mansion, as is the area around the mansion, with a mixture of conifers, evergreen and deciduous trees.Stuart Read, pers.comm., Aitken, 2002, 465, Christo AItken, 2003 Duntryleague was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

They were all amalgamated into the North Eastern Railway (NER) which in turn was subsumed into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and British Rail in 1948. British Rail closed two lines, the Wensleydale line in 1954 and a section of the Leeds Northern Railway to in 1969. The Wensleydale line was retained as a freight branch and resurrected as a heritage railway in 2003 but the line to Harrogate closed completely. Despite closures and rationalisation, the station still is at a major junction on the East Coast Main Line. is on the East Coast Main Line and Transpennine Express Northern Line. The station is north of London King's Cross, north of railway station and south of railway station. History =1841‚Äì1901= A railway between York and Darlington via Northallerton was suggested in 1826 in the York Herald, but the first railway, built by the Great North of England Railway (GNE), following the proposed route, only opened to mineral traffic in January 1841 and to passengers in March of the same year. When navvies were digging in the Castle Hills area of Northallerton, three Roman sarcophagi were unearthed which were taken to Darlington. station opened in March 1841, and the \\"York Herald\\" described it as \\"in the Elizabethan Gothic style\\". Although much remodelled, the station is in the same location, with staggered platforms as when first built. Opening beyond to did not come until 1844. In 1842, the GNE was absorbed into the Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway (N&DJR;), who, in 1846 gained Parliamentary approval for a line between Northallerton and Bedale. Work started the same year, but because of the unscrupulous practices of George Hudson, who controlled the N&DJR;, work was halted in early 1848 The line opened between Northallerton and Bedale in March 1848. Various other schemes progressed the line through Wensleydale and the N&DJR; became part of the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway (YN&BR;). The Wensleydale line left Northallerton westwards and had two connections with the mainline north of Northallerton; one at Castle Hills South and the other at Castle Hills North. Initially, access was from the north (the Darlington direction) which meant that trains originating in Northallerton had to reverse. This was remedied in 1882 with the opening of a direct curve onto the Wensleydale line. The third line was the Leeds Northern Railway (LNR), previously the Leeds & Thirsk Railway, whose line opened in June 1852. The LNR line paralleled the YN&BR; line at a lower level to the west. The GNE formation was built on an embankment that took it from what became Cordio Junction to Castle Hills on an embankment made from of earth from when Castle Hills, north of the station, was levelled. This was the second most difficult engineering task undertaken by the company between York and Darlington after the stone viaduct at Croft. The LNR station, Northallerton Town was in the North Bridge area. The LNR passed under the YN&B; just north of Northallerton station where a short tunnel was driven under the YN&B; line at an angle of 23%. Tunnelling took place while keeping the upper line open.Some writers refer to the tunnel as a \\"long bridge\\". The Eastern Trackmaps diagrams refers to the formation as a tunnel. No work took place until designs the tunnel were submitted by the LNR engineer, Joshua T Naylor, to the YN&B.; The tunnel was constructed by driving piles into the GNE embankment and inserting a platform above them to support the rails. The tunnel was excavated and the space bricked up until the arches at either end could be completed. The tunnel is wide and long. The former Northallerton Town railway station (LNR), now a private business A spur at the north end of the station allowed trains to and from to call at the station and access the line towards and Stockton in 1856. This route was taken via the Thirsk line from Melmerby and then north along what became the ECML. It along with the YN&B; and the LNR, became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1854,Initially, the North Eastern Railway was created by the YN&B;, the LNR and the York and North Midland Railway, with the Malton & Driffield Railway being amalgamated quite soon afterwards. precipitated the closure of Northallerton Town station (LNR) although it remained open for well over a century as a goods depot. The line to Wensleydale was absorbed into the NER in 1858. The LNR opened two platforms on its line adjacent to Northallerton station. They remained in use after mainline trains had been diverted through the station and via Thirsk. The low platforms were the terminus for local trains from Melmerby (via until 1901, when the line from Melmerby was doubled and became the key line north,Doubling began in March 1899 and took two years. and the line from Thirsk to Melmerby became secondary. When mainline trains were re-routed via the Melmerby to Northallerton line, the NER installed a junction at Cordio Wood to feed a spur into the south of the station. The low platforms became redundant and were abandoned but were resurrected during the Second World War and for engineering diversions. Access to the low platforms was via a path from the upper platforms. A door in the subway under the main running lines allowed passengers to interconnect between all platforms. left Other lines were planned, some gained Parliamentary approval. One was the York & Carlisle Railway which proposed a line from Northallerton and Bishop Auckland meeting near Barnard Castle and crossing the Pennines. The plan was abandoned in 1846 when the company merged with another. =1901‚Äì1948= In 1911, the station was remodelled when an improved connection was installed on the western side for access to the Wensleydale line. The down platform (Darlington-bound) was converted into an island platform with two running lines and a north-facing bay for Wensleydale services. Another bay was installed on the up platform (York-bound) which allowed services to depart south for the Ripon line, although the stopping service until 1901 had used the low platforms. Starting in 1897, the tracks were \\"widened\\" in several sections between York and Northallerton. In 1931, the London and North Eastern Railway quadrupled most of the line and created the grade separated Longlands Junction south of Northallerton by 1933. It connected to the original formation from Ripon and allowed freight to avoid the station from the York direction. Trains heading south accessed the line south via the Longlands Tunnel () under the fast lines through the station. In 1942, the LNER installed up and down slow lines between and as wartime necessities led to an upsurge in traffic. British Rail completed the quadrupling of the line in 1959 and 1960. Northallerton - a Down freight heading for Teesside In 1941, concerns about wartime bombing prompted building a chord from north of Romanby Road level crossing to Castle Hills Junction to connect the lower and upper lines and opened in November 1941. Should Northallerton station be bombed, it provided an alternative route. The new section was engineered with a unique feature; because of the gradient it was too low to bridge the Wensleydale line and too high to dive under the railway. Engineers created two moveable sections on rail wheels which when pushed together, created a bridge allowing trains bound to and from Wensleydale to traverse the section. If the wartime chord needed to be used, the moveable sections could be moved onto sidings on either side of the running lines. The bridge was constructed from two girders that straddled the lower running lines. The bridge completed the track circuits and prevented trains from running under when the bridge was in place, or from running over it if the lower wartime lines were in use. Trains could still access the Wensleydale line by reversing at Castle Hills Junction. Apart from testing, there is no evidence that the chord was used as Northallerton was rarely attacked (some bombs did land on one of the livestock marts). Closure of this section came in 1946. =1948 ‚Äì present day= When the passenger service ended on the Wensleydale line in April 1954 (due to its ¬£14,000 per year loss-making revenue according to British Rail), the direct curve from the station onto the line was used less until it closed in 1970. Thereafter, freight services used Castle Hills siding and reversed into the loop to run-round. Some freight trains traversed the line with locomotives at both ends, a procedure known as top and tail, which removed the necessity to reverse and run-round. Services on the line comprised various loads, but up until December 1992, it conveyed limestone from Redmire to the British Steel complex at Redcar. The operation involved the train arriving from Teesside into the station via the Eaglescliffe line and reversing into the Castle Hills siding and continuing up the branch. On returning, the train reversed the process to access the Eaglescliffe line. In 1996, the Ministry of Defence paid ¬£750,000 to upgrade the line to convey military vehicles in and out of Catterick Camp. The last section of line to be closed, the Leeds Northern Line from and , closed to passengers in 1967 but was not closed completely until 1969. The widened lines on the ECML, which provided four tracks between Northallerton and York, were an easier route south than some steeply graded sections around Ripon and Wetherby. The former LNR route was re-opened for services in the aftermath of the Thirsk rail crash. Some questioned the validity of closing the line citing the crash at Thirsk as reason to keep it open as an alternative line when the ECML would be closed. Various reports have detailed re-opening the line but some historical studies have suggested that the route should only open between Ripon south to Harrogate as there would be no business case to provide for a railway running further north. In 2015, North Yorkshire County Council submitted plans for transport schemes in North Yorkshire, the provision of a railway connecting Harrogate and Ripon to the ECML was among them. However, while the routeing of the railway north suggests that the freight railway through Northallerton could be closed, the plan calls for the junction of a re-opened line to be north of Northallerton town. 185102 at Northallerton having just passed over Low Gates level crossing. The engineers sidings are on the right With the loss of the local and long-distance traffic on the Wensleydale and Harrogate lines, the bay platforms at the southern and northern ends of the station were taken out of commission. In 1982, British Rail announced its intention to revamp the dilapidated station, but with no funding from local authorities, the option to retain the Victorian buildings were limited. The down side buildings were removed in 1972-1973 and the up side lost its glass canopies in 1985. The station was remodelled between 1985 and 1986 with the down line on the western edge of the station (the down relief line) also being removed. Local passenger services were lost on the Northallerton-Eaglescliffe route and most other passenger workings were transferred leaving freight using the line. British Rail started a named train to Midldlesbrough, the Cleveland Executive, but it ceased just before the ECML was electrified because of poor patronage north of Northallerton station. The route regained passenger services in the 1990s when Regional Railways introduced the Middlesbrough-Manchester Airport services which used the line rather than having to reverse at Darlington. The ECML was electrified with a 25 kiloVolt Alternating Currency overhead catenary in 1991. The section between York and Northallerton was energised and tested in September 1990, electric services between London King's Cross and Edinburgh did not commence until July 1991. Electrification involved raising many bridges and spelt the end for the signalbox which opened in September 1939 and controlled a large section of the ECML. The signalbox closed in April 1990 when control was transferred to York IECC, although the control of the barriers (but not the signals) at the Low Gates level crossing was kept under the authority of the box at Low Gates. Signalling control now rests at the Rail Operating Centre at York. The North Eastern Railway had pursued a scheme to electrify the line between Northallerton and via Stockton in 1922/1923. This line was also considered for electrification by British Rail for a proposed Channel Tunnel freight terminal on Teesside in 1994, but was not taken past the planning stage. In 2009, electrification was announced on the Transpennine route between , , and York and electrification of the line between Northallerton and Middlesbrough was mooted by Network Rail to provide through running between Manchester and Middlesbrough. In 2017, a platform in the station was lengthened to enable the new Class 800 trains to call on East Coast services. =Wensleydale railway= In 2003, the Wensleydale Railway signed a 99-year lease with Railtrack (the predecessor of Network Rail) and started services on the former Wensleydale line. Initially, trains ran to as the eastern terminus, but in 2014 railway station opened. It is a temporary structure as the Wensleydale Railway was keen to reopen the closed 1970 curve and run trains into, or as close as possible to, Northallerton station. The north-facing bay platform used for the Wensleydale branch has been filled in and is part of the car park. The section between Leeming Bar and Northallerton does not see scheduled services as the level crossing on Yafforth road is in need of upgrading. In 2016, a train struck a car on the level crossing and while the report did not attribute direct blame on the company, it said that the approaches and sighting of the level crossing should be improved.The level crossing at Yafforth was used to stage a crash under the banner \\"Operation Zebra Smash\\" in 1994. Railtrack set the crossing up with fake barriers and pushed a train onto the level crossing which smashed a Vauxhall Astra GTE. =Goods= The North Eastern Railway applied for Parliamentary permission to build a freight yard between the Darlington and Eaglescliffe lines. It was given permission in 1901 and 1903 but nothing was built. The town had two goods yards; one at the station and the other next to the closed Northallerton Town station known as High and Low Goods Yard(s) respectively. Northallerton auction mart was next to the station and cattle were forwarded from the yard which also had coal drops. It remained a wagonload freight location until the early 1980s. The low yard was used for general merchandise. The yards had three and two sidings respectively which are used but for engineering purposes. Northallerton forwarded the same types of freight as any other station on the local lines. The Wensleydale Pure Milk Society Dairy to the north west of the station forwarded milk products to London, Hull, Newcastle, Sunderland and Dewsbury and received milk from Wensleydale. The one wagon movement was a hand-pushed trolley operated by two workers, which was pushed into the station from the creamery. This conveyed cream for dispatch and the wagon was converted so that it could work on the line, and had a red flag placed on a very tall pole so that its movement could be observed by traincrews. Current services Northallerton station is served by LNER services between Edinburgh and London King's Cross, Transpennine Express (TPE) services between Middlesbrough and Manchester airport, Newcastle and and Grand Central services between and London King's Cross. Most LNER services and all CrossCountry services pass through at speed without stopping. One TPE service per hour in each direction does not stop at the station. Most freight trains are routed via the old Leeds Northern Railway line on the lower tracks avoiding the station. This means freight trains on the lower lines cross four level crossings in the town. From south to north they are; * Boroughbridge Road Gates: this takes the A167 across the freight lines and under the fast lines. * Romanby Road: leads the local road from Romanby into Northallerton * Springwell Lane: a road across the freight lines to a small number of houses and provides foot access to Northallerton West railway station * Low Gates: takes the A167 Darlington road across the Northallerton-Eaglescliffe Line. This level crossing is the busiest as all trains to and from the Middlesbrough area cross here. Low Gates level crossing often has its barriers down at peak time for 25 minutes in an hour. This leads to traffic tailbacks on the A167 which can take 15 minutes for the traffic to clear. Problems with queuing traffic and congestion in the town have led to calls for the level crossing to be bypassed, bridged or closed. One suggestion was that the corridor the freight lines occupy be turned into an inner ring road and a new rail formation be cut further north to provide a new chord to the Middlesbrough line from the ECML further north than the current station. This would mean traffic could use the trackbed to access the A167 without going through the town as there is no bypass around the town for road traffic. Stations and engine sheds * railway station; opened in 1841, was completely remodelled in 1986 when buildings on the up side of the line (York bound) were demolished. The station is run by Transpennine Express, with other services being provided by LNER and Grand Central. The last recorded use of the low platforms was in February 1961 after the station was damaged by a derailment. Trains were diverted via the low platforms and a diversion at Eaglescliffe to regain the main line at Darlington. * railway station; opened in 1852 and closed in 1856 * railway station; opened in 2014. The platform at Northallerton West is a semi-permanent structure that sits on a passing loop. Only one platform is provided (on the south side of the line) and access is on foot across Springwell Lane Level Crossing. The first engine shed in the town was located adjacent to Northallerton Town railway station. It was a single road shed which opened in 1852 and remained open after the route to Northallerton station opened in 1856. It closed in 1858. A two-road engine shed was provided for services on the Wensleydale branch. It was built in 1857 and replaced in 1881 and an extension was added in 1886. The shed was adjacent to the low platforms at Northallerton station and had one through and one dead-end line. The shed was coded as 51J under British Railways as a sub-shed of Darlington. With the withdrawal of passenger services on the Wensleydale line, the shed closed in March 1963, nine years after passenger traffic had ceased on the branch. The site is now in private business use. The turntable was located in the goods yard adjacent to the main station. It could accommodate locomotives up to a length of . Its location at the station rather than adjacent to the locomotive shed was a legacy from when Leeds Northern services terminated in the station and ran round before proceeding south. An engine moving from the station to the locomotive shed had to travel over and negotiate two junctions to reach it. The turntable was next to the coaling plant and watering facility; none of the structures were relocated to the engine shed on the lower lines. The water tank was situated between the low and high platforms and held over of water. As it was located on low ground, it was built to a height above that of the upper-level platforms to allow enough pressure to feed the water column by the turntable, making it significantly higher than would normally be expected. Incidents * 1870: A boiler explosion occurred in a steam locomotive in the station; whilst there were some injuries, no-one was killed. * July 1870: The landlord of the Golden Lion Hotel was using the foot crossing to access platform 2 when he stopped to look at his watch. He received fatal injuries from the crash. Mainly because of this accident (but also on account of other people sustaining injuries in the same location) a subway was opened soon afterwards to replace the foot crossing. * 21 November 1889: A driver who was due to be shown the road for the line between Northallerton and , jumped on board the guard's van of the train whilst it passed through the station. He fell from the van onto the platform and his arm was badly smashed between the van and the platform. It was amputated at Northallerton's Cottage Hospital. * 4 October 1894: A Scotch Express heading south had experienced trouble with brakes and a pilot engine was attached at Darlington. The pilot loco at the front of the train assumed that the other driver was looking out for the signals, whereas the other driver assumed that as the pilot loco was at the front, he was looking out for the signals. The train went through a signal at danger and collided with the rear end of a goods train just north of Northallerton. A passenger was killed. * 23 December 1894: A gale which struck most of Northern England, stripped the panels from the station roof and ripped off other fittings. No injuries or deaths were recorded. * In November 1913, a locomotive from the Wensleydale line was signalled onto the main line at Castle Hills, but was not cleared to run further south by the Northallerton signal box. The locomotive was returning to the shed and so had to run through on the main line to get to the shed. The signallers forgot about the light engine and two different signallers both accepted an express from the north. The driver of the light engine was surprised to see the distant signals being raised, which would not be necessary for him as he was only just going past the station. On realising something was wrong, the driver saw the express running towards him. He started his engine to try and get clear, but both he and his fireman baled out onto the platform as their engine passed through Northallerton station. The express came to a halt and the light engine was found a little south of Northallerton having run out of steam. * September 1935: a northbound express coming off of the Harrogate Line going north, saw an express on the main line was headed for the station. The express from Harrogate performed an emergency stop. It was determined that the driver of the express on the main line had been mistaken by the green signals further down the line through Northallerton station. * February 1961: a parcels train derailed in the station ripping up the track and demolished part of the island roof. The newspaper and parcels were shredded in the crash which created a \\"snowstorm\\" effect. Despite it happening in daytime and the station busy with passengers, the only injury was to the guard of the train who was sent home from hospital on the same day. * 28 August 1979: an Intercity 125 unit from London King's Cross to Edinburgh derailed south of the station but remained upright. The cause was attributed to low gearbox oil which caused the pinion to seize and lock the leading wheels on the train in place. With the rear power car pushing the train, this caused the flanges on the locked wheels to deform and strike the points south of the station, which buckled the rail. This caused the whole train to derail but it stayed upright and only one person required hospitalising overnight. * 3 August 2016: a train on the heritage Wensleydale Railway struck a car on a level crossing near Yafforth just west of Northallerton. Three people suffered injuries; the car driver and two passengers on the train.

The amphibious vehicle sank with 31 people on board, leaving 17 dead, during high winds associated with nearby severe thunderstorms.  Background  The original design of the DUKW did not include a hard overhead canopy. The DUKW (\\"Duck\\" or \\"duck boat\\") is a wheeled amphibious vehicle used by the United States military and its allies during the later years of World War II and the Korean War. The vehicles became available in surplus after the Korean War, and a veteran in Minnesota began a business giving rides aboard the vessels to tourists on the Wisconsin River. Over the last 50 years, the practice has expanded to other areas. Several major tourist destinations in the United States feature duck boat tours, including Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Before the Table Rock Lake accident, there had been several other fatal incidents involving duck boats, notably one near Hot Springs, Arkansas, on May 1, 1999, in which 13 people died. That incident was attributed to several factors, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB); inadequate maintenance was the main cause, with other contributing factors including inadequate reserve buoyancy and the continuous canopy roof over the passenger cabin preventing escape. Among others, recommendations were made for amphibious passenger vehicles to either add additional buoyancy to prevent sinking when flooded, or require passengers to wear life jackets and remove the canopy to allow escape in the event of a sinking.  Accident  The accident occurred shortly after 7 p.m. Central Daylight Time on July 19, 2018, as a line of severe thunderstorms approached the Branson area. Approximately an hour prior to the accident, the National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning for areas around the lake. It is not known whether the two crew members aboard the vessel were aware of the warning or what action they attempted to take. The National Weather Service reports that winds in the area at the time were in excess of , and the storm over the lake was moving very quickly and causing three-foot (one-meter) waves on the lake. The vessel was a refurbished DUKW built in 1944 and extended to hold more people, a design known as a \\"stretch duck\\". The first 911 call was received at 7:09pm as the boat was already going under the water, according to the local sheriff. Local officials reported the following morning that all passengers and crew aboard the vessel had been accounted for and confirmed a total of 17 deaths. The ages of those who died in the accident ranged from 1 to 70 years old, and nine were members of a single family visiting from Indianapolis. None of the passengers or crew were wearing a life jacket when the boat sank.  Investigation and aftermath  The boat involved in the accident The NTSB dispatched investigators to the accident site the following day. In response to previous incidents involving duck boats, the NTSB had issued strong warnings about the design of the vehicles and the danger posed to passengers by their overhead canopies. Tia Coleman lost nine family members in the accident; she claimed that the crew specifically told passengers not to put on life jackets because they would not need them. Jim Pattison Jr., president of Ripley Entertainment (who bought the Ride the Ducks Branson location in 2017), told the media that the storm \\"came out of nowhere\\", then moved through the area and led to the accident. The day following the accident, Ride the Ducks announced that the Branson operation would be \\"closed for business\\" pending an investigation and out of respect for the victims' families; the company also announced that it will pay for funeral and medical expenses for the passengers on board the boat. Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, Georgia, suspended their duck boat rides the day after the accident. The boat was raised from the bottom of the lake by the US Coast Guard on July 23, 2018, after being examined and photographed by divers. Divers also recovered a recording device from the boat, about below the surface. A federal indictment against the boat's captain, Kenneth Scott McKee, was announced on November 8, 2018. McKee is charged with 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship's officer, resulting in death. According to the indictment, McKee allegedly \\"failed to properly assess incoming severe weather both prior to and after entering the water\\" of the lake and he \\"entered the vessel onto the water while there was severe weather, including high winds and lightning approaching the area\\". In June 2019, Curtis P. Lanham, general manager of Ride the Ducks Branson, and Charles V. Baltzell, operations supervisor who was acting as a manager on duty, were indicted by a federal grand jury for multiple felonies related to the accident. McKee was also subject to additional charges. In September 2020, a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the criminal charges against the three men indicted, reasoning that \\"Table Rock Lake is not considered a navigable waterway under admiralty law\\", and the case should be handled at the state level. In November 2019, a safety recommendation report was issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), stating that the \\"Coast Guard has repeatedly ignored safety recommendations that could have made tourist duck boats safer and potentially prevented\\" the Table Rock duck boat accident. ‚ÄúThese safety issues were identified almost 20 years prior to the sinking of the Stretch Duck 7 and remain relevant to this accident,‚Äù the report said. The NTSB said in their report that because of the boats low freeboard and open interior, it makes the duck boats ‚Äúvulnerable to rapid swamping and sinking‚Äù when they are suddenly flooded. The safety report also found that a fixed canopy and closed side curtain impeded passenger escape and likely caused more deaths. Lawsuits A federal lawsuit was filed on July 29, 2018, for US$100 million on behalf of two members of an Indiana family that lost nine people in the accident. The suit accuses Ride the Ducks of ignoring warnings that had been issued about the weather prior to the accident and continuing to use boats with design flaws that made them susceptible to sinking. In March 2019, a confidential settlement was reached for relatives of the two members of the family from Indiana. An additional federal lawsuit was filed on September 4, 2018 by Tia Coleman, who was aboard the boat during the incident. Coleman's husband and three children were among those that drowned. In November 2018, a confidential settlement was reached with Ripley Entertainment on behalf of two daughters of a couple from Higginsville, Missouri. The couple was celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary when they died on the duck boat ride. As of November 2019, all but one lawsuit against Ripley Entertainment have been settled.

The character was born on-screen to parents Lachlan Fraser (Richard Grieve) and Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) during the episode broadcast on 20 April 1998. Producers allowed Grieve and Wright to choose the name of their characters' daughter and they eventually settled on Olivia. The character was played by a number of infant actors until her departure in 1999. In 2005, Wright reprised her role as Chloe, while Ivy Latimer was cast as Olivia. Following Chloe's death, Olivia was at the centre of a custody battle between her grandmother Diana Fraser (Kerry McGuire) and Chloe's foster mother Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). The character was reintroduced in 2015, with Banno cast in the role. During her audition, Banno performed scenes with actors Matt Little and Scott Lee, whose presence made her more \\"excited\\" about securing the role. Olivia is portrayed as bold, flirty, and confrontational. Banno also thought there was a darkness to Olivia. The character's early storylines focused on her friendship with VJ Patterson (Little), a feud with villain Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz), and the revelation that she has been self-harming due to being sexually abused. Banno praised the writers' decision to explore the issue of self-harm, as she believed it was a topic that was not often portrayed on television. Producers paired Olivia with Hunter King (Lee), and their on-off relationship has been tested several times, with issues ranging from infidelity to pregnancy, and later a proposal. Olivia has also been the part of a love triangle involving Hunter and Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger). In May 2018, it was confirmed that Banno had left Home and Away and that she had already filmed her final scenes. Banno made her final appearance as Olivia on 13 August 2018. Creation and casting The character was created in 1998, when screenwriters plotted a pregnancy storyline for Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) and Lachlan Fraser (Richard Grieve). After Lachlan learns that Chloe is pregnant with his child, he is \\"totally shocked and confused\\", but vows to support Chloe. They eventually fall in love with each other. The scenes depicting Chloe's 36-hour labour and the birth took two and a half weeks to film. Chloe and Lachlan struggle to agree on a name for their daughter and spend a week fighting about it. Off-screen, the producers allowed Grieve and Wright to choose the name for the baby. Wright admitted that she and Grieve had trouble agreeing on a name, but eventually settled on Olivia. The character was played by a number of infant actors from her birth. When viewers spotted at least four different babies playing the role, a show spokesperson said \\"Our fans are quite right. But it was even more complicated when Chloe first gave birth. We had to have eight babies for the part.\\" The Australian child employment laws state that young children are only available to work on set for certain number of hours, before they have to take a break. Development =2005 return= When the character made a return in 2005, she was played by Ivy Latimer. A young Olivia returns to Summer Bay with her mother. Shortly after, Chloe dies in a car accident, leading to a custody battle between her grandmother Diana (Kerry McGuire) and Chloe's foster mother Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Irene becomes \\"so desperate\\" to stop Olivia from going with Diana that she runs away with her, until Barry Hyde (Ivar Kants) makes her realise that she needs to return home. Olivia eventually leaves the Bay to live with her uncle James Fraser (Michael Piccirilli), and they later move to London. =Reintroduction= Olivia returns to the Bay to live with Irene, played by Lynne McGranger (pictured). On 18 October 2015, Sally Rawsthorne of The Daily Telegraph reported that Olivia was being reintroduced to the show, with actress Raechelle Banno in the role. Banno told Rawsthorne that during her audition for the part, she performed alongside actors Matt Little and Scott Lee, an episode director and a producer. She also said that Little and Lee's presence in the audition made her more \\"excited\\" about winning the role and being in the show. Banno and her twin sister Karina had previously made several guest appearances in the show when they were younger. Banno said her sister was the first to find out that she had been cast in the show. Of joining the cast, Banno stated \\"I feel so fortunate that my start at working full-time in the industry is through being cast in something as respected as Home and Away. I have the privilege of being made to feel so welcome, while being trusted with the responsibility of bringing this great character to life.\\" Olivia's return scenes aired on 28 October. After arriving back in the Bay, Olivia goes to the beach and befriends VJ Patterson (Matt Little), after he catches her laying down on his beach towel. Banno said Olivia was \\"very forward\\" and wanted to gain VJ's attention, so she \\"just puts herself out there.\\" VJ offers to show Olivia around the Bay, but she asks to see his place instead. Banno told Stephen Downie of TV Week that Olivia flirts with VJ to make him nervous. Olivia and VJ then steal some bikes to tour the town. Later that day, Olivia finds Irene and asks to stay with her permanently, after admitting that she has been suspended from her London school. Downie thought there was more to Olivia's story than it first seems. After Olivia begs Irene to let her stay in Australia, Banno confirmed that Olivia has \\"a bit of a past in the UK\\". =Characterisation= Following her reintroduction, Banno thought Olivia was looking for somewhere to belong, whether that was with Irene or a new friendship group. She was also looking for \\"new opportunities\\", and something to \\"fill a void in her life\\", but it was likely that she was running away from \\"some demons in her past.\\" Banno described Olivia as bold, \\"a definite go-getter\\", and as someone who puts themselves out there. She also said Olivia was flirtatious, as well as \\"confrontational and forward, and doesn't care what anyone thinks.\\" She found that while they were similar, unlike Olivia she does not like confrontation at all. Banno believed that Olivia had \\"a darkness about her\\" that tries to keep hidden, and she would make viewers feel sympathy for her. =Feud with Charlotte King= Olivia is threatened by Charlotte King, played by Erika Heynatz (pictured). Olivia was later introduced into the plot focusing on villain Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz). Olivia comes across Charlotte arguing with Irene about being evicted from the flat above the diner. Banno explained that Olivia has heard stories about Charlotte before their meeting, and her opinion of her \\"isn't a positive one form the get-go.\\" Charlotte shows an aggressive attitude towards Irene, which is why Olivia comes to her defence. Charlotte then turns her \\"wrath\\" on Olivia, who stands her ground. The argument is broken up by Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway), but Downie pointed out that the women have become enemies. Charlotte later threatens Olivia, who gets revenge by spreading the trash from the diner throughout Charlotte's flat. Olivia is then questioned by Constable Kat Chapman (Pia Miller), and Banno said, \\"She wasn't expecting to see the police. And, she didn't really consider the consequences of her actions.\\" Charlotte is later shot and killed, which starts a \\"whodunit\\" storyline. Olivia was named as one of several suspects. The identity of the shoot was kept a secret from the cast and crew. Each actor whose character was a suspect filmed a different ending to keep the conclusion to the storyline from being leaked. Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy later broke down the motives for each character. Of Olivia, Dainty speculated that after Charlotte threatened her, she may have got there first. Dainty wrote, \\"Olivia had more reason than most to want her gone.\\" Charlotte's killer was later revealed to be Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher). =Self-harming and sexual abuse= The character was the focus of an issue-led storyline about self- harming. The plot begins when Olivia meets up with Hunter King (Scott Lee) at the local beach pool. She appears reluctant to get out of the water and asks Hunter to turn away while she gets her towel. However, Hunter \\"can't resist a peek\\" and he sees that Olivia has scars covering her thighs, leading him to suspect that she is hiding a secret about her life in London. Of the moment, Banno commented \\"She understands more than anyone why he'd be shocked to see them. That's probably half the reason she's not quite ready to go down that path just yet.\\" While Hunter does not saying anything at the time, he tells VJ what he saw. VJ uses the opportunity \\"to one-up\\" Hunter and assures Olivia that he is around if she wants to talk about her scars, leaving her embarrassed and angry. Banno confirmed that her character has both emotional and physical scars, and that being able to share them with others takes time. She also said that Olivia is \\"trying to take each day as it comes.\\" Irene soon finds out about the scars and during the ensuing confrontation, Olivia \\"freaks out\\" and runs off to the beach, where she collapses in tears. Olivia reveals that the reason she began self-harming was due to the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her uncle's friend. She admits to Irene that she was fearful of not being believed, so she did not tell anyone what was happening. The storyline led to the revelation that Irene was also sexually abused when she was younger, and had given birth to a child that was adopted out. The storyline was revisited in April 2016, after Olivia has an abortion. Olivia struggles to cope and eventually starts self-harming again. Banno explained that it was Olivia's \\"natural coping mechanism\\" when she is faced with something traumatic. No one notices what Olivia is doing, as they are giving her space to deal with recent events. Banno said filming was \\"full-on\\", and she hoped that she brought \\"honesty and sincerity\\" to the scenes. She also praised the writers' decision to explore the issue of self-harm, as it was not often portrayed on television. Olivia's sexual abuse storyline was also revisited after her former friend Tabitha Ford (Eliza Scanlen) pretends to be her abuser Kirk online. The incident brings up bad memories for Olivia and prompts her to go to the police to report both Tabitha and Kirk. Banno told an Inside Soap writer that Olivia believes that she can get justice. She continued, \\"It sounds like the right thing to do. But going through what happened comes with emotional baggage. It's a very vulnerable position for Olivia to be in ‚Äì it's completely terrifying.\\" With Irene's support, Olivia tells Sergeant Phillip McCarthy (Nicholas Cassim) about Tabitha's psychological abuse, but she cannot explain the details of Kirk's abuse and flees the station. Kat later finds Olivia and tells her about her the abuse she received from her former boyfriend. Kat encourages Olivia to return to the station and report Kirk. =Relationships= Hunter King In an early news article about her reintroduction, it was confirmed that Olivia would be paired with Hunter King upon her arrival, after Banno and Scott Lee were photographed filming a kissing scene at the show's outdoor location in Palm Beach. Lee credited Olivia with calming his character down and making him more likeable to viewers. At the start of their relationship, Olivia helps Hunter deal with his grief at his mother's death and his attempts to get to know his new family members. Lee stated, \\"Hunter and Olivia have both been through a lot and they comfort each other. They're both quite lonely. I think you'd naturally gravitate towards someone like that if you've been through what they have.\\" The relationship is tested by Hunter's failure to makes plans for his future, and the introduction of Lindsay Ford (Georgia Flood), who reveals that Hunter cheated on Olivia with her. Hunter and Olivia are brought closer following a \\"traumatic experience\\" in the bush. Hunter organises a romantic picnic for Olivia. But Hunter soon doubles over in pain and struggles to breathe. Olivia \\"panics\\" and has to run to the road to flag down a passing car, which is being driven by Hunter's father Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen). Hunter's condition deteriorates and Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) diagnoses Hunter with a tension pneumothorax over the phone. Nate manages to talk Zac through a procedure to ease Hunter's pain and he is later given the all clear. The incident causes the couple to reaffirm their feelings for one another. Of this, Banno commented, \\"Olivia is keen for a fresh start. The fact they're both on the same page and focused on getting back on track means so much to her.\\" Producers then used the couple to explore the issue of teenage pregnancy. After Olivia organises another picnic for Hunter, he tries to initiate sex, but she rejects his advances and runs off. Laura Morgan of All About Soap observed, \\"it soon becomes clear Olivia's not feeling the same, and something serious is playing on her mind.\\" As she has been feeling sick, Olivia takes a pregnancy test, which comes back positive. Banno described the news as \\"life-changing\\" and thought it would mean big adjustments for her body and her relationship with Hunter. Hunter flees when he learns that Olivia is pregnant, but he soon returns to support her. Banno said the couple were \\"two 16-year-olds dealing with an adult issue\\". Olivia and Hunter decide they are not ready for a child and Olivia has an abortion. Hunter and Olivia's relationship ends after he punches their friend Jordan Walsh (Benny Turland) at a party. The following day, Hunter argues with Olivia after seeing her talking to Jordan, who tells Olivia that she deserves better. Banno commented that Jordan's statement was quite confronting for Olivia to hear. But she soon realises that Hunter's recent actions have really affected their relationship and questions their future as a couple. When Olivia tells Hunter tell what Jordan said, he breaks up with her and she accepts that their relationship is over. Banno thought that her character had become aware of how toxic the relationship had become. Hunter and Olivia later reunite and their relationship is immediately tested by VJ's attempt to kiss Olivia. The storyline begins with Olivia and Hunter taking VJ out to local restaurant Salt to cheer him up, after he loses custody of his step-daughter. VJ drinks to excess and when he becomes verbally abusive towards Hunter, Olivia tells Hunter to leave while she calms VJ down. However, VJ makes a comment about how things could have turned out if they had dated, before trying to kiss Olivia, who pushes him off. Hunter and VJ then fight, with Olivia having to separate them. She \\"goes ballistic\\" at Hunter, causing tension between them. Hunter later decides to propose to Olivia. Although Hunter purchases an engagement ring while he is drunk, Lee thought that his character was serious about his love for Olivia. During a meal at Salt, Hunter puts the ring in Olivia's champagne glass, but it gets knocked over and she believes the ring belongs to someone else. Lee said Hunter was \\"a bit embarrassed\\", especially when Olivia says the ring is ugly. The incident prompts Hunter to plan the proposal out properly. However, Lee did not want Hunter to go through with it, as he believed the couple were no longer compatible. Irene learns that Hunter has organised a second proposal and tells Olivia, who plans to say accept. However, after Hunter makes speech about their relationship, Olivia rejects him and leaves the beach, unable to cope with her guilt at having cheated on him. Mason Morgan Producers later paired Olivia with Bay newcomer Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger). They also formed a love triangle storyline with them and Hunter. When Hunter sees a text message from Mason on Olivia's phone, he forces her to admit that she is romantically interested in Mason. Hunter and Olivia argue, which results in Olivia stating that she might just be better off with Mason. Downie thought that as Mason and Hunter are quite different from each other, this would appeal to Olivia. Downie later noted that both Hunter and Olivia still had strong feelings for one another, but when Mason makes his interest in Olivia clear, she \\"can't help but feel drawn to him.\\" Banno added that Olivia likes the element of curiosity about Mason. After Olivia assures Mason that she and Hunter are moving on, he accepts her invitation to the school formal. Hunter also attends and when he and Olivia dance together, Mason realises that still has feelings for him. The following day, Olivia fails to assure Mason that her dance with Hunter meant nothing. She later learns that Hunter and Mason have been involved in a fight. Pledger explained that Olivia wants them to start over, but Mason rejects the idea. But when they later attend the Summer Grooves music festival, Mason and Olivia share a kiss. Mason and Olivia consummate their relationship at the Summer Bay Auto garage, where they are caught out by Irene and Mason's brother. After Olivia fails to tell Mason about working with Hunter at the Pier Diner, their relationship becomes strained as he believes that she still has feelings for her former boyfriend. Olivia also questions her commitment to Mason when she turns to Hunter for support ahead of her first day at university. Olivia and Mason's break up aired in April 2017, after she finally admits that she still has feelings for Hunter. Although she asks that they continue dating, Mason rejects her proposition and ends their relationship. =Infidelity= Producers later implemented another break-up for Olivia and Hunter. They introduced guest character Axel Boyd (Matthew Pearce), whose presence in Olivia's life helped act as a catalyst for the end of the relationship. Axel is a representative for online clothing retailer, The Find, who signs Olivia as a fashion designer. Of Olivia and Axel's relationship, Banno told an Inside Soap columnist, \\"She and Axel obviously have chemistry, but Liv is trying to work out if it's just creative chemistry or more romantic.\\" Axel later makes romantic advances towards Olivia and kisses her. She decides not to tell Hunter about the kiss, and Banno thought that if she did, it would \\"ruffle more feathers than necessary\\". Axel organises a fashion showcase for Olivia, who invites Hunter and Mason along. However, it soon becomes clear that the couple's differences are starting to have an effect on their relationship, after Hunter mocks her new \\"working world\\". Hunter puts Olivia's career in jeopardy when he organises a meeting with The Trend, a competitor of The Find. When Axel discovers the meeting, he informs Olivia that The Find are cancelling her contract and they will sue if she joins The Trend. In a bid to save her job, Olivia visits Axel to apologise and asks for his help, but he admits that he may trouble convincing his boss not to fire her. He then invites her to stay for a drink, which leads to them kissing and having sex. Speaking to a New Idea writer, Banno stated that Olivia \\"sort of loses her inhibition\\" due to alcohol and she does not think about anything else in that moment. Banno admitted that she was put to the test when she found out about the plot for her character, to whom she had become attached. She found it challenging to film, commenting \\"It's something that I can never see myself doing. It's such a tough moral issue, but you have to play it with integrity.\\" Banno added that she kept apologising to Lee after filming because she had to ignore him during the scenes. Olivia attempts to tell Hunter the truth, but later decides to confide in her friend Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman), who \\"is horrified by Olivia's actions\\". Ziggy gives Olivia an ultimatum ‚Äì either Olivia tells Hunter or Ziggy will do it for her. Ziggy later refuses to be a part of Hunter's second proposal to Olivia, while Axel invites her to accompany him to Paris Fashion Week. Digital Spy's Sophie Dainty reported that Olivia is tempted by the offer, as she is developing feelings for Axel. After rejecting Hunter's proposal, Olivia goes to see Axel at his motel room. =Departure= In the 5‚Äì11 May 2018 issue of Inside Soap, it was confirmed that Banno had left Home and Away and that she had already filmed her final scenes, with Olivia's departure to air later in the year. Banno's final scenes as Olivia aired on 13 August 2018. Olivia leaves the Bay for \\"an exciting work opportunity\\" in Melbourne. Of filming Olivia's exit, Banno said \\"It was a really emotional journey for me, but a positive one to be able to send off Olivia in such an independent way. It was a tough day, because you want to do the right thing by the scene, but you're also feeling quite indulgent yourself.\\" The actress did not rule out a return in the future, and added that it was nice of the producers to leave the door open for Olivia to return to her Summer Bay family. Storylines =1998‚Äì1999, 2005= Following her birth, Olivia is diagnosed with a heart murmur and undergoes surgery. Her mother, Chloe, raises Olivia alone, after her father, Lachlan moves to the United States for treatment for brain damage, and later reveals that he has no feelings for either of them. Lachie's mother, Diana, tries to involve herself in Olivia's life, while Lachie's brother, James also keeps an eye on the family. Olivia falls ill and James takes her to a specialist, who operates to correct a narrow aorta in her heart. James and Chloe have a brief marriage. After Lachie dies, Diana becomes obsessed with Olivia and kidnaps her. Her husband, Peter (Helmut Bakaitis) rescues Olivia and checks Diana into a clinic. Needing a fresh start, Chloe and Olivia move to the city. Six years later, Olivia and Chloe return to Summer Bay, as Chloe is trying to escape an abusive boyfriend. Olivia is orphaned after Chloe dies following a car accident. Chloe's former foster mother, Irene Roberts applies for custody of Olivia, as does Diana. Olivia begs Irene not to let Diana take her, so they leave the Bay, but Barry Hyde convinces Irene to return home. Custody is awarded to Diana, but James announces that he is the executor of Chloe's will, which stipulates that he should be Olivia's guardian in the event of Chloe's death. James and Olivia move to the city, and then London. =2015‚Äì2018= Ten years later, Olivia returns to the Bay alone, having been expelled from her school in London. She befriends VJ Patterson on the beach and they steal some bikes to explore the area. Olivia then visits Irene to ask if she can live with her. Irene soon learns from James that Olivia stole his credit card to buy herself a plane ticket. Irene agrees to let Olivia stay. Olivia is forced to work at the diner, after she and VJ take a car for a joy ride. Olivia also befriends Hunter King and stands up to his mother, Charlotte, when she is aggressive towards Irene. Charlotte later threatens Olivia, so she throws garbage around Charlotte's flat. After Hunter sees scars on her legs, Olivia explains to Irene that she has been self-harming since she was sexually abused by Kirk Shephard, one of James's friends. Irene also admits that she was sexually abused by an uncle, and they agree to see a counsellor. Olivia and Hunter start dating. Soon after, Hunter leaves the Bay when Charlotte's crimes are revealed. Upon his return, Olivia provides comfort when he learns Charlotte is dead. Olivia takes a dislike to Skye Peters (Marlo Kelly) after she moves into the Beach House, but they soon become friends. Olivia interferes when Claire Lewis (Anita Hegh) claims to be Irene's daughter. Hunter refuses to support her when she orders a DNA test, which soon reveals that Irene is not Claire's mother. Olivia breaks up with Hunter after learning that he kissed Lindsay Ford during his time away. Lindsay pays a friend to make romantic advances towards Olivia, and Olivia attempts to slap her. Lindsay takes a ute for a joyride and injures Hunter when she loses control of the vehicle. Olivia threatens to call the police and Lindsay leaves the Bay. Olivia and Hunter get back together and go on a romantic picnic, where Hunter collapses with a tension pneumothorax. Olivia flags down a passing car being driven by Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen), and he helps save Hunter. Olivia learns she is pregnant and she and Hunter decide to have an abortion. Olivia begins self-harming again, but stops with help from housemate Chris Harrington (Johnny Ruffo). Irene is kidnapped by her estranged son Mick Jennings (Kristian Schmid), who attempts to kidnap Olivia too. She manages to place her phone in his car, before escaping. She and Chris track the phone and rescue Irene. During a party, Hunter gets drunk and punches Jordan Walsh out of jealousy when he sees him talking with Olivia. Jordan advises Olivia to break- up with Hunter, and when she tells Hunter what he said, Hunter's angry reaction leads her to end the relationship. Olivia then meets up with Tabitha Ford, a friend from her support group, to attend a charity sleep out event at the high school. Hunter argues with Olivia, and Tabitha later tells Olivia that Hunter called her scars disgusting, which he denies. Olivia continues to spend time with Tabitha, until she catches her framing Hunter for tampering with an exam result. Tabitha later poses as Kirk, the man who abused Olivia. Through an online chat, she forces Olivia to comply with her instructions or risk a video of her abuse being posted online. Hunter catches Tabitha and manages to send Olivia a message telling her what is happening. Olivia reports both Tabitha and Kirk to the police, and Tabitha is expelled. Olivia and Hunter also reconcile, but they break-up once again after they argue over Hunter's career plans and a pregnancy scare. Olivia dates Mason Morgan, but she still has feelings for Hunter and they eventually break-up. Olivia and Hunter decide to move in together. They rent a property without viewing it first and they are later burgled. Irene invites Hunter to move into the Beach House instead. Olivia is reluctant to celebrate her 18th birthday and she expresses her regret that her parents are not around to celebrate it with her. Olivia and Hunter take VJ out to cheer him up and he tries to kiss Olivia, who pushes him away. He and Hunter then end up in a fight. Olivia supports Hunter when he learns Zac is not his biological father. She encourages Hunter to get in contact with his grandmother, who later reports them both to the police for keeping quiet about Hunter's involvement in stealing the diner safe some months previously. Olivia befriends Bay newcomer Ziggy Astoni. Hunter helps Olivia set up a website, so she can sell her clothing designs. Sales are slow to begin with, but after a disastrous launch party at Salt, the publicity generates more interest. Olivia forges Irene's signature to take some money from her trust fund. Irene finds out and after Olivia explains that Chloe taught her to make dresses, Irene invests her own money in the business. Sales soon drop off when a copy of her most popular design is sold on fashion website, The Find. She meets with the company's representative Axel Boyd, who offers her a contract. Axel suggests that Hunter is holding her back, and he later kisses her. Hunter arranges for Olivia to meet a representative from another fashion brand. Axel finds out and he informs Olivia that she has breached the exclusivity clause in her contract. After arguing with Hunter, Olivia visits Axel at his motel, where she gets drunk and they have sex. Axel helps Olivia get her contract with The Find back. Both Irene and Ziggy find out about her one-night stand with Axel, and Ziggy threatens to tell Hunter. Hunter proposes, but Olivia cannot accept and ends their relationship. She stays with Axel in the city, but she feels homesick after talking with Irene and returns to the Bay. She apologises to Hunter, who reveals that he knows she cheated on him. When Olivia explains that she had sex with Axel to save her career, Hunter says he never wants to see her again. They struggle to be friends, especially when Hunter dates Jennifer Dutton (Brittany Santariga). Olivia also struggles to come up with new fashion designs and she later quits The Find. While drunk, Olivia insults Hunter and invites Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost) to move in. Jasmine later overhears Olivia telling Ziggy that she made a mistake. Olivia apologises to Jasmine and admits that she was jealous of her bond with Irene. Olivia and Hunter have a one-night stand, but agree that they should not get back together. Olivia makes Ziggy's wedding dress and is soon commissioned to make another, after Ziggy's dress is spotted online. Olivia receives a job interview with a wedding fashion company in Melbourne, but when she returns she admits that it did not go well once they brought up her history with The Find. However, the company offer Olivia the job and she accepts. Before leaving the Bay, Irene and her friends throw her a farewell party at Salt. She says her goodbyes to Hunter, before leaving for Melbourne. Reception After seeing her return scenes, Downie (TV Week) called Olivia \\"a blast from the past\\", a \\"cheeky blonde\\" and \\"an outrageous flirt!\\" While Frances Sacco of The Daily Telegraph branded Olivia \\"flirty, feisty and a bit of a wild child\\". Downie later observed, \\"ever since she came to the Bay, there has been a degree of danger about Olivia's actions.\\" A writer for TVNZ later included Olivia in their list of the show's \\"most troubled teens\\", where they called her \\"a bit of a wild child\\". A TV Week contributor included the character in their feature on Irene's best foster children throughout the years. Of Olivia and Irene's relationship, they said \\"The two have been through a traumatic time since her arrival in the Bay, with both revealing they were victims of sexual assault.\\" In November 2015, 58% of TV Week readers voted that they liked Hunter and Olivia as a couple. After the couple broke up, Downie commented, \\"In truth, Olivia and Hunter had a tempestuous relationship. Barely a week went by when they weren't fighting with each other.\\" While Downie's colleague Tamara Cullen thought Olivia \\"could be the most hated person in Summer Bay\\" after she rejected Hunter's marriage proposal. In April 2017, Home and Away and fellow Australian soap opera Neighbours were accused of encouraging teenage girls to get pregnant after airing various teenage pregnancy storylines. Olivia's abortion plot was cited as a recent example.

Both buildings were designed by the architect Skjold Neckelmann; the church in collaboration with his professional partner August Hartel, and the courthouse, after Hartel's death, alone.

Hebei Welcome Pharmaceuticals, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case before the Supreme Court of the United States involving the interpretation of foreign law in US domestic courts. The case arose out of a controversy in which Hebei Welcome Pharmaceuticals (Hebei), a company incorporated under Chinese law, and its parent company North China Pharmaceutical Group was accused of price fixing in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act by Animal Science Products (ASP), which filed a class action against Hebei. When the case was before the district court, Hebei claimed that Chinese law required them to price-fix, and this claim was supported by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in written submissions to the court, but this defense was denied on the grounds that there was no evidence that Chinese law actually imposed this requirement; a jury awarded damages to ASP. On appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the district court erred by entering into an independent review of foreign law, and that it should have instead, for reasons of international comity, deferred to China's representation of its own law, provided that this representation was \\"reasonable\\". In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the Second Circuit, finding that respectful consideration must be granted to a foreign government's statements, but not conclusive effect.. The case was the first time that the Chinese government appeared as an amicus curiae in oral argument before the US Supreme Court, and was only the third time that any foreign government appeared as an amicus.

The small Catholic population worshipped in rooms hired in three different buildings in Lowestoft until a permanent chapel was established in a net loft in 1881, when the diocesan parish was founded under the leadership of Apostolic Missionary, Fr. Geoffrey Brennan. However, the chapel became too small to accommodate the increasing congregation, and under a new priest Fr.

It was used to conduct various counterinsurgency (COIN) and patrol missions in riverine and marshy areas where larger boats could not go. Background The Viet Cong (VC) insurgents, one of the US Army's main enemies in Vietnam, relied heavily on motorized and paddled sampans to move troops and supplies throughout the canals, streams, swamps, and rivers abundant in Vietnam, particularly in the Mekong River delta. The boats used by US forces prior to the Aircat's 1964 introduction relied on screw-propellers, which would become fouled by aquatic plants and thus rendered useless. US forces sometimes used paddled sampans to avoid this problem, although these sampans had the same speed as the VC ones and so were unable to effectively pursue and defeat them. Because US boats had trouble navigating the waters of the Mekong Delta, the region quickly became home to many Viet Cong strongholds and logistics bases. In 1961, the US Navy brought airboats and pump-jet boats, neither of which rely on propellers in the water, to Vietnam at the behest of ARVN for testing. The Navy found that airboats outperformed pump-jets and screw-propeller boats in all respects except noise, although they concluded that airboats' noise made them unacceptable for use in counterinsurgency operations. Army special forces and others in the US and South Vietnamese militaries disagreed, however.  Development and selection  In spring of 1964, US Special Forces advisers to ARVN forces in South Vietnam expressed a need for fast, shallow- draft boats. In response, the Commander of the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam, (COMUSMACV) stated an operational requirement in June 1964 for shallow-draft boats capable of carrying 4-5 troops plus crew-served weapons that could negotiate aquatic plants and other obstacles abundant in marshes and rice paddies at speeds of at least . The Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Command (CINCPAC) approved the request on June 19, 1964 and ordered six airboats from two commercial manufacturers‚Äîthe Hurricane Fiberglass Products Company of Auburndale, Florida and Susquehanna Danville Airport of Danville, Pennsylvania‚Äîto evaluate and test them and then select a winner. The Susquehanna airboats were a joint venture between Ken Burrows-owned Danville Airport of Danville and Mari-Mar Industries of Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania. The two models of airboats evaluated were the Hurricane Aircat and the Susquehanna Skimmer. Each Aircat and Skimmer cost about $6,000 each in 1964 (equivalent to about $49,000 in 2018). The Army finished its evaluation by the end of 1965. The Aircat was found to be more durable, maneuverable, and have greater obstacle crossing capabilities than the Skimmer, although the Skimmer outperformed the Aircat in deep water. As such, the Army opted to begin purchasing Aircats in early 1966. =Design= The Hurricane Aircat had a rectangular hull long with beam. The draft varied with speed but was no more than . At top speed, the Aircat could draw as little as a single inch () of water. The hull was made from five layers of molded fiberglass and was semi- catamaran fore and flat-bottomed aft. This unique hull shape helped the Aircat surmount higher obstacles. The Aircat was powered by a 4-cylinder Lycoming O-360 aircraft engine providing . The engine was hooked up to a diameter aerial propeller. The propeller blades were made from wood and tipped with bronze, which sometimes caused a problem, as three propellers failed during the evaluation period when the wood rotted and the bronze tips were separated by centrifugal force. Steering was provided by a stick controlling two air rudders aft of the propeller and propeller guard. Counting crew and passengers, the Aircat could carry payloads of up to . A .30 caliber (7.62 mm) M1919 machine gun was mounted on a pintle mount in the bow. These guns were found to be accurate up to , comparable to the guns of some WWII fighter aircraft. Some crews substituted this gun for the heavier .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2HB machine gun to increase the boat's firepower, though the M2HB often proved too powerful for the flimsy vessel. While the gunner fired, the pilot had to pull forward to offset the gun's recoil or risk the boat being blown about or even capsized. The 57mm M18 recoilless rifle was test fired from an Aircat and proved impractical owing to its extensive back blast. The 106mm M40 recoilless rifle was used on airboats ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù by the 7th Armored Squadron, 1st Air Cavalry Division, who and ‚Äúproven very valuable‚Äù. Using the 106mm recoilless rifle on an Aircat had little effect on the airboat or on accuracy, but issues arose relating to speed and maneuver (the boat could not attain top speed and was not as maneuverable) and ammunition (only 4 rounds can be carried in the boat with the gun; any additional rounds had to be transferred from need to transfer rounds from other Aircats). The 106mm recoilless rifle was fired off to the side to avoid exposing crew to the back blast. The Aircat enabled bringing the weapon over ‚Äúterrain where normally a heavy crew served weapon could not be used‚Äù. The Aircat was equipped with an AN/PRC-25 radio for short-range communication. The AN/PRC-25 posed challenges because of the difficulty hearing the radio over the engine noise and the fragility long antennas, which took a beating from bushes, trees, and other obstacles. Testing by the 5th Special Forces Group found that the noise issue could be overcome by using the radio with a CVC tanker's helmet and that the antenna vulnerability issue could be fixed by using a vehicular radio and antenna such as the AN/VRC-12 or AN/VRC-16. Nevertheless, radio problems persisted at least through 1968‚Äì69. Operational history 5th Special Forces Company D Aircats on the Mekong near the Cambodian border in 1966 During the Vietnam War the Hurricane Aircat was used by US Special Forces and ARVN to patrol and attack in riverine and marshy areas where larger boats could not go. Aircats were used primarily in the of the Mekong Delta and Plain of Reeds though they also saw action in the B·∫£y N√∫i mountains near the Cambodian border. Its most important contribution to the American war effort was in allowing American Green Berets to attack previously unassailable Viet Cong (VC) support bases and strongholds in wetlands and swamp forests. Aircats saw combat on many occasions in which they engaged Viet Cong forces, captured enemy documents, weapons, and munitions, and received enemy fire and suffered casualties. The Aircat proved effective at many types of missions: in its 104 missions in 1965, encompassing reconnaissance, flank security, and assaults, it killed 86 VC, destroyed 26 of their boats, and achieved most mission objectives. Aircats were able to clear obstacles that proved insurmountable for other boats. The Aircat could cross high dikes at and there were several examples of US troops encountering obstacles or blockades in other watercraft, such as Swift Boats and river patrol boats, making a note of the obstacle, and then returning in Aircats and proceeding over it. These characteristics made the Aircat invaluable during the rainy monsoon season, as it could easily cross flooded rice paddies and jump dikes between paddies. The Aircat was very fast relative to other patrol boats, being capable of speeds up to in deep water and on shallow water or rice paddies. Its speed made it ideal for reconnaissance, providing flank security for riverine assault boats, and special forces use. The Aircat's speed and maneuverability was important for US Special Forces because they were able to outrun and outmaneuver most enemy vessels. As such, the craft was used widely by special forces for pursuing and assaulting Viet Cong units in flooded areas in the Mekong Delta. That said, the Aircat's speed and maneuverability could also be a disadvantage, as Aircat crews would often get disoriented without constant aerial observation. The 5th Special Forces Group was especially noteworthy for its use of Aircats, operating 84 of the vessels in the Mekong Delta beginning in early 1967. Colonel Francis J. Kelly, commander of the 5th Special Forces Group from June 1966 to June 1967 and author of a book about US Army Special Forces in Vietnam, praised the Aircat for its \\"speed and firepower,\\" writing that once tactics adjusted to employ the Aircat to maximum effect, Aircats enabled \\"telling victories over the Viet Cong\\" and turned the flood season into a tactical advantage for US forces. The use of Aircats, increases in troop strength, and introduction of other tactics allowed the 5th Special Forces Group to take the fight to the VC and capture territory in the Delta, helping to make the 50% of territory and CIDG bases that were previously too overrun with Viet Cong to enter safe enough to operate in. It also helped the 5th Special Forces Group mount operations and establish CIDG bases deep into territory previously under the control of the Viet Cong. These gains were not without cost, however: 55 Special Forces and 1,654 Vietnamese were killed during 1967, as well as an estimated 7,000 Viet Cong. The 5th Special Forces Group found that the Aircats were most effective when used in combined arms operations with gunships, as the gunships would locate and engage the enemy while the Aircats would use their speed and maneuverability to seal off escape routes. The Aircat was also valuable to special forces because it could be easily transported by Chinook helicopter, allowing for flexible operations across southern Vietnam. In addition to special warfare use, Aircats were used by the South Vietnamese government for transporting important officials and by Vietnamese police forces for inspecting fishing boats. Crew sizes varied greatly by mission. The Aircat could carry as many as 12, although it generally carried no more than six. Crew sizes were reduced to an average of 5‚Äì6 in response to a December 1964 accident in which an airboat carrying 11 ARVN soldiers sank in the Mekong River, drowning five. Observers at the scene believed that the overloading of the boat contributed to the accident. Normal roles for the five-soldier crew were one commander/operator, one machine gunner, one radio operator/assistant gunner, and two riflemen. Aircat airboats in American and South Vietnamese service operated in units of six boats. In use by special forces units, the Aircat often operated with a crew of three: commander/pilot, gunner, and radio operator/grenadier. A rifle platoon could be transported in 6‚Äì8 boats. A US Army Aircat on the Mekong in 1969 Initially, Aircats were able to operate with impunity, as they were faster and sturdier than any enemy vessels. Their dominance of the Mekong Delta led the Viet Cong to develop dedicated anti-airboat tactics and introduce several dedicated anti-airboat traps, including a light naval mine mounted on the end of a bamboo pole and piano wire strung between wooden poles that held fishing traps, used to decapitate or injure airboat drivers and gunners. The change in VC tactics exposed a major weakness of the Aircat: the fiberglass hull offered no protection against gunfire or shrapnel. Standard defensive tactics for the Aircat were to \\"avoid becoming decisively engaged,\\" i.e. to dodge enemy fire and perform offensive actions. The Aircat was also modified to defend against the piano wire traps by welding a large piece of iron to the gun mount that would protect the Aircat crew from the wire. The Aircat's hull was durable otherwise: it withstood ordinary damage and cross-country travel easily. It was also much sturdier than the wooden sampans used by the enemy Viet Cong; Aircats used ramming attacks against sampans to great effect. In one November 1965 battle involving three Aircats battling a VC platoon embarked on sampans in Kien Tuong province, considered \\"a classic instance of successful employment of an airboat unit\\" by the Army Concept Team in Vietnam (ACTIV), ramming attacks were responsible for about half of VC casualties and sampan losses. No Viet Cong survived the battle. A downside of the Aircat was the level of additional training that it demanded from operators, gunners, and repair personnel. Almost every aspect of operating the Aircat proved to require substantial training. Learning the basics of operating an Aircat took two weeks, although ARVN troops often took longer to reach the desired level of competence. Learning to sail in formation and execute tactical maneuvers would take ARVN troops an additional three weeks. Gunners and riflemen also had to receive training in firing at moving targets while moving towards, laterally, and away from the targets. Any engine maintenance required bringing in scarce aircraft mechanics. As ACTIV wrote, \\"Even the most elementary engine repair work required the attention of a skilled mechanic.\\" Though US and South Vietnamese forces had fiberglass-repair capabilities at the unit level, they lacked the ability to do extensive electrical or engine repair, which was often required because the Aircats were initially built with commercial off- the-shelf electrical and drive system components that did not hold up well in Southeast Asian conditions. Of the six original Aircats deployed, one was lost to an accident and the remaining five required considerable engine repair to remain in service by 1965. Another downside was that Aircats could be very loud. The high noise level of the engine and propeller could give away the boats' position. It also made use of radio equipment difficult while the vehicle was in motion, as it was difficult for crews to hear their radios over the sound of the engine. However, the Aircat's noise was found to be both an advantage and a disadvantage, as it was often impossible for enemies to determine how many Aircats were bearing down on them or from where, especially if the boats were used alongside similarly-loud helicopters. The high noise level also contributed to the psychological warfare value of the Aircat, and small groups of Viet Cong would freeze in place when attacked by Aircats. Similarly, field tests by the 5th Special Forces Group Company D eventually found that the using the AN/PRC-25 radio and CVC tanker's helmet sufficiently reduced noise to the point where the radio was usable. However, noise problems persisted at least through 1968. Field research conducted from 1964‚Äì1966 led to the development of tactics that could minimize the boats' noise level. These tactics combined with the low silhouette and high speed of the boats enabled the Aircats to occasionally be highly stealthy and suitable for operations like surprise attacks, special operations insertions, and reconnaissance. In August 1970, the 5th Special Forces Group reported to the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam that its Aircats were \\"excess\\", indicating that they wanted to dispose of them, as a response to decreased operational requirements caused by President Richard Nixon's Vietnamization policy. The 5th Special Forces Group began turning in its Aircats in December 1970 and finished transferring its Aircats to the Military Assistance Command, South Vietnamese forces, or parties in the continental United States, by March 1971. However, some Aircats remained in US service until 1972. Vietnamese strike troops man a Hurricane Aircat in a river operation =Postwar service= Following their service in Vietnam, Aircats were either transferred to other militaries or to civilian use. Starting in 1969, the US Army began to transfer Aircats to the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN). US forces began training ARVN troops to operate Aircats soon after the boat's introduction in 1964, and ARVN troops began crewing Aircats as early as 1967. Available at the National Archives at College Park, catalog entry here: https://catalog.archives.gov/id/31509 In addition to regular ARVN troops, civilian irregulars crewed Aircats. These irregulars were paid by the South Vietnamese government to perform counterinsurgency and patrol missions along the Mekong River, especially in the Mekong Delta and surrounding area. These irregulars included forces from the Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) and Nung militiamen from the Mobile Strike Force Command (MIKE Force). US Navy personnel, including Navy SEALs, helped US Army Special Forces train these irregulars. Many Aircats returned to the United States, where they became widely used by civilians for recreation, commercial jobs, and environmental conservation. Aircats have been used by individuals for fishing, hunting, and personal travel and by companies for tours, geophysical surveying and oil exploration, mosquito control, and transporting workers to oil rigs and construction sites in marshlands. Estimating the number of military Aircats that ended up being transferred to civilians is difficult because Hurricane produced several civilian versions of the Aircat alongside the military model. Between the military and civilian models, over 800 Aircats were built. Some civilian Aircats are still in use today. Aircats are used widely for wildlife monitoring, biological sampling, and other activities in marshy wildlife preserves, especially in National Wildlife Refuges where they are operated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Some Fish and Wildlife Aircats are military surplus, while others are civilian models purchased new. Aircats have proved particularly valuable for bird banding, allowing researchers to band more birds and bird species than was possible using bait-trapping or other methods, although the loud noise of their engines can scare off wildlife. Some civilian Aircats have made their way outside the United States, where they have found use in 28 countries around the world. Outside the United States, Aircats have been used by civilians to transport lumberjacks in Pakistan, bring sick people to missionary clinics in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), control weeds on the Panama Canal, herd livestock in Venezuela, and transport animal specimens in Colombia.

It stars Adnan Senkumba who plays Kenneth Senkumba, a man with a dream to submit his award-worthy script entitled The Bad Mexican to an influential producer at the Masters Music office so that he can make loads of money. He dreams that it will be more than enough to refund Moses (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in full and also enjoy himself at the beach with girls.

Ken's stomach starts grumbling because of the bad Mexican food he had eaten as recommended by the friend. He shits in his pants and has to change them in time for the presentation, his friend (advised by Jess - a girlfriend sitted on a sofa and watching TV) tries telling him to contact a company called Trendz that delivers clothes by GPS but because of bugs in their app; a motorcycle courier instead delivers a grey French cap (nkofira) worth 20,000 UgX.

On 10 June 1940, Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany. During the course of the war, Great Britain and their allies captured in Ethiopia and North Africa approximately 400,000 Italian troops, who were sent to POW camps all over the world, including Australia. Between 1941 and 1945, Australia received custody of 18,420 Italian POWs. The bulk came from British camps in India. During this time prisoners wore burgundy/maroon clothing. Then, after Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the Australian authorities took between 13,000 and 15,000 Italian prisoners out of the POW camps and put them to work. Over the period, several POWs escaped internment camps, at least one was shot for allegedly trying to escape from a camp, one suicided in a camp, , fights between fascist versus anti-fascist supporting prisoners, and others was charged with criminal offences. At least one was named as a party to divorce proceedings. Research undertaken of POWs in northern New South Wales indicated newspapers carried much anti-Italian sentiment: Unionists held concerns unpaid Italian POW labour would displace existing Australian labour; Inequality of Italian POWs had greater freedoms and better food than Australian POWs in overseas camps; and POWs should not be allowed to return to Australia post-war. On an individual level, rapport occurred between landowners and their POW labourers. One brand of red wine currently produced in Australia is called \\"Rabbit & Spaghetti\\", this being the customary diet of Italian POWs in Australia.Internet images The Italian National Ossario at Murchison, Victoria holds the remains of 130 Italian soldiers and civilians who died while interned in Australia.

Education  Wang Xing was born in 1979 in Longyan, Fujian, China. He graduated from Tsinghua University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in electronic engineering in 2001. He pursued a Ph.D. in computer engineering at University of Delaware from 2001 to 2004 but then dropped out of the program. Nevertheless, in 2005, he received a master's degree in computer engineering from University of Delaware.  Startups  After dropping out of University of Delaware, Wang returned to China and, with a couple of friends, tried to create a Chinese version of the then-social networking site Friendster. His first such site was called Duoduoyou (\\"Many Friends\\"), targeting students in various Chinese universities. Unfortunately, Duoduoyou failed to take off. He then started Youzitu to serve Chinese students abroad but the site got shut down. In 2005, he created a Chinese version of Facebook called Xiaonei (\\"On Campus\\"). The site was a hit but Wang had to sell it off due to financial problems. The new owners re-branded the site, which is now called Renren (\\"Everybody\\"). In 2007, he created a Chinese version of Twitter called Fanfou. It was China's first big microblogging site but was soon shut down by the government over politically sensitive content. It was eventually permitted to reopen but by then, other Chinese microblogging sites like Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo had entered the market and captured substantial market share. In 2010, he founded the Chinese group-buying site Meituan, which was based on the business model of Groupon. Meituan was hugely successful and merged with Dianping in 2015 to become Meituan-Dianping.

In the 1980s, Pande presented the UK's Asian television programme Aap Kaa Hak, which ran for fourteen years. He was chair of the British International Doctors' Association (BIDA), formerly known as the Overseas Doctors Association (ODA). In addition, he was the first Asian doctor to be elected as treasurer of the General Medical Council. He is a visiting professor at Gauhati University, India, and at the University of Bolton. He has helped raise funds for charity, including arranging a joint India-Pakistan cricket team to play against \\"the rest of the world\\" in 1985 to raise money for Mother Theresa's charity and the orphans of the Bhopal gas tragedy. In 2018, his story was one of those told in a book on migrant South Asian doctors and was simultaneously part of an exhibition on migrant doctors at the Royal College of General Practitioners in London. Early life and family Pande was born on 25 October 1938 in central British India. Since his father had a business in Bombay (now Mumbai), Pande was able to stay with him and complete his early education in Mumbai. Pande married Kala and they have three children, including two who became GPs. Surgical career After completing his MBBS in 1962 and a master's degree in surgery from Vikram University, Indore, he spent nine years in surgery in various medical colleges before travelling to the Britain to train in surgery for two years. He was one of more than 10,000 South Asian doctors who sought work in Britain in the four decades after the Second World War. He initially worked in accident and emergency at the Royal Albert Infirmary, Wigan, followed by a position as a registrar in cardio-thoracic surgery at the London Chest Hospital, during which time his wife travelled from India to join him. Subsequently, he obtained placements at Broadgreen Hospital and Fazakerley Hospital, Liverpool. His two-year plan extended to four and he therefore remained. General practice By 1975, his children were settling into secondary school and there were increasing job opportunities in general practice. He completed his one- year vocational training in Liverpool and whilst job searching, worked as a GP locum prior to being taken on as a partner with another Asian-born GP who had suffered a heart attack. This practice belonged to a Goan GP, Dr Paes, whose Welsh wife, Dilys, took care of the paperwork and whose daughter carried out the role of receptionist. Without an appointment system, patients turned up and waited their turn. Thereafter, Pande ran this practice and gained another practice in 1981. Being single-handed and unable to always use an expensive locum service meant that Pande had to be available to patients twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year. Other difficulties included some female patients not wishing to disclose their problems to a male doctor. However, as an independent practitioner with some autonomy in decision-making, Pande had the freedom to appoint assistance from a nurse, and in Liverpool was the first single-handed GP to do so. Television Pande became involved in television programmes for Asian people, He hosted a citizens' rights programme Aap Kaa Hak (This is Your Right), broadcast by Granada TV from 1980, for fourteen years. It was founded on the principles of Lord Michael Winstanley's English- language show This is Your Right. In a similar manner, Pande would respond to queries about health and welfare in Hindi and Urdu, whilst his Pakistani barrister friend answered the legal queries. The show introduced Pande to numerous allied health professionals including dieticians and social workers, and he extended their services to his own practice, providing \\"children's health checks, vaccinations, and family-planning clinics\\". He worked as broadcaster for the BBC North West TV and BBC Radio Merseyside, and for 24 years has been a Justice of Peace on the Liverpool bench. In 2002, he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Merseyside. Other roles Pande has been chairman of the British International Doctors' Association, (BIDA), previously known as the Overseas Doctors Association (ODA). He was the first Asian doctor to be elected as treasurer of the General Medical Council. =PLAB= In 1996, Pande initiated and oversaw the pilot of the first part of the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) test to be held in India. The innovation allowed thousands of young Indian doctors to sit the exam in their home country, rather than in Britain. =Charity= In 1984, Pande arranged for India's World Cup-winning cricketers to be involved in coaching unemployed Liverpool youngsters when the Indian cricketers visited the city in 1984. A year later, hoping to achieve a similar success as the music world had done for the Ethiopian famine victims with Band Aid, he raised ¬£20,000 for Mother Teresa's charity and the orphans of the Bhopal gas disaster by forming for the first time, a combined India-Pakistan XI cricket team to play against \\"the rest of the world\\". The match was held on 28 August 1985, at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, home of the Lancashire County Cricket Club, Manchester, one of the sponsors. Players included Clive Lloyd as captain of \\"the rest of the world\\", with Desmond Haynes, Alvin Kallicharran, Peter Lever and Graeme Fowler amongst others from Britain, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. The India- Pakistan team was captained by Gundappa Viswanath, and included Madan Lal, Kirti Azad, Dilip Doshi, Mudassar Nazar, Mohsin Khan and others. The crowd numbered almost 5,000, and it was televised by Granada TV. Pande personally presented the raised funds to Mother Teresa and the then prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi. In addition, he raised funds for the 1993 Latur earthquake victims at a reception hosted by Prince Charles at Kensington Palace. Retirement After 30 years in general practice, Pande retired in 2005. In 2016, Pande was appointed visiting professor in ethics and leadership at Gauhati University, India. A year later, he was appointed visiting professor at the University of Bolton. In 2018, his story was part of an exhibition at the RCGP in London on South Asian migrant doctors in the UK. His interview was one of forty-five oral histories in Julian M. Simpson's Migrant architects of the NHS; South Asian doctors and the reinvention of British general practice (1940s-1980s), used to illustrate how imperial legacies and medical migration shaped healthcare in the UK in the decades following the founding of the NHS.

It is the 'bean' part of the Mexican jumping bean, despite not being a legume like true beans. The 'jumping' is provided by the larva of the jumping bean moth (Cydia saltitans). Name The term 'Mexican jumping bean' usually refers to the seeds that have been attacked by moth larvae, but the entire plant is also called 'Mexican jumping bean.' It was difficult to determine the species of plant responsible for the novelty item at first, as the C. saltitans larva leaves the seed sterile. In addition, a related plant Sapium biloculare (syn. Pleradenophora bilocularis) also has jumping seeds and is also commonly called 'Mexican jumping bean.' However S. pavoniana is the species most commonly sold as curios. In Spanish it is called ('jumper seeds'), or simply ('jumper'). Other Spanish names include ('arrow wood') and ('arrow herb'), but it is not used to create or poison arrows. In Mayan it is called . The Aztecs call it (or ) which means \\"herb of death,\\" but the name is understood as 'seeds against death' and not as causing death. The Yaqui named the seeds (seeds that jump). The seeds are called in German. Johannes M√ºller Argoviensis when he originally described the species first placed it in Gymnanthes sect. Stenogussonia, but the species was later transferred to Sebastiania. The specific epithet pavoniana might derive from the Latin ('peafowl'). However neither the flowers nor fruit are peacock blue or any other shade of blue, but more of a greenish yellow. The seeds do have a spot that might abstractly resemble the eyespot on a peacock's tail feathers. The most likely etymology honors Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n Jim√©nez, from whose collection the species was originally described. Description S. pavoniana is a slender tree or large shrub that grows up to tall. The trunk diameter at breast height is . Initially it can resemble Excoecaria indica, but the female calyx is eglandulose (lacking glands) inside. The branches have subterete twigs with leaves that are up to 8 cm long by 3¬Ω cm wide, but often smaller. The leaves are membranous, fuscous, and glabrous. The leaf shape is oblong- ovate to oblong-subelliptical. The base is obtuse, with the apex shortly cuspidate-acuminate. Margins are bluntly crenate-serrate. Petioles are short, about 8 mm long. Spines are shorter than the leaves, about 3-5¬Ω cm long. Bracts are broadly ovate, subtruncate, and lacerate-denticulate. The plant is monoecious, and thus has both male flowers and female flowers on the same individuals. Female flowers have a calyx with sessile laciniae. The ovary is appressed, broadly ovate, apiculate, and denticulate. The style column very short. Sepals of male flowers are subulate and entire. Male flowers have short pedicels with younger ones subsessile. S. pavoniana has cryptic fruit with hard capsules. Each fruit has three sections. Distribution S. pavoniana is native to northwest Costa Rica in Guanacaste Province, and Mexico, including the states of Baja California Sur, Puebla, Sonora, Jalisco, and Veracruz. Specimens have also been found in Belize. It is one of the most common trees of the Tropical dry broadleaf forest, especially in late-succession forests as it is shade-tolerant. It can be found growing at in elevation. It typically grows in arroyos or other riparian zones. Ecology S. pavoniana flowers in both March and June through August. The pollination syndrome is entomophily (insect-pollinated). Fruiting occurs mainly from the start of the summer wet season in July. White-headed capuchins (Cebus capucinus) eat the fruit of S. pavoniana, as does Cydia saltitans. Occasionally military macaws (Ara militaris) will also eat the fruit. The leaf phenology is late-drought deciduous. The ello sphinx (Erinnyis ello) also feeds on S. pavoniana, and in turn can be parasitized by the braconid wasp Microplitis figueresi. Use by humans Besides the seeds selling as novelty items, the Yaqui grate the unpeeled (and unparasitized) seeds turning them into a flour which is baked into a loaves for feast days. The , or 'bread of hunger,' as it's called, is thought to provide a boost of energy. An American entrepreneur in Havana once tried to sell the flour mixed with chicle to make an energizing gum, but was stopped over concern for accidentally introducing the moth to the island of Cuba. It is not known if this is a true pharmacological effect or a placebo effect, hoping that the observed jumping vigor of the seeds is transferred. If a true biological effect is taking place, it would be similar to chewing coca leaves or drinking very strong coffee.

Life Isham was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Charles Storrs Isham and Lucy B. (Mott) Isham. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London for two years. In 1895 he married Helen Margaret Frue. He died in New York. Career Isham began as a playwright and later turned to novels, writing mainly historical romances and adventure novels set in various periods. Black Friday, for example, centers on the American financial crisis of 1869, while Under the Rose is set in 16th century Europe. His experiences in theater informed his first novel, The Strollers. Published by Bobbs-Merrill Company and its predecessor Bowen-Merrill Company, Isham's novels were illustrated by such artists as Harrison Fisher, William Thacher Van Dresser, Max J. Spero, and W. B. King. The critic H. L. Mencken wrote of his novel Half a Chance that it was \\"a brisk and entertaining story, with not too much reality in it,\\" which well summarizes the general tenor of Isham's work. Several of his novels have been turned into movies. With Max Marcin he turned his 1918 novel Three Live Ghosts into a 1920 comic play, and it was later made into a movie three times: a 1922 British comedy directed by George Fitzmaurice, a 1929 American comedy directed by Thornton Freeland, and a 1936 American film directed by H. Bruce Humberstone. Isham co-wrote the screenplay for the last of the three movies, which are about a trio of World War I soldiers who return home after the war only to discover that they are thought to be dead. His 1914 novel Nothing but Truth was made into a movie twice: as a loose adaptation in 1929 directed by Victor Schertzinger and more faithfully as a 1941 film directed by Elliott Nugent. The Social Buccaneer was a ten- episode 1923 American film serial based on Isham's novel and directed by Robert F. Hill. It is now thought to be a lost film.

The Famine of 1867‚Äì1869 was the last famine in Sweden, and (together with the Finnish famine of 1866‚Äì1868) the last major naturally caused famine in Europe. In Sweden, the year 1867 was known as Storsvag√•ret ('Year of Great Weakness') and, in Tornedalen, as Lav√•ret ('Lichen Year') because of the bark bread made of lichen.H√§ger, Olle; Torell, Carl; Villius, Hans (1978). Ett satans √•r: Norrland 1867. Stockholm: Sveriges Radio. It contributed to the great rush of Swedish emigration to the United States. Causes During the 1860s, Sweden had suffered poor harvests on several occasions. The spring and summer of 1867 was extremely cold all over Sweden. In Burtr√§sk, for example, it was not possible to start sowing before Midsummer: snow was still left in June. The late spring was followed by a very short summer and an early autumn. This caused not just bad harvests, but also made it difficult to feed the cattle. The consequence was rising food prices. This caused widespread famine. The famine struck throughout Sweden, but was particularly severe in the northern provinces. Because of early ice and snow disturbed communications, it was hard to transport and distribute emergency food supplies to the starving areas. The year of 1868 was, in contrast to the previous year, not cold, but a widespread drought caused a failed harvest and starving animals nonetheless, which caused a continuation of the famine. Actions A Charity play organized in favor of the famine victims, Sweden, 1867. In the autumn of 1867, the government of Sweden granted emergency loans to the Northern counties, and the county governors were given permission and encouraged to establish unds√§ttningskomitt√© (emergency committee) to collect the funds needed from volunteers and philanthropists. Furthermore, two central emergency committees were created by the government: one located in the capital of Stockholm and the second in Gothenburg. The press published appeals for funds to help the needed, and charity concerts, charity plays and other similar events were hosted to collect money to pay for emergency help to the victims of the famine. Funds from outside Sweden were also contributed both from Europe and America: in fact, the foreign contributions were reportedly about as large as those from inside the country. Among the contributors from outside Sweden was Jenny Lind, with a sum of 500 kronor, and John Ericsson with a sum of 20 000 kronor. The help from the emergency committees was distributed by the local city councils. Formally, the Poor Care Regulation of 1847, which was in effect at this time, was quite liberal, and would provide help for all who needed it. In reality, however, the emergency help was severely restricted by regulations imposed by the authorities and the elite in opposition to the law, which had come to be regarded as too liberal (it was in fact to be replaced soon after by the strict Poor Care Regulation of 1871). The terms to receive help was not merely starvation: a starvation victim would have to be willing to work to receive help, otherwise they would not be given help. An exception was made for people who were physically unable to work, such as invalids and the elderly, but the regulations stipulated that only 10 percent of the emergency help was allowed to be spent on \\"charity\\", while the rest was only to be distributed to people willing to work in exchange. Therefore, work such as road construction and home production of various form of handicraft objects were organized to give people in need of the emergency help an opportunity to work for it. In practice, these work tasks were meant as a symbolic demonstration that the government would only help those willing to work and be productive. The local city councils were criticized for enforcing the principle of help in exchange for work so far that the most needing were left without help. An example of this abuse occurred in the parish of Grundsunda kommun in √Öngermanland, where no one who could not offer Surety was given help. The local governor, Per Grundstr√∂m, described in the distribution of help in the press: \\"A great mass of beggars and paupers could not be given anything. Torp-dwellers and other undesirables were in fact left without much at all.\\" The authorities recommended that the starving people should eat Bark bread made of lichen rather than expect great amounts of flour in relief help. Some of the local emergency committees, such as the one in H√§rn√∂sand, mixed the flour with lichen and had it baked to bread before distributing it. This bread, however, caused chest pains and, in children, vomiting. Aftermath Caricature from the paper F√§derneslandet 14 December 1867, criticizing the unjust distribution of the relief help committees: the relief help are given first to county governor, and are thereafter given first to the wealthy officials and rich farmers and last, when only an handful is left, to the poor people truly in need. The authorities were exposed to harsh criticism from the press because of how ineffectively the relief funds from the emergency committees were distributed, and on which terms. Notably the paper F√§derneslandet voiced its anger at the fact that those most in need of help were left without because of the unwillingness of the authorities to compromise the principle of help in exchange for work, a regulation the paper described as \\"quasi philosophical thoughts about the value of work\\". There was widespread criticism focused on the belief that the famine in Sweden was caused by unjust distribution. This is supported by the fact that the year of 1867 was in fact a successful year for the Swedish cereal exports: the largest of the farms and estates in Sweden exported their harvests, mostly oats, to Great Britain, where it was used for horse drawn buses in London. There was also a fact that authorities had elected to impose a more strict interpretation than the Poor Care Regulation of 1847 would have allowed, thus making the famine worse than it needed to be. The 1847 law was replaced but a few years after the famine by the very strict Poor Care Regulation of 1871, which followed the strict practice of distribution made by the elite during the famine. The great famine of 1867-68, and the distrust and discontent over the way the authorities handled the relief help to the needy, is estimated to have contributed greatly to Swedish emigration to the United States, which skyrocketed around this time.

Background and construction Eichler Homes was founded as a developer of tracts of single-family houses in the Bay Area suburbs during the California building boom that followed World War II. Joseph Eichler, the founder, insisted on modernist style and used only designs by architects, initially Anshen and Allen and later also Jones and Emmons. The company specialized in constructing these houses cheaply enough to be an affordable alternative to more conventional tract houses.Ned Eichler, \\"A Cherished Legacy\\", in Jerry Ditto and Lanning Stern, Eichler Homes: Design for Living, San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1995, , pp. 35‚Äì117, p. 67.Paul Adamson and Marty Arbunich, Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream, Salt Lake City, Utah: Gibbs Smith, 2002, , pp. 47‚Äì48; they remained more expensive, because of the challenges of construction and the extra attention paid to landscaping and to the layout of subdivisions. The vast majority were of timber, using post and beam construction. Eichler had however commissioned a steel-frame house from Raphael Soriano in 1955; this was built in Palo Alto to demonstrate the practicality and cost-worthiness of building tract houses in steel rather than wood,Neil Jackson, The Modern Steel House, London: E & FN Spon / Chapman & Hall, 1996, , p. 82. was smaller than the X-100, and came in at a cost of $7 per square foot, according to Eichler comparable to that of a timber house.Adamson and Arbunich, pp. 95, 97. Jones had also designed a steel-frame house for the \\"Research Village\\" project sponsored by U.S. Gypsum in Barrington, Illinois, and another in 1954 as his personal residence in Crestwood Hills, Los Angeles (destroyed in the 1961 Bel Air Fire).Adamson and Arbunich, p. 94.Jackson, pp. 77‚Äì79.Cory Buckner, A. Quincy Jones, London: Phaidon, 2007, , pp. 122‚Äì25, 59‚Äì61. Eichler commissioned the X-100 from Jones in 1955, with two aims: further exploration of the practicality of steel for future homes, also showcasing advanced household appliances, some of them prototypes; and promotion of the San Mateo Highlands development, whose location was at the time remote from highways.Suzan Lindstrom and Marty Arbunich, \\"Eichler X-100, House of Steel\\", Eichler Network (undated, pre-2003).Claudine Zap, Realtor.com, \\"Super rare Bay Area Eichler home available to rent for $5,500 a month\\", San Francisco Chronicle, July 10, 2018. Its name may have been derived from the X-15, a manned space project. Ground was broken in May 1956Adamson and Arbunich, p. 96 (photo caption). and the grand opening took place on October 6.Jackson, p. 83. The house structure was pre-fabricated, with advice from Pierre Koenig, like Soriano a Los Angeles architect with considerable experience building in steel.Buckner, \\"Eichler Steel House X-100, San Mateo, California, 1956\\", p. 116 (plan, elevation, and photos on following pages). House The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and a kitchen grouped around the perimeter, with a central utility core containing two bathrooms and utility and laundry areas. Instead of the open atrium of many Eichler houses of the period, it has two interior gardens, dubbed the \\"entry garden\\" and the \\"game garden\\" by the company; there is also a children's play yard, which the two smaller bedrooms open onto, while the master bedroom has glass doors to the backyard.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: X-100, May 3, 2016. The landscaping was by Douglas Baylis.Jackson, p. 84. The thin steel supports and use of glass sliding doors both inside and along the entire rear facade create a sense of openness; the inside entrance to the master bedroom has curtains rather than a door. The house is on a ridge with views of the Coastal Range across open space preserved as watershed and a nature reserve; originally it was possible to see through the house to the hills from the street, which garden walls and gates now prevent. The structure consists of six bents, of which the three at the carport end are longer, of 4-inch H-section columns approximately 13 feet apart supporting 8-inch I-beams. (U.S. Steel indicated in an ad that 16-inch beams would have been necessary if wood had been used.)Jackson, pp. 81‚Äì82. The beams protrude under the roof at the front of the house; Jones turned down the steel decking to form a fascia.Soriano, who accused Jones of copying from his steel house design for Eichler (Jackson, p. 84), used a more delicate steel fascia (Adamson and Arbunich, p. 97). The roof was originally covered with tar and gravel, later replaced with sprayed polyurethane foam. In the gardens, the floor consists of circular concrete \\"steppingstones\\" of various diameters between 18 inches and nine and a half feet, plus some in the entry garden made up of sections of circles to make cloudlike forms. Each garden has three planting areas where bare earth was left between the circles. The house's underfloor heating system extended to the garden pads. The beams and columns are painted deep brownish red (\\"deep-tone cinnamon\\") and the corrugated metal ceiling light grey. For privacy, the side walls have panels of the high- density plywood used for concrete forms. At the front of the house, concrete blocks painted in a coffee color are used for the facade, the wall of the play area, and planters; these are mostly half blocks, with both blocks turned sideways and full blocks forming a decorative pattern. Inside, in addition to track lighting on both sides, the X-100 has plastic skylights (\\"skydomes\\") in each room that are equipped with artificial lighting; one above the gardens and bathrooms is 32 feet long in four sections. It made extensive use of Formica in white, grey, charcoal, and primrose yellow, including reversible white and yellow panels on the kitchen cabinets. Modern and prototype equipment in addition to the underfloor heating (standard in Eichler houses) included a black dishwasher said to incorporate five years of research, a \\"pulverator\\" (garbage disposal), a double oven with \\"vari-speed control\\" and attached to a liquor storage cabinet, a refrigerator-freezer, a washer-dryer, a water heater, a radio and intercom over the kitchen counter, a built-in five-function blender, and a two-burner cooktop for warming food between the two sliding sections of the built-in dining table. There are dual bathtub controls, for use when showering and when bathing. Originally the house had a rotating fireplace in the entry garden and interior decor by Knorr and Associates, furniture by Herman Miller, and accessories by Gump's. Total cost was $125,000. A metal star sculpture that remains on the facade is probably by Matt Kahn, an artist who worked with Eichler. Later history On display as the \\"house of tomorrow\\", the X-100 was visited by 150,000 people, written about in publications including Popular Science, Life, Sunset, Arts & Architecture, and Living for Young Homemakers, and covered in a newsreel. Eichler sold it for $60,000 to Jesper Petersen, a furniture importer; his secretary Anna-Lise Pedersen bought it in 1964 and lived there until her death in 2003. It was then bought by a group named X-100 Partners; one of them, Marty Arbunich, director of the Eichler Network, restored itDan Smith, \\"X-100 Time Capsule Arrives!\\", Eichler Network, April 2017. and is the owner , and it is now a rental house.

Extending over a length of 2.5 km along the coastline, it constitutes one of Qatar's largest archaeological sites as well as containing its largest fort. The town was likely inhabited from the 1500s to the late 1700s. Etymology \\"Ruwayda\\" originates from the Arabic term \\"rawda\\", which refers to a depression that is rich in vegetation due to the accumulative collection of rainfall and sediment run-off.Petsersen et al., p. 323 It may have been given this name due to the presence of a large garden in the town square, although, as this garden was established only after the town's initial founding, this hypothesis raises questions of the town's original name.Petersen et al., p. 345 Location Bedouin grazing his sheep near Ruwayda archaeological site Positioned near the north-western coastline of Qatar, the town of Ar Ru'ays is 10 km to the northeast and the abandoned village of Al Jumail is to the east. Fresh water was most likely available in the area, its extraction having been assisted by the shallow depth of the water table. The coastal waters surrounding the site are very shallow and host a plethora of white mangroves. These mangroves are considerably larger than most others found throughout the peninsula; this lends credence to the availability of fresh water. Written records Historical accounts of Ruwayda are scarce, with only two accounts being known. The first is a manuscript dating to the 1800s called Lam al- Shihab, which, according to Kuwaiti writer and historian Abu Hakima, refers to Ruwayda as being among the towns which were raided by the Wahhabis of Nejd in 1790. John Gordon Lorimer's 1908 encyclopedia Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia is the other source which makes mention of Ruwayda, describing it as an abandoned village located 3 miles north of Al Khuwayr. He reported that, according to local sources, it was deserted around the 1760s when its inhabitants migrated to the newly founded town of Zubarah.Petersen et al., p. 321 Excavation history Due to a lack of standing structures and a dearth of documentation in historical texts, Ruwayda was overlooked by the earliest archaeological expeditions launched in Qatar. It was not until 1973 that the British archaeological mission led by Beatrice De Cardi discovered the site. In her 1978 report, she noted the presence of a fort and two zones of settlement. She also claimed that she and her team unearthed artifacts dating to the 10th century, although to date no archaeologists who have excavated the site have reported similar findings.Petersen et al., p. 322 The Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) sought help from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David to make an assessment of the site in January 2009. Various artifacts and structural remnants were found, prompting the QMA to direct large-scale excavations of the site from 2011 to 2014. Site =Fort= By far the most visible structure of the site is its centrally-placed fort. The fort is square in shape and has a rounded tower. It has two complexes and an outer wall covering an area of 2.25 hectares.Petersen et al., p. 324 The joint QMA-University of Wales Trinity Saint David Archaeological Mission ascribed three phases of construction to the fort.Petersen et al., p. 325 Phase 1 marked the fort's original construction. It was likely deserted for a brief period of time before phase 2 witnessed the reconstruction of the fort, marking the peak of the fort's area. In phase 3, the fort was significantly downgraded.Petersen et al., p. 326 A residential quarter, a garden, two wells and a section containing the remains of what was likely an animal pen are found in the two complexes. Some of these features were added in phase 2.Petersen et al., p. 332 Dating back to the 16th century, there is debate over who constructed the fort, with the two main contenders being the Portuguese and the Ottomans. Construction methods of the fort appear to resemble Portuguese forts at the time, bearing little resemblance to Ottoman forts. Archaeologist Andrew Petersen, who was a key figure in the excavation team from 2011 to 2014, speculated that it was the Portuguese who were responsible for building the fort. Petersen alluded to the lavish and grandiose scale of the fort, pointing out its functional limitations which were not present in Ottoman forts of that period. He also hypothesized that, after being abandoned by the Portuguese, it was rediscovered by Kuwaiti Bedouin tribes in the 1700s who refurbished the fort to protect them from attacks. =Mosques= Situated on the seafront north of the fort is a mosque, which was uncovered from 2011 to 2013. This mosque is thought to have been built in the 1700s. Another structure west of the fort that is yet to be excavated is also purported to be a mosque.Petersen et al., pp. 334‚Äì335 =Warehouse= A structure dubbed the warehouse comprises eight adjacent rooms. Few artifacts were recovered from the premises, although a date press (madbasa) was uncovered.Petersen et al., pp. 335‚Äì336 =Tomb= Roughly 500 meters eastward from the fort is a tomb. Originally, the site accommodated a midden, but this midden was eventually converted into a raised entrance once a small rectangular building was built next to it. Structural evidence indicates that it is likely this building did not have a roof. It is not known who was buried in the tomb.Petersen et al., pp. 339‚Äì340 =Workshop= Large quantities of bitumen, pottery, glass, metalwork and marine shells have been found in an excavated structure known as the workshop. A tentative description of this structure offered by the joint QMA-University of Wales Trinity Saint David team is that it previously served as a boat repair shop.Petersen et al., pp. 338‚Äì339 References Bibliography * Category:Archaeological sites in Qatar Category:Al Shamal ","title":"Ruwayda"},{"id":"57953795","text":"Clay Central‚ÄìEverly Community School District (CCE) is a school district headquartered in Royal, Iowa, United States.\\"Home.\\" Clay Central-Everly Community School District.

His father was Jean-Baptiste de Cornulier-Lucini√®re, Comte de Lucini√®re. He joined the navy as √©l√®ve de la Marine (naval officer candidate, or Midshipman) 2nd class on the training ship Orion in Brest harbour, and in 1830 was named √©l√®ve 1st class. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour for the taking of the B√¥ne Kasbah on 10 May 1832. Naval officer (1833‚Äì70) Cornulier was named enseigne de vaisseau (sub-lieutenant) on 1 January 1833. On 4 January 1838 he married Louise-Elisabeth-Charlotte de la Tour-du-Pin-Chambly in Nantes. Their children included Henri-Raoul-Ren√© (1838), Paul-Louise-Ernest (1841), Camille- Louis-Marie (1844) and Anne-Augustine-Marie-Victorine (1847). He was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau 2nd class (lieutenant) on 21 December 1840. He served in Africa and Sumatra. In 1847 he was named Officer of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword for his participation in the Treaty of Set√∫bal. Cornulier was promoted to capitaine de fregate (frigate captain) on 2 December 1852. He was made Officer of the Legion of Honour on 12 August 1854 after a cruise in the Black Sea during the Crimean War. Cornulier was promoted to capitaine de vaisseau (captain), and officer of the Turkish Order of the Medjidie on 2 December 1855 for taking the Kinburn Fortress during the Battle of Kinburn. In this attack he commanded the floating battery Lave. He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour on 12 August 1861. Cornulier participated in the bombardment and capture of Acapulco during the second French intervention in Mexico. He headed the √âcole Navale and was a member of the Admiralty council several times. On 4 March 1868 he was promoted to contre- amiral (rear admiral). Cochinchina (1870‚Äì71) Cornulier was governor of Cochinchina from 8 January 1870 to 1 April 1871. When he took office Napoleon III told the court of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c, Emperor of Vietnam, that Cornulier spoke in his name. He seems to have been a liberal governor, tolerating the Buddhist customs of the local people. When news reached Cornulier of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War he began preparing the defenses of Saigon to guard against an attack by Prussia. He fell ill after 15 months and asked to be allowed to return to France. Last years (1871‚Äì86) Cornulier joined the naval reserve in 1873. On 2 March 1874 he was named mayor of Nantes by presidential decree in place of M. Waldeck-Rousseau, who had resigned due to illness. He died on 23 March 1886 in Nantes at the age of 74.
