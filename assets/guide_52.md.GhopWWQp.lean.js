The program featured short comedy skits and cartoons and was known for humor that appealed to adults as well as children. Personal life Thompson was born in New York City on December 18, 1931 to William and Marie Thompson, who had met while attending the University of Arizona. The Thompsons were a wealthy family who had made a large part of their fortune through mining operations in Arizona carried out by Bill's great-uncle, William Boyce Thompson, and grandfather, J. E. Thompson. As a child, Bill visited J. E. Thompson's estate in Phoenix, the Rancho Joaquina House, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on the historic register for the City of Phoenix. Bill's father traded stocks on Wall Street. When Bill was three, the family moved from Manhattan to Bronxville, New York, where he grew up near the Thompson family's mansion. After graduating from Bronxville High school, Thompson attended DePauw University, where he studied art and acting, but was not an enthusiastic student. Around that time, he began writing children's stories featuring a character named Wallace Snead. In 1952, Thompson dropped out of college, moved to Phoenix, married Donna Cope and started a family. They had three children: Carrie, Annie and Tony. They eventually divorced and, on March 4, 1974, he married Katie Frye. Thompson died on July 23, 2014 of undisclosed causes in Phoenix. Career After arriving in Phoenix, Thompson worked in the circulation department of The Phoenix Gazette newspaper. He eventually was hired by KPHO-TV and, on April 1, 1954, his character Wallace Snead first appeared on the KPHO-produced children's program, The Golddust Charlie Show. KPHO's program director, Bob Martin, soon offered him his own show and in January 1955 it debuted as It's Wallace? The following year, \\"Ladmo\\" (Ladimir Kwiatkowski) joined the program. On June 15, 1970, the title was officially changed to The Wallace and Ladmo Show, as it had come to be known colloquially. It continued broadcasting, Monday through Friday, until its last taping on December 29, 1989—one of the longest-running, daily, locally produced children's television shows in American broadcasting. Thompson holds a prominent place in the cultural history of Arizona and has been inducted into Arizona Historical Society's hall of fame. In addition to his TV program, he made thousands of personal appearances and performed at live stage shows and in the 1960s he owned a chain of fast-food restaurants with his co-host, Ladmo. The Wallace and Ladmo Show won many awards, including nine Emmys, and has been credited by Steven Spielberg, Alice Cooper and generations of Phoenicians as having a formative influence on them. After The Wallace and Ladmo Show left the air, Thompson, then 58, essentially retired from broadcasting and public life.

In 1972 Trotti became professor of Painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, where he taught until 2000. He holds teaching posts in Peking and in Canton, in the People's Republic of China. Early life Trotti was born at Monte Urano, in the Marche region of central Italy, in 1934. He moved to Rome, where he became friend with other Italian important Masters as Luigi Montanarini, Domenico Purificato, Pericle Fazzini, Sante Monachesi and Corrado Cagli. Career His first personal exhibition has been held in 1954 in Porto San Giorgio. During the '60s Trotti's pictorial research is directed towards abstractionism and experimentations on glass and plastic materials: Cellophane, Cartesian Axes, Rice Beans, Televisions and Crates. In the '70s Trotti develops a more figurative painting, which does not leave out the geometric shapes and realizes the famous series of \\"White Nudes\\" and portraits of the Japanese Yoko. Since 1970 he has traveled abroad and in 1973 he exhibited in Syria, at the Urnina Gallery in Damascus. He has traveled to Thailand and India, Egypt and the Middle East, thus enriching his pictorial research with new subjects and new suggestions (Buddhas and portraits of oriental women, a theme that returns throughout his career). The portraits, the nudes of women, the landscapes of Rome and the Marche hills are pictorial themes constantly present in the art of Trotti. Reputed among the greatest European figurative painters, his works have been shown in several exhibitions in Italy and abroad: in 1977, personal exhibition at the Galleria Vittoria in Rome on the theme of geraniums, with a presentation by Costanzo Costantini and Ferruccio Ulivi; in 1982, an anthological exhibition at the Palazzo Bosdari in Ancona, presented by Franco Solmi; in 1985, a major anthological exhibition at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara, curated by Franco Farina and Carmine Benincasa and a group exhibition at the Museum of Philadelphia, together with other important Italian masters. In 1986 the Museum of Sao Paulo (Brazil) hosts an exhibition on Trotti's abstract works. In 1992 an exhibition in St. Petersburg, where he meets many artists and writers including the writer Vladimir Asimov, who will write an essay on his painting. In the same year, a successful anthological exhibition in the Monumental Complex of San Michele a Ripa in Rome with a presentation by Carmine Benincasa. Parallel to the pictorial activity Trotti also carries on the graphic design by making many etchings. In 1998 an anthological exhibition in Ascoli Piceno and Monte Urano, with the presentation of Claudio Strinati. In 1999 Trotti was invited to China, and exhibited in Canton, Peking and Shanghai. In 2007 he had another large exhibition in Shanghai, and was appointed professor of history of art at the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Peking and at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in Canton. In 2008 an important exhibition has been held at the Goza Gallery in Bratislava. A retrospective exhibition of his work has been held at Civitanova Marche in the province of Macerata in the winter of 2010–2011. In 2010 he was between few living painters to participate in \\"Romaccademia - a century of art from Sartorio to Scialoja\\", an exhibition held at the Vittoriano complex in Rome in honor of the great masters of the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. From 1984 his self-portrait figures permanently in the Vasari corridor of the Uffizi in Florence.

It is a long rectangular open area on the southwest side of New Hampshire Route 107A (Main Avenue), a historic main road between Kingston, New Hampshire, and Newburyport, Massachusetts. The historic district extends along Main Avenue south to the Massachusetts state line and north to the Nettle Hiller House, and westerly along Hilldale Avenue. It includes a cluster of civic buildings that are predominantly Greek Revival in character, including the town hall, Baptist church, and Barnard School, all of which were built during the 1830s. The residential character of the area is significantly early 20th-century in character, due to a 1912 fire that destroyed a number of houses facing the common, but there are a number of 18th and early 19th- century houses. The district is anchored at the southern end by the Kiely House, a Georgian brick house that stands on Main Avenue just north of the Massachusetts line. Not far to its north is the c. 1720 Ordway House, the only surviving Georgian saltbox in the town. Before reaching the green, the road passes a c. 1820 Federal house that once functioned as a tavern serving stagecoach customers. The civic buildings are clustered around the eastern end of the common; the c. 1832 Greek Revival Baptist church is oriented facing east toward Jewell Street. Directly north of this area is the \\"Hilltop Fire\\" area, in which nine older structures were demolished in 1912; this area is now populated by Colonial Revival and other 20th-century houses that are similar in scale to other residential architecture in the district.

Construction began in 1764, and several notable civil engineers were involved with the scheme over the years. Despite the high costs of the initial scheme, it was not particularly successful, because of the refusal of the ship owners of Hull to allow an outlet at Marfleet. They insisted that the water be discharged into the River Hull to keep the channel free of silt. Following a period of agricultural depression and the building of new docks in the early 1800s, an outlet at Marfleet was finally authorised in 1832. A high level system still fed upland water to the Hull, but the low level system discharged into the Humber, where levels were considerably lower. Following the success of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston Drain, the trustees looked at such a possibility for the Holderness Drain, but the development of the Alexandra Dock in the 1880s and then the King George V Dock in 1913 provided a solution, as the docks were topped up with water pumped from the drain, to lessen the ingress of silt-laden water. Responsibility for the scheme rested with the Trustees of Holderness Drainage from its inception in 1764 until 1930, when a major overhaul of land drainage legislation took place. Since then it has been managed by a catchment board, a river board, a river authority, a water authority, the National Rivers Authority and the Environment Agency. Since 1930, the smaller drainage ditches that feed into the Holderness Drain have been the responsibility of an internal drainage board. In order to improve the efficiency of the system, pumping stations were built at Tickton, Great Culvert and East Hull in 1972. However, attitudes to land drainage have changed and the Tickton station is now deemed to be uneconomic, and will be closed down unless alternative sources of income to fund its operation can be found. History The valley of the River Hull was regularly inundated with fresh water in the north, and salt water in the south in the early medieval period. Hamlets along the edges of the Humber and the Hull built banks to prevent the inundation by sea water in the early fourteenth century, as King Edward II appointed commissioners in 1311 and 1313, with responsibilities to inspect and repair the banks. However, the commissioners were only appointed when the walls were breached, and once repairs had been made, they were disbanded. There was no regular inspection of the banks. As well as preventing the ingress of sea water, the banks also prevented fresh water from the land reaching the Humber, and so a network of channels were cut, to channel water to the Hull and the Humber. Primitive sluices were built where the channels passed through the banks, to ensure that water only passed in one direction. The carrs to the north remained flooded, although a number of channels were cut through them by the monks from Meaux Abbey. These ran in an east-west direction and were primarily to aid transport by boat, rather than for drainage, although their large size tended to have some effect on the land. A move towards a more comprehensive system of control occurred in 1532, with the passing of the Stature of Sewers. This created Commissioners of Sewers in the main areas of England and Wales which had significant areas of marshland. They had considerable powers, which were exercised through Courts of Sewers. Two such Courts were created in the Hull valley. One was based at Beverley, with separate juries for North, Middle and South Holderness and three other areas, while the second was based at Hull. They were initially only concerned with existing banks and drains, but in 1580 they organised the construction of a new drain to link Monkdike to Forthdike, providing a more southerly outlet for the water, where the level of the Hull was lower at low tide. An extensive survey of all the drains and banks was made between 1660 and 1662, with the details recorded in a book of pains, now held by the East Riding Record Office. Pains was the term used for records of the size of such structures, the intervals at which they had to be repaired or scoured, and the penalties for failing to carry out the repairs. The idea of taking the waters from the carrs in the north to a new outlet near Marfleet on the Humber was suggested by Mr Snow in 1671. He was a Commissioner of Sewers, and proposed a new drain from Forthdike to Marfleet, passing to the east of Sutton, whose inhabitants had resisted previous attempts at a solution. Snow offered to cut the drain in return for use of the drained land for a period of 21 years, but he failed to obtain the consent of the landowners or an Act of Parliament to authorise it. Sir Joseph Ashe made some improvements to his Wawne estate, which included cutting the Engine Drain, at the end of which he built two windmills to raise the water into the Hull. Others followed suit, and there were around a dozen drainage windmills in the area by the early eighteenth century. =First phase= In 1763, landowners decided that the carrs to the east of the River Hull could be turned into profitable land, and obtained an Act of Parliament to exclude this area from the jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers. It created Holderness Drainage, a legal entity with powers to construct new banks and drains. Plans for the drainage of Holderness were then put together. John Grundy, Jr. was approached to produce plans for the drainage of some of low-lying land to the east of the River Hull. He worked with John Smeaton on the initial assessment, and the two men visited the area in November. There was significant opposition to his plans for the main outlet to be at Marfleet, since the shipping owners felt that the scouring action of the fresh water on the mud banks near the lower end of the Hull was vital to maintain the Old Harbour, as this part of the river was known. With limited financial resources, Holderness Drainage were unable to resist the pressure, and the plans were altered to have an outlet at Stoneferry on the Hull, and reduced dimensions for the drains. Grundy wrote the final report, completing it on 30 December. Smeaton then reviewed it, and suggested only minor modifications, as he was happy with all the major points. The land surveyor Charles Tate produced an engraved plan, and Grundy went to London to steer the bill for the scheme through Parliament. The bill became an Act of Parliament on 5 April 1764. Grundy's life was marked by tragedy shortly afterwards, when his wife of 21 years died, and remarkably personal letters between the two engineers have survived. Although busy with the Calder Navigation by then, Smeaton made the time to visit the area with Grundy on 4 July, in response to a request from the Trustees of the scheme to view the low grounds and carrs. Grundy produced a report on 14 July, and then designed the outfall sluice, which had two arches with sluices. Smeaton again reviewed the plans in September, suggesting improvements to the foundations, and this was his last involvement with the scheme. Grundy submitted his report on the sluice in December 1764, which included a detailed bill of quantities, with an estimated cost of £1,800. It appears that Grundy had been acting as Chief Engineer since July 1764. In addition to the main drain, the scheme involved the construction of of barrier bank, on the east bank of the River Hull, to prevent inundation of the low-lying land from that source. Construction of the bank had begun in July 1764, with John Hoggard acting as Superintendent of the works. In March 1765, work on the main sluice began, and bricklayers, carpenters and masons were employed. The resident engineer or 'Surveyor' for this part of the work and for the construction of the main drain was Joseph Page, who was paid £80 per year. Throughout the contract, Charles Tate, who had produced the original engraved plan, worked as the land surveyor. Grundy in his capacity as Chief Engineer, visited the sites on four occasions in 1765, and continued to do so until October 1767, when the main drains and sluice were finished. Both he and Page then moved on, but work on the banks and drains continued under the supervision of Hoggard. By the time this first phase was completed in 1772, the cost had been around £24,000. Some work continued until 1775, consisting largely of raising river banks, making drains deeper, and extending the drains that had been created. However, the system was inadequate, as there were large areas that remained under water near Leven, in the north of the area, and at Weel, to the east of Beverley. Flooding during the winter months was still a regular problem, because the drains could not cope with rain from the low-lying carrs, when they were full with water from higher ground to the north of Holderness. The engineer William Jessop spent a month investigating the problems, studying some , and presented a report in July 1786. Further survey work was then carried out by George Plummer, and formed the basis for Jessop's detailed plan, which was agreed in 1787. He produced specifications for drains, embankments, dams and tunnels, with the overriding principle that the water from the uplands to the north should be kept entirely separate from the internal drains of the area. Once the project got under way, Jessop visited from time to time to check on progress. He made a total of seven visits between 1789 and 1792, when his involvement and that of George Plummer, who had acted as resident engineer, ceased. Anthony Bower then took over as resident engineer, overseeing the work until 1795. This phase of the scheme was finally completed in 1805, at a cost of £16,000. =Second phase= Despite the large amounts of money spent on the schemes, they were not particularly effective, because of the failure to provide an outfall at Marfleet. Ship owners continued to oppose such a plan until at least 1810, and there was an agricultural depression from 1815 to 1830. During this period, the port of Hull developed, with the opening of Humber Dock in 1809 and Junction Dock (later Princes Dock) in 1829. By the time the agricultural industry began to recover, the carrs were in a bad state, but so was the Old Harbour at Hull. Holderness Drainage acted quickly, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1832, which authorised the construction of a drain to Marfleet, where the outlet sluice (known locally as a clow) could be built at a lower level than previous outlets, thus providing a better gradient for the flow of the water. The old Main Drain was embanked where it crossed the carrs, and was used to carry runoff from the streams of Holderness to the Hull. The new lowland drain carried water from the carrs to Marfleet, passing under the upland drain in the Great Culvert. Where possible, old drains were made straighter, wider and deeper, and the meres in the Leven and Tickton area soon disappeared. By 1854, around one sixth of the land was still subject to occasional winter flooding, but most of the carrs were by then used for crops, rather than for pasture. Flooding in the Holderness Level increased between 1840 and 1880, as farmers used tile drains to keep their land free of standing water. These carried the water away more quickly to the main drains, increasing the peak flow. Where this drained into the upland drain, this was not a problem, but where it entered the lowland drain, it caused difficulties, particularly when Marfleet was tide locked. Following the successful introduction of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston drain, to the west of the River Hull, the Trustees looked at the possibility of installing pumps as Marfleet. However, help came from another source. The Alexandra Dock was built to the west of the final section of the drain in the early 1880s. Research on the original Hull Dock had shown that around 1.25 million tons of mud were deposited in the dock each year, as a result of the muddy water of the Humber entering the dock for 2 to 3 hours at each high tide. In order to mitigate the high cost of dredging to remove this material, the water levels in the dock were maintained by pumping fresh water from the Holderness Drain. Pumps capable of pumping 14.5 million cubic feet (410 Ml) per day were installed, resulting in significant savings in the cost of operating the dock. Pumping from the drain increased again in 1913, when the newly constructed King George V Dock opened, and again required clean water. For Holderness Drainage, this provided the benefits of pumping without the cost. =Administration= Holderness Drainage were responsible for the management of the system until 1930, when the Land Drainage Act 1930 became law. This organised the low-lying areas of England and Wales into catchment areas, each with its own catchment board. These boards were responsible for the main rivers within a catchment basin. For the Holderness region, responsibility for the River Hull and the Holderness main drain passed to the Hull Catchment Board. Holderness Drainage then became an internal drainage board (IDB), with responsibility for the smaller drains. Responsibility changed again with the passing of the River Boards Act 1948, which created the Hull and East Yorkshire River Board. The next change occurred as a result of the Water Resources Act 1963, when the Hull River Board was joined to the Yorkshire Ouse River Board to become the Yorkshire Ouse and Hull River Authority. Further amalgamation and reorganisation took place following the passing of the Water Act 1973, when the river authority became part of the much larger Yorkshire Water Authority. Yorkshire Water Authority was privatised as a result of the Water Act 1989, and responsibility for main rivers including the Holderness Drain passed to the National Rivers Authority, which subsequently became part of the Environment Agency in 1995. Similarly, the internal drainage boards have gradually amalgamated into larger units. The Holderness IDB first merged with the Beverley IDB, and subsequently with the Beverley and Barmstom IDB, to become the Beverley and North Holderness IDB in 1981. They are responsible for an area of in which they maintain of drains, including those that feed into the Holderness Drain. Some 70 per cent of the area is dependent upon pumping stations to prevent flooding. =Development= Holderness Drain has three pumping stations along its length, which manage changes in level. The first is at Tickton, which was built in 1972 as part of the Holderness Drain scheme. The second is the Great Culvert pumping station, which was built at the same time. This is located close to the point of the original Great Culvert, which carried the high level drain to the River Hull over the low level drain to the Humber. Water from Monkdike and the Foredyke Stream was diverted into the low level drain, with the pumping station raising water from the remainder of the low level drain to the north. The rest of the Foredyke Stream, which carried the high level waters through the city to the River Hull at Stoneferry was abandoned. The East Hull pumping station, near the outlet of the Holderness Drain, has a capacity of , and is jointly managed by Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency. It was originally constructed in 1949, so that the outflow from the drain could be pumped into the Humber when the level of the tides prevented gravity discharge. A major upgrade by Kingston upon Hull Corporation took place in May 1972, when it was extended to pump sewage flows into the Humber as well. In 2010, the Environment Agency looked at the costs and effectiveness of the pumping stations, and concluded that only East Hull significantly reduced the risk of flooding to properties. Costs to run Tickton pumping station were about £20,000 per year, and it was decided to continue operating it for a further five years, while working with local communities to find other sources of funding for it. Although deemed uneconomic, Great Culvert pumping station would continue to be used, as removing it would result in water from the high level system flowing back up the Holderness Drain, increasing the risk of flooding. At the time, a £900,000 refurbishment scheme was being carried out at East Hull pumping station, and ways to increase its capacity were under investigation. Of the four pumps, the two ones were refurbished first, followed by the two ones. All of the pumps have been available for pumping water from the drain since 2006, when pumping of sewage was discontinued following the commissioning of Saltend Waste Water Treatment Works, and the deep level sewer that connects it to Hull's sewerage system. As part of a £28.5 million flood alleviation scheme for Hull, the Environment Agency decided that the East Hull pumping station had reached the end of its life, and that constructing a new pumping station would be more economical than refurbishing it. Following a planning decision in April 2020, work started on the new structure in May, which is located to the south of the existing station, nearer to the Humber. It will be capable of pumping in conditions where water levels in the drain are high and the tide in the Humber is also high. The Holderness Drain Flood Alleviation Scheme is a multi-agency project, jointly funded by the Environment Agency, Hull City Council, East Riding of Yorkshire Council, the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership and Highways England. Phase 2 of the project, to create a flood relief area to the east of Bransholme and Sutton near the Castle Monument, is expected to begin later in 2020. Navigation When the commissioners approached Jessop in 1786 they had asked him > \\"... to take a view of the works of the Drainage, and of the River Hull, and > to report what measures (in his opinion) ought to be pursued to give the > best effect to the undertaking; what will be the probable expence of those > measures, whether a navigation be compatible with the drainage, and if it > be, what additional expence would be required to effect a navigation (as > well as a drainage) from the outfall to Monk bridge.\\" His report of 1786 had stated that a navigation might be an advantage to the drainage. He estimated that it would cost an additional £5,136 to make the main drain suitable for craft drawing . The cost included a number of passing places, and the provision of two locks. However, the trustees did not take the plan any further. An independent group proposed a canal running parallel to the drain in September 1791, which would be navigable from near the Holderness outfall to Monk bridge, or to Leven, about further to the north. The drainage trustees were anxious to ensure that such a plan would not damage the drainage, and asked John Hudson of Louth to assess it in February 1792. The promoters then petitioned Parliament in March, but the plan foundered. In 1799, Mrs Bethel asked Jessop to produce a plan for a canal running westwards from Leven to the River Hull. Jessop did so, and reported that the canal would not harm the drainage. However, the trustees were nervous, and asked Mrs Bethel to pay for a second opinion. She employed James Creassy, who agreed with Jessop, and with the blessing of the trustees, she obtained an Act of Parliament in 1801. The Act stipulated that Jessop and Creassy must agree that any work carried out would not harm the drainage, and if they could not agree, then they were to consult the engineer John Rennie. As a further measure, Mrs Bethel provided an indemnity against the canal damaging the drainage. The canal crossed the main Holderness Drain on an aqueduct.

Life  Marcel Lanquetuit was born in 1894 in Rouen, Normandy, France. His father, Charles (18601932), was a church musician at the church of St-Godard de Rouen. Lanquetuit began his musical studies in his hometown under Albert Dupré, and then began learning the organ and music theory (harmony, counterpoint, fugue) privately with Albert's son Marcel Dupré. From 1910 to 1914, he played the organ at St-Godard de Rouen. Meanwhile, he continued his studies. In 1913, he studied at the Paris Conservatory of Music under Eugène Gigout, and in 1914 won the Conservatory's 1st prize for organ. He served in the armed forces from 19141919, and in 1918 he married Marcelle Lacombe. They had one son, Pierre, an architect. He became principal organist at St-Godard de Rouen in 1920. In 1926, he made a recital tour of the United States, visiting New York City, Princeton and Philadelphia (where he played the famous Wanamaker Organ, by some measures the largest pipe organ in the world, in Wanamaker's department store). In 1938, he was appointed principal organist at Rouen Cathedral, and retained this position until 1978. He also filled in from time to time at the church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris when Marcel Dupré was on tour. He taught privately, and was the substitute for Marcel Dupré at the Paris Conservatory before the Second World War. He was then professor of organ at the Rouen Conservatory for 15 years, where his students included Pierre Labric, Bernard Havel, Jean-Claude Touche, Odile Pierre, René Alix and Marie-Thérèse Duthoit (his successor in Rouen). He died in 1985 at the hospital in Bois-Guillaume, Normandy.  Work  Only a few of Lanquetuit's works have been preserved. He preferred to improvise, and a large part of his work was destroyed by a fire in his house in 1940. His reputation as a composer is based primarily on a Toccata in D major, published in 1927 by Éditions Alphonse Leduc. He also wrote a short Intermezzo for organ in G major.

It was built for Magistrate William O'Reilly who served as Magistrate of Placentia from 1897-1923. He was the son of Thomas O'Reilly who had been the magistrate of Placentia from 1877-97. In 1902, Magistrate O’Reilly employed the architect W.J. Ellis to build a Balustrade Queen Anne Victorian house that would serve as his family home. Description Consisting of two storeys, the exterior of this Victorian bracketed house is defined by narrow wooden clapboard. Alongside this feature, the house contains several design elements that reflect the typical style of Victorian houses. Accordingly, an entablature was placed above the front door and in the entrance-way, the architect added decorative stained glass windows which were placed alongside the interior door of the foyer. Double-bay windows with pediment also highlight the front of the house. Inside the house, the rooms on the ground floor are typical of Victorian decorative arts with a parlour and dining room near the front of the house and a kitchen and pantry in the rear. Leading out of the kitchen is a narrow and modest stairway that led to a room that would have been reserved for the maid who worked in the house. The parlour also contains several attributes including \\"very large double bay windows, dentil mouldings, pocket doors, roundels, stained glass windows, four fireplaces, large handcrafted mouldings throughout and a handcrafted staircase.\\" The main stairway is defined by unique details. Close to the top floor, one of the wooden railings is inverted. Whether this detail was intentional or unintentional is unknown. However, it remains one of the original elements of the house. The various rooms in the house were warmed by fireplaces. On the ground floor, there is a fireplace in the parlour, as well as another in the dining room. Two of the rooms on the second floor each possess a fireplace. House of the Magistrate Magistrate William O'Reilly stepped down in 1923 and was followed by Michael Sinnott. At the time, the O'Reilly family continued to live in the O'Reilly House until the death of William O’Reilly in 1928. Afterwards, in the mid-1930s, the O'Reilly House was rented to the Cahill family. When William Linegar became the Magistrate in 1939, after Michael Sinnott stepped down, he privately leased the O'Reilly House as accommodation for himself and his family. It was several years later in 1943, when the Government of Newfoundland (Department of Justice) purchased the house in order for it to be used as the official residence for the magistrates.Placentia Magistrates House 1943-1944 The Rooms, Provincial Archive of Newfoundland and Labrador, #49 Box 117 GN 13/1/B. William Linegar remained as Magistrate until 1972 and was followed by Magistrate Terrence Corbett who did not reside in the house. Although William Linegar was no longer the magistrate, he continued to occupy the O'Reilly House until his death in 1984. Renovations In 1985, the O’Reilly House became vacant and the Placentia Area Historical Society was able to purchase it for a dollar from the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation. For the most part, the house was used as the magistrate's house. Amongst the older houses in Placentia, NL, \\"it is one of the few that have not been 'modernized.'\\" Many of the features of the original house remained intact. However, after successfully obtaining a number of grants to fund the renovations, the PAHS began its work. The renovations were substantial and involved tasks such as removing paint that had been in place for several decades. Some of the elements of the house had to be replaced such as the ceiling in the dining room, as well as the fireplace. Despite these renovations, the goal was to maintain the original design features of the house. The Placentia Area Historical Society received the Southcott Award in 1989 from the Newfoundland Historic Trust in recognition of the preservation of the house. Additional repairs were completed in 1999. This work was focused on the roof, chimneys, siding, and doors. On 24 April of that year, the building was designated a Registered Heritage Structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador. The O’Reilly House was designated a Municipal Heritage Building on 19 August 2006 by the Town of Placentia. Museum Following the renovations, the Placentia Area Historical Society officially opened the house as the O’Reilly House Museum on 1 June 1989. Since this time, the O’Reilly House Museum has become a noted tourist attraction for visitors to the Placentia area in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Palestinians hold most of the same rights as the Syrian population, but cannot become Syrian nationals except in rare cases. History Most Palestinian refugees fled to Syria in 1948 and came from northern Palestine districts, Safad, Haifa, Java, Acre, Tiberias, and Nazareth. Some refugees arrived in Syria via Lebanon, some came from Galilee and the Hula Valley onto the Golan Heights, and others came directly from Palestine to Jordan to Syria. By the summer of 1948, there were about 70,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria, the majority concentrated along the border area with Israel. The refugees were initially housed in deserted military barracks in As-Suwayda, Aleppo, Homs, and Hama. In 1949, Law no. 450 established the Palestine Arab Refugee Institution (PARI), which later was replaced by the General Authority for Palestine Arab Refugees (GAPAR), to manage the Palestinian refugee affairs. GAPAR’s responsibilities were refugee registration, relief assistance, finding employment opportunities for the refugees, and managing funds and contributions intended for them. GAPAR, with UNRWA, jointly administer the camps. Around 526,000 Palestine refugees are registered with UNRWA. There are nine official and three unofficial camps for refugees.In 1967, Palestinian refugees fled the Quneitra Governorate in the Golan Heights, and around 4,200 of them were housed in Daraa Emergency Camp. In 1970, as a result of Black September, some Palestinian refugees fled from Jordan to Syria. In 1982, in the wake of 1982 Lebanon War, a few thousand Palestinian refugees left Lebanon and found shelter in Syria. The initial influx of Palestinians was substantial (90,000–100,000), and the government, through a series of laws, gradually paved the way for their integration into the Syrian socioeconomic structure while preserving their separate Palestinian identity.Palestinians in Syria: The Politics of Integration Laurie Brand, p. 621-637 =Current trends= Due to the civil war in Syria that commenced in 2011, many Palestinians in Syria have been displaced, either within Syria, itself or they have fled the country. Their propensity to fleeing includes having been under siege in refugee camps, while many have opted to make the dangerous journey to Europe as conditions remain hostile to Palestinians in neighboring Middle Eastern states. According to UNRWA, more than half a million Palestinians resided in refugee camps in Syria before the war started. As of 2019, it is estimated that at least 120,000 Palestinians have been displaced from Syria since 2011. According to the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, Palestinians who lived in refugee camps in Syria have faced additional obstacles, since they have been made \\"refugees for the second time\\". The Geneva-based organization reported that more than 160,000 Palestinian Syrian refugees had left their camps in Syria, migrating to neighboring or countries of the European Union. These include nearly 80,000 refugees who fled to Europe, 57,276 others who fled to neighboring countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, and another 7,000 Palestinian Syrian refugees who fled to Egypt and the Gaza Strip. 3,642 Palestinians died during the first seven years of war, 1,651 Palestinians had been detained and more than 300 Palestinians were unaccounted for. Residents of Palestinian camps are suffering from air raids, shelling, siege, and malnutrition, in particular in Yarmouk Camp in the Damascus area, besieged by the government until 2018, leading to the displacement of over 100,000 and many deaths from starvation. By 2019, 3,987 Palestinians, including 467 women and 200 children, had been killed in the conflict. According to the spokesperson of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency or UNRWA, Chris Gunness, \\"Palestinians are among those worst affected by the Syrian conflict.\\" He explained that 95 percent of the 438,000 Palestinians are in \\"critical need of sustained humanitarian assistance. The UNRWA is an agency that works for Palestine refugee and is mostly funded by voluntary contributions. They also receive their funding from the Regular budget of the United Nations. UNRWA was established by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 302 IV of 8 December 1949 to carry out relief programs for Palestinian Refugees. Gunness also states \\"The war in Syria has devastated lives with incalculable cruelty. In this situation, many of the services UNRWA provides are often literally life-saving.\\" Gunness is referring to the clinics, emergency assistance and teaching staff that UNRWA provides. Any pullback in funding has an effect on care for this population. The UNRWA educates 45,000 students a day, without funding this agency would no longer be able to assist students. 54 percent of UNRWA funds go to education, 17 percent goes to health, 16 percent goes to support services, 9 percent goes to relief and social services and 4 percent goes to infrastructure and camp improvement. The Trump administration announced that the United States will indefinitely withhold 65 million dollars of its planned 125 million contributions to the UNRWA. The president of the United States, Donald J. Trump pulled back funding for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. On 2 January 2018, he wrote \\"It’s not just Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue…\\" Rights Children born in Syria to fathers who are Palestinian nationals, even if they themselves were born in Syria, are considered Palestinian not Syrian nationals. \\"Only in very limited circumstances, such as the absence or statelessness of a father, could the mother grant her child Syrian citizenship.\\" Palestinians in Syria have the right to own more than one business or commercial enterprise as well as the right to lease properties. These rights extend to trade and commerce. Union membership in Syria is also open to Palestinians. Palestinians are free to travel throughout Syria and have the right to establish residence in Syrian villages and cities. There is, however, a prominent gap in the home and land ownership laws. Unlike Syrian nationals, Palestinians may not own more than one home or purchase arable land. The 1965 Casablanca protocol regarded the treatment of Palestinians living in the Arab States, it consisted of the following regulations (1) Whilst retaining their Palestinian nationality, Palestinians currently residing in the land of ...... have the right of employment on par with its citizens. (2) Palestinians residing at the moment in ...... in accordance with the dictates of their interests have the right to leave and return to this state. (3) Palestinians residing in other Arab states have the right to enter the land of ...... and to depart from it, in accordance with their interests. Their right of entry only gives them the right to stay for the permitted period and for the purpose they entered for, so long as the authorities do not agree to the contrary. (4) Palestinians who are at the moment in ......, as well as those who were residing and left to the Diaspora, are given, upon request, valid travel documents. The concerned authorities must, wherever they be, issue these documents or renew them without delay. (5) Bearers of these travel documents residing in LAS states receive the same treatment as all other LAS state citizens, regarding visa, and residency applications. Salim Salamah is the director of the Palestinian League of Human Rights – Syria argues that \\"Palestinian refugees in Syria and those who have been doubly displaced to neighboring countries will suffer as a result of the decision. The impact is going to be really massive and tragic, for Palestinians of Syria, its life-saving aid, especially in the context that many Palestinians lack access to many basic services, even [ those who fled] in Lebanon or Jordan. It falls within the long-standing tradition of eroding the existence of Palestinians... and it is tragic\\". Demographics According to GAPAR data, 85,000 Palestinian refugees settled in Syria by the end of 1948. In 1960 the number became 126,662 and in 1989, the refugee population rose to 296,508. By the end of 1998, the number of refugees was 366,493. In 2011 the UNRWA reported having 526,744 registered refugees. Due to harsh conditions the number of registered refugees has dropped to about 450,000 due to many Palestinians fleeing to Lebanon, Jordan or elsewhere in the region. In 2011 many Syrian Palestinians escaped the war and went to Europe as refugees, especially in Germany and Sweden.

Participants are invited to knit, crochet or otherwise create small yellow ducks and then leave them in public places to be found by strangers. Each duck has a tag introducing the project, often naming the duck, and encouraging the finder to log on to the project website. There they can record the finding of the duck and learn more about the need for organ, stem cell and blood donors and how to become one. The project was started by British woman Emma Harris in memory of her friend Clare Cruickshank, who died from cystic fibrosis aged 26 on 15 April 2013 while waiting for a double lung transplant. Cruickshank had collected rubber ducks during her life, and this inspired the project.

Background Snee's son, Mr Savage, purchased a travel agency. In order to be a travel agent, it needed to pay a bond of $50,000 to the Travel Agents Association. To satisfy this requirement, they arranged for Contractors Bonding to issue the bond, but they required suitable security before this bond was given. To satisfy this requirement, Savage approached his mother, convincing her to guarantee this bond, supported by a mortgage over her house. She gave this guarantee, despite the fact her lawyer had advised her not once, but twice, to not give the guarantee. Savage received her guarantee documents from his lawyers, and took them to his mother to sign. Two years later, after customer funds disappeared, resulting in Contractors Bonding seeking reimbursement of the bond from Mrs Snee, and started mortgagee proceedings against her house, although she managed to obtain an injunction from the High Court to stop this, pleading duress, undue influence, and unconscionable bargain, as amongst other things, it was held that she suffered a significant mental impairment due to her alcoholism. Contractors Bonding appealed. Held The Court ruled that whilst Savage exercised undue influence over his mother, however as Savage was not acting as the agent of Contractors Bonding, no undue influence could be imputed against them. Accordingly, the guarantee and the mortgage were both ruled to be legally enforceable against Mrs Snee.

One day, the director of the company, Mr Allan Hebdon visited his firms accountancy firm, asking him to witness a loan agreement between the company and the Development Finance Corporation. Pevats applied the company seal and signed as a witness of the seal. At this stage, Pevats informed Hebdon, that he was signing merely as a witness, and in no way was he agreeing to give a personal guarantee for the loan. Pevat also signed in the shareholder section.

September 2020. Chinatown Point is a shopping mall located in Chinatown, Singapore next to Chinatown MRT station at the junction of New Bridge Road and Upper Cross Street. It is a mixed development which includes a 25-storey office tower located right above the mall. Constructed in the 1980s, the mall opened in 1990. From 2011 to 2012, the mall underwent renovations after a change in the management. It held its soft core launch in year-end 2012 and was fully operational in the 2nd quarter of 2013. History When it first opened, the mall was at the forefront of shopping in Singapore. There were countless curio shops, pawn shops and jewelry stores. Like many old malls in Singapore, the shopping centre declined in popularity when newer malls opened within the region. In July 2010, the mall was bought over from City Developments Limited by Perennial (Singapore) Retail Management for S$250 million. The mall then underwent a S$90 million makeover from 2011 to 2012 which increased its total retail floor area by 18 percent. Architecture Originally, the mall featured 2 spiralling podiums. One of the podiums was converted into a flat space and it now features a spiralling central atrium, where shoppers can walk from the highest level of the shopping mall to the first level. Other renovation works included the installation of a dome-shaped ceiling in the central atrium, carpeting on some levels and a giant LED screen. The basement carpark has also been relocated to higher levels for more retail space. A pedestrian link to the Chinatown MRT station was also built. Tenants After the renovation works, a new tenant mix was also brought in including new anchor tenants, NTUC FairPrice, Daiso and Uniqlo. Other new tenants include an Eat At Taipei outlet, Din Tai Fung restaurant and also more apparel and other retail outlets. A new 1,000 square metre library managed by National Library Board located on the fourth floor was also built. The library which focuses on Chinese culture and history is privately funded and is also Singapore's first public library to be staffed almost completely by volunteers.

Opened in 1979, Thomson Plaza is best known for having a Yaohan departmental store in the 1980s and 1990s. Design Thomson Plaza is built over of land and is relatively low-rise, in keeping with the neighbourhood around the Thomson area. Thomson Plaza is one of the first public buildings to be designed with barrier-free features from the onset. In addition to the standard escalators, ramps were incorporated into the shopping complex's design to allow people in wheelchairs to freely navigate between different floors of the complex. Other handicapped-friendly features in the complex include enlarged toilet cubicles that cater to wheelchair users and door levers, which enable people with difficulty controlling their hands to easily open doors around the complex. History The proposal to build a residential and recreational complex along Upper Thomson Road was first approved by the Ministry of National Development in 1977 as part of its policy of decentralizing commercial activities away from Singapore's Central Business District. The contract to build this complex was awarded to Japanese construction company Ohbayashi Gumi by Development Bank of Singapore, the appointed land developer for Thomson Plaza. Initially estimated to cost SGD$22.3 million, this project was completed eventually at a cost of $38 million in 1979. Even before its completion, Thomson Plaza attracted strong interest from retailers. 80% of its retail outlets were leased out within 6 months of their launch. Thomson Plaza later attracted the attention of Japanese retailer Yaohan, the pioneer of one-stop departmental stores in Singapore. At that time, Yaohan was famous for its innovative approach to customer service; its first departmental store in Plaza Singapura reportedly attracted 955,000 shoppers a week. Yaohan's store in Thomson Plaza became its third outlet in Singapore. In 1997, the parent company of Yaohan stores in Singapore was declared insolvent due to its over-expansion and rising retail rental costs in Singapore. Thus, Yaohan closed its Thomson Plaza outlet, its last in Singapore, in 1998. Yaohan's former retail space was taken over by NTUC Fairprice supermarket chain.

Low temperatures have very marked effects upon the magnetic properties of various substances. Some examples are given in this article. Oxygen Oxygen, long known to be slightly magnetic in the gaseous state, is powerfully attracted in the liquid condition by a magnet, and the same is true, though to a less extent, of liquid air, owing to the proportion of liquid oxygen it contains. Carbon steel A magnet of ordinary carbon steel has its magnetic moment temporarily increased by cooling, that is, after it has been brought to a permanent magnetic condition ( aged ). The effect of the first immersion of such a magnet in liquid air is a large diminution in its magnetic moment, which decreases still further when it is allowed to warm up to ordinary temperatures. A second cooling, however, increases the magnetic moment, which is again decreased by warming, and after a few repetitions of this cycle of cooling and heating the steel is brought into a condition such that its magnetic moment at the temperature of liquid air is greater by a constant percentage than it is at the ordinary temperature of the air. The increase of magnetic moment seems then to have reached a limit, because on further cooling to the temperature of liquid hydrogen hardly any further increase is observed. The percentage differs with the composition of the steel and with its physical condition. It is greater, for example, with a specimen tempered very soft than it is with another specimen of the same steel tempered glass hard. Alloy steels Aluminium steels show the same kind of phenomena as carbon ones, and the same may be said of chrome steels in the permanent condition, though the effect of the first cooling with them is a slight increase of magnetic moment. Nickel steels present some curious phenomena. When containing small percentages of nickel (e.g. 084 or 3-82), they behave under changes of temperature much like carbon steel. With a sample containing 7.65%, the phenomena after the permanent state had been reached were similar, but the first cooling produced a slight increase in magnetic moment. But steels containing 18-64 and 29% of nickel behaved very differently. The result of the first cooling was a reduction of the magnetic moment, to the extent of nearly 50% in the case of the former. Warming again brought about an increase, and the final condition was that at the barometric pressure of liquid air the magnetic moment was always less than at ordinary temperatures. This anomaly is all the more remarkable in that the behaviour of pure nickel is normal, as also appears to be generally the case with soft and hard iron. Silicon, tungsten and manganese steels are also substantially normal in their behaviour, although there are considerable differences in the magnitudes of the variations they display. Iron Low temperatures also affect the permeability of iron, i.e. the degree of magnetization it is capable of acquiring under the influence of a certain magnetic force. With fine Swedish iron, carefully annealed, the permeability is slightly. Hard iron, however, in the same circumstances suffers a large increase of permeability.

Overview In 2013, foreign buyers made up about 7% ($92.2 billion) of transactions in the $1.2 trillion U.S. real estate market. Canada was the main buyer with 19% of sales (decrease from 23% the year before), China was on the second place with 16% of sales, while on the first place considering total foreign sales by dollar value (24% or $22 billion). Mexico ranked third with 9% of sales and India and the UK both accounted for 5%. Florida is the most popular destination with 31% of sales, followed by California (12%), Texas (9%) and Arizona (6%). Almost 80% of foreign-born U.S. residents owned a home in 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. The national homeownership rate at that time was 65.4%. Taxation Foreign non-resident real estate owners have two taxation options. One of them is to have the property taxed as Effectively Connected Income (ECI) of a U.S. trade or business. Income from real estate that is \\"effectively connected\\" with a U.S. trade or business is taxed to the owner of the real estate at the same rates that apply to U.S. individuals and corporations. In addition, the owner can claim deductions that arise from the operation of the property. A second option is to have the property treated as an investment property and subject to a flat 30% tax. Most income received by foreign persons from U.S. investments, including rent, is taxed at a flat 30%, and the foreign person is permitted no deductions related to the operations of the property. That means that if there is a mortgage on the property, the interest payments are not deductible. However, many countries have entered into income tax treaties with the U.S. reducing the 30% rate to a lesser amount. Estate tax All U.S. real estate (and other assets) owned by non-resident aliens (and others) is subject to an estate tax upon the owner's death. However, U.S. citizens and residents are permitted a partial exclusion from estate taxes; non-resident aliens are also allowed a smaller exclusion (prior planning may change the exclusion level to that of a citizen/resident). Purchase structure There are various variables to consider when deciding the structure of a real estate purchase in the U.S., like: *Is the real estate income-producing or is it a personal residence? *Is the real estate part of a U.S. trade or business? *If the real estate is a residence, does the owner contemplate selling it? *If the owner is a foreign individual, is the owner a U.S. resident for U.S. estate tax purposes? *Does the foreign owner seek to keep the identity of the owner confidential? *Does the owner seek “asset protection” i.e. to shield the property from the claims of creditors?

Bonli married Elsa Pederson (born 6 September 1930), daughter of Danish parents who immigrated to Saskatchewan in 1927. She was a registered nurse who worked at Melfort Hospital before their marriage. They had two children, Scott and Jane. Later they divorced and Elsa remarried. Bonli studied with Illingworth Kerr and Luke Lindoe at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Arts in Calgary, Alberta. He then went to the Art Center School in Los Angeles and the University of Southern California, studying water colors and fabric design. While in Los Angeles he had a part-time job with the Bullochs Department Store in their design studio, where he gained practical experience in interior design. Career =Saskatoon= Bonli returned to Saskatoon and worked at Clark's Interior Furnishings for four years while giving evening classes in art. Bonli participated in the first Emma Lake Artist's Workshop in 1955, and in subsequent workshops in 1956, 1957, 1962, 1963 and 1965. At these workshops he studied with Jack Shadbolt, Joseph Plaskett, Will Barnet, Clement Greenberg, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, and Lawrence Alloway. In 1957 he taught the young Joan Anderson at Saskatoon Technical Collegiate. She would later be better known as the singer Joni Mitchell. Then aged thirteen, she had planned to take lessons from the well-known landscape and figurative Ernest Lindner, but he was on sabbatical that year. Bonli found her an argumentative pupil. In 1957 Bonli founded Bonli Interiors in Saskatoon. It first occupied James Art Studio and then moved to premises on the lower floor of the King George Hotel that had been vacated by the Mendel Art Gallery. The firm provided interior design services and the store sold gifts and bath accessories, imported Scandinavian furniture and window coverings. Bonli soon began to also undertake residential and commercial work in Regina, where he had a full-time representative. In 1958 Bonli appeared on a weekly CTV television show with Margaret Dallin, and then on a show with Sally Merchant called Here Comes Sally. He also took summer courses at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. In New York Henry and his wife Elsa became friends of the critic Clement Greenberg. Bonli was an admirer of New York abstract expressionists such as Barnett Newman. He was encouraged by the art collector Fred Mendel to exhibit his work. He participated in shows at the Mendel Art Centre and the Dunlop Gallery in Regina. Bonli was a member of the Saskatchewan Arts Board and the Saskatchewan Society of Artists. He was vice- president of the Saskatoon Art Centre. He was an art consultant for the Saskatoon School System for three years, and was Assistant Curator at the Coste House art center in Calgary. He held a one-man show at the Mendel Art Gallery in 1965. =Toronto= Bonli moved with his family to Toronto in 1965 where they opened Bonli Gallery, selling art and furniture. Later he opened two more stores, both called \\"Henri The Second\\", which sold factory over-runs and designer furnishings. In 1966–67 Joni Mitchell would often stay rent-free at Bonli's Toronto studio over Rugantino's restaurant on Yonge Street, with her husband Chuck Mitchell, and at times was babysitter for the Bonlis' daughter Jane. The Bonlis considered that Chuck was the better singer of the two, and would be the one to succeed. By this time Bonli had become a reasonably well-known painter. Bonli continued to return to Saskatoon to execute interior design commissions. In 1974 he sold his interior design company and devoted himself to painting. Henry Thomas Bonli died at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, on 16 May 2011. He was aged 83. Exhibitions and collections Bonli's works in acrylic and watercolor began to be exhibited in galleries across Canada in the early 1950s. He held a number of solo exhibitions in Regina, Saskatoon, and Toronto. Bonli's work is held by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Saskatchewan Arts Board, University of Saskatchewan, Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon, MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.

Allen Graffham, a geologist and curator of the park's Tucker Tower museum, was interested in a more scientific study of the object. He contacted Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico about the specimen. LaPaz confirmed that it was a meteorite. He assessed that it was composed primarily of nickel and iron, and estimated that it may have weighed when it struck, about 90 to 110 million years ago, but that oxidation had since worn away of the surface. LaPaz, then the director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University, carefully cut the specimen into two pieces. He performed additional tests and classed the specimen as octahedrite. He wrote that it could also be an example of a hexaoctahedrite (a transition between hexahedrite and octahedrite).

It is an apocalyptic autobiographical anti-war novel. It mines the author's own experiences and is considered an important example of the literary realism genre of postwar novel. The book was originally published in late 1956, by the long established Frankfurt publishing house S. Fischer Verlag. It deals with 70 minutes of a mid-night bomb attack by the United States Army Air Forces against an unnamed German city towards the end of World War Two, during which a large number of civilians and military personnel are killed. The events are described from both the American and German perspectives with great directness, and without shielding the reader from the horrific details. Ledig's first novel ' (\\"The Stalin Organ\\"), which dealt with the battles of the Russian Front in the Leningrad region in the Soviet Union, had been an international success. By contrast, Vergeltung was widely rejected by readers when it appeared in 1956. The book was quickly forgotten and there were no plans for a reprint. That changed in the late 1990s, shortly before the author's death, when the book encountered much more widespread acceptance, led by scholar-critics including Max Sebald, Marcel Reich-Ranicki\\"Interview mit Marcel Reich-Ranicki: 'Die Literatur ist dazu da, das Leiden der Menschen zu zeigen, Der Spiegel, 24 July 2003 and Volker Hage.\\"Deutschland im Feuersturm: Berichte aus einem Totenhaus\\", Der Spiegel, 1 April 2003 Vergeltung now acquired a correspondingly wider readership, with several new editions published by Suhrkamp Verlag starting in 1999. Translations followed into Dutch (entitled Vergelding, meaning \\"Retribution\\") in 2001; English (as Payback) and French (as Sous les bombes - \\"Under the Bombs\\") in 2003; Spanish (as Represalia - \\"Reprisal\\") in 2006; and Croatian (as Odmazda - \\"Reprisal\\") in 2008. At the same time a new interest in Ledig's literary output emerged among critics and readers, which would outlive the author himself. In effect, shortly before he died Ledig found himself “rediscovered” by the literary establishment.  The storylines  Vergeltung deals with the fates of the inhabitants and defenders of an unnamed German city and of an American bomber crew that has approached the city in a formation of bombers. In total twelve storylines can be identified, all connected with the air attack, and all given more or less equal weight, even though they differ greatly in terms of their more detailed narratives. Eight of the twelve storylines focus on a single character or group of characters. For instance, during the attack the bomber is shot down by a German fighter-plane and the crew are forced to evacuate. The American pilot, named \\"Sergeant Jonathan Strenehen\\", having survived a crash landing, falls into the hands of some Germans and is gruesomely abused physically, contrary to the provisions of to the Geneva Convention which guarantee the \\"bodily integrity\\" of prisoners of war. This occurs despite Strenehen having taken care to crash land his bomber on a public cemetery in order to spare the civilian population - something of which his German captors are unaware. Later two German civilians do come to help Strenehen, but in the end he nevertheless dies as a consequence of brutal treatment received from German civilians whose sadistic actions can be traced back to their awful experience of the aerial bombings. Other storylines concerns the fate of the suicidal Cheovski couple, a rescue squad, a group of forced laborers from Eastern Europe, a war- shattered lieutenant from a \\"Flak squadron\\", a group of drunken soldiers and a man looking for his family driven almost mad by his predicament. Another of the threads presents a young woman driven to an air-raid shelter by the bombs and later raped by an old German man, reacting under the exceptional circumstances, and who himself later commits suicide. Four other storylines each focus on just one scene or circumstance. These concern an air defense position, a coordination command post, a huge concrete bunker along the lines of those that existed only in the largest cities such as Berlin and Vienna, and a transformer station for the municipal power supply. With the exception of Sgt. Jonathan Strenehen, who is the mostly fully formed of the protagonists and whose fate is spelled out, it is generally left for the reader to decide which, if any, of the participants in the various storylines survive the bombing raid.  Structural aspects  The novel is divided into thirteen chapters which are sandwiched between a prologue and an epilogue that includes precise information on the time of day covered. The length of time taken by the events recounted exceeds by a good hour the 70 minutes actually covered. From this it is to be inferred that the episodes presented take place simultaneously. All the chapters are composed of short or very short fragments of text. These present snapshots of the respective plot lines and are arranged in a way that provides the reader with an initially confusing experience. Thus the novel's structure reflects and communicates the disorientating impact of a bomb attack on the characters on the novel. Each chapter starts with an italicized autobiographical interlude, reporting in the first person on the fate of one of the characters, using the formats of letters, personal résumés and monologues. However, this novel provides no continuous action driven narrative, but comprises a succession of short episodes that pick-up on earlier plot-lines and progress them briefly before moving on. What takes place is therefore a constant staccato of rapidly changing locations, narratives and players. In this way the structure resembles that of some movies. There is little use of protagonists in the traditional sense, to define and progress the storylines. The book is driven, rather, by events around which the central conflicts revolve. Many of the characters are identified only by a military rank or by their profession, and this feeds the impression of a collectivized experience. To some extent narrative context is provided by the brief quasi-autobiographical sketches appearing in italic font at the start of each chapter, but these are nonetheless incomplete and fragmentary. Apart from those short biographical sections, the narrative developments are presented directly from the author. The all-knowing narrator, who does not himself participate in the action, communicates the thoughts and feelings of the various participants, but he does this by concentrating on external manifestations, and avoids comments or value judgements, leaving it for the reader to form any required assessments of characters' inner motivations and reactions. Through this overwhelmingly neutral narrative stance, which comes close to resembling a documentary approach, the novel becomes authentic and powerfully plausible. At the same time the sparsity of commentary summons up a bleak underlying nihilism. Exceptionally, right at the end, the writer breaches his neutral narrative stance for a moment. The narrator uses the authority which his objectivity has established through the novel to communicate that the allied bombing of German cities in the Second World War had become unavoidable, but in the same breath he denies the allied forces any general right to act as they did, while a Christian concept teaches that issues of moral authority regarding such matters must be reserved for the Last Judgment.  Style  The language in Ledig's second novel comes across as highly laconic and staccato. The rapid narrative pace is reminiscent of the postwar TrümmerliteraturTrümmerliteratur = literally \\"rubble literature\\" employed by Günter Eich in the lyric piece . Much the same can be said of Gert Ledig's use of parataxis, declamatory statements, ellipsis and the relatively low level of visual imagery. Value related adjectives and adverbs are applied sparingly, in order to reinforce the impression of realism and the impact of facts. The novel's occasional use of symbolism mostly has a religious dimension, in the context of the theodicy problem or in reference to the Passion narrative. The symbol of the cross has a particular significance here, both as a Leitmotif in Christianity, and in terms of the military connotations, in Germany, of the Iron Cross.  Critical and public reception  In the 1950s, the critical reaction in West Germany to Vergeltung was sharply negative. There were one or two more positive reactions from a handful of reviewers in the East German papers, as well as in one or two lower tier West German publications. At that time the dominant opinion formers in the world of German-language literature were writing for the leading newspapers, and these condemned the novel unanimously. As an example, Peter Hornung in Die Zeit criticised Ledig's prose style as \\"over-simplified to the point of desolation\\"„auf ein wahres Existenzminimum vereinfacht und verödet“Peter Hornung: Zuviel des Grauens (\\"Too much gruesomeness\\"). In: Die Zeit, 15. November 1956. Writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Wolfgang Schwerbrock found the novel \\"excessively emotional and declamatory\\"„zu pathetisch und zu deklamatorisch“Wolfgang Schwerbrock: Im Stil von Malaparte. In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 22. September 1956. Commentators were in particular affronted by the novel's numerous depictions of violence and death. In the Rheinischer Merkur E. R. Dallontano found Ledig's depiction of rape, and the shattering of a taboo that this represented, \\"distasteful and obnoxious\\" (\\"widerwärtig\\") and a \\"mainspring of the author's gruseomeness\\" (\\"Triebfeder seiner Gruselei“).E.R. Dallontano: Gruselkabinett mit Bomben (\\"Horror chamber with bombs\\") In: Rheinischer Merkur, 7. Dezember 1956. Writing in the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, Rolf Becker's reaction was similarly hyperbolic: he complained that the novel would provide the reader with nothing but a \\"rapid succession of various horrors bathed in the deathly stench of naked sensation\\"„gehäufte Variationen des Grausigen... [und atme] ...den fatalen Geruch der nackten Sensation“Rolf Becker: Ein Roman des Bombenkriegs(\\"A novel of the Bombing War\\"). In: Kölner Stadtanzeiger,13. Oktober 1956. Assertions of this nature left the critics' many readers to conclude that Gert Ledig had produced not a work of serious literary merit, but an old fashioned \\"Penny dreadful\\". The idea that the novel was a serious attempt at a literary reassessment of the Second World War gained hardly any traction. The novel was underpinned by an ugly and unvarnished presentation of total war, acknowledging no diminution of the industrial-scale brutality of modern war on the so-called home front. This presentation coincided with a sustained push by the West German political establishment towards national rehabilitation, involving rearmament and the country's recent (in 1955) admission to NATO. The implications of Ledig's work regarding the contentious issues surrounding West German rearmament and militarism more generally were not particularly welcome to the instinctively rather conservative class of literary critics then dominating the \\"national\\" press. In 2003, nearly fifty years later, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, himself widely seen as the doyen of a younger generation of literary critics, provided his own assessment of the media rejection that had greeted Vergeltung back in 1956: > At that time no one was interested in the war, in the war as a subject for a > novel or a drama. That was Ledig's misfortune. And it was too bad, because > one of the properties of his two important novels [Vergeltung and Die > Stalinorgel] is the way that they do not spare the reader.\\"„Es war damals > niemand am Krieg interessiert, am Krieg als Thema von Romanen oder von > Theaterstücken. Daher der Misserfolg von Ledig. Das war zu hart, denn eine > der Eigentümlichkeiten dieser beiden wichtigen Bücher von Ledig [Vergeltung > und Stalinorgel] ist, dass er den Leser überhaupt nicht geschont hat.Die > Literatur ist dazu da, das Leiden der Menschen zu zeigen (\\"It is to show the > suffering of the people that the literature is there\\"). Interview with > Marcel Reich-Ranicki, by Volker Hage. In: Der Spiegel, 24. Juli 2003. The book was republished in the Autumn/Fall of 1999 at the instigation of the influential literary critic/journalist Volker Hage. This followed a fundamental re-evaluation of post-war literature more generally that had become mainstream in the German speaking world, following a lecture given by Max Sebald in Zürich in 1997. By 1999 many attitudes had been completely reversed since the original publication of Vergeltung, which now met with a much more positive critical reception.

In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 19. Januar 2000. On 29 October 1999 Vergeltung was featured on the influential television programme . The programme had an audience of several million viewers in the German speaking world at the time, and Ledig's book was featured alongside the German language version of the bestseller Atomised (Elementarteilchen/Les Particules Élémentaires) by Michel Houellebecq, which must have contributed substantially to the subsequent popularity of Vergeltung.

The Atherley Narrows Swing Bridge is a Canadian National rail bridge located at the confluence of Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching at the Atherley Narrows, near Orillia, Ontario. The current bridge was constructed in 1970 as a plate girder bridge, consisting of nine steel through plate girder sections supported on eight steel pile bents. The western end of the east approach for the steel through plate girder structure is supported by a concrete pier on wooden piles built in 1919. The end of the eastern pier is made of concrete. Between 1843 and 1964, three railway bridges were constructed at the site and a navigation channel was dredged, all of which disturbed the Mnjikaning Fish Weirs. The swing bridge was deemed unsafe in a 2010 inspection by the railway. Reports to local police and the railway in 2011 declared that the wooden timber cribbing at the base of the swing bridge was decaying and shedding material into the water below. As of 2013, the swing bridge is currently under review for use with the local trail system, as a link for pedestrian trails and snowmobile trails on both sided of the Narrows. The swing bridge is currently locked in the \\"open\\" position since the Canadian National Railway abandoned the line into Orillia and lifted the rails.

It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by Cambridge University Press, one of the conditions for the prize. Summary The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded. It examines the relationship between the form of the historical novel on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox historical method) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself. Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as Napoleon; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a \\"maker of history\\" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past. One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed. The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.

Her work is now preserved in the USDA's Pomological Watercolor Collection, and she has been called the best of the early USDA artists. She rose to lead the USDA staff artists, and she became the most prolific of the group, contributing one-fifth of the 7500 paintings in the Pomological Watercolor Collection. Dayton (strawberry) watercolor by Deborah Griscom Passmore, 1909 Early life and education Deborah Griscom Passmore was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on July 17, 1840, the fifth and last child of Everett Griscom Passmore (1787–1868), a farmer, and Elizabeth K. Knight (c.1800–1845), a teacher and preacher for an orthodox branch of Quakers. The youngest of the family, with two older brothers and two older sisters, Passmore was given the forenames Deborah Griscom after her paternal grandmother, who was a first cousin of Betsy Ross. Her mother died while she was still a child, and Passmore was educated at the nearby boarding school where her mother had taught before her marriage. She went on to train as an artist at the School of Design for Women and the Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Her first cousin Deborah Passmore Gillingham (1820–1877) was also a botanical artist, though an amateur whose work was not published until recently. Passmore followed up her Philadelphia art training with a year studying art in Europe. There, she found inspiration in the botanical illustrations of Marianne North at Kew Gardens, England, and when she returned to the United States, she began painting the wildflowers of America as well as lilies and other flowers. She hoped to publish these watercolors under the title Flowers in Water Color: Wildflowers of America, but she never managed to do so and the manuscript is now in the USDA's Special Collections. Passmore prided herself on delineating her subjects with minute accuracy and sometimes used as many as a hundred washes to get the desired effect. The noted botanist Edward Lee Greene was a great admirer of Passmore's flower paintings. Passmore also painted cacti, and some of her watercolors were printed in a 1919 work entitled The Cactaceae that was published by the Carnegie Institution. USDA career Forelle (European pear) watercolor painted in 1900 by Deborah Griscom Passmore (USDA) Passmore worked in Philadelphia as a teacher for several years before being induced to move to Washington, D.C., by William Wilson Corcoran, founder of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, who was very impressed by her work. Corcoran died before Passmore could gain work through this connection, and instead she took a job in 1892 as an illustrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This was a time when the major fruit-producing regions in the United States were just beginning to emerge, as farmers worked with the USDA to establish orchards for expanding markets. Photography was not yet in widespread use as a documentary medium, so the government relied on artists like Passmore, Amanda Newton, Elsie Lower, Ellen Isham Schutt, and Royal Charles Steadman to produce technically accurate drawings for its publications. Passmore was one of more than 50 botanical illustrators hired in this early period, and she was quickly promoted, being named the leader of the staff of artists in the Division of Pomology the same year she was hired. One of her first tasks for the USDA was to paint exhibits for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago; she also entered some of her own paintings in the Exposition's art exhibition. She would ultimately work for the USDA for nineteen years, and Alan Fusonie, the head of the National Agricultural Library's Special Collections in 1990, considers her \\"the finest example of the quality of the early USDA illustrators\\" and her fruit watercolors in particular a national treasure. In a book on the roots of ecofeminism, Greta Gaard cites Deborah Passmore alongside the nature artists Lucy Say and Grace Albee as helping to \\"create a climate and tradition that can be claimed as foundational for ecofeminism.\\" Passmore's artwork for the USDA covered a wide range of fruit including apples, pears, plums, peaches, oranges, persimmons, strawberries, and gooseberries as well as the less-common loquat, kumquat, and Surinam cherry. She was extremely prolific, producing more than 1500 finished watercolors and drawings for the USDA, more than half of which were created between 1895 and 1902. Many of these can be found in the agency's technical reports and publications. In addition, between 1901 and 1911, a selection of her work was published in the department's yearbook, accompanying an annual report on promising new fruits. Among the cultivars she illustrated for the first of these yearbooks were the McIntosh apple and the Wickson plum. Passmore also taught art privately in Washington, D.C., where she maintained her own studio. She died at home of a heart attack on January 3, 1911. Much of Passmore's work is held in the USDA's Pomological Watercolor Collection within the National Agricultural Library's Special Collections. Several prints of her work are on permanent exhibition in the library's main reading room.

Academic Press, SanDiego, California, 1974 Historic documents now located in area museums, as well as historic societies and local historians, provide an early glimpse of settlement history along the South Carolina coast, beginning in the 16th century. Trading ships from European nations, including Spain, France, England, and the Netherlands, sailed with the trade winds, following routes to Central America where they would trade and return home with enormous riches. Eventually trading vessels found their way to the coasts of Florida and South Carolina. Minor settlements sprang to life. Hunting, farming, and trading with local Indian tribes were primary settlement activities. Many settlements did not survive due to warring between European nations, violent uprisings by Indian tribes, and an inability to cope with the hostile environment. However, with every setback, came new explorations, settlements, and governing European nations.Rowland, Lawrence S. The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina, 1514-1861. University of South Carolina Press, 1998.Walter, Edgar. South Carolina: A History. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1998. Callawassie Island, an 880-acre coastal island, received its earliest English settlers in 1711.Behan, William A., A Short History of Callawassie Island, South Carolina. The Lives & Times of Its Owners & Residents 1711-1985, iUniverse, Inc. 2004 p.1. Over the next 120 years, ownership of Callawassie Island changed hands mostly through inheritance among well-to-do English families named Cochran, Heyward, Rhodes, and Hamilton. All figured prominently in early America either as land barons, governing authorities, and/or military leaders. Callawassie Island's acreage, fertile for planting, was largely dedicated to farming and livestock during this period, making way for successive cash crop industries in indigo and sea island cotton, which were in high demand by European trading nations. A small crop of sugar cane was attempted but failed due to climate conditions. The island's population was sparse, consisting of owner families and slaves who worked the farms. = Antebellum and Civil War years = South Carolina Sovereignty/Secession Flag with the palmetto and the crescent. During the Antebellum years leading up to the Civil War, the island's owners, the Kirk family, continued to prosper because of cotton even as they became active in southern rebellion causes that led to Secession from the Union.The Civil War in South Carolina: Selections from The South Carolina Historical Magazine. edited by Lawrence S.

However, an elaborate scheme to take over ownership by William Wallace Burns, a prominent Union general, enabled him to maintain ownership for the next fifty years. Burns was motivated, along with other northern interests, by a vision of this area of the Lowcountry becoming \\"The Port Royal Railroad/Seaport\\" development complex, a vision that was put to rest only fifty years later by competing interests in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. General Burns was an absentee landlord assigning multiple leasing rights for the island's acreage to local area farmers over the next fifty years. Farmers by the names of Hodge, Vaigneur, Johnson, and Pinckney raised families, maintained livestock, and grew a variety of subsistence crops and cotton as a cash crop. Life on the island was simple, but far from easy, often resulting in death at an early age caused by: polluted waters, epidemics of infectious diseases, and occasional natural disasters including storms, drought, and earthquakes.United States Census; Agriculture, Industry, Social Statistics and Mortality Schedules for South Carolina 1850-1880; Helen Craig Carson and R.

The Great Sea Island Storm of 1893. Macon: Mercer University Press 2004 Although there was no loss of life on the island, the Lowcountry area was less fortunate, with the storm claiming in excess of 2,000 lives as its waters covered nearly 80% of Beaufort County.Gibson, Christine, \\"Our 10 Greatest Natural Disasters\\" American Heritage Aug./Sept. 2006, Vol.57 Issue 4. After the Great Storm, Callawassie Island farmer Willie Pinckney secured loans to rebuild farms, maintain livestock, and grow crops. Willie became an area personality with leadership skills that were instrumental in reducing area disease through the construction of artesian wells that produced clear, unpolluted water, free of disease. Willie, then known as the \\"Sage of Okatie,\\" continued to lease acreage and prosper from the island until 1917. = 20th century = In 1917, the boll weevil struck South Carolina devastating cotton crops, and \\"King Cotton\\" was declared dead forever.Behan, William A., A Short History of Callawassie Island, South Carolina. The Lives & Times of Its Owners & Residents 1711-1985, iUniverse 2004, p.134. A modern era of invention throughout the United States left behind the old Southern ways of life on Callawassie Island. During 1917, wealthy New Jersey businessman Benedict Kuser purchased the island, announcing plans to develop Callawassie Island through modern truck farming. World War I intervened, and development plans turned toward commercial farming with the construction of homes for share cropper families and the construction of Kuser's own private estate. Sharecropper families – Padgett, Bennett, Cooler – lived and worked on Callawassie Island raising families, maintaining livestock, and growing a wide variety of crops while Ben Kuser, a very successful northern wildlife conservationist, brought a multitude of friends to the island for hunting and fishing outings. Lavish entertainment during the 1920s disappeared during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the sharecropper families continued to flourish. Ownership of the island changed twice during 1937, with it ending up in the hands of the Drexel family where it remained until they sold the island to timber interests in 1948. Sharecropper families continued to maintain and farm the island during this period. Between 1948 and 1978, business entities with various profit motives owned Callawassie Island. They did not pursue land development activities and were eventually discouraged from pursuing these due to issues of cost, permitting, and protests of various projects by the local citizenry. One such protest involved a connector road routing that was planned directly across the island to support highway infrastructure for a large petrochemical plant to be built at Victoria Bluff on the Colleton River. The project was defeated by widely voiced protests, which reached the White House, demanding protection for and the preservation of local river and harbor water quality and wildlife. = Modern era = In 1978, a small group of Hilton Head investors purchased but did not develop the land, selling it to a developer when faced with high interest rates and other shelved projects. Between 1981 and 2002 developers continued ownership of Callawassie Island and developed the land as a gated, residential community consisting of 717 home sites, 33 lagoons, and multiple conservation and wildlife areas surrounded by a first class golf course and other amenities. In 2002, the developer sold all existing amenities to the Callawassie Island Members Club.  Callawassie Sugar Works  The Callawassie Sugar Works is a historically significant site containing the tabby (cement) ruins of two structures - the sugar mill base or foundation, and the boiling house - and archaeological evidence of a third structure, most likely the curing shed. The sugar works, constructed circa 1815-1818, was a complex for processing sugar cane into sugar.Brooker, Colin H. \\"Callawassie Island Sugar Works: A Tabby Building Complex.\\" In Michael Trinkley, editor, Further Investigations of Prehistoric Lifeways on Callawassie and Spring Islands, Beaufort County, S. C. Chicora Research Series 23. Chicora Foundation, 1991. Callawassie Sugar Works on Chechessee Creek Archaeological and historical evidence suggests that the Callawassie Sugar Works was part of a larger settlement which included housing for slaves and possibly an overseer's house.Brooker, Colin H. 1991 The settlement was mostly constructed soon after 1816 while the island was owned by James Hamilton, Jr. The architect/builder of the sugar works is unknown. It is conjectured that the sugar mill was built sometime within the next three years, based on plans similar to mill construction seen in the West Indies. Research suggests that James Hamilton, Jr., (1786-1857) was most likely the developer of the Callawassie Sugar Works (circa 1816). He was the son of Major James Hamilton, an aide to General George Washington in the American Revolutionary War, and grandnephew of Thomas Lynch, Jr., a signatory of the Declaration of Independence. He served during the War of 1812. Through marriage, James Hamilton, Jr., was nephew-in-law of South Carolina's largest, and most prosperous rice planter, Nathaniel Heyward, and stepson-in-law of Savannah River investor Nicholas Cruger. These gentlemen shared close familial and professional relationships and entrepreneurial drive to develop and implement new industries such as sugar production. Hamilton had acquired several close and influential West Indian connections who were heavily involved in the Caribbean sugar trade. Hamilton sold the property and moved to Charleston, South Carolina in early 1819, leaving no documentation on the mill and its anticipated use. Apparently, the sugar works were still operational when it was abandoned, as ashes were left uncleared from the furnace.Tinkler, Robert. James Hamilton of South Carolina. Southern Biography Series. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004.Busick, Sean R. \\"James Hamilton, Jr.\\" In Walter B. Edgar, ed., The South Carolina Encyclopedia.. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2006. The Callawassie Sugar Works' construction appears to be based on observations made by Thomas Spalding.Spalding, Thomas. Observations on the Method of Planting and Cultivating the Sugar-Cane in Georgia and South Carolina, published by Agricultural Society of South Carolina (Charleston) in 1816. It incorporated three principal components: a mill, boiling house, and curing shed. The footprint of the buildings suggests that the boiling house and curing shed were aligned in a \\"T\\" configuration (little remains of the curing shed). The remaining structures include exterior walls of the one-story buildings with the brick boiling train still evident in the mill. Primitive mills of this kind usually had a set of four kettles arranged in a line, the tops of the kettles being raised from the floor. Today, only the foundation of the mill and parts of the boiling house remain. There is no evidence, above or below ground, that the tabby mill base was ever enclosed within a permanent structure, even though the base survives in excellent condition. While the boiling pans, and the masonry that supported them, have disappeared, the boiling train bed, constructed of fire brick, is still intact, together with an ash pit and wall vents. The long tabby wall on the north side of the boiling house collapsed outward and retained enough integrity to enable theoretical reconstruction of the original layout of windows. Excavation of glass at the site suggests that the windows were glazed. Only tabby strip foundations remain of the curing shed, which was most likely timber framed. All machinery and mechanical equipment is gone. Despite the degradation of the sugar mill site over time, the remnants are still illustrative of sugar processing before the introduction of steam machinery in the late 1830s. The sugar mill ruins on Callawassie Island are featured as a \\"unique example of industrial tabby\\" and \\"the only one of its kind to exist in South Carolina.\\" Tabby, referred to as \\"poor man's masonry\\", is a building substance created by mixing locally available materials, such as oyster shells, with equal parts, water, sand, and lime. The Spanish brought it to the New World before 1700. Shellfish remains available from aboriginal shell middens provided a plentiful source for tabby construction. Tabby wall construction involved up to six successive pours, each requiring a set of forms or molds. According to the National Park Service, the tabby remaining at the Callawassie Sugar Works: \\"appears to have been well compacted and meticulously cast.\\"National Park Service.

The Callawassie Sugar Works is one of the few remaining structures from this early period of sugar production along the Atlantic Coast. Sugar was one of the few agricultural commodities protected by a tariff, which levied three cents per pound duty on foreign raw sugar in 1816. This inspired wealthy planter entrepreneurs of the Georgia and South Carolina coastal areas to explore the viability of a local sugar industry. Despite Hamilton's entrepreneurial hopes, and Spalding's professional expertise, the growing conditions in the Low country of South Carolina were not ideally suited for the successful cultivation of sugar cane, which prefers a year-round temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit with at least 60 inches of rainfall. The sugar works on Callawassie Island is the only example of such an early enterprise in the South Carolina Low country. It was formally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 2014.\\"National Register Information System\\" National Register of Historic Places. National Park Services  Ecology and wildlife  Wildlife on Heron Walk Lagoon = Island ecology = Callawassie Island's location in a large expanse of salt marsh leaves the island open to the effects of wind and salt spray, giving it maritime-like vegetation.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., The Vascular Flora of Callawassie Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina Department of Biology, University of South Carolina, 1982 p.1 The island is characterized by a diversity of natural communities, which include brackish marsh, maritime forest, maritime shrub thicket, salt flat, salt marsh, salt shrub thicket, and tidal freshwater marsh.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A.,Phinney, Derrick M., Surveyor, Clemson Cooperative Extension, Forestry and Natural Resources Agent, survey August/September 2013 Much of the salt marsh zone around the island is characterized by stands of two kinds of smooth spartina cord grass (tall and short).Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., The Vascular Flora of Callawassie Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina, Department of Biology, University of South Carolina, 1982 p.7 The spartina cord grass provides essential nutrients, making the tidal marshes a breeding ground or nursery for countless species of mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. The salt marsh shrub thicket between the salt marsh and the maritime forests of the island include bayberry, wax myrtle, southern red cedar, and live oak.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., p.8Bagwell, William, Director of Agronomy, Callawassie Island, International Society of Arboriculture Certified Arborist Despite the amount of surrounding salt water, Callawassie Island has thirty-three fresh water, man-made lagoons covering . In addition to providing irrigation water for the golf course, these same lagoons enhance the ecology of the island and the surrounding waters by reducing the rainwater run-off into the marsh and providing a source of food for alligators and fish-eating birds. Callawassie has a long history of human occupation. Indians used the surrounding waters for shell fishing and portions of the adjacent land for cultivation. Approximately 275 years ago, Europeans began to significantly impact the ecology of the island primarily through logging most of the pine trees from the interior of the island and later by farming the land. There are a few relic pines, which are over 150 years old located near the south end of the island.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., p. 1 The island has the following forest communities: inland maritime (live- oak hammock), subtropical magnolia, and three types of hardwood forests. These hardwood forests include lowland mixed hardwood, pine-mixed hardwood, and mixed-oak hardwood.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., The Vascular Flora of Callawassie Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina, Department of Biology, University of South Carolina, 1982 p.9-11 The characteristic maritime-like forest occurring on the perimeter of Callawassie Island is composed of live oak and salt-tolerant species such as loblolly pine and palmetto. Because this plant community is influenced by wind and salt spray, it is considered an inland maritime forest or live oak hammock due to the presence of subtropical plants.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., e-mail Angela Estees (Callawassie Island Ecology Committee Board member) dated November 24, 2013 Many large live oaks are scattered throughout the island, but it is believed that many were harvested for shipbuilding until the advent of ironclads during the Civil War, when wood was replaced by metal.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., p. 2 The most unusual community on Callawassie Island is a subtropical magnolia forest characterized by the dominance of southern magnolia in the over story with white ash as a co-dominant. This is the only existing documented community of its type in South Carolina.There is only one other documented site of this community type in South Carolina located at Victoria Bluff, not far from Callawassie Island, which was destroyed in preparation for an industrial site (S.C. Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, Heritage Trust Programs Records, Columbia, S. C.). This magnolia community appears to be a virgin or near-virgin forest: an area exhibiting this amount of maturity requires several hundreds of years to reach its climax. One possible explanation for its existence is that it is situated on an Indian shell midden. Because this midden is composed of four feet of shell materials, the land was totally unsuitable for cultivation and appears to have been left undisturbed by early settlers as well as recent occupants of the island.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A., The Vascular flora of Callawassie Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina, Department of Biology, University of South Carolina. 1982 pp.11, 17 The lowland mixed hardwood forest occurs in low-lying areas of the island in poorly drained soils.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A. p. 9 A pine-mixed hardwood forest covers more acreage on the island than any other type and is generally the result of intermittent succession from areas used for agriculture or from the cutting of pine. Finally, the oak-mixed hardwood forest, with the exception of the subtropical magnolia forest, is the most advanced succession stage on Callawassie Island.Aulbach-Smith, Cynthia A. p. 10 The natural habitat of the island and the waters that surround it support an abundant wildlife population with some of the most common species including: alligators, songbirds, birds of prey, water fowl, deer, fox, possum, raccoon, mink, otters, reptiles, amphibians and bottle-nosed dolphin. Baby great egrets on Callawassie Island Well established rookeries are found on two of the island's lagoons, where black-crowned night-herons, great egrets, and great blue herons nest and raise their young. Osprey and bald eagles also nest on the island; and although there is not a wood stork rookery on Callawassie Island, significant numbers of this formerly endangered species have made the island their home. Other bird species known to frequent the island include: doves (Zenaidura carolinensis), quail (Colinus virginianus), crows (Corvus sp.), and vultures (Carthes aura). Marshes provide a habitat for marine oriented species including terns, gulls, sandpipers ), loons and ibis. In developing the island, care has been taken to preserve as much of the natural habitat as possible. The Architectural Review Committee (ARC) has strict guidelines for the development and maintenance of landscape plans consistent with the long-term preservation of the island's natural environment. In addition, a land management plan provides guidelines and standards for the maintenance of the island's common properties and open spaces, including the golf course. The Ecology Committee provides advice to the Callawassie Island Property Owners Association (CIPOA) Board regarding issues affecting the island's ecosystems and engages residents in environmental support activities significant to Callawassie Island. = Wildlife Habitat certification = In February 2006, Callawassie Island became the first community in South Carolina, and the fifteenth community in the United States, to achieve National Wildlife Federation (NWF) Community Wildlife Habitat certification. This status is awarded to communities whose vision is to develop a long-term plan of action and accompanying strategies that will ensure a continued sensitivity to the wildlife and natural environment the community presently supports and shelters. Callawassie Islanders have accomplished this through resident involvement with the NWF Backyard Wildlife Habitat program and continuing wildlife education for all island residents. To date, more than 200 Callawassie properties have been certified as Backyard Wildlife Habitats, making Callawassie Island the largest per capita community Backyard Wildlife Habitat Community in America. Residents ensure wildlife habitat on their own properties provides the four basic wildlife needs: food, water, cover, and a place to raise their young. Community Wildlife Habitat re-certification occurs annually by meeting specific criteria (judged by a point system) as set by NWF. While only forty points are required to maintain CWH certification, Callawassie typically earns more than 100 points each year. Reports are filed annually with NWF, providing a recount of programs that support the island's Community Wildlife Habitat Program. = Ecology and wildlife programs = In the past, Callawassie Island has either led or participated in and reported on the following ecology programs: * A Community Ecology Guide: This publication is provided to all new residents via the community website (callawassieisland.org) and addresses the uniqueness of Callawassie Island from an ecological point of view. * A Wildlife Habitat Preservation Program: Common community properties that are conducive for sustaining wildlife are identified and maintained. * Educational Speaker/Dinner Programs: All programs have stewardship as their main theme and are scheduled as least quarterly throughout the year. Speakers include naturalists, biologists, and other representatives from various government-supported nature programs. * Save-A- Snake Program: Through resident education, Callawassie residents are encouraged not to kill any snake they may encounter. Instead, the island promotes its snake relocation effort. Residents may call the island's herpetologist to have a snake removed from their property while he explains the benefits snakes have to the overall ecology of the island. Callawassie promotes the following slogan: \\"A Live Snake is a Good Snake.\\" * Chinese Tallow Tree Eradication Program: The goal is to prevent invasion and growth of Chinese Tallow trees, a non-native invasive species brought to the Southeast during Colonial times. Community volunteers inventory new growth and eradicate saplings, as needed. * Annual River/Marsh Cleanup Program: Resident volunteers collect debris and trash that has been brought in by the tides from Callawassie's shoreline. * SCORE-SC South Carolina Oyster Reef Restoration Enhancement: Volunteer residents have planned, implemented, and tracked development of the establishment of an oyster reef near the Sugar Mill Community Dock. On October 29, 2004, President George W. Bush recognized Callawassie Island for its commitment to the SCORE program. Eastern bluebird on Callawassie Island * Bluebird Nest Monitoring Program: Resident volunteers maintain and monitor 60 bluebird houses located on out-of-play areas of the community's three golf courses during bluebird nesting season (March–August). Over 200 bluebirds fledge annually with statistics reported to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. *Audubon Society Annual Christmas Bird Count: Each year resident volunteers spend a day in December counting species and the number of individual birds on Callawassie Island. A typical CBC produces over 80 species and almost 2000 individual birds. It is not unusual to spot a pair of bald eagles during the Christmas Bird Count. Callawassie Island has been home to nesting eagles for many years. * Magnolia, Sequoia and Sugar Mill Parks: The Callawassie Island Garden Club maintains three walk-through parks, which have been designated as habitats and left in their natural state. All three parks border on the Okatie River and tidal creeks. Magnolia Park is unique in that it encompasses a sub-tropical magnolia forest (Magnolia grandiflora). The Magnolia grandiflora is native to the Southeastern United States, and the Magnolia Park on Callawassie Island is the only such forested site in South Carolina.Aulbrach-Smith, Cynthia A. * Annual Callawassie Island Ecology Calendar: This calendar celebrates the nature of the Lowcountry through the photographs of the island's photographers. Funds from the sale of the calendars help to support ecology projects throughout the island.  Gardens and parks  Callawassie Island has three parks, Magnolia, Sequoia, and Sugar Mill, as well as a butterfly garden for the enjoyment of its residents and visitors. A walk through each park provides the visitor with a different experience because of the distinctive flora and views of the tidal rivers and salt marshes that surround the island. Additionally, each park represents a different aspect of Callawassie's long and rich history. The community is committed to preserving the parks as nature preserves; its Master Plan states that only vegetation native to Callawassie Island can be planted in these parks. Because parks provide food, water, and shelter for wildlife, Sequoia Park and Magnolia Park have been designated as Backyard Wildlife Habitats by the National Wildlife Federation.http://www.nwf.org/backyardwildlife The parks and butterfly garden are maintained jointly by the Callawassie Island Property Owners Association and the Callawassie Garden Club. = Sugar Mill Park = Sugar Mill Park sits on a low bluff on the northwestern side of Callawassie Island, overlooking the salt marsh and a branch of the Chechessee River. A path flanked by live oaks draped with Spanish moss runs from Sugar Mill Drive to a community dock that provides access to the river. Native plants in the park include southern magnolias, yaupon hollies, wax myrtles, dwarf palmettos, and sabal palms. At the rear of the park near the bluff, are the tabby ruins of an early 19th-century sugar processing facility, the Callawassie Sugar Works.The Historic American Buildings Survey, http://www.lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/sc/sc1o100/sc1115/data/sc1115data.pdf. = Magnolia Park = Magnolia flower Magnolia Park is a one-acre subtropical magnolia forest located on the west side of Wild Magnolia Court. It is a near- virgin forest that has been left undisturbed for several hundred years and the only existing documented forest of its type in South Carolina. A path winds through the park to the edge of the tidal salt marsh with a view of a branch of the Colleton River. As its name suggests, the park is characterized by the dominance of southern magnolias that, along with white ash trees, create a dense canopy. This is also the site of an Indian shell midden, a mound of mollusk shells left behind by the early native inhabitants of Callawassie Island. Numerous sabal palms and dwarf palmettos create a lush tropical understory throughout the shady park.Aulbrach-Smith, Cynthia A., The Vascular Flora of Callawassie Island, Beaufort County, South Carolina, Department of Biology, University of South Carolina, 1982 = Sequoia Park = Sequoia Park is a one-acre pine forest on the southwest corner of Winding Oak Drive and Sequoia Court. A horseshoe-shaped path through a large stand of loblolly pines leads to an expansive view of the tidal salt marsh. This is a young forest resulting from the clearing of hardwood trees, either for their wood or for the cultivation of crops such as indigo or sea island cotton. Because of the tall pine canopy, sunlight is able to penetrate to encourage the growth of understory flora such as oaks, sweet gum trees, hickories, sassafras, yaupon hollies, and wax myrtles. = Butterfly Garden = Callawassie's butterfly garden, on the southeast corner of Callawassie Drive and South Oak Forest Drive, was expanded and replanted in 2010. It provides a colorful floral display from spring through late fall. The 6500-square-foot garden contains a variety of host and nectar plants to support butterflies throughout their life cycle. Caterpillars feed on host plants such as milkweed, parsley, butterfly weed, and snapdragons. Nectar plants in the garden include butterfly bushes, shasta daisies, zinnias, Joe Pye weed, yarrows, lantanas, sages, abelias, bee balm, and a vitex tree. Other plantings provide color to attract butterflies. Frequent visitors to the garden include monarch, swallowtail, little sulphur, cloudless sulphur, and tiger swallowtail butterflies. In 2011, the garden was certified by the North American Butterfly Association as a garden \\"that provides resources to increase the world's population of butterflies.\\"  Amenities  In addition to the 27-hole golf course designed by Tom Fazio, voted Best Golf Course of Bluffton for 2011 by readers of Bluffton Today and the amenities mentioned above there is a golf practice facility and pro shop, a fitness senter, a tennis pro shop, a bocce/croquet court and the Callawassie Island and River Club Clubhouses.

Chungking Mansions is a building located at 36–44 Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Though the building was supposed to be residential, it is made up of many independent low-budget hotels, shops and other services. As well as selling to the public, the stalls in the building cater to wholesalers shipping goods to Africa and South Asia. The unusual atmosphere of the building is sometimes compared to that of the former Kowloon Walled City. Chungking Mansions features guesthouses, curry restaurants, African bistros, clothing shops, sari stores, and foreign exchange offices. It often acts as a large gathering place for some of the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, particularly South Asians (Indians, Nepalese, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans), Middle Eastern people, Nigerians, Europeans, Americans, and many other peoples of the world. Peter Shadbolt of CNN stated that the complex was the \\"unofficial African quarter of Hong Kong\\".\\"China, hip-hop and the new Sudan.\\" CNN. 4 February 2011. Retrieved 4 February 2011. The building was completed in 1961, at which time Chinese residents predominated. Now, after more than five decades of use, there are an estimated 4,000 people living in the complex.https://zolimacitymag.com/the-world-inside-a-building-chungking- mansions/ Building structure and housing Chungking Mansions is 17 storeys tall and consists of five blocks, named A, B, C, D and E. There are two lifts in each block, one of which serves even-numbered floors, the other odd- numbered floors. A CCTV camera system exists at the ground floor level for each of the lift cars. The first two floors are common space where you can wander around under the blocks; the third floor is actually a terrace level between the blocks where the tower blocks start to rise out of the base of the building; and all floors above this are accessible only by the stairways and lifts contained in each block. The separate Cke Shopping Mall, a few metres to the north of the main entrance, however, protrudes into the 3rd floor of blocks A and B. Location Chungking Mansions is located in one of the busiest districts of Hong Kong; it is very close to the Tsim Sha Tsui Station and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station of the MTR. Several airport buses run by it (A21 No14-Bus Stop). Kowloon Park is anchored by a mosque and this structure and the park itself are a popular refuge from the crowding of the Chungking Mansions and the surrounding area. The Hong Kong Cultural Centre and the Museum of Art are close by, across Salisbury Road. Businesses While Chungking Mansions is designated for residential use, the building includes a wide variety of commercial establishments. =Retail= There are three shopping arcades within Chungking Mansions. All have their main entrances on Nathan Road: the main arcade, Cke Shopping Mall and Wood House. The original mall was closed in 1998. It reopened later and the Cke and Wood House were created.

For example, some small and family-run Indian and Pakistani restaurants with traditional Indian curry and Nepalese food are very well known. Due to competition between the very large number of restaurants inside the Mansions that are similar in style, many of them send staff to distribute leaflets on the streets to aggressively promote their restaurants.Paul Wenham, Can the charms of Chungking survive? , The Standard, 3 November 2004 There are many money changers located in the lower floors of Chungking Mansions who provide exchange services to the high number of people from all over the world living or doing business here.

Background At the beginning of the 18th century, the principal literary language of the Serbs was Church Slavonic of the Serbian recension or Serbo- Slavonic, with centuries-old tradition.Ivić 1998, pp. 105–6 By the mid-18th century, it had been mostly replaced with Russo-Slavonic (Church Slavonic of the Russian recension) among the Serbs in the Habsburg Empire.Ivić 1998, pp. 116–19Paxton 1981, pp. 107–9 A linguistic blend of Russo-Slavonic, vernacular Serbian, and Russian—called Slavonic-Serbian— became the dominant language of Serbian secular publications during the 1780s and 1790s. A German–Slavonic- Serbian dictionary was composed in the 1730s in Karlovci, with around 1,100 headwords.Ivić 1998, pp. 129–33 The last notable work in Slavonic-Serbian was published in 1825.Ivić 1998, p. 194 Since 1750, German had been steadily replacing Latin as the official language in the Habsburg Empire. In Serbian schools, German began to be taught on 1 October 1753 in Karlovci.Kostić 1998, pp. 39–43 A knowledge of that language was especially important for those Serbs who sought a career in the imperial bureaucracy, the army, or commerce. A German grammar in Slavonic-Serbian appeared in 1772,Paxton 1981, pp. 110–11 adapted by Stefan Vujanovski. The book also contained a dictionary with around 4,500 headwords. Two years later, Sava Lazarević wrote a textbook for learning German, with a dictionary of around 1,600 headwords. This dictionary would be published as a separate book titled Рѣчникъ малый (Little Dictionary) in 1793, and it was reprinted in 1802, 1806, 1814, 1823, and 1837. The 1772 grammar and the 1774 textbook were printed in Vienna by Austrian publisher and bookseller Joseph Kurzböck. He established his Cyrillic printing house in 1770, and Empress Maria Theresia granted him a monopoly on printing and importing Cyrillic books.Denić 2004, pp. 64–65Gastgeber 2002, para. 7 The empress sanctioned a Cyrillic press in Vienna to reduce the massive importation of Russian books requested by the Serbian Orthodox Church and schools. The Habsburg court had repeatedly rejected the Serbs' petitions to found their own printing houses.Gastgeber 2002, para. 6 In 1786, Kurzböck employed Teodor Avramović as a proofreader,Denić 2004, pp. 68–69 who previously worked as a teacher in his home town of Ruma.Denić 2004, pp. 62–63 Mojsije Putnik, the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Karlovci (1781–1790) Between 1779 and 1785, there was an intensive campaign in the Habsburg Empire to eliminate the Cyrillic script and the Church Slavonic language from Serbian schools and secular publications. The Cyrillic script was to be replaced with the Latin alphabet, and the \\"Illyrian\\" language that was used in Croatian schools was to replace Church Slavonic. This campaign eventually failed as it was effectively resisted by Serb educational and religious authorities, including the Metropolitan of Karlovci, Mojsije Putnik. The term \\"Illyrian\\" was used in the Habsburg Empire to refer to any South Slavic peoples or to the South Slavs in general, though in the 18th century, non-Slavic Habsburg officials associated it primarily with Serbs.Fine 2006, p. 374 Production and usage After an agreement with Metropolitan Putnik, Joseph Kurzböck undertook the project of producing a German dictionary for the Serbian people.Denić 2004, pp. 122–24 The quickest and least costly way to do that was to adapt an existing work. At that time, highly regarded as the German–Russian bidirectional dictionary composed by Jacob Rodde in Riga and printed in 1784 in Leipzig.Denić 2004, pp. 119–21 Kurzbeck entrusted his proofreader Teodor Avramović with the job of adapting Jacob Rodde's work into Slavonic-Serbian. Avramović was helped by Atanasije Dimitrijević Sekereš,Denić 2004, pp. 142–45 the censor of the Cyrillic books installed by the Habsburg court in 1772.Brković & Kartalović 2002, p. 40Gastgeber 2002, para. 8 Sekereš began composing his Slavonic- Serbian dictionary in 1775, using five Russian dictionaries as sources, but he later abandoned that work. The printing of the Avramović Dictionary began at the end of 1789. In February 1790, Kurzböck requested and received Metropolitan Putnik's permission to dedicate the book to him. After the metropolitan died on 9 July 1790, Kurzböck stopped its printing. Emanuilo Janković, whose petition to found a Serbian printing house in Novi Sad was rejected, criticized the dictionary and Kurzböck's Cyrillic production in general; he owned a press in Leipzig. The new Metropolitan of Karlovci, Stefan Stratimirović, was elected in November 1790, and he approved the dictionary at Kurzböck's request. Its printing was then resumed and completed in the first half of May 1791. Kurzböck sent a copy to Count Francis Balassa, the head of the Illyrian Court Chancellery, which was a Habsburg ministry focused primarily on the Serbs. Kurzbeck requested and received Balassa's permission to include a dedication to him and his portrait in the dictionary. The book appeared at the end of July 1791; its price was 7 guldens and 30 kreuzers.Denić 2004, pp. 132–34 Count Francis Balassa's engraving in the Avramović Dictionary Balassa sent a copy to Stratimirović recommending the book, and the metropolitan informed the eparchies under his jurisdiction about its publication. It was bought by students, priests, scholars, merchants, and other people, mostly in Vienna, Budapest, Novi Sad, Osijek, and Oradea, where Avramović was the district inspector for Serbian and Romanian schools from 1792 until his death in 1806. In 1792, Stefan von Novaković bought Kurzböck's Cyrillic press and warehouse of books. When he sold them to the Pest University Press in 1795, there were 360 unsold copies of the Avramović Dictionary in the warehouse. The book was listed in the university's sale catalogs until 1829. It was part of the library of Sava Tekelija, who wrote additional entries in his copy.Denić 2004, pp. 140–41 The first edition of Vuk Karadžić's Serbian Dictionary appeared in 1818 as the first book in modern literary Serbian, based on the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect. There are indications that Karadžić used the Avramović Dictionary as a source for his work.Gudkov 1972, pp. 195–96 In 2002, the Austrian National Library hosted an exhibition titled \\"The Serbian Book in Vienna 1741–1900\\", prepared by the Library of Matica Srpska with the help of the National Library of Serbia. Among 212 exhibited publications, there were 28 of those printed by Kurzböck,Brković & Kartalović 2002, pp. 119–22 one of which was the Avramović Dictionary.Brković & Kartalović 2002, p. 75 Between 1770 and 1792, Kurzböck printed 151 Serbian publications, including textbooks, religious books, philosophical, literary, and other works, by authors such as Jovan Rajić, Jovan Muškatirović, Aleksije Vezilić, Dositej Obradović, Zaharije Orfelin, and Pavle Julinac. Description The Avramović Dictionary is the largest Serbian dictionary of the 18th century.Gudkov 1993, p. 78 Printed in the octavo format, it contains 1045 pages of lexical text divided into two separately paginated parts. The first part is a German–Slavonic-Serbian dictionary titled Deutsch–Illyrisches Wörterbuch (German–Illyrian Dictionary), consisting of 719 pages. The second part is a Slavonic-Serbian–German dictionary titled Славено- Сербскïй Леѯïконъ (Slavonic-Serbian Lexicon), consisting of 326 pages. Either part has approximately 20,000 headwords; the first part has more pages as its entries are larger and more detailed.Gudkov 1993, p. 81 By the time of its publication in July 1791, the book had been printed in four variants, differing only in front matter. In the first two variants, 1790 is given as the year of publication, and in the other two variants, it is 1791. The 1790 variants have two title pages, one in Slavonic-Serbian (folio 1 verso), and the other in German (folio 2 recto). The earlier of these variants contain a dedication to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik composed by Kurzböck, while the other variant has no dedication. The 1791 variants have one title page (folio 2 recto) with both the Slavonic-Serbian and the German version of the title. The preceding page (folio 1 verso) contains a copperplate engraving depicting Count Francis Balassa, and these two variants differ only in some details of the engraving. After the title page comes a dedication to Balassa, composed by Kurzböck in the tone of humble devotion.Denić 2004, pp. 125–26 All variants have the same foreword written by Kurzböck, while none of them mentions Jacob Rodde as the source or Teodor Avramović as the editor of the dictionary. Only Kurzbeck is mentioned as its publisher.Denić 2004, pp. 127–28 Its source and editor have been identified respectively by Samuel Linde at the beginning of the 19th centuryGudkov 1993, p. 80 and Pavel Jozef Šafárik in 1865, since when the book has been referred to as the Avramović Dictionary. Page 1 of the 2nd part of the dictionary, titled Slavonic-Serbian Lexicon Its German component is practically identical to that of Rodde's dictionary. The latter's German–Russian part is based on the German–Latin–Russian dictionary published by the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1731. Rodde added stress marks and grammatical notes on Russian words.Keipert 2006, pp. 94–95 The academy's dictionary is created through adding a Russian component to the German–Latin part of the Lexicon bipartitum Latino–Germanicum et Germanico–Latinum, written by Ehrenreich Weismann and first published in 1673 in Stuttgart; it had eleven more editions. Besides lexemes of the educated German language, Weismann's Lexicon also contains regionalisms and archaisms. Its entries often include compounds of the headword; e.g., Landstrasse and Holzstrasse are found s.v. Strasse. Polysemes are entered as separate headwords accompanied by a disambiguating remark; thus, four senses of the noun Frucht (fruit) are found s.v. Frucht (Baum), Frucht oder Nutz, Frucht (vom Acker), and Frucht des Leibes. Usage of headwords is illustrated with phrases, idioms, and collocations, and the Lexicon contains many proverbs and sayings.Birzhakova 2010, pp. 66–67 The Serbian component of the Avramović Dictionary reflects the contemporary condition of the literary language of the Serbs—a blend of Church Slavonic, vernacular Serbian, and Russian.Gudkov 1993, pp. 106–7 While Rodde's work uses the civil version of Cyrillic, introduced in Russia by Peter the Great, the Avramović Dictionary uses an old ecclesiastical type of the script, including the archaic letters ѕ, ѡ, ꙗ, ѧ, and ѵ. Many Russian terms are copied from Rodde verbatim or with a small modification, especially those used in areas with which the Serbs were not very familiar at the time. Serbian vernacular terms predominate in some areas, such as armament and trade;Gudkov 1972, pp. 193–94 there are also common Serbian expressions like айдемо (ajdemo, \\"let's go\\").Gudkov 1972, pp. 187–88 A number of Russian words in Rodde are replaced by Avramović with their Russo-Slavonic equivalents. An example of the entries dominated by vernacular Serbian terminology is that under the headword Nadel (needle), in which only one word is taken from Russian, meaning \\"magnetic\\":Gudkov 1972, p. 186 In the second part of the dictionary, the copied Russian headwords are often accompanied by their Serbian equivalents; e.g., under the headword очки (glasses), \\"очки, наочари, die Augengläser\\".Gudkov 1993, p. 87 In entries of the first part, Russian and Serbian forms complement each other; so the headword schwarz (black) is translated with the Russian черный, and in that entry, the verb schwärzen (blacken) is translated with the Serbian поцрнити.Gudkov 1972, p. 185 German proverbs and sayings are interpreted with their Serbian counterparts. Thus, s.v. Schnitt, a German phrase meaning \\"he made a good profit from it\\" is interpreted with a popular Serbian saying, pala mu sekira u med (his axe fell into honey). Phonologically, morphologically, and lexically, vernacular Serbian used in the Avramović Dictionary reflects a dialect of the Serbs of Vojvodina. It also exhibits some archaic grammatical traits, and the usage of aorist is more common than in modern Serbian.Gudkov 1972, pp. 191–92 The everyday language of the Vojvodina Serbs was enriched in the 18th century with loanwords from German. Some of those found in the dictionary are also part of modern literary Serbian, such as торта (torta, torte), харинга (haringa, herring), шупа (šupa, shed), паръ (par, pair), нула (nula, zero), цицъ (cic, fine printed calico), and баïонетъ (bajonet, bayonet).

Halford is a four times senior British Champion (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017), and two times Junior British Champion. She represented Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Gymnastic career Halford began gymnastics at the age of six, and her natural flexibility saw her gravitate towards rhythmic gymnastics. By the age of nine she was representing both Britain and Wales, qualifying for the latter through her Welsh father. At the age of ten she won her first junior British title. At the age of 12 Halford was recognized by her district council as an aspiring junior sportsperson and was awarded a grant to help fund her sporting career. Halford, who trains out of Wiltshire club, Esprit Gymnastics in Swindon, travels to Cardiff three times a week to train with the Welsh team, where her team mate was British Champion Frankie Jones. In 2011 Halford became British junior Champion. In 2012, her first year competing as a senior, in the absence of Frankie Jones, she was favourite to take the British Championship held at Fenton Manor Sport Complex. Her overall score of 55.599 was enough to push her team mate Stephani Sherlock into second place and give Halford the title. The same year she also took the Wales national title. In preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland, Halford and Wales team-mate Nikara Jenkins travelled to Tartu, Estonia to take part in the Miss Valentine Gymnastic Competition in order to practice their new routines in a competitive setting. Although not placing highly their coach believed the experience was valuable. Halford's build-up to the Commonwealth Games continued through 2013 when she won the invitational senior Millennium Cup in Vancouver, Canada. In 2014 Halford successfully defended her Welsh title, also taking gold in the individual ball event. A few days later she travelled to Stoke to defend her British Championship title. Her score of 61.465 across the ball, hoop, ribbon and clubs saw her retain her crown, which also saw the return of Frankie Jones to the competition. In June 2014 it was announced that Halford had been selected for the Wales team at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. At Glasgow she was entered for four individual events, the ball, hoop, ribbon and all-around; while she was joined by Jones and Jenkins to compete for the team all-around event. On the first day of the Commonwealth Games, in the team all-around event, Wales won silver having led for much of the competition. On day two, she entered the individual all-around, scoring 56.225 to finish third to take bronze, while team-mate Jones finished ahead of her in silver position. In day three Halford came eighth in ribbon, fifth in hoop, but secured a third medal by taking a bronze in the ball. Halford competed at the 2014 World Championships in Izmir, Turkey placing 44th in the all-around qualifications. In 2015, Halford competed at the 2015 Lisboa World Cup finishing 33rd in the all-around. In August, Halford finished 36th in all-around at the 2015 Sofia World Cup. In September 9–13, Halford competed at the 2015 World Championships in Stuttgart finishing 73rd in the All-around qualifications and did not advance into the Top 24 finals. In 2016, Halford competed at the 2016 FIG World Cup in Espoo finishing 31st in the all-around. On March 17–20, Halford competed at the 2016 Lisboa World Cup where she finished 33rd in the all-around. Halford finished 25th in the all-around at the 2016 Sofia World Cup. On July 1–3, Halford competed at the 2016 Berlin World Cup finishing 24th in the all-around. In 2017, On May 5–7, Halford competed at the 2017 Sofia World Cup and finished 31st in the all-around. On May 12–14, Halford competed at the 2017 World Challenge Cup in Portimao where she finished 17th in the all-around which was her highest World Cup all-around placement. On May 19–21, Halford along with teammate Stephani Sherlock represented the individual seniors for Great Britain at the 2017 European Championships. Her next event was at the 2017 World Challenge Cup Guadalajara where she finished 26th in the all-around. She reclaimed the National title at the 2017 British Championships. On August 30 – September 3, Halford competed at the 2017 World Championships in Pesaro, Italy; finishing 67th in the all-around qualifications and thus not making the top 24 all-around finalists.

The resulting article, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1983 (148 Wos citations, 210 GS citations), spawned a series of studies tracking the birth cohort-specific relationships between smoking rates and disease incidence.Burns DM, Lee L, Shen LZ, Gilpin E, Tolley HD, Vaughn J, Shanks TG, Cigarette smoking behavior in the United States, Chapter 2 in Shopland D, Burns DM, Garfinkel L, Samet J, eds., Changes in Cigarette-Related Disease Risks and Their Implications for Prevention and Control.

National Cancer Institute, Bethesda MD, Feb. 1997. = Improved short-term survival from AIDS (1990) = In an article entitled Improved Short-Term Survival of AIDS Patients Initially Diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia, 1984 through 1987 (101 WoS citations, 131 GS citations), Harris was one of the first investigators to report a significant gain in life expectancy for AIDS patients, which he attributed to the introduction in 1986 of zidovudine, the first antiretroviral agent. = Risk of lung cancer from low tar cigarettes (2004) = Harris collaborated with Dr. Michael Thun and his colleagues at the American Cancer Society to study the relationship between cigarette tar yield and the risk of cancer in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort (57 WoS citations, 136 GS citations, 36,000 downloads from British Medical Journal website). This prospective cohort study of over 900,000 men and women remains the standard citation for the conclusion that, while cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung cancer compared to nonsmokers, there is no difference in lung cancer risk between those who smoke medium tar cigarettes, low tar cigarettes and very low tar cigarettes.Ridge CA, McErlean AM, Ginsberg MS. Epidemiology of lung cancer. Seminars in Interventional Radiology 2013; 30(2):93-98.  Public service  Harris has served as Consulting Scientific Editor, Contributor, and Senior Reviewer to U.S. Surgeon General's Reports on Smoking and Health (1979–1983, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1996). He has served as a member of several committees of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, including the Diesel Impacts Study Committee, the Committee to Study the Prevention of Low Birth Weight, the Committee on National Strategies toward Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the Committee on Risk Characterization, and the Committee on Reducing Tobacco Use. Harris has served as consultant to governmental agencies, including the U.S. National Cancer Institute, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Minnesota Attorney General, New York City Department of Health, New Hampshire Association of Counties, the Attorney General of Canada, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Safety Commission. He has consulted for nonprofit public interest organizations, including the American Cancer Society. He has also served as a physician member of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine (1978-1980).  Expert testimony  Harris has given invited testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives; the Committee of the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives; the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee; the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture; the U.S. Senate Democratic Task Force; and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. In 2003, he gave expert testimony in Price v. Philip Morris, a class-action lawsuit alleging fraud in the marketing and sale concerning light cigarettes, in which the trial court entered a $10.1 billion judgment against the defendant.Although the judgment was vacated by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2005, the case has been recently revived and is currently pending appeal. In 2004, he gave expert testimony in United States v. Philip Morris et al., in which the trial court found that tobacco manufacturers had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Harris has offered expert testimony in other cases involving the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. = Cipollone v. Liggett (1988) = Harris’ role as an expert witness at trial in Cipollone v. Liggett, the first lawsuit in which a jury held the tobacco industry responsible for an individual smoker's death, has been subject to reviews. As recounted by Richard Kluger in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Ashes to Ashes:Kluger R, Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris, Alfred A. Knopf, 1996. \\"Harris tellingly contrasted the tobacco companies' conduct with that of the canning industry, which had adopted new sterilizing methods when botulism was traced to its careless procedures, and the pharmaceutical industry, which had put a skull- and-crossbones warning on preparations found to be toxic when ingested. Such measures were in marked contrast to the conduct of Philip Morris, Harris said, which in the 'Thirties had introduced the humectant diethylene glycol-- a compound later found to be harmful to the kidneys-- based on a minimum of testing...\\" Harris' unpublished Expert Report on the State of the Art, which was submitted in the Cipollone litigation, itself spawned an inquiry into the role of historians as experts in tobacco-related litigation.Proctor RN, \\"Everyone knew but no one had proof”: tobacco industry use of medical history expertise in US courts, 1990–2002. Tobacco Control 2006; 15(Suppl. 4): iv117-iv125. As recounted by Robert Proctor in Golden Holocaust,Proctor, RN. Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011. pp. 426-27. \\"In a memo titled 'Witness Development,' Arnold & Porter's Janet L. Johnson emphasized to STIC's State-of-the-Art Subcomittee their need to develop a 'storyteller' to tell 'our version' of the history of the recognition of tobacco hazards. Jeffrey Harris's expert report for Cipollone had presented a detailed chronicle of the discovery of lung cancer hazard, identifying evidence from the 1930s and the strong case for proof by 1957. The industry wanted to counter the testimony without having to address when a link had actually been established. 'Instead of trying to defend the issue of whether and when a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was established, we should consider focusing our testimony on defending 1954, attacking Harris' 1957 date on which a link was 'proven,' and demonstrate that it was not proven in 1957 with post-57 statements by medical experts about the existence of a controversy'.\\"  Hispanic collaborations  Since he spent the summer of 2005 in a community health center in Guatemala, Harris has developed connections with researchers and policy makers throughout the Spanish-speaking world. He has served as visiting faculty and has given lectures, principally in Spanish, in Guatemala (Universidad Francisco Marroquin), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública), the Dominican Republic (Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra, Universidad Tecnológica de Santiago), Spain (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, University of La Laguna, University of Salamanca, Pompeu Fabra University), Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Investigación y Enseñanza en Nutrición y Salud, University of Costa Rica), Uruguay (Fondo Nacional de Recursos, University of the Republic) and Chile (University of Chile, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile). In 2008, Harris was named Huésped Distinguido (Distinguished Guest and Honorary Citizen), City of Salamanca, Spain.

It was previously included with tupelos in the dogwood family, Cornaceae. It is native to South Central and Southwest China from Hubei to southern Gansu, south to Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan, but is widely cultivated elsewhere. Taxonomy Davidia involucrata is the only member of its genus, but there are two varieties differing slightly in their leaves, D. involucrata var. involucrata, which has the leaves thinly pubescent (short-haired) on the underside, and D. involucrata var. vilmoriniana, with glabrous (hairless) leaves. Some botanists treat them as distinct species, with good reason, as the two taxa have differing chromosome numbers so are unable to produce fertile hybrid offspring. Description It is a moderately fast-growing tree, growing to in height, with alternate cordate leaves resembling those of a linden in appearance, except that they are symmetrical, and lacking the lop-sided base typical of linden leaves; the leaves are mostly 10–20 cm long and 7–15 cm wide and are ovate to heart-shaped. Davidia involucrata is best known for its inflorescence that features white bracts surrounding a purplish-red flower head. The Latin specific epithet involucrata means \\"with a ring of bracts surrounding several flowers\\". These form a tight cluster about 1–2 cm across, each flower head with a pair of large (12–25 cm), pure white bracts at the base performing the function of petals. The inflorescences hang in long rows beneath the level branches and are at their best in late May. On a breezy day, the bracts flutter in the wind like white doves or pinched handkerchiefs, hence the English names for this tree. The fruit is a very hard nut about 3 cm long surrounded by a green husk about 4 cm long by 3 cm wide, hanging on a 10 cm stalk. The nut contains 3–6 seeds. History The genus Davidia is named for Father Armand David (1826–1900; \\"Père David\\"), a French Vincentian missionary and keen naturalist who lived in China. David first described the tree in 1869 as a single tree found at over altitude, and sent dried specimens to Paris; in 1871, Henri Baillon described it as a new genus and species.\\"E. H. Wilson's First Trip to China\\", by William H. Gardener, in Arnoldia, the quarterly journal of the Arnold Arboretum; published May 3, 1972 (vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 103–115; introduction by Gordon P. DeWolf, Jr. British plant hunter Augustine Henry again found a single tree, this time in the Yangtse Ichang gorges and sent the first specimen to Kew Gardens. Plant collector Ernest Henry Wilson was employed by Sir Harry Veitch to find Henry's tree but arrived to find that it had been felled for building purposes; however, he later found a grove of the trees overhanging a sheer drop. Returning to Britain, Wilson’s boat was wrecked, but he managed to save his Davidia specimens.http://www.lmi.org.uk/medical_society/16/16Martin.pdf File:Davidia2.jpgyoung tree in flower FIle:DavidiaInvolucrataTree.jpgform File:DavidiaInvolucrataBark.jpgbark File:DavidiaInvolucrataLeaf.jpgleaves Fossil record The oldest probable fossils of Davidia are permineralized fruits from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park near Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. Those fruits are smaller than those of D. involucrata and have fewer locules, but are otherwise similar in morphology to the extant genus.http://www.palaeobotany.org/page/living-fossils/davidia-involucrata/ In 2009, B. I. Pavlyutkin described Miocene fossils in Primorsky Krai and assigned them to a new species in the genus Davidia. In gardens The species was introduced from China to Europe and North America in 1904, and is a popular ornamental tree in parks and larger gardens. Most trees in cultivation are var. vilmoriniana, which has proved much better able to adapt to the climatic conditions in the west. This tree and the cultivated variety D. involucrata var. vilmoriniana have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

He was the only main ally of King Narapati II of Ava in the latter's 25-year struggle against the Mohnyin-led Confederation of Shan States, Prome and Toungoo. After Ava's fall, he became a member of the Confederation. He died during or shortly after his participation in the Confederation's 1542 campaign against Toungoo Dynasty. His son, also named Hkonmaing, and grandson Narapati III became kings of Ava. Background What is known about Hkonmaing is solely from the Burmese chronicles. The Chinese annals (Ming Shilu) on the Tai-Shan frontier (present-day southern Yunnan, Kachin State and Shan State) stopped at Hsenwi, and make no mention of Hsipaw.Fernquest 2005: 1162, 1173–1174 The Burmese chronicles mention Hkonmaing as a supporting figure—albeit an important one—in King Narapati II's reign. According to the chronicles, Hkonmaing (also called Hkonmaing Gyi,Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 120 lit. \\"Hkonmaing the elder\\") was the ruler of the Shan state of Onbaung–Hsipaw, certainly by 1505.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 103–104 Since his eldest son Hkonmaing the younger was born in 1497, he was likely born c. 1480. At the time, Onbaung–Hsipaw was a major Shan state, which controlled (or claimed to control) the entire stretch of eastern Shan Hills west of the Salween river: Bhamo,Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 105–106 Yawnghwe (Nyaungshwe), Mong Nai (Mone) and Mong Pai (Mobye).Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 123Onbaung–Hsipaw's claims especially that over Mong Nai/Mone need to be tempered. It was more likely that members of a ruling clan governed these states than an outright patron-client relationship. Mong Nai was a major Shan state in its own right; its ruling clan was related to the ruling dynasty of Lan Na as well as Onbaung–Hsipaw. Per (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 240), the Mong Nai leadership claimed a say in Hsipaw's succession order as much as Hsipaw claimed Mong Nai, and in 1557 they attacked Hsipaw because they disagreed with Bayinnaung's choice of the saopha of Hsipaw. Moreover, Onbaung–Hsipaw's relationship with Ava in the early 16th century was closer to an alliance than a patron-client arrangement. Chronicles mention Hkonmaing and Narapati II as thwethauk brothersMaha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 109–110—men who have ritually entered into \\"a sacramental brotherhood\\" by drinking each other's blood.(Harvey 1925: 178): thwethauk means \\"a sacramental brotherhood of some round table as it were\\". Ava had been disintegrating since the 1480s, and its rulers had been fighting losing wars on several fronts against its former vassal states. Narapati II, who came to power in 1501 amidst major rebellions, desperately tried to retain the loyalty of remaining \\"vassal\\" rulers like Hkonmaing of Onbaung and Mingyi Nyo of Toungoo.Harvey 1925: 105 Ally of Ava In the end, Hkonmaing was the only steadfast ally of Narapati II.Harvey 1925: 106 In late 1505, he sent an army (4,000 men, 300 horses, 60 elephants) led by his younger brother to assist Narapati defend the town of Sale from the forces of Prome and Toungoo. Hkonmaing likely stayed in the alliance because he and Narapati were fighting against a common enemy: Sawlon the ambitious expansionist leader of Mohnyin. Sawlon had been raiding Ava's northern territory since 1502.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 103 In 1511, Hkonmaing lost Bhamo, its northernmost possession, to Sawlon whose army simply seized the border town between the two Shan states. Hkonmaing asked Narapati for help. Narapati sent a sizable army (12,000 men, 600 horses, 150 elephants). But the Ava army was ambushed en route at Myedu by a smaller Mohnyin force (4,000 men, 200 horses, 100 elephants), and was driven back with heavy losses. Hkonmaing remained in the alliance even as Mohnyin grew more powerful in the following years. When Sawlon and his allies attacked Ava itself in 1524, Hkonmaing personally led an army (8,000 men, 600 horses, 100 elephants) and defended Ava. But the combined Mohnyin and Prome forces drove out Narapati II and Hkonaming on 22 March 1525. The two thwethauk brothers still had sizable armies—the defeated Ava army still had 8,000 men, 400 horses, 250 elephants while the Onbaung army counted 7,000 men, 500 horses, 80 elephants. As the two armies moved south and entered Toungoo's territory, they were met by the Toungoo army (4,000 men, 400 horses, 100 elephants) at Yamethin. They defeated the Toungoo army, and followed up to Toungoo itself. They could not take it and had to retreat to Ava. (Mohnyin and Prome forces had looted and left the city.) According to the chronicles, Narapati was truly grateful that Hkonmaing remained loyal till the end, and is said to give the saopha many jewels. But Hkonmaing is said to have refused the presents.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 111–112 But their troubles were not yet over. Sawlon returned in the dry season of 1526–27 with a 15,000-strong army. Hkonmaing again came to the aid of Narapati II, and defended Ava. Like in 1525, Sawlon's forces overwhelmed Ava's defenses. On 25 March 1527, Narapati II died in action, and Ava was taken.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 113 Sawlon appointed his eldest son Thohanbwa king of Ava.Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 115 Later years After the defeat at Ava, Hkonmaing retreated to Hsipaw. He later either agreed to a truce with, or submitted to Sawlon since Sawlon did not attack Hsipaw after Ava's fall. After Sawlon was assassinated in 1533, Hkonmaing like other leaders of the Confederation probably did not acknowledge Thohanbwa as the first among equals. However, he did stay in the Confederation. He actively participated in the Confederation's 1541–42 campaign to retake Prome (Pyay).Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 119 The campaign was a failure. The Confederation forces were defeated in April 1542 by Toungoo forces led by Gen. Bayinnaung. Hkonmaing died during the campaign or shortly after since by May 1542, he was already dead.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 120): He was already dead in Kason 904 ME (15 April 1542 to 14 May 1542) when the Ava court offered the throne to his son, Hkonmaing the younger.

As a child, he paid more attention to the sea than his studies. His artistic talent was discovered when he was locked in the attic as punishment and used a piece of charcoal to draw a view of the Ostend docks on the wall. In 1831, he received his first lessons from and François-Antoine Bossuet, who would later become famous for his vedute, but was still working for the Port of Ostend at that time. He later attended the local Beaux Arts Academy and graduated after winning a gold medal in 1835. By this time he had already gained some dangerous experience with ships and sailing while tending to his father's oyster beds.R. Halewyck and N. Hostyn - Het Oostends Oesterboek, Ostend, 1978 Old Lighthouse with Shrimp Fishermen He continued his studies at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, where he studied under François-Joseph Navez. While there, he made drawings of surgical procedures in the operating room of Doctor Louis-Joseph Seutin, with the intention of publishing them in a textbook.l'Echo d'Ostende, 29 March 1903 In 1839, he was drafted in the Army, but his father paid for a replacement (a common practice at the time). In 1840, he began to exhibit and moved to Brussels permanently in 1842, completing his studies the following year. His career was substantially advanced when King Leopold I bought two of his paintings in 1845. =Business affairs= Because of the interest for his art that existed in England, he spent some time there, also travelling to Spain and Portugal. He returned home in 1848 when his father fell ill. In 1849, he married the painter Marie- Célestine Gosselin (1826-1853). After his wife's early death, he gave his share of the family business to his brother Auguste, in return for studio and exhibition space in the family's restaurant. He had also acquired some public land where he built the \\"Pavilion des Dunes\\", the first structure on the beach, which he rented out and also occasionally used as a studio. In 1863, Leopold I built his Royal Pavilions nearby, which inspired a real-estate boom and, in 1865, Musin converted the Pavilion into a hotel. It was sold in 1877, demolished in 1879 and replaced by the \\"Splendid Hotel\\" which was destroyed in World War II. On the beach at Katwijk During these years, he travelled extensively, visiting Portugal, the Alps, France, North America and Norway, where he may have participated in a whaling expedition. All of these travels produced reams of sketches that were elaborated on in his studio. In 1869, he finally settled in Sint-Joost-ten-Node where he built a huge garden studio, collected maritime antiques and gave his son Auguste his first art lessons. His sister-in-law lived with them as housekeeper until her death in 1877. =Patrons and whales= Ever since Kaiser Wilhelm I ordered eight seascapes in 1853, royal customers had been a major source of his income. In 1865, two paintings were bought by the royal family of Württemberg and, in 1873, two were acquired by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. In 1869, the Museo del Prado bought his painting \\"The Cannon Shot - Signal for the Revolt of Cadíz\\", and he was awarded the Order of Charles III. Curiously though, the Belgian government did not buy any of his works until 1880. In 1885, a whale carcass washed ashore at Ostend and became quite a sensation. Musin painted a pochade of the scene, which was also captured by Willy Finch and James Ensor.Norbert Hostyn. De walvis van 1885, gezien door J. Ensor?. De Plate, XXI, 1992, pp. 201-203 He died of a stroke. His friends and family recalled him as a hedonist who was always in a good mood and ready to recount his many adventures. His paintings were unusually popular with forgers, leading his son to contrive various means of identifying the originals, including certificates of authenticity and wax stamps.

By the end of the 18th century, there were about 300 incorporated companies in the United States, most of them providing public services, and only eight manufacturing companies.See PI Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law (1993) 6 The formation of a corporation usually required an act of legislature. State enactment of corporation laws, which was becoming more common by the 1830s, allowed companies to incorporate without securing the adoption of a special legislative bill. However, given the restrictive nature of state corporation laws, many companies preferred to seek a special legislative act for incorporation to attain privileges or monopolies, even until the late nineteenth century. In 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court granted corporations rights they had not previously recognized in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward. The Supreme Court declared that a corporation is not transformed into civil institution just because the government commissioned its corporate charter; and, accordingly, it deemed corporate charters \\"inviolable\\" and not subject to arbitrary amendment or abolition by state governments.17 U.S. 518 (1819). New York was the first state to enact a corporate statute in 1811. The Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811, allowed for free incorporation with limited liability, but only for manufacturing businesses.See An Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes, of 22 March 1811, NY Laws, 34th Session (1811) chap LXCII at 151. New Jersey followed New York's lead in 1816, when it enacted its first corporate law. In 1837, Connecticut adopted a general corporation statute that allowed for the incorporation of any corporation engaged in any lawful business. Delaware did not enact its first corporation law until 1883. *Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 9 U.S. 61 (1809) corporations have capacity to sue. *Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 US 1 (1824) the right of Congress to regulate interstate trade under the commerce clause. General incorporation laws Early state corporation laws were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power. Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance, and corporations were required to comply with the purposes expressed in their charters. Therefore, some large-scale businesses used other forms of association; for example, Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership and John D. Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a corporate trust. In the late 19th century, state governments started to adopt more permissive corporate laws. In 1896, New Jersey was the first state to adopt an \\"enabling\\" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state. As a result of its early enabling corporate statute, New Jersey was the first leading corporate state. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913. Despite the fact that New Jersey changed its corporate law again in 1917 to reenact an enabling corporate statute similar to the repealed 1899 enabling statute, corporations had relocated to Delaware for good; Delaware has been the leading corporate state since the 1920s. *Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 118 U.S. 394 (1886) *M Dodd, 'American Business Association Law a Hundred Years Ago and Today', in 3 Law: A Century of Progress: 1835-1935 (Reppy 1937) 254, 289 Antitrust and mergers In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, which criminalised cartels that acted in restraint of trade. While the case law developed, which eventually began cracking down on the normal practices of businesses who cooperated or colluded with one another, corporations could not acquire stock in one another's businesses. However, in 1898, New Jersey, at the time the leading corporate state, changed its law to allow this. Delaware mirrored New Jersey's enactment in an 1899 statute that stated that shares held in other corporations did not confer voting rights and acquisition of shares in other companies required explicit authorisation.Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) 1883 §23 (17 Del Laws, c 147 p. 212, 14 March 1883); Changed in DGCL 1889 (21 Del Laws, c 273, p. 444, 10 March 1899). Any corporation created under the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) could purchase, hold, sell, or assign shares of other corporations. Accordingly, Delaware corporations could acquire stock in other corporations registered in Delaware and exercise all rights. This helped make Delaware increasingly an attractive places for businesses to incorporate holding companies, through which they could retain control over large operations without sanction under the Sherman Act. As antitrust law continued to tighten, companies integrated through mergers fully. *Clayton Act of 1914 *William Peters Hepburn proposed a Hepburn Bill of 1908 which would have required federal incorporation. This was attacked from various groups who wished to maintain the state system of incorporation.

Great Depression and New Deal AA Berle, with coauthor Gardiner Means, wrote The Modern Corporation and Private Property in 1932, as a response to the Wall Street Crash. They gathered evidence that in modern corporations directors had become too unaccountable, requiring New Deal law reforms. Limited liability was a matter of state law, and in Delaware up until 1967, it was left to the certificate of incorporation to stipulate “whether the private property of the stockholders... shall be subject to the payment of corporate debts, and if so, to what extent.” In California, limited liability was recognised as late as 1931. *AA Berle and GC Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932) *Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 See also *United States corporate law *UK company law history Notes References *PI Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law (1993) Category:History of corporate law ","title":"History of corporate law in the United States"},{"id":"43400463","text":"Project Baseline is a broad effort to map human health, led by Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), Alphabet, Inc.'s health sciences division, and was announced in the Wall Street Journal on July 24, 2014. It begins with the Project Baseline Study, which will collect phenotypic health data from approximately 10,000 participants over the course of at least four years. The project employs experts from widely varying fields including science, medicine, user experience and design, engineering and patient advocacy. The project is not the first one to aim to collect data on many individuals for medical purposes, but it aims to collect a much larger amount of data covering a broader array of topics than its predecessors. De- identified Project Baseline study data will be available to qualified researchers for exploratory analysis in the future. Qualified external researchers may apply through applications reviewed by the Proposal Review and Publications Committee and Scientific Executive Committee. Purpose The Project Baseline study is the first initiative of Project Baseline, a broader effort designed to develop a well-defined reference, or \\"baseline,\\" of good health as well as a rich data platform that may be used to better understand the transition from health to disease and identify additional risk factors for disease. The study will collect comprehensive health information both within and outside the four walls of a clinic. Within the clinic, a broad group of participants - including those who are exceptionally health, at-risk of disease, and with overt disease - will be providing deep data on a diverse set of measurements with repeat sampling over the course of four years. To bridge these encounters, Verily has developed tools such as the investigational Study Watch to allow participants to provide insights throughout their everyday lives. That means the Project Baseline study dataset will include clinical, molecular, imaging, self-reported, behavioral, environmental, sensor and other health-related measurements. To organize this information, Verily is developing infrastructure that can process multi-dimensional health data - much of which have never been combined for an individual. The project also hopes to enable doctors to predict the onset of diseases such as cancer and heart disease far earlier than is currently possible. Organizers hope this will move medicine toward an era centered on prevention rather than treatment. In addition, the study aims to identify biomarkers that make certain people more or less susceptible to various diseases. Methodology The project began in the summer of 2014, when Google began recruiting volunteers to collect bodily fluids such as urine, blood, saliva and tears for a pilot study. The public facing launch was in April 2017, and since then participants have begun enrolling. Sites include Duke University School of Medicine and Stanford Medicine, whose institutional review boards will also monitor the study and make sure the data from it is not misused, according to Verily. Verily also stated that all the data in the study would be anonymized before researchers would have access to it. Ethical concerns Specialist online reporting service STAT News reported in 2016 that the contract for testing of the 200 patients for the study's pilot phase had been awarded without competitive bidding to the California Health & Longevity Institute, a luxury health clinic largely owned by Conrad that offers medical and cosmetic para- medical services and alternative medicine in a spa-like setting. The report said that Conrad had stated that the clinic had the advantage of having all the testing equipment needed for the study in one location, but neither he nor officials from the clinic would disclose what relevant experience the clinic had in conducting the complex research required for the project. Conrad further stated that the contract had been vetted by Google X's compliance and ethics officers when Verily was still part of that division, and a spokesperson stated that Conrad had recused himself from the decision-making project, but a former Verily employee claimed that Google X's vetting of the deal was perfunctory. In April 2017, a Verily spokeswoman confirmed that Andy Conrad had divested from the California Health & Longevity Institute.

The novel is largely a fictionalized retelling of the experiences of the real mountain man Liver- eating Johnson. The book was adapted for Sydney Pollack's film, Jeremiah Johnson (1972).

Sam takes a wife from the Flathead Indian tribe, eschewing her difficult Indian name in favor of the name Lotus. Lotus becomes pregnant, and Sam leaves her at his cabin for the winter months, unwilling to subject his pregnant wife to the rigors of sleeping outdoors while he plies his trade of trapping for furs.

He served as Majority Leader from 2013 to 2017, when he endorsed his successor, Becca Balint.  Education and teaching career  Baruth earned a B.A. in English from Brown University in 1984 and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine in 1993. He is Professor of English at the University of Vermont, where he has served on the faculty since 1993. His teaching is primarily in the areas of creative writing, postmodern American literature and culture, eighteenth-century British literature, and the literature of Vermont. He is married to Annika Ljung-Baruth, a senior lecturer in the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program, and in the Department of English, at the University of Vermont.  Political career  First elected to the Vermont Senate in 2010, Baruth was re-elected in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. He was elected Majority Leader of the Vermont Senate in 2013, and served until 2017. As of 2019, Baruth serves as Chair of Senate Education and also has a seat on the Judiciary Committee. He has previously served on the Education, Economic Development, and Agriculture Committees. He has also served on the PreKindergarten-16 Council and the Vermont Child Poverty Council. Baruth began his public service career as a member of the Burlington Board of School Commissioners. First elected in 2003, he served two non-consecutive two-year terms in Ward 4. In the fall of 2005, Baruth launched a political blog, \\"The Vermont Daily Briefing.\\" The blog was voted \\"Best Vermont Blog of 2006\\" for its first year of political coverage in the Seven Days \\"Best of Vermont\\" poll.

Baruth's career in the State Senate is most noted for his advocacy of gun control. He first proposed an assault weapons ban in 2013 as Majority Leader and later supported a comprehensive background check bill in 2015. In 2018, following the Parkland mass shooting and a foiled plot at Fairhaven Union High School in Vermont, Baruth’s Universal Background Checks language became the nucleus of a comprehensive gun safety bill S55, a bill then signed by Republican Governor Phil Scott on the steps of the Vermont statehouse. He was the driving force in the Senate behind the passage of the 2016 Paid Sick Leave bill, in recognition of which he was named Legislator of the Year by the Main Street Alliance of Vermont.

In this role, Weinberg oversees initiatives to strengthen instruction and enhance student learning across the City's 1600+ district schools. Weinberg has served as a New York City educator for nearly three decades. Prior to being appointed Deputy Chancellor in January 2014, he spent 27 years at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology (HSTAT) in Brooklyn. At HSTAT, he was an English teacher, assistant principal, and most recently, the school's principal for 13 years. Early life and education Weinberg was born in Hawaii and raised in Hamden, Connecticut, a town in New Haven County. He attended Hamden High School. Weinberg's passion for education was sparked by an independent study class he took as a high school senior.Fund for the City of New York, “Interview with Sloan Award Recipient Phil Weinberg”. Retrieved July 26, 2014. As part of the course, he received guidance and support to teach a small class of students with disabilities. This experience helped shape his belief that effective teaching requires ongoing reflection to assess student learning and professional collaboration to improve instruction. Upon graduating from high school, Weinberg enrolled in Swarthmore College. He graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in English. He received his master of arts in teaching English from Columbia University Teachers College in 1984, and later received his school building leader advanced certificate from Hunter College in Manhattan. Education career Weinberg has been a New York City educator for 30 years. He spent 27 years at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology (HSTAT) in Brooklyn. He served as an English teacher for 13 years and assistant principal for one year. In 2001, Weinberg became the school's principal and served in this role for 13 years.

Since its inception in 1985, the school has employed the Educational Option high school admissions process to admit a bell curve of students with varied academic abilities.New Visions for Public Schools, “High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology”, Retrieved July 16, 2014. As a result, HSTAT serves 1,300 students with diverse needs. Twenty-four percent of students require special education services and a little over a quarter of students fall within the lowest third of all New York City students based on their eighth grade math and English Language Arts test scores.Carrano, Jared., “High School of Telecommunication Arts & Technology: A Study of a High-Performing Organization”, 2 April 2013. Retrieved July 16, 2014. In addition, 80 percent of students qualify for free lunch based on family income. Throughout Weinberg's principalship, he focused on preparing students academically and socio-emotionally for success in college and their future careers. In service of this vision, Weinberg funneled the school's resources, particularly the limited resource of time, towards improving students’ access to quality instruction.Anzalone, Lisa, Elise Corwin, Lillian Dunn, Verna Lauria, Kathleen Mulgrew-Daretany, Nancy Sheehan, Luann Smith, Annie Warco “Minute by Minute: School Strategies for Optimizing Time”, 2014. Retrieved July 16, 2014. A principle strategy of this goal was to support teachers in implementing the Common Core Learning Standards.Weinberg, Phil., “A New Year, A New Chance to Help Teachers Teach”, 21 September 2011, Retrieved July 16, 2014. The Common Core is a set of national standards which outline the core skills students must master at each point in their academic careers to be on track for success in college. Weinberg supported teachers in rising to the challenge of implementing the standards by creating a culture of collaboration. Teachers agreed to work in teams and devote an extended amount of professional learning time each week to analyzing and discussing student work. This time was instrumental in allowing teachers to better understand students’ needs, determine how to shift instruction to support their growth, and refine assessments to better measure their progress towards mastering the Common Core. Weinberg and his staff also used data-driven academic programming to ensure that all students, regardless of their academic abilities upon entering the school, would be on track to graduate and achieve a New York State Regents diploma.Fairchild, Susan, Timothy Farrell, Brad Gunton, Ann Mackinnon, Christina McNamara, Robert Trachtman. “Design and Data in Balance: Using Design-Driven Decision-Making to Enable Student Success”, 2014. Retrieved July 17, 2014. All students begin their career at HSTAT in rigorous introductory courses to develop strong foundational literacy, writing, and critical thinking skills. Students who enter the school in need of additional support are enrolled in sections of these courses which are taught in an inclusive co- teaching model. This model brings an additional teacher into the classroom to supports these students’ needs as they are exposed to the same curriculum and high standards as other students. Student progress is assessed continuously at the end of every course in order to enroll them in the most challenging course suitable for them. The ultimate goal was to create pathways that met students at their level and kept them on track for success in college-level coursework. To support students in rising to challenging coursework, Weinberg also instituted structures called “initiatives” within the ninth and tenth grades. Initiatives are cohorts of up to 150 students supported by a team of teachers. This teacher team reviews student work, discusses where students are struggling, and strategizes about how to provide personalized and targeted support for their academic and socio-emotional needs. The cohorts also create a more intimate sense of community for students and a collaborative professional learning support structure for teachers. As a result of Weinberg and his staff's efforts, HSTAT has seen significant gains in student achievement in the past several years. The school's four-year graduation rate rose from sixty-one percent in 2005 to eighty-six percent in 2012 (compared to the citywide average of 66 percent). Fifty-two percent of HSTAT students demonstrated college readiness by meeting the City University of New York's (CUNY) score requirements on New York State Regents examinations compared to the citywide average of twenty-eight percent. Students who reach this benchmark avoid remedial coursework should they enroll in a CUNY. Each year, HSTAT seniors celebrate their preparation for college by dressing up in professional clothing to turn in their college applications to their college counselors. Weinberg was recognized for his leadership in many ways during his time as principal. He was selected for the Cahn Fellowship in 2006.“Deputy Schools Chancellor Farina to Welcome Top Principals Into Teachers College Fellowship Program”, Columbia University Teachers College, 18 June 2006. Retrieved July 16, 2014. The highly selective fellowship is a fifteen-month program from Columbia University Teachers College which recognizes outstanding principals and provides them with opportunities for professional, intellectual, and personal growth. In 2012, Weinberg received the Sloan Public Service Award from the Fund for the City of New York. The award is given to six civil servants each year whose outstanding work to serve the City goes above and beyond the call of duty and upholds the qualities of service, commitment, responsiveness, reliability, risk-taking, adaptability, and dedication to the public interest. Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña acknowledged Weinberg's effective leadership and instructional vision for schools when, in January 2014, she appointed him Deputy Chancellor for Teaching and Learning.

These arms are visible on the monument to Sir John Dodderidge (1555-1628) in the Lady Chapel of Exeter Cathedral, also high above the entrance door of Bremridge, sculpted in stone impaling Pollard At some time the estate of Bremridge became the inheritance of Sir John Doddridge (Doderidge or Dodderidge, etc.) (1555–1628), Justice of the King's Bench in 1612 and Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1589 and for Horsham in 1604.Fuidge, N.M., biography of John Dodderidge, published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1558–1603, ed. P.W. Hasler, 1981 The Dodderidge family had long been prominent merchants in nearby South Molton and later in Barnstaple. He was son of Richard Doddridge, merchant, of Barnstaple. According to the family's historian, Rev. Sidney E. Dodderidge (1882), the family took its name from the estate of Dotheridge (anciently Dudderidge) in the parish of Alwington in North Devon. They were feudal tenants of the Coffin family of Portledge, lords of the manor of Alwington. In 1250 Sir Richard Coffin renewed his grant of Dudderidge to Thomas de Dudderidge, a supposed ancestor of the Dodderidge family.Dodderidge, Rev. Sidney E, p.163 Other sources, most notably John Prince (d.1723)Prince, John, (1643–1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London supposed the family to have originated at the manor of Dodderidge in the parish of Sandford, near Crediton, in Mid- Devon. Richard was the son of a wool merchant and was born in South Molton, in which town he married. With his wife and eight children before 1582 he moved to Holland Street, Barnstaple and served as Mayor of Barnstaple in 1589.Lamplugh, p. 52 A certain John Dodderidge, perhaps a relation, is recorded earlier in 1579 as mayor of Barnstaple.Lamplugh, p. 156 In 1585 he bought a house in Cross Street from his fellow burgess Thomas Skinner, which descended in turn to his sons Sir John and to the latter's brother Pentecost Dodderidge (d. circa 1650), MP for Barnstaple in 1621, 1624 and 1625 and mayor of Barnstaple in 1611, 1627 and 1637.Lamplugh, p.156 This large timber-framed house, known as the \\"Dodderidge House\\" was demolished in about 1900 to make way for a post office, the present large sandstone building with the date \\"1901\\" sculpted on its parapet. A room of ornate carved oak panelling dated 1617 from this house survives in Barnstaple Guildhall, known as the \\"Dodderidge Room\\" and an ornate overmantel displays the date 1617 between the initials \\"PD\\" and \\"ED\\", signifying Pentecost and his wife Elizabeth.Lamplugh, p.134 The room is now used to display the Corporation's silver and the mayor's regalia. Richard entered the shipping business and owned a 100-ton prize-ship named Prudence, a privateer effectively engaged in licensed piracy. She is recorded as having had 80 men on board in 1590, and landed a record prize taken off the Guinea Coast, probably from Spanish galleons from South America, consisting of four chests of gold worth £16,000 with in addition chains of gold and civet-fur. The gold landed at Barnstaple from this voyage weighed 320 lbs. Between June and October 1590 Prudence sent back to Barnstaple two further prizes of unrecorded value and in January 1592 brought in a prize of £10,000. In March 1596 the Privy Council ordered the mayor of Barnstaple to send a ship to challenge two or three Spanish ships in the Irish Sea and the Prudence was selected for this task. She was victualled for five months, for a crew of 40, at a cost exceeding £900, borne by the North Devon population. On 8 August 1596 she returned to Barnstaple, loaded with much pillage taken during the attack on Cadiz conducted by Lords Essex and Howard.Lamplugh, pp.52-54 Richard received at some time letters patent as one of six west country merchants licensed to trade with \\"the River of Senegal and Gambia in Guinea\\".Lamplugh, p.156 Richard presented to the Corporation of Barnstaple \\"a great boale with its covering, wrought in silver and a silver-gilt table lamp\\".Lamplugh, pp.53 Sir John Dodderidge is said by Hoskins (1959) Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.438 to have built a new mansion at Bremridge in 1622. =Pentecost Dodderidge= Sir John Dodderidge's heir was his brother Pentecost Dodderidge (d. circa 1650), MP for Barnstaple in 1621, 1624 and 1625 and mayor of Barnstaple in 1611, 1627 and 1637.Lamplugh, p.156 Pentecost Dodderidge's heir was his son John Dodderidge (1610–1659), MP (see below). Pentecost had several daughters including: *Elizabeth Dodderidge, wife of Richard Crossing (born 1608aet(atis) 12 (aged 12 at the heraldic visitation of 1620 (Vivian, p.255)), son of Thomas Crossing (d.1644) of Exeter (brother of Hugh Crossing, Mayor of Exeter).Vivian, Lt.Col.

It would thus appear that the surviving house at Bremridge, apparently originally part of a larger structure,Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.449 was built by John Dodderidge (1610-1659) as the date \\"1654\\"http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-98938-bremridge-filleigh- devon; Stated incorrectly as \\"1624\\" by Pevsner, p.449 is sculpted on the labels of the Tudor arched front entrance. High above the front door inset into the wall is a stone heraldic displaying the arms of Dodderidge (Argent, two pales wavy azure between nine cross croslets gulesPole gives the blazon alternatively as: Argent crusilly gules, three pallets unde azure (Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.481)) impaling (A chevron sable between three escallops).

The identity of the wife bearing these escallop arms is unclear from surviving records.For example the Heraldic Visitations of Devon (Vivian, 1895, pp.597-9, pedigree of Pollard, pp.392-4, Gay of Goldsworthy) does not list a marriage by a Pollard or Gay into the Dodderidge family John Dodderidge (1610-1659) is known to have married three times but his only son John predeceased him.Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries 1901 His wives included: *Martha Dacres (d.1655), the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.As mentioned in his will *Jane *Judith One of his wives was the daughter of John GurdonCalled his father-in-law in his will of Assington Hall, Sudbury, Suffolk. Dodderidge died in 1659 at Cheshunt at the age of about 49. He bequeathed his library of 112 books to his wife Judith who in turn gave or bequeathed them in 1667 to the town of Barnstaple.Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries 1901 The collection, known as the Dodderidgian Library (Latin: Bibliotheca Doddridgiana) was housed in a purpose-made building erected at the north-east corner of St Peter's Church, Barnstaple, which survives.

Students have votes of equal status in matters of policy, organization, discipline and rules. This 'democracy' extends to the choice of subjects offered.

(1972) “An Evaluation of City School 1971-1972” retrieved 27 July 2014 She wrote: \\"The objectives of City School are: # To provide the basic subject skills based on individual aims. # To encourage involvement by parents and community. # To provide for the exploration of areas of interest not normally available in schools. # To develop individuality in goal setting and in self-concept. # To provide each individual with success. # To develop social concepts in a variety of situations. # To explore the community and become practically involved. # To develop the ability to think.\\" Reid surveyed students and parents on a School Sentiment Index and in her summary, noted, \\"Many students and parents felt that one of the school's greatest handicaps was the inadequacy of its buildings and equipment. The facilities were designed for children at the primary level and are, not surprisingly, unsuitable in some ways for older children.\\"Reid, Marilyn J. (1972) “An Evaluation of City School 1971-1972” retrieved 27 July 2014  First move  After three years the school outgrew these facilities and moved to Vancouver's downtown core. The Sir William Dawson elementary school was designed by Edward Evans Blackmore\\"Blackmore, Edward Evans\\", Biographical dictionary of architects in Canada and built in 1913 at 935 Helmcken Street. It closed in 1972.Hamilton, Val. “Brief history of schools in Vancouver”, retrieved 27 July 2014 Its address in the 1970s was 901 Helmcken Street. City School occupied the main floor and shared the building with Ideal School and a class for new Canadians. By the 1974-75 school year, nearly 200 students were registered in Grades 4 to 12, with one part-time and six full-time teachers.  Using the city as a classroom  With more appropriate facilities - classrooms, seminar rooms, kitchen, art room, darkroom - and proximity to much that was going on downtown and beyond, the school hit its stride and began to pique media interest. Kay Alsop wrote a feature article for The Province newspaper in 1976. \\"It was something new in the way of an alternative school; geared, not to academic dropouts, but to students who found regimentation irksome and stifling. And it's become so flexible in structure that timetables, as such, would be incongruous.\\"Alsop, Kay (6 March 1976). \\"Every Block is Their Blackboard\\", The Province (Vancouver) Students were pictured studying rock formations with a UBC professor, looking at chicken foetuses in a genetics class, and loading the school van for a camping trip. Alsop listed many of the field trips the school had taken in British Columbia's Lower Mainland and beyond: geology road trips to Prince George and Banff, an exchange to Quebec. Early excursions are remembered in a film made on the occasion of a City School reunion in 1996.Alan Etkin, Joshua Berson, City School Productions, Knowledge Network (B.C.), Vancouver Elementary School Teachers Association (Producers), 1996. City School: 25 Years of Alternative Education (Documentary) Vancouver These extended science trips and exchanges began a tradition that has carried on. In ensuing decades, City School groups have taken multiple road trips with a geology focus, to B.C.'s Interior and to Dinosaur Park and Drumheller in Alberta. Exchanges, with the support of Open House Canada (later Exchanges Canada) have taken students to Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories.Thompson, Roxanna (1 June 2007). “Walking in someone else’s shoes”, Northern News Services Online Biology field studies at the Marine Sciences Centre at Bamfield, B.C. have been regular events as have camping trips to various provincial parks (Alice Lake, Porpoise Bay, Golden Ears, Montague Harbour, Newcastle Island). Closer to home, students took advantage of libraries, art galleries, museums, public lectures, law courts, university classes, film festivals, and myriad other resources to learn outside the walls of the school building. This custom continues today.  Move to Strathcona  In 1976 the school board decided to decommission the former Dawson School and move its tenant programs out. The entire block, which had also contained the original King George Secondary School, was later redeveloped as the Wall Centre. Just as Ideal School fought its relocation to classrooms in Lord Byng Secondary, City School parents, students and staff strongly protested their move to a 1940 parish school building in Vancouver's historic Strathcona neighbourhood some three kilometres east of the downtown core. During the Christmas holiday closure in December 1976, the school's belongings were transferred. In January 1977, the students and staff, wearing black armbands, walked from their boarded-up building to their \\"new\\" leased premises in the former Sacred Heart School at 884 East Pender Street. Minor modifications had been made to create a darkroom and kitchen, but the floor plan was essentially a corridor running the length of the building, with classrooms off both sides. The forced move and the struggle that preceded it led to many students and all the teachers leaving City School at the end of that school year. The remaining students and their families were committed to maintaining the school's philosophy and traditions through further staff changes and the prospect of another move.  Return to the downtown core  Declining enrolment in Vancouver's only downtown high school, coupled with a disinclination on the part of the school board to pay rent, led to City School's relocation from Strathcona to the West End. In September 1980 it opened its fourth set of doors, in what had been the cafeteria on the ground floor of King George Secondary, at 1755 Barclay Street. Though smaller than the Sacred Heart building, the physical space had a better layout, and the downtown location was much more popular with students and families. The elementary grades were abandoned at this point, and a long period of stability ensued, with little staff change for a decade. Constraints on the \\"student- centred education\\" model of the early 1970s came, over time, in the form of provincially mandated final exams, and demands for accountability and conformity from district administrators. Schedules and classes became more structured, but opportunities for enrichment always trumped the formal timetable.  An incubator for the arts  City School's high school program attracted a wide variety of young people seeking an alternative to the mainstream school culture. Their reasons for attending were as diverse as their perceptions of what City School was about; some didn't find what they needed there but many more did. From the mid-1970s to the present, City School has nurtured more than its fair share of musicians, writers and visual artists. Alumni were or are to be found performing with bands (Econoline Crush, Uzume Taiko, Slow,Smith, Eric. “Wadda ya gonna do?”, retrieved 26 July 2014 ©/Copyright, Brilliant Orange, Flash Bastard, Power Ballad, The Winks, Nü Sensae, Petroleum By-Product, Thee Ahs, Mary Sweeney, The Bank Dogs, Blue Reef, Rossi Gang) and as independent artists. Embryo writers, poets, journalists, composers, film makers, photographers, painters and glass artists explored and developed – and continue to explore – their talents there.  Another move  Another funding and space crunch mandated a downsizing of City School once again, and it moved to a smaller area within the King George building in 1996. Now almost a \\"one-room schoolhouse,\\" it continued to offer a uniquely personalized school experience to students in their last three years of high school for the next eighteen years.Handley, Gen (14 August 2013) “City School thinks outside the classroom box”, WE (Vancouver) A 40th year reunion was held in May, 2011, and alumni attended from every year of City School's sometimes tenuous existence.  Community fights back against budget cut  Funding for Vancouver public schools has been inadequate for years;Kieltyka, Matt (24 April 2014) “Decades of cuts adding up at B.C. schools: Vancouver School Board” , Metro (Vancouver) City School took its share of cuts and fought successfully against others. Staffing was cut in 2002, and threatened again in 2010. In 2014, strong protest from former students, parents and staff, as well as those about to be most affected by the threatened cut,Peng, Jenny (13 April 2014), “Alumni rally to defend Vancouver alternative school” Vancouver Courier (Vancouver) made no difference to the school board's decision decrease the number of City School's teachers.  Coming full circle  It was clear that the current model would not be sustainable with the new student-teacher ratio. The school community's response was a return to the personalized, inquiry-based education of its founding philosophy: self- designed learning programs, projects, expert mentors, individual in-depth studies, group undertakings using the resources of the greater community of the Lower Mainland, and classes only if necessary.

When fully operational, the power station will have an installed capacity of 2,400 MW. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir is located on Hebei River and the upper reservoir is located in a valley above the north side of the lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Hongping Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. It is operated by Jiangxi Hongping Pumped Storage Ltd.

Originally belonging to an aristocratic Confraternity, it passed on to a confraternity of Ricamatori. The aristocratic confraternity kept a codex that serves as a contemporary annotation of the heraldry of the nobility of the era.Archivio di Stato di Napoli, miniato della Confraternita di Santa Marta.

After the revolution, the Prince of Rocca Filomarino, whose palace was in front, rebuilt the church. A further restoration occurred in 1715.

He was a Bangladeshi military officer who was the Sector Commander of Bangladesh Forces Sector 2 and K-Force Brigade Commander during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Khaled Mosharraf was killed along with two fellow officers after an attempted coup that went futile after a counter-coup.  Background  On August 15, 1975, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated by sundry officers of Bangladesh Army. After the assassination, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad took oath as the President of Bangladesh according to the prescription of the killer officers. They captured the Bangabhaban (president's official residence) and started dictating the President, causing fresh chaos in the new nation. Mosharraf decided to stop the killers residing inside the Bangabhaban and staged a coup d'état among the Bangladesh Army. He declared himself the Chief of Military Staff on November 3, 1975. According to his order the Chief of Military Staff of the Bangladesh Army Major General Ziaur Rahman was put under house arrest. On November 6, Mosharraf was selected as one of the Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators. On November 7, 1975 the soldiers of Bangladesh Army staged a mutiny.  Plot  The plot to kill Mosharraf, as well as some senior officers including Colonel Shafaat Jamil, was a part of the plot to stage the November 7 coup. After the November 3 coup was staged by Mosharraf with the help of Colonel Shafaat Jamil, the Chief of Biplobi Sainik Sanstha (Revolutionary Soldiers' Establishment) Colonel Abu Taher took steps to organize a counter coup to free Major General Ziaur Rahman and establish a classless military in Bangladesh like the People's Liberation Army of China. Abu Taher using his Biplobi Sainik Sanstha started propagating against Mosharraf, Shafaat Jamil, Colonel Nazmul Huda and other November 3 coup leaders as Indian agents. They distributed leaflets to the soldiers agitating them against Mosharraf and their anti-Indian sentiment to prove him as an agent of India. Taher also used the popularity of detained Ziaur Rahman to convince the ordinary soldiers to revolt against the establishment of officers in Bangladesh Army. In addition, the members of Biplobi Sainik Sanstha were thoroughly directed by their leader to shoot down Mosharraf and Jamil at any instant. Jamil, who was serving as the Brigade Commander of 46 Infantry Brigade of Bangladesh Army at Dhaka cantonment came to know about the plot while leaving the cantonment for Bangabhaban after receiving a phone call from Mosharraf at 10 PM on the night of November 6, 1975. The Brigade Major Hafiz and a Junior Commissioned Officer of 1st East Bengal Regiment confirmed him about the deadly plan of Biplobi Sainik Sanstha. Jamil rushed to the Bangabhaban and described the plot to the newly appointed Chief of Staff who was messed up with some political issues. Mosharraf turned a deaf ear and eased the coup.  Events  The assassination of Mosharraf is linked with several events that took place during the night of November 7, 1975. Conspirators from different corners wanted to finish off the freedom fighter that night. Hours before the November 7 mutiny was kicked off Mosharraf was at Bangabhaban. He was arguing with the Chief of Bangladesh Navy and the Chief of Bangladesh Air Force regarding the distribution of power among them under the Martial Law. Jamil was called to solve the issue. When Jamil told Mosharraf about the nascent coup in the cantonment, Mosharraf did not take it seriously and continued his talk with the officers. Mosharraf got a call from the Dhaka Cantonment. He was informed about the mutiny in the cantonment on that call. He left the Bangabhaban without wasting a second along with Colonel Haider and Colonel Huda. He also asked Jamil to stay in the Bangabhaban. Ziaur Rahman was freed minutes after the coup was launched. Rahman was taken to the office of 2nd Field Artillery Regiment. The Chief of Staff asked the soldiers and junior officers to call all the senior officers. He firmly ordered that he wants no further bloodshed. Jamil got a phone call from the Rahman around 3 AM. Rahman asked him to reconcile. When the entire cantonment was celebrating the leader of the abortive coup, Mosharraf and his two fellows were travelling in a car in search of a safe place. They went to the resident of former Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini Chief Colonel Nuruzzaman at 2 AM. They changed their clothes there. While staying at the place Mosharraf heard gunfire. The driver of their car, Amir was panicked and started shouting. Mosharraf discharged the driver and asked Huda to drive the car. Then they went to the house of a relative of Mosharraf. Mosharraf called some individuals using the land phone of his relative. At first he inquired about the situation in 4th East Bengal Regiment to Lieutenant Kamrul who picked up his phone call. Kamrul told him the situation. Later he called Colonel Nawazish Ahmed of 10th East Bengal Regiment. Ahmed assured him of security. After being assured of his security Mosharraf started for the camp of 10th East Bengal Regiment at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. On their way to Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Huda met an accident. They went to a clinic named Fatima Nursing Home of Mohammadpur. Then they walked to the camp of 10th East Bengal Regiment. When they reached the camp, some soldiers of the regiment stopped them and took away their guns. Ahmed informed Rahman about the presence of Mosharraf in his camp. Knowing this, Rahman asked Nawazish to ensure the security of Mosharraf and to protect him from any possible assault. He also urged them not to panic. Then he talked with Major Jalil, another officer of the regiment and directed him to assist Nawazish to save the trio. Colonel Taher, who was in the room with Rahman while he was talking to Colonel Nawazish, went out at some point for almost 15 minutes after he came to know about the exact location of Mosharraf.  Death  Nawazish, after getting assurance of the Chief of Staff, arranged some breakfast for the officers. Just as the three men were being served the breakfast some other men in uniform, probably Taher's Biplobi Sainik Sanstha personnel, rushed into the room, forced the three out at gunpoint, then shot and bayoneted them to death. According to some internal military sources, some of the Biplobi Sainik Sanstha personnel gave the message to kill all three officers to Colonel Asaduzzaman who allegedly led the assassination.

Johnson. He was the editor of Hurst's the Heart, one of the most widely used medical textbooks in the world. He also served as a former president of the American Heart Association. Throughout his career, Hurst was recognized as a leader in cardiology.  Early life and education  John Willis Hurst was the only child of John Hurst and Verna Bell Hurst. He was born in Cooper, Kentucky, a community near Monticello, Kentucky, in Wayne County, Kentucky, on October 21, 1920. In Cooper, Hurst's father owned and operated a general store. Eleven months after he was born, Hurst's family moved to Carrollton, Georgia. In Carrollton, Hurst's father served as the principal of a small, local school. During this time, Hurst's family lived in dormitory style housing on the school's grounds with several other teachers, including his aunt. In 1932, Hurst's father quit teaching in order to assist with the development of the Carrollton Federal Savings and Loan Association. At this time, the family moved to a single family home on Cefar Street. Hurst graduated from Carrollton High School in 1937. He then enrolled at West Georgia College in Carrollton. At West Georgia College he met his future wife Nelie Wiley. After two years, Hurst transferred to the University of Georgia. There, he obtained a Bachelor of Science in zoology and a Bachelor of Science in chemistry. In 1941, Hurst began his studies at the Medical College of Georgia. He graduated first in his class in 1944. He then began his internship and residency at the University Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.  Career  In 1946, after completing his residency, Hurst was drafted into the army and was stationed at Fitzsimons General Hospital near Denver, Colorado. During this time he obtained the rank of captain. His tour of duty in Denver was cut short, however, as Hurst was allowed to return home following the news of an automobile accident that killed his mother-in-law and severely injured his sister-in-law. Then, in 1947 Hurst began working as a fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital. There he met Dr. Paul Dudley White, the Father of American cardiology, who became one of Hurst's most influential mentors. Meeting White prompted Hurst to commit to specializing in cardiology. After completing his fellowship in Massachusetts, Hurst returned to Georgia in 1949 and briefly established a private practice in Atlanta. Then, in 1950, he accepted a job offer at Emory University. In 1954, Hurst was drafted for the second time. He was assigned to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he was appointed Chief of Cardiology. On July 2, 1955, Lyndon B. Johnson, then majority leader of the senate, suffered a heart attack. It was during this incident that Hurst took on the role of Johnson's personal cardiologist. He continued to serve as Johnson's cardiologist until Johnson's death in 1973. Hurst even traveled with Johnson to 15 countries when Johnson served as the vice president during the Kennedy administration. Hurst declined the offer to serve as White House Physician during Johnson's presidency. Hurst was honorably discharged from the military in 1955 and returned to Emory University. There, he resumed teaching and also practiced consultative cardiology. In 1957, Hurst was named the Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Emory, a position he held until 1986. Even after stepping down from the role of chairman, Hurst continued to teach at Emory. In the early 1960s, Hurst assisted with the creation of both the continuing medical education program in cardiology at Emory and the Emory Clinic. Then, in 1991, Hurst was named as a consultant to Emory's Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine. He continued in this role until 2007. During his time at Emory, Hurst taught more than 5,000 residents and 2,500 residents and fellows. Hurst served a term as the president of the American Heart Association and a term as the president of the Association of Professors of Medicine. He was also a member of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Council. He also served as Chairman for the Subspecialty Board of Cardiovascular Disease.  Publications  Throughout his career, Hurst edited over 60 books and published over 350 scientific articles. His works include a children's book and several novels. = Major publications = * An Atlas of Vector Electrocardiography (1952) * Hurst's The Heart (first published 1966, currently in its fourteenth edition) * Four Hats: On Teaching Medicine and Other Essays (1970) * Medicine for the Practicing Physician (first published 1983, currently in its fourth edition) * The Bench and Me: Teaching and Learning Medicine (1992) * Cardiac Puzzles (1995) * The Quest for Excellence: the history of the Department of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, 1834-1986 (1997) * The Heart: The Kids' Question and Answer Book (1998) * Prescription for Greed (2000, cowritten with his son Philip W.

Variety. January 13, 1971. 24. The Wild Country was initially released on January 20, 1971.  Plot  In the late 1880s, Jim and Kate Tanner along with their sons Virgil and Andrew move from Pittsburgh to a farm in Wyoming, where they find the ranch in dilapidated condition. To make matters worse, Jim learns from the trapper Thompson and his Shoshone companion Two Dog that the source of the water for his land runs through property owned by the powerful rancher Ab Cross, meaning Jim is at Ab's mercy. Ab is uncooperative and refuses to stop letting his steers graze on Tanner land. Jim's threat to take Ab to court is met with laughter and Jim is told that there are no laws in their territory. Later, when Ab learns that Jim is trying to contact the marshal in distant Cheyenne, the two men get into a fight in which Jim is injured but Ab gets knocked out. Ab retaliates by ordering his men to close a dam, cutting off the Tanner family's water supply completely. Virgil tries to unplug the dam, and while rescuing his son from Ab's men Jim is shot in the leg. The Tanner ranch is devastated by a cyclone and Kate is determined to move the family back East, but she is persuaded by Jim and Virgil to stay. Soon after, the marshal arrives with a court order that requires Ab to open the dam. That night, as the Tanners are celebrating, they realize that their barn is on fire. As they fight the flames, Ab on horseback shoots Jim, kicks away Kate and turns to shoot Jim again, but he himself is shot dead by Virgil. Ab's men are repentant and promise to rebuild the barn, and the Tanners are finally free to live as ranchers in peace.

Following an uninterrupted presence in the top tier Serie A from 1964 to 1980, the club fell down the divisions and plays in the fifth division amateur Serie C Regionale, Girone B as of the 2014-15 season. For past club sponsorship names see sponsorship names. History Pallacanestro Milano was founded in 1955 by Valentino Milanaccio in order for his son and his friends from the San Gioachimo oratory to play basketball. From 1955 to 1957 it participated in the leagues of the Centro Sportivo Italiano, a christian sporting organisation, winning the national title in 1956. The 1957-58 season saw the club join the Italian basketball federation and play in the Promozione (the fifth of the six divisions that made up the Italian basketball league system at the time). Successive promotions saw it reach the first division Serie A by 1964. 1968–69 All'Onestà Milano, the longest lasting sponsorship in the team's history. Its heyday started in the second part of the 1960s and lasted through the 1970s where the \\"Other Milan\\" played impassioned derbies against the more prestigious Olimpia Milano, with Pallacanestro Milano the only Milan side in the Serie A during the 1976-77 season after Olimpia's relegation. Pallacanestro Milano would stay in the top division until 1980, after which it would be relegated a number of times and progress down the league pyramid, with the national titles conquered by the youth sides a meager consolation. A new ownership from 1998 managed to rebuild the side from a perilous situation (no youth sector after a breakup, only three players affiliated to the club) with three consecutive playoff appearances but without being able to return the side to the national divisions.

Calibration is needed because the atmospheric / ratio, which is a key element in calculating radiocarbon ages, has not been constant historically.Taylor (1987), p. 133. Willard Libby, the inventor of radiocarbon dating, pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that the ratio might have varied over time. Discrepancies began to be noted between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts, and it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates. Uncorrected dates may be stated as \\"radiocarbon years ago\\", abbreviated \\"ya\\". The term Before Present (BP) is established for reporting dates derived from radiocarbon analysis, where \\"present\\" is 1950. Uncorrected dates are stated as \\"uncal BP\\", and calibrated (corrected) dates as \\"cal BP\\". Used alone, the term BP is ambiguous. Construction of a curve The Northern Hemisphere curve from INTCAL13. As of 2017, this is the most recent version of the standard calibration curve. There are separate graphs for the Southern Hemisphere and for the calibration of marine data. To produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely-dated samples is needed, which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. Dendrochronology, or the study of tree rings, led to the first such sequence: tree rings from individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness due to environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. Those factors affect all trees in an area and so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In that way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created in the 1960s by Wesley Ferguson.Taylor (1987), pp. 19-21. Hans Suess used the data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967.Aitken (1990), p. 66-67.Bowman (1995), pp. 16–20.Suess (1970), p. 303. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long-term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter-term variation, often referred to as \\"wiggles\\", with a period of decades. Suess said that he drew the line showing the wiggles by \\"cosmic schwung\\", or freehand. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. The calibration method also assumes that the temporal variation in level is global, such that a small number of samples from a specific year are sufficient for calibration, which was experimentally verified in the 1980s. Over the next 30 years, many calibration curves were published by using a variety of methods and statistical approaches.Bowman (1995), pp. 43–49. They were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2020. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, varves, coral, and other studies. Significant additions to the datasets used for INTCAL13 include non-varved marine foraminifera data, and U-Th dated speleothems. The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect; there is also a separate marine calibration curve. Part of the INTCAL13 calibration curve, showing correct (t1) and incorrect (t2) methods of determining a calendar year range from a calibration curve with a given errorOnce testing has produced a sample age in radiocarbon years with an associated error range of plus or minus one standard deviation (usually written as ±σ), the calibration curve can be used to derive a range of calendar ages for the sample. The calibration curve itself has an associated error term, which can be seen on the graph labelled \\"Calibration error and measurement error\\". This graph shows INTCAL13 data for the calendar years 3100 BP to 3500 BP. The solid line is the INTCAL13 calibration curve, and the dotted lines show the standard error range, as with the sample error, this is one standard deviation. Simply reading off the range of radiocarbon years against the dotted lines, as is shown for sample t2, in red, gives too large a range of calendar years. The error term should be the root of the sum of the squares of the two errors:Aitken (1990), p. 101. :\\\\sigma_{total} = {\\\\bigl( \\\\sigma_{sample}^2 + \\\\sigma_{calib}^2 \\\\bigr)}^{ \\\\frac{1}{2}} Example t1, in green on the graph, shows this procedure—the resulting error term, σtotal, is used for the range, and this range is used to read the result directly from the graph itself without reference to the lines showing the calibration error. Different radiocarbon dates, with similar standard errors, can give widely different resulting calendar year ranges, depending on the shape of the calibration curve at each point. Variations in the calibration curve can lead to very different resulting calendar year ranges for samples with different radiocarbon ages. The graph to the right shows the part of the INTCAL13 calibration curve from 1000 BP to 1400 BP, a range in which there are significant departures from a linear relationship between radiocarbon age and calendar age. In places where the calibration curve is steep, and does not change direction, as in example t1 in blue on the graph to the right, the resulting calendar year range is quite narrow. Where the curve varies significantly both up and down, a single radiocarbon date range may produce two or more separate calendar year ranges. Example t2, in red on the graph, shows this situation: a radiocarbon age range of about 1260 BP to 1280 BP converts to three separate ranges between about 1190 BP and 1260 BP. A third possibility is that the curve is flat for some range of calendar dates; in this case, illustrated by t3, in green on the graph, a range of about 30 radiocarbon years, from 1180 BP to 1210 BP, results in a calendar year range of about a century, from 1080 BP to 1180 BP. Probabilistic methods The method of deriving a calendar year range described above depends solely on the position of the intercepts on the graph. These are taken to be the boundaries of the 68% confidence range, or one standard deviation. However, this method does not make use of the assumption that the original radiocarbon age range is a normally distributed variable: not all dates in the radiocarbon age range are equally likely, and so not all dates in the resulting calendar year age are equally likely. Deriving a calendar year range by means of intercepts does not take this into account. The output of CALIB for input values of 1260-1280 BP, using the northern hemisphere INTCAL13 curveThe alternative is to take the original normal distribution of radiocarbon age ranges and use it to generate a histogram showing the relative probabilities for calendar ages. This has to be done by numerical methods rather than by a formula because the calibration curve is not describable as a formula. Programs to perform these calculations include OxCal and CALIB. These can be accessed online; they allow the user to enter a date range at one standard deviation confidence for the radiocarbon ages, select a calibration curve, and produce probabilistic output both as tabular data and in graphical form. In the example CALIB output shown at left, the input data is 1270 BP, with a standard deviation of 10 radiocarbon years. The curve selected is the northern hemisphere INTCAL13 curve, part of which is shown in the output; the vertical width of the curve corresponds to the width of the standard error in the calibration curve at that point. A normal distribution is shown at left; this is the input data, in radiocarbon years. The central darker part of the normal curve is the range within one standard deviation of the mean; the lighter grey area shows the range within two standard deviations of the mean. The output is along the bottom axis; it is a trimodal graph, with peaks at around 710 AD, 740 AD, and 760 AD. Again, the ranges within the 1σ confidence range are in dark grey, and the ranges within the 2σ confidence range are in light grey. This output can be compared with the output of the intercept method in the graph above for the same radiocarbon date range. For a set of samples with a known sequence and separation in time such as a sequence of tree rings, the samples' radiocarbon ages form a small subset of the calibration curve. The resulting curve can then be matched to the actual calibration curve by identifying where, in the range suggested by the radiocarbon dates, the wiggles in the calibration curve best match the wiggles in the curve of sample dates. This \\"wiggle-matching\\" technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. Since the data points on the calibration curve are five years or more apart, and since at least five points are required for a match, there must be at least a 25-year span of tree ring (or similar) data for this match to be possible. Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce.Aitken (1990), pp. 103−105. The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified tephra sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314 AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching.Walker (2005), pp. 207−209. When several radiocarbon dates are obtained for samples which are known or suspected to be from the same object, it may be possible to combine the measurements to get a more accurate date. Unless the samples are definitely of the same age (for example, if they were both physically taken from a single item) a statistical test must be applied to determine if the dates do derive from the same object. This is done by calculating a combined error term for the radiocarbon dates for the samples in question, and then calculating a pooled mean age. It is then possible to apply a T test to determine if the samples have the same true mean. Once this is done the error for the pooled mean age can be calculated, giving a final answer of a single date and range, with a narrower probability distribution (i.e., greater accuracy) as a result of the combined measurements.Gillespie (1986), pp. 30−32. Bayesian statistical techniques can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated. For example, if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a given stratigraphic sequence, Bayesian analysis can help determine if some of the dates should be discarded as anomalies, and can use the information to improve the output probability distributions.Walker (2005), pp. 35−37.

History  = Previous Wild Mouse Rides at Lagoon = Wild Mouse opened as a wooden roller coaster in 1965 after being relocated from the Seattle World's Fair. After operating in its location in Lagoon's North Midway, it was eventually retired in 1971. In 1973, the Wild Mouse roller coaster returned to Lagoon as \\"The New Wilder Wild Mouse.\\" The new version of the ride was located at the South Midway, in the same location where the current Wild Mouse operates. Since this ride featured the same layout and look of the previous Wild Mouse, it's assumed this is the same ride installed in 1965. This version of the ride operated until 1989, when Lagoon decided to retire the Wild Mouse again. A common myth among local Utah residents is that one of these Wild Mouse coasters has had one or more severe accidents causing injury or death. However, there has been no verifiable evidence to conclude there has ever been a major incident on any Wild Mouse ride at Lagoon. = Current Wild Mouse Ride = In 1998, Wild Mouse returned as a steel roller coaster. This version featured a similar layout to the original and was built in the same location as the 1973 version but is an all new ride built by Maurer Söhne. In the ride's first two seasons, there was no themed tunnel (decorated to look like a house) on the ride. This element was added beginning with the 2000 season.  Layout  Like many other Wild Mouse roller coasters manufactured by Maurer Söhne, Wild Mouse features a layout that weaves in and out of itself with several hairpin turns and stiff brakes until riders reach the station again to complete the circuit. Wild Mouse originally had a purple and yellow color scheme, but it was repainted green and yellow for the 2013 season. Cars are painted to look like cats or mice to fit the theme of the ride.

The mission of the Sports Backers has expanded from its beginnings as a traditional sports commission for economic development to be focused on increasing physical activity to improve the health of area residents. The Sports Backers created Movement Makers, a national active living conference to encourage community health organizations that promote physical activity to have a place to gather and learn from each other. The annual event takes place in Richmond, Virginia and occurs at the same time as Dominion Riverrock. The Sports Backers own Dominion Riverrock, the largest outdoor sports and music festival in the country, the Ukrop's Monument Avenue 10k, the 8th largest running race in the United States, and the Anthem Richmond Marathon, the 18th largest marathon in the country. The organization owns and produces 15 events. The organization also supports other organizations with more than 24 major sports tourism events in the Richmond region receiving annual support through marketing grants, operational assistance and loaning equipment. Sports Backers was named the Member of the Year by the National Association of Sports Commissions in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015. Jon Lugbill is the organization's executive director and has been leading the organization since 1993. The Sports Backers training teams provide local residents a way to prepare for local road races. The Sports Backers Marathon, Half Marathon and 8k training teams prepared runners for the three races of the Anthem Richmond Marathon. Active RVA The Sports Backers added a number of programs in 2012 under the shared moniker of Active RVA, a region-wide initiative to motivate area residents, businesses and local governments to make physical activity a personal and regional priority. The organization has started a program to certify schools and businesses that go above and beyond to increase physical activity for their students and employees. Another program encourages the use of stairs through a stairwell signage initiative. A fitness oasis program exists to increase fitness opportunities in underserved parts of the region. The success of the Active RVA program is being measured through a combination of community indicators that has resulted in the region receiving a \\"C\\" grade for its overall fitness programs. Bike Walk RVA The Active RVA effort includes Bike Walk RVA, a program of the Sports Backers to support bike and pedestrian friendly policies, programs and infrastructure projects. The Sports Backers work with area leaders and public works staff to fund and install bike lanes, trails and sidewalks. The strength of the program is based on 40,000 individuals from around the region that are part of the Bike Walk RVA advocacy database. These advocates send e-mails, show up at public hearings, write letters and organize support for biking and pedestrian improvements in their neighborhoods. The Sports Backers measure the success of the Bike Walk RVA program by measuring the total miles of bike lanes, paved trails and dirt trails added each year. In 2012 the Sports Backers staff rode, ran or walked every mile of existing bike lanes and trails (paved and dirt) in the Richmond region. The resulting baseline report provides the starting point for the region's bike infrastructure. Kids Run RVA Each year, thousands of area youth participate in the Sports Backers' Kids Run RVA program which includes a variety of ways to support and reward youth athletic achievement. In 2014, there were 10,000 youth that took part in the Kids Challenge running and walking incentive program at elementary schools throughout the Richmond region. Another program, the Healthy School Challenge rewarded middle and high school students for participating in the Ukrop's Monument Avenue 10k. A particular emphasis is placed on outreach to underserved schools by offering grants and support to encourage participation in specific programs. Scholarship program The Sports Backers have been providing scholarships to area student athletes since 1992. Since the start of the scholarship program, Sports Backers have given over $660,000 to more than 395 student athletes. In 2014, the organization provided $65,000 in scholarship funds to area student athletes. The organization also provides recognition and financial awards for the top high school athletic teams and the \\"comeback athletes\\" of the year.

Life Born at Dun, Angus, on 26 December 1837, he was youngest son of Alexander Japp, a carpenter, by his wife Agnes Hay. After his father's early death, the mother and her family moved to Montrose, where he was educated at Milne's school. At seventeen Japp became a book-keeper with Messrs. Christie and Sons, tailors, at Edinburgh. Three years later he moved to London, and for two years was employed in the East India department of Smith, Elder and Co. Returning to Scotland in poor health, he worked for Messrs. Grieve and Oliver, Edinburgh hatters, and in his leisure in 1860–1 attended classes at the university in metaphysics, logic, and moral philosophy. He became a double prizeman in rhetoric, and received from Professor William Edmondstoune Aytoun a special certificate of distinction; but he did not graduate. At Edinburgh Japp associated with young artists, including John Pettie and his friends. Turning to journalism, he edited the Inverness Courier and the Montrose Review. Having settled in London in 1864, he joined for a short time the Daily Telegraph. While writing for other papers, he acted as general literary adviser to the publishing firm of Alexander Strahan (later William Isbister &Co.;), and assisted in editing their periodicals: Good Words, Sunday Magazine (from 1869 to 1879), and The Contemporary Review from 1866 to 1872, while Henry Alford was editor. He also assisted Robert Carruthers in the third edition of Chambers's Cyclopædia of English Literature. In October 1880, Japp started as a publisher, under the style Marshall Japp and Co., at 17 Holborn Viaduct; but bad health and insufficient capital led him to make the venture over to T. Fisher Unwin in 1882. From that year to 1888 he was literary adviser to the firm of Hurst and Blackett. From 1884 till 1900 he lived at Elmstead, near Colchester, where he cultivated his taste for natural history. After three years in London he finally settled at Coulsdon, Surrey, in September 1903. There, busy to the last, he died on 29 Sept. 1905, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery. He was made LL.D. of Glasgow University in 1879, and in 1880 was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Relationship with Stevenson Japp's interest in Henry Thoreau brought him the acquaintance of Robert Louis Stevenson. The two men met at Braemar in August 1881, and Japp's conversation attracted Stevenson and his father. Stevenson read to Japp the early chapters of Treasure Island, then called The Sea Cook, and Japp negotiated its publication in Young Folks. Subsequently Stevenson and Japp corresponded on intimate terms; and Japp's last work, Robert Louis Stevenson: a Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (1905), was the result of their contacts. Works Japp was versatile and prolific writer, writing under pseudonyms such as \\"H. A. Page\\", \\"A. F. Scot\\", \\"E. Conder Gray\\", and \\"A. N. Mount Rose\\" as well as in his own name. In his own name he issued in 1865 Three Great Teachers of our own Time: Carlyle, Tennyson, and Ruskin, which Ruskin found perceptive. He issued a selection of Thomas de Quincey's Posthumous Works (vol. i. 1891; vol. ii. 1893) and De Quincey Memorials: being Letters and other Records here first published (1891). As \\"H. A. Page\\" he published: * The Memoir of Nathaniel Hawthorne (1872; with several uncollected contributions to American periodicals); * an analytical Study of Thoreau (1878); and * his major work, De Quincey: his Life and Writings, with Unpublished Correspondence (supplied by De Quincey's daughters) (2 vols. 1877; 2nd edit. 1879, revised edit. in one vol. 1890). Japp tried many genres. Under a double pseudonym he issued in 1878 Lights on the Way (by \\"the late J. H. Alexander, B.A.\\", with explanatory note by \\"H. A. Page\\"), which was semi-autobiographical fiction. There followed: * German Life and Literature (1880; studies of Lessing, Goethe, Moses Mendelssohn, Herder, Novalis, and other writers); * Hours in my Garden, and Other Nature-Sketches (1893) * three volumes of verse: The Circle of the Year: a Sonnet Sequence with Proem and Envoi (privately printed, 1893); * Dramatic Pictures, English Rispetti, Sonnets and other Verses (1894); * Adam and Lilith: a Poem in Four Parts (1899; by \\"A. F. Scot\\"); * Animal Anecdotes arranged on a New Principle (by \\"H. A. Page\\") (1887); it attempted to show that the faculties of certain animals differ in degree rather than in kind from those of men; * Offering and Sacrifice: an Essay in Comparative Customs and Religious Development by \\"A. F. Scot\\" (1899); * Some Heresies in Ethnology and Anthropology dealt with under his own name (1899); * More Loose Links in the Darwinian Armour (1900); * Our Common Cuckoo and Other Cuckoos and Parasitical Birds (1899), a criticism of the Darwinian view of parasitism; and * Darwin Considered Mainly as Ethical Thinker (1901), criticism of the hypothesis of natural selection. Family Japp married twice: # in 1863 Elizabeth Paul Falconer (died 1888), daughter of John Falconer of Laurencekirk in Kincardineshire; # Eliza Love, of Scottish descent. There were seven children of the first marriage.

In this context, following Fischer (2007)Fischer, T. B. (2007). Theory and Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London. SEA may be seen as: *a structured, rigorous, participative, open and transparent environmental impact assessment (EIA) based process, applied particularly to plans and programmes, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies, *a participative, open and transparent, possibly non-EIA-based process, applied in a more flexible manner to policies, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies,Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461 *a flexible non-EIA based process, applied to legislative proposals and other policies, plans and programmes in political/cabinet decision-making. Effective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making. SEA is an evidence-based instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention. History The European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments (85/337/EEC, known as the EIA Directive) only applied to certain projects. This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel). The concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department published the Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook. In Europe the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context the so-called Espoo Convention laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment. The European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC required that all member states of the European Union should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004. Countries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive. Relationship with environmental impact assessment For the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen. Aims and structure The SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is. The structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases: * \\"Screening\\", investigation of whether the plan or programme falls under the SEA legislation, * \\"Scoping\\", defining the boundaries of investigation, assessment and assumptions required, * \\"Documentation of the state of the environment\\", effectively a baseline on which to base judgments, * \\"Determination of the likely (non-marginal) environmental impacts\\", usually in terms of Direction of Change rather than firm figures, * Informing and consulting the public, * Influencing \\"Decision taking\\" based on the assessment and, * Monitoring of the effects of plans and programmes after their implementation. The EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of sustainability. SEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called Strategic Impact Assessment. In the European Union SEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive). The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs. =United Kingdom= SEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term 'sustainability', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider Sustainability Appraisal (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood. The United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, A Better Quality of Life (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are: *social progress which recognises the needs of everyone *effective protection of the environment *prudent use of natural resources *maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. These headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program. Internationally =The pan-European region= The Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment was negotiated by the member States of the UNECE (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all UN Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments. =New Zealand= SEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of Environmental impact assessment. The Resource Management Act 1991 has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects. =The OECD DAC – SEA in development co-operation= Development assistance is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options. The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed guidance on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.

In 1959 she was a founding member of the Orkney Field Club and was its President from 1993 until her death.  Scientific career  She explored the diverse habitats of the 39 islands of Orkney to record its flora, both flowering, and non-flowering plants such as ferns. There are around 500 native plants and a further 200 have been introduced. She recorded not only species but hybrids and over more than half a century built up an unrivaled knowledge and record of Orcadian plant life. At times she travelled in a Robin Reliant three-wheeler which she had modified to so that it could act as a tent. She also made field records in the adjacent mainland region of Caithness to compare island and mainland. Her records, revisiting the same site over many years have provided the data to assess the impact of changes in land management and climate. She also campaigned for a repository for biological records of Orkney and was eventually successful when the Orkney Biodiversity Records Centre was founded. Her work inspired visiting academics, students and teachers over decades. She was the Official Recorder of Orkney for the Botanical Society of the British Isles for 46 years (1963–2009), resigning this role when she was 93 years old. Her scientific publications of papers, treatises and book chapters included work on the Scottish primrose (Primula scotica), endemic to Orkney and the north coast of Scotland. Her checklist of the flowering plants and ferns of Orkney, published in 1972 and subsequently up-dated, is the essential reference for the island's flora.  Personal life  From the age of 10, Elaine Bullard was interested in identifying plants. However, she was entirely a self-taught botanist. She moved to Orkney in 1946 as a milk recorder employed by the Milk Marketing Board. In 1960 she gave up this employment to concentrate on recording the plants of Orkney.

The oldest part is an open hall house dating from the 13th or 14th century, built in sandstone with a Welsh slate roof. It is the only known domestic open hall in County Durham. In the 17th century the hall was extended to form a Jacobean manor house; then in the 18th century a large brick Georgian house was appended to the 17th-century wing, making up a house of 11 bays in all. It is surrounded by English country style gardens. History Inside the medieval hall The Manor of Sydgate was granted in 1217 to Aimery, son of the then Archdeacon of Durham, from whose family it passed to Peter del Croke, after whom it is named. From him it passed to the Billingham family, who occupied the hall for some 300 years. In 1657 it passed to the Mickletons until it was bought in 1736 by the Hoppers of Shincliffe. Since then there have been a succession of different owners until it was bought in a semi-derelict condition by the Cassels in 1928. The building is reputedly haunted by the \\"White Lady\\" and is open to the public throughout most of the year. In 1995, the property was bought by Keith and Maggie Bell who open the hall and gardens to the public until June 2020 when it was reported that the reporting that the business was about to go into liquidation and the Hall and Gardens would be sold after the effects of the 2020 covid 19 lockdown on the tourist attraction/ The Hall and Gardens had become a major wedding venue, and visitors from around the world come to wander around the gardens as well as the Hall. The gardens are seen as one of the best in the north of the country. Keith Bell wrote a book in 2017 called Blood, Sweat and Scones – two decades at Crook Hall (). In it he describes their period of ownership, and the trials and tribulations of owning a Grade-One listed building and creating a successful business/tourist attraction.

It was first identified in 1966 at the Mayo Clinic, by A.G. Engel, and that same year W.K. Engel and J.S. Resnick noted another case that they elaborated in 1975. The diagnosis of the disease rests on subacutely evolving weakness after age 40, normal to low CK level, a myopathic EMG with fibrillations, and often a monoclonal gammopathy. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualizing rods in cryosections on light and electron microscopy. The associated monoclonal gammopathy has an unfavorable prognosis. Presentation Weakness in a limb-girdle distribution, hips and shoulders, after age 40 is generally the first symptom. Sometimes the weakness is predominantly distal. Head drop may also be a presenting symptom. Dysphagia may occur, as can respiratory insufficiency.  Pathophysiology  The etiology is unknown. Some cases of SLONM have been comorbid with HIV infection, and others with immune disorders, and so both a viral trigger and an autoimmune disorder have been considered candidate etiologies. The monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) associated with a worse prognosis also argues for an immune disorder. On electron microscopy, nemaline bodies within the affected muscle fibers may be found. These bodies are sometimes crisply rod-shaped, but can also be irregular and punctate. The rods may be found alongside atrophic muscle fibers, and may be seen arising from the thickened Z-discs of the sarcolemmae. Affected fibers may be vacuolated or lobulated.  Diagnosis  The myopathic EMG demonstrates fibrillation potentials. The serum CK level will be normal or low normal. The muscle biopsy will demonstrate the nemaline rods, but as they are less than 1 µm in length they are easily overlooked. The sections must be trichromatically stained and sectioned at a thickness of 2 to 4 µm for effective visualization. Immunostains for myotilin and α-actinin all but clinch the diagnosis. However, nemaline rods may still be visible post-mortem in neurosarcoidosis, which may remain on the differential. Generally the outcome is grim, with respiratory insufficiency the cause of death.  Treatment  Rehabilitation for muscle strengthening can be useful in alleviating symptoms. Improvement has been noted in two HIV-negative individuals treated with immunoglobulin (IViG) agents. Improvement has also been noted with autologous stem cell transplantation, and chemotherapy with melphalan.

It's the love of water when it wants to slake mans’ thirst and shed her scent in the bleached fields by the hawthorn flower. It is love of water, the memory that brings life to bodies that brings life to clouds that brings life to jungles (…) Pablo Guerrero (from The Love of Water)  Biography and Artistic Production  =1946-1968= Pablo Guerrero was born into an agricultural family of small landowners on 18 October 1946 in Esparragosa de Lares in the province of Badajoz. He attended public school, \\"Virgen de la Cueva\\", in his village. As a child, he was especially fond of reading – especially poetry. After finishing high school in Badajoz, he studied Teaching in Sigüenza (Guadalajara) where he continued to expand his literary knowledge. At the age of 16, he was given his first guitar as a gift and began playing music with an amateur group from his school, including songs by two popular groups, Los Bravos and Los Brincos. He also played songs by popular singers from various nationalities such as Georges Moustaki, Jorge Cafrune, Joan Baez, Massiel, the Dynamic Duo, and others. He went to Madrid to study liberal arts, specifically Literature, while at about the same time, he began to sing, but without any professional intentions, but continued to train as a musician by attending private classes. His poetic interests continued to develop with readings by Pablo Neruda, Blas de Otero, Luis Cernuda, José Ángel Valente and José Agustín Goytisolo during 1969-1978. =1969-1978= In 1969 he took his first steps as a professional into the music world when he presented himself at the Benidorm Festival with the song Amapolas y Espigas (trans: Poppies and Wheat Spikes [espiga: wheat still on the stalk]), winning first prize for best lyrics and second prize overall. This opened doors into the record industry for him thanks to and guided by Manolo Diaz, who had just founded the Action label, which had recorded the groups, Aguaviva, and Vainica Doble. He recorded a single with arrangements by Ramón Farrán. On the A-side, Amapolas y Espigas (of which María Dolores Pradera would later incorporate into her repertoire), and on the B-side, Carro y Camino. Pablo Guerrero's voice is distinctive with his marked regional accent in these first single albums. In his early days as a singer, Pablo Guerrero dedicated himself to researching Extremadura folklore. Shortly thereafter, he began to write his own lyrics such as the song Amapolas y Espigas (Poppies and Wheat Spikes). After his small success in Benidorm, he had to combine his career as a singer with teaching, apart from his studies of Philosophy and Letters (Hispanic Philology and Hispanic Literature). His second single, arranged by Carlos Montero, further accentuated the rural character of his compositions: Son Hombres Que Se Mueren Sin Haber Visto La Mar (Tr: They are Men Who Have Died Without Having Seen the Sea) and Por una calle de Cáceres (A Street in Cáceres). His next had the same musical group and continued the countryside theme in the songs; Junto al Guadiana (Next to the Guadiana) and Al Pasar Po'l Arroyo (Passing by the Stream), with lyrics by the poet Luis Chamizo. In his fourth single, there is an important change in the arrangements of Benito Lauret who used a large orchestra and choirs. The orchestrated songs are: Y Los Demás Se Fueron (And the Others Left) and Pequeño Propietario (Small Landowner), which can be considered as Pablo Guerrero's first social protest song. Pablo Guerrero set Miguel Hernández’s (who was imprisoned and executed by Francoists) poems to music on a record that was to be called Tierra, but censorship of the time (during the Francoist Spain era) did not allow him to record it. (Later, however, Serrat sang Hernández’s poems in a separate production.) During the backdrop of the Spanish cultural scene (La Movida) during the late-sixties and early-seventies, he admired the works of Joan Manuel Serrat, Luis Eduardo Aute, Lluís Llach, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, and others such as the Portuguese Amália Rodrigues and José Afonso, the French-born in Alexandria Georges Moustaki, the Belgian Jacques Brel, and South Americans Daniel Viglietti and Jorge Cafrune. He liked the Anglo-Saxon pop-rock of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the lyrics of Lou Reed. In 1970 Pablo Guerrero collaborated as a singer in the recording of the album La Cantata del Exilio: ¿Cuándo llegaremos a Sevilla? (Tr: Song of the Exile: When Will We Arrive in Seville?) The lyrics were written by Antonio Gómez – a professional journalist and the ideological leader of the group, Canción del Pueblo, with music by Antonio Resines, a folk-rock singer. Pablo, with his distinctive voice, sings Dulce Muchacha. Apart from Antonio Resines on guitar, voices Teresa Cano, Elisa Serna, Luis Pastor, Quintín Cabrera, and the music journalist Carlos Tena also collaborated, with arrangements by Malasaña with Luis Mendo on guitar. The album was not published until 1978, however. In 1972, Pablo Guerrero recorded his first LP, A Cántaros. The song of the same name had a quite long subtitle (\\"Tú y yo, muchacha, estamos hechos de nubes\\") and quickly became one of the most important songs (Span:\\"hymnos\\") of freedom and liberty of the time. A Cántaros was Guerrero's first album with an urban theme. There were also changes in the musicians for this album. One was the guitarist and arranger Nacho Sáenz de Tejada (ex-member of Nuestro Pequeño Mundo), who left aside previous orchestral embellishments and used Spanish acoustic guitars and electric guitar on two tracks. Juan Alberto Arteche, another member of Nuestro Pequeño Mundo played percussion, and Pablo Guerrero played guitars and percussions. The album was completed with the musicians José González on the organ and piano, José Maria Panizo on bass, Alex Kirschner on flute with Sáenz de Tejada, Quintanilla on violoncello and Carmen Sarabia's choirs. Both José Maria Panizo and Carmen Sarabia belonged to the mythical group, Aguaviva. This album, A Cántaros, shows the influence of American folk musicians: Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Bob Dylan, and especially the Canadian writer and songwriter, Leonard Cohen, who left a deep mark on Guerrero's entire musical career. On 2 March 1975 he recorded a live album at the Olympia Theatre in Paris entitled, Pablo Guerrero at the Olympia. The record would be released by Movieplay's Gong label. On it, Pablo Guerrero sings and plays the Spanish guitar, and the performance is accompanied by the guitar of Nacho Sáenz de Tejada and the double bass of Miguel Ángel Chastang. On the album he reviews some songs from previous albums, such as Buscándonos, Hoy Que Te Amo, and the popular A Cántaros, and others not included on his other albums such as Busca La Gente de Mañana, Ecos de Sociedad and Emigrante, along with two acapella songs, a work song called Trilla, and Extremadura, dedicated to his homeland. It was one of Pablo Guerrero's best-selling albums during the 1970s. After Olympia, Guerrero performed in the Ducal Palace in Venice, Italy. He also performed in Germany. Afterward, he traveled throughout Spain with his particular folk- style that characterized him during the seventies. In February 1976, he recorded the album Porque Amamos El Fuego (Tr: Why We Love The Fire) for Movieplay, a collaborative arrangement that was produced by Gonzalo García Pelayo. Musically this album makes an approach to jazz while based on the popular music of his native Extremadura. It features musicians Nacho Sáenz de Tejada and Jean Pierre Torlois on acoustic and electric guitars, jazz musicians Miguel Ángel Chastang and Antonio Perucho on double-bass and electric bass, and drums and percussion, respectively, and Antonio Pascual on keyboards. A very young Jorge Pardo collaborated with the flute and tenor sax and Antonio Fernández played the acoustic guitar in No Estés Así (Don’t Be Like That). In this album, he put the poem \\"Por Debajo Del Agua\\" by José Ángel Valente to music and paid tribute to the Cadiz poet Rafael Alberti in the song Ven Alberti. The musical score in Teo is composed by the singer-songwriters and arrangers, Hilario Camacho and P. Guerrero. Even though the characters that populate Guerrero's songs are usually poor and marginal while love, freedom, and hope are present throughout the album. Special mention should be made of the songs Un Rincón De Sol En La Cabeza dedicated to the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1975, in Portugal and the love song Dulce Muchacha Triste (Sweet Sad Little Girl) which still continues today in the Extremaduran singer's repertoire. In December 1977, he recorded the studio album A Tapar La Calle for the label Gong (Movieplay), produced by Gonzalo García Pelayo, and released in 1978. The song, A Tapar La Calle, which gave the album its name, was originally a popular song from Extremadura which Pablo Guerrero transformed into a festive demand for freedom and a reminder of the tenth anniversary of the French May 1968. From the musical point of view, the album A Tapar La Calle is an approach towards flamenco from the popular roots of Extremadura in that the guitar arpeggios derive from flamenco, but the harmonies, on the other hand, are of Extremaduran roots. In this totally acoustic album, the flamenco guitarist Miguel de Córdoba exerts a certain influence. The musical arrangements of the album are collective. The musicians for the album, A Tapar La Calle, were the following: Miguel de Córdoba: flamenco guitar; Nacho Sáenz de Tejada: flamenco guitar y mandolin; Juan Alberto Arteche: buzuki y mandolin; Miguel Ángel Chastang: contrabass; and Javier Estrella: percussion. Thematically it is a quite varied album, but undoubtedly his most politically and socially committed album. Although it is an album with some songs of social protest and vindication, Guerrero avoids political “pamphleteering” by using symbolic language approaching poetry, because during 1978, Spain was experiencing socially unsettled times and freedom and democracy were not yet fully established in all the pre- constitutional Spanish institutions or within society. (The Constitution would be approved in December, 1978.) Protest songs are: Paraiso Ahora, A Tapar La Calle and Predicción De La Fiesta. Renewed love is found in Enredado Entre Tu Pelo, Ronda Del Anillo Dentro Del Agua, Una Tarde (lyrics by José Domínguez) and Si Volvieras Otra Vez, as well as a song that summarizes the history of the closed and isolated Spain of the past, and as a song to Europe and to progress: Canción Ritual Que Habla de España, among others.

These modified muscle cars have been developed to function as well as, or to surpass, the capabilities of the foremost modern performance vehicles. Pro-Touring cars are built with an emphasis on function and are intended to be driven. Whether they are driven on the street, the race track, the drag strip, or through cones at an auto-cross is of no difference. Regardless of the location, pro-touring cars are destined to be driven. History Credit for coining the term ‘Pro-Touring' itself to define the emerging genre is widely attributed to Mark Stielow, GM Program Engineering Manager, and Car Craft magazine’s Tech Editor Jeff Smith, who was heading up Chevy High Performance magazine at the time. Mark Stielow can also take credit for helping grow the new concept through his own projects such as the white 1969 Chevrolet Camaro known as Tri-Tip that competed in the One Lap of America in 1993. The Camaro was widely covered and created a surge in interest, and once the term was put in print, it stuck. Since that time, Stielow has built a number of trailblazing Chevrolet Camaros with names like \\"The Mule,\\" \\"Red Devil\\" and \\"Mayhem,\\" many of which have graced the covers of some of the industry's most beloved publications, including Hot Rod magazine, Car Craft magazine, and Popular Hot Rodding magazine, further fueling the pro- touring trend. Car Platforms & Models There is no rule that says pro- touring machines have to be built from any particular car platform or car model. Historically, however, pony cars are the most popular type used. The perennial favorite model is the Chevrolet Camaro with, typically, the Chevrolet Camaro (first generation) cars being the preferred choice for builders, with the Chevrolet Camaro (second generation) reaching new levels of popularity these days. Other cars known to have been used are the Ford Mustang and the De Tomaso Pantera.

Its purpose is to provide a forum for dissemination of new ideas and information related to the field of laboratory hematology. History In 1984 Dr Berend Houwen began to organize meetings which brought together scientists, manufacturers, clinicians, and regulatory representatives to exchange ideas on technical innovations in laboratory hematology. The first meeting was held in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The success of these meetings led to the formation of ISLH in 1992. At the time of incorporation, members of the society decided that a new journal be started to provide a forum for publication of research and review articles in the broadening arena of laboratory hematology. In 2003 this journal, Laboratory Hematology, began to be officially indexed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information,.\\"International journal of laboratory hematology\\", NCBI NLM Catalog.

S. Forester, particularly Hornblower and the Hotspur. It was released on 5 January 2003, nearly four years after the first four films and nine months after the next two films. The series received four nominations for the 2004 56th Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie, Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special and Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or Movie, although it is not clear whether they were for Loyalty or Duty (which was broadcast one day after Loyalty) or both.

Near the end of the fighting, a cutter is spotted sailing towards Hotspur, with news that the war with France is over. The peace lasts a year and the sailors and officers of the Royal Navy languish on half pay. Meanwhile, Napoleon is making plans across the Channel. In Portsmouth, Hornblower's promotion to commander was not confirmed, nor does he have a navy posting. As a result, he has to pawn many of his possessions to survive during the peace. By chance, he runs into Lieutenant Bush, also on half pay. Later that night, Hornblower takes Bush to an exclusive establishment, where he plays whist with Admiral Edward Pellew, Captain Hammond, and Hammond's nephew Jack, who aspires to serve under Hornblower. Hornblower's whist winnings are enough to pay the rent he owes to his landlady, Mrs. Mason; Mrs. Mason's daughter Maria is attracted to him. Later, Pellew gives Hornblower command of HMS Hotspur and orders to sail to Brest to spy on Napoleon and take a Frenchman, Major Côtard, to a secret rendezvous with a trusted friend in France. Bush, Hornblower's first lieutenant, signs on a crew for Hotspur, including Boatswain Matthews, Irishman Wolfe, and Boatswain's Mate Styles. Jack Hammond also comes aboard, as a midshipman, though his eagerness is overshadowed by his apparent ineptitude and cowardice. Off Brest, Hotspur spots a semaphore telegraph reporting their presence. There is a tense moment when a much more powerful French frigate, Loire, sails toward Hotspur. Fortunately, war has not broken out (without Hornblower's knowledge), and the two ships merely exchange salutes. But there is no sign of Major Côtard's contact, and it is very suspicious that Loire just happens to be at the rendezvous point. Hornblower and Côtard reconnoitre, disguised as fishermen. They discover an encamped French invasion force. Spotted, they are forced to flee. Loire returns, this time to fight, but Hornblower manages to outfox and disable the enemy ship before returning to England to warn Pellew. The British fleet arrives off Brest and Admiral Pellew makes plans to attack the French fort based on Hornblower's report: the French fleet is anchored in the outer harbor, protected by a shore battery. Since all British movements are immediately reported by a semaphore, Pellew assigns Hornblower to destroy it, while Captain Hammond will lead a party of Marines to take the shore battery. These two actions will enable Pellew to launch a pre-emptive strike on the French fleet. As Hornblower heads toward the semaphore, Wolfe, one of his men, slips away. After Hornblower completes his mission, he and his party are captured by French troops. Wolfe is revealed to be a traitor, working to liberate Ireland from Britain with French support. Wolfe reveals that another agent is a senior member of the Royal Navy. Captain Hammond's party lands, only to be forced to surrender by Wolfe and his waiting men. Wolfe fires Hammond's prearranged signal, informing the fleet the battery has been taken. The British fleet sails into an ambush. Hornblower and his men manage to escape and blow up the fort, enabling Pellew to countermand his withdrawal and attack the French ships. Hornblower and his men then run into Wolfe and Captain Hammond, who is revealed to be the other Irish traitor. Hammond orders Wolfe to kill Hornblower and his greatly outnumbered men. However, Bush arrives with reinforcements. A battle ensues, during which Jack Hammond dies bravely. Wolfe escapes, while Hammond, distraught over the death of his nephew, commits suicide. Afterward, Hornblower's report states that Captain Hammond died heroically and honorably for England, to avoid inflaming the many Irishmen serving in the Royal Navy. Back in Portsmouth, Hornblower visits the Masons, but has an argument with Maria. As Hornblower is about to leave, Mrs. Mason tells him Maria wept for him while he was gone. Horatio then asks Maria to marry him; she accepts.

It was the main dumping ground of the city at the time, one of the “big three”. The other two were the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground. It was located at the present site of the Ilmala Railyard. Before 1949 it was the main dumping ground of the Finnish State Railways. Technically the site is part of the Pasila neighbourhood. Household waste and industrial waste was taken to the site, and the place was not guarded. History = Finnish State Railways dumping ground = The Finnish State Railways used the dumping ground to dispose of its used cross ties. They did so by sinking them into the local marsh. =City of Helsinki dumping ground= Helsinki started using the site as its dumping ground in 1949. At first the area was filled from the east, and the process continued towards the west. Many fires occurred at the site, and sometimes even the old railroad ties underneath caught fire. It is estimated that ca. 9 million cubic metres of waste was taken to the site. The area of the site was 40 hectares. = Finnish State Railways railyard = The use of the site as a dumping ground came to and end, when the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground was taken to use. Land was brought to the area, and it was levelled into a sand field. Then the area was left to settle for seven years, after which, in 1970, the first tracks and a hall for passenger cars were built. The area became the railroad depot for the passenger cars of the State Railways. Later a sorting station for the Finnish Postal Service as well as a depot for Pohjolan Liikenne was built in the western fringes of the area. From time to time, the ground has caved in, and during the 2000s major reparations have been undertaken in the area, as holes have appeared in the ground and the tracks have sunk in places. The city of Helsinki has estimated that no significant costs will be caused by reparation works in the area. The site at present The area is now in a use that resembles industrial use, and the dumping ground can not be discerned any longer. The waste has decomposed completely. Even though the city has estimated that the area will not give rise to significant costs through reparation works, it might be pointed out that the following statement has been made by a scientist who studied this theme: Even though the dumping ground has officially not existed for decades, at least according to some photos published in the internet in 2006, the site still contained wrecked cars at the time. Present effects on the surrounding areas A lake, Huopalahdenjärvi, existed at the site of the dumping ground in the 19th century. The waters of this area, now known as Pohjois-Pasila flow down the Kumpulanpuro brook into Kumpula and on to the sea in Vanhankaupunginselkä Bay. Earlier these waters were directed to an industrial water treatment plant of the city, but since May 2011, the waters have been allowed to empty into Kumpulanpuro. Problems are caused by occasional overflowing, and in such instances the waters end up in the Vallila allotment garden. The construction of an urban runoff park in the Isonniitty park area in Kumpula has begun, and the former “recreational and playground grass is just a memory now”. The permission for this work was applied for by the Finnish Transport Agency and the State Railways. The permission was granted by the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland.

In late 2014, following the failed coup attempt to take over the capital Tripoli in the context of the Libyan Civil War, the House of Representatives relocated itself to Tobruk in the far east of Libya. , it is generally called the Tobruk government. Several HoR sessions were held in Tripoli in May 2019 while Tripoli was under armed attack, electing an Interim Speaker for 45 days. Formation The House of Representatives officially became a legislative body on 4 August 2014, following an election on 25 June 2014, replacing the General National Congress. Turnout at the election was 18%, down from 60% in the first post-Gaddafi election of July 2012. Because of security concerns no voting took place in some locations. the chairman was Aguila Saleh Issa. the deputy presidents of the Council of Deputies were Imhemed Shaib and Ahmed Huma. , the HoR's associated executive authority is the Second Al-Thani Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani, based in Bayda, Libya. The Tripoli-based Libyan Supreme Constitutional Court ruled on 6 November 2014 that the June elections were unconstitutional and that the House of Representatives should be dissolved. The House of Representatives rejected the ruling, saying that the ruling was made \\"at gunpoint\\", with the court being controlled by armed militias. In late 2014, a rival parliament in Tripoli was restored, the General National Congress (GNC). The House of Representatives did not recognize the new GNC, and voted on 6 October 2015, 112 out of 131, \\"to extend its term beyond 20 October\\", given the inability to hold elections. Government of National Accord In October 2015, the UN envoy for Libya, Bernardino León, announced a proposal for the House of Representatives to share power with the rival new GNC government, under a compromise prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj. However, the terms of the final proposal were not acceptable to either side, and both rejected it. Nonetheless, the proposal did spark a revised proposal put together by Fayez al-Sarraj and others, which was subsequently supported by the United Nations.UN Security Council Resolution 2259 of 23 December 2015 On 17 December 2015 members of the House of Representatives and the new General National Congress signed this revised political agreement, generally known as the \\"Libyan Political Agreement\\" or the \\"Skhirat Agreement\\". Under the terms of the agreement, a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would have been formed, with a view to holding new elections within two years. The House of Representatives would have continued to exist as a legislature and an advisory body, to be known as the High Council of State, would have been formed with members nominated by the New General National Congress. On 31 December 2015, Chairman of the House of Representatives, Aguila Saleh Issa declared his support for the Libyan Political Agreement. As of April 2016, the Libyan National Elections Commission was still considering its recommendations on legislation to implement the next election of the House of Representatives. A new round of talks that started in October 2017 in Tunis broke down a month later without a deal. On 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the \\"so-called\\" Skhirat agreement void. Shift to Tobruk In late 2014, following the occupation of Tripoli by armed Islamist groups during the Second Libyan Civil War, the House of Representatives relocated to Tobruk in the far east of the country. Since there was not enough housing for them, they initially hired a car ferry from a Greek shipping company, the Elyros of ANEK Lines, for members to live and meet in.

On 2 May, 51 members of the HoR held a session at the Rixos al-Nasr Hotel. They stated that their session was not intended to split up the HoR nor Libya and called other members of the HoR to attend another Tripoli session planned for 5 May. They opposed the use of military force, called for a political solution to the offensive, and called for the Presidential Council, in its role as the head of the Libyan armed forces, to appoint a new head of the army to replace Khalifa Haftar, who had been appointed by the HoR on 2 March 2015. On 5 May, a Tripoli session of 47 members of the House of Representatives elected al-Sadiq al-Kehili as Interim Speaker, Musaab al-Abed as a rapporteur and Hamouda Sayala as a spokesperson, for a period of 45 days, with 27 votes in favour. In the 2014 Libyan parliamentary election, al-Kehili was elected with 1596 votes in electorate 56, Tajura; Musaab al-Abed (Musab Abulgasim) was elected with 2566 votes in electorate 59, Hay al-Andalus; and Sayala (Siyala) was elected with 6023 votes in electorate 58, Tripoli Central. On 8 May, another session was held in Tripoli, creating an Internal Code Review committee, to review HoR decisions made since 2014, under Article 16 of the Skhirat Agreement; an International Communication committee; a Secretarial Office; and a Crisis committee, to \\"follow\\" the work of the emergency committee created by the Presidential Council in relation to the 2019 Western Libya offensive. Sayala stated in a televised interview that solving the crisis in Libya would require a political agreement in which the HoR is \\"restored\\" as the highest legislative authority in Libya. Disappearances On 17 July 2019, one of the Benghazi members of the House of Representatives, Seham Sergewa, well-known for her documentation of rape as a weapon of war during the 2011 Libyan Civil War, was detained by the Libyan National Army (LNA). , her location was unknown.

The bridge, built in 2003, is a segmental box girder bridge named after John Ringling, one of the founders of the Ringling Brothers Circus and resident of the Sarasota area. History The first bridge was built in 1925 by John Ringling, who owned large tracts of land on both Lido and Longboat Keys. He wanted to develop the islands and financed the cost of the bridge at a cost of approximately $750,000, equivalent to $ in , to connect the islands with the mainland. The ornate bridge opened for traffic on February 7, 1926 and was labelled \\"one of the greatest engineering accomplishments in the South” by the Sarasota Herald, which also proclaimed “There are no words adequate with which to express our appreciation.” Ringling donated the bridge to the city in 1927. Around 1950, the first bridge began to show that it could not adequately handle increased traffic to the islands. In 1951, the State Road Department opted to replace the bridge with a four-lane drawbridge, which was completed and opened to traffic in 1959. The drawbridge was built at a cost of $20 million and the original bridge was demolished. Around 2000, the drawbridge began to suffer the same fate as its predecessor. With the drawbridge opening as many as 18 times a day, it was unable to handle increasing amounts of traffic. To remedy the situation, construction began on the current high-span bridge in 2001. The tall bridge opened for traffic in 2003 at a cost of $68 million. Landscaping around the bridge was financed by private donors.

At the same time, there are a number of dialects such as Salchuq, Qashqai and Khalaj languages. Although there are various dialects of Azerbaijani language, they do not significantly differentiate one another. These dialects are mutually intelligible. The Southern Azerbaijani contains a lot of Arabic and Persian words. There can be problems with the understanding between the southern and northern Azerbaijani because of these words. This difference has begun to increase since 1828.  Dialect groups  The dialects of Azerbaijani language are commonly divided into four main groups, Eastern (Derbent, Baku, Shamakhi, Mugan and Lankaran dialects), Western (Qazakh, Karabakh, Ganja and Ayrum dialects), Northern (Nukha, Zaqatala - Qakh dialects), Southern (Yerevan, Nakhchivan, Ordubad and Tabriz dialects). The dialects are mutually intelligible but differ with regard to accent, syntax, and vocabulary. Eastern and northern groups of dialects were significantly influenced by the Kypchak language. The dialects can be distinguished on the basis of the geographical location like Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Russia (Dagestan) and Georgia. According to these areas, Afshar, Qashqai, Aynallu, Bayat, Shahsven, Qajar and Turkman dialects are classified. These dialects are commonly classified regarding to the geographic conditions such as Tabriz, Urmia, Khoy, Kushchinskiy (central Ostan), Maraga, Merende, Uryantepin, Turkmenchay, Ardabil, Sarabian, Mian, Galugiha (Mazandaran), Lotfabad and Dergez (Khorasan- Rizaui) dialects. The dialects of Azerbaijani language differ from one another in accordance with phonetics and vocabulary.  Publications  The first comparative analysis of the Turkic (Azerbaijani) dialects was carried out by Mirza Kazimbey on his book dated 1839 called \\"The General Grammar of the Turkish – Tatar Language\\". During 1924 - 1930 Soviet researchers collected about 60 thousand dialect words. The program was prepared to compile a dictionary of dialects of the Azerbaijani language. N.I. Ashari led this program. The Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR published a one-volume dictionary named \\"Dialectological Dictionary of the Azerbaijani Language\\" covered more than six thousand words in 1964. At the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century “Dictionary of the Dialects of the Azerbaijani language” was published.

It was the largest interurban station in the world and at its peak handled 500 trains per day and seven million passengers per year. The station opened in 1904 and remained in use until 1941, when interurban operation ended. It continued to serve as a bus station until 1968 and was demolished in 1972. The Hilton Indianapolis now stands at its location.  Design  The terminal was designed by D. H. Burnham & Company, an architectural firm based in Chicago. The terminal consisted of three parts: a nine-story office building, a passenger waiting platform, and an adjoining train shed. The train shed was wide and covered nine tracks. It was positioned north-south, with trains entering from Market Street and exiting to Ohio Street. The train shed severed Wabash Street. East of the train shed was the waiting station. This consisted of a by platform covered by a skylight, with waiting rooms underneath. The office building stood nine stories tall and was by at its base. The building's frame was constructed with steel. The exterior of the first two stories was covered in Bedford limestone, native to Indiana, while the remaining seven stories were \\"speckled brick.\\" The original complex included a freight-handling area in the northwest corner. By 1918 freight traffic outstripped the terminal's ability to handle it and the Terre Haute, Indianapolis and Eastern Traction Company constructed a separate freight station on Kentucky Avenue. All freight traffic to the terminal ended in 1924.  History  Soldiers and Sailors Monument in the background to the east. One of the stone eagle sculptures at Old Indianapolis City Hall in 2010. The terminal was the joint effort of seven interurban railroads which provided service to Indianapolis: Indiana Traction; Indianapolis and Eastern Railway; Indianapolis and Cincinnati Traction; Indianapolis, Columbus and Southern Traction; Indianapolis and Martinville Rapid Transit; Indianapolis Coal Traction; and the Indianapolis and Northwestern Traction. Construction began in July 1903 and was completed in September 1904. The total cost of construction exceeded . It was the largest interurban station in the world. Indianapolis stood at the center of a large interurban network; in 1914 the terminal handled 500 trains per day and seven million passengers per year. Interurban service to the terminal ended in 1941 as the industry collapsed. The tracks were paved over but the terminal remained in use as a bus station until October 1968, at which time the former train shed was removed. In April 1972 the office building was demolished as well. The Hilton Indianapolis, originally constructed as the headquarters of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Indiana (part of Anthem), now occupies the block. When the Terminal's train shed was torn down in 1968, it was dismantled, not demolished. The structural steel girder sections were numbered and removed to the site of the Indiana Museum of Transport and Communication (known today as the Indiana Transportation Museum) in Forest Park, located in Noblesville, Indiana. The $10,500 cost for that portion of the project was almost entirely financed (all but $500) by a donation from Ruth Lilly, and the original goal was to eventually reassemble the shed and use it to shelter the museum's existing and future railroad equipment collection. An adjoining two-story office and waiting room was envisioned, which was to include a scaled-down replica of the terminal's original waiting room. However, the plan languished due to the prohibitive projected cost of its reconstruction. The stacked girders remained untouched until the early 1980s, when they were finally hauled away as scrap. The only surviving remnants of the complex today are two stone eagle sculptures that once flanked either side of the train shed. They were removed in 1968 and are now located on the steps of the Old Indianapolis City Hall.

He was also a successful Association football player. He was born at Newton Heath, Manchester and died at West Didsbury, also in Manchester. Lancashire was educated at Lancing College and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He won a Cambridge Blue for football in 1878, 1879 and 1880, when he captained the team against Oxford University; in all three years, Cambridge won the university match. As a cricketer where he played as a right-handed batsman, often appearing in the lower middle-order, Lancashire played for both Cambridge University and for the county side of Lancashire in 1878 and 1879 without much success. In 1880, he passed 50 for the first time in making an innings of 60 for Cambridge against the \\"Gentlemen of England\\" side in a high-scoring match. He was then awarded his cricket Blue, and in the 1880 University match he made 5 and 29 as a strong Cambridge team beat Oxford by 115 runs. Lancashire was still at Cambridge in 1881 but though he played a few more matches for the university cricket team he did not do well enough to win a second Blue. After leaving Cambridge, Lancashire continued to play county cricket fairly regularly for the next half dozen years without ever making much of an impact: in 1886, for example, he played in 19 first-class matches, all but one of them for the Lancashire county team, but he averaged only 10.03 with the bat and his highest score that year was just 49. In 1884, he scored 119 for Lancashire in a non-first-class game against Cheshire. But his highest first-class score was an innings of 76 against MCC in 1885, when he was left undefeated when Lancashire won the match by eight wickets. He did not play first-class cricket after the 1888 season. Unmarried, Lancashire appears to have had no profession or occupation and to have been of \\"independent means\\". He was a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire from 1887. He was chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1913 to 1927 and president in 1923-24.

The offensive is considered to be the largest military attack against the Syrian government launched by ISIL since its establishment. It is also considered to be a reaction to Syrian Army military operations against ISIL positions in eastern Syria. The offensive =Raqqa, Al-Hasakah, and Aleppo assaults= Late in the evening on 23 July, a 640-men strong Islamic State assault force (of which 40 were infiltrators) launched an attack on the Division 17 base, north of Raqqa, from three sides. The attack began with two suicide attacks. Both were thwarted by the defenders before they could reach their targets. However, the explosions did leave 19 soldiers dead. The next day, just hours after the attack on Division 17 started, ISIL launched an attack on the Regiment 121 base (known as the Melbiya Regiment), south of Al-Hasakah, and the Panorama checkpoint at the southern entrance to the city. According to some reports, militants breached the base and killed General Mozid Salama along with 20 of his men. A Syrian Army official denied this claim. At the same time, four infiltrators disguised as NDF members attacked the Ba'ath party building in Al-Hasakah, killing a high-ranking Ba'ath political leader. The four ISIL infiltrators eventually blew themselves up, killing a total of 12 persons. During the night of 25 July, a suicide car-bomb was detonated at the Panorama checkpoint, killing five soldiers. Meanwhile, clashes at the southern perimeter of Al-Hasakah city killed three YPG fighters, while 11 Syrian soldiers (including an officer) died while defending the Artillery Regiment 121 base. 17 ISIL fighters were also killed near the base. On 26 July, ISIL took control of Division 17 after government forces retreated, following two days of fighting. Hundreds of troops retreated from the base towards Brigade 93 and nearby villages. Three groups were pulled out, while one group stayed behind to cover the retreat. One of the retreating groups got ambushed by ISIL, but two other groups, numbering hundreds of soldiers, reached Brigade 93 that day. 300 other soldiers were still held up in the village of Al Rahyat. 50 soldiers from the ambushed group were captured and summarily executed. Overall, 85 soldiers were killed in the battle for Division 17. The fate of 200 others remained unknown, according to the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights (SOHR). Some of the executed Syrian soldiers were paraded in Raqqa, where the heads of soldiers were put on poles.Syria: Militants put victims' heads on poles 28 ISIL fighters were also killed during the takeover of Division 17. On the same day, ISIL forces penetrated the besieged Kwayres air base, east of Aleppo, and captured parts of the airport campus. In the evening, it was reported that ISIL managed to capture large parts of Artillery Regiment 121 base, and by the next day, according to SOHR, had fully taken control of the base. However, according to Kurdish sources, government troops recaptured the base after ISIL forces retreated under heavy artillery fire. It was also reported that YPG units seized weaponry from the SAA in Hasakah city, while YPG and pro- government fighters set up joint patrols in the southern parts of Al-Hasakah to prevent ISIL taking control of the city. According to the state news agency SANA, the military recaptured the Penitentiary center for teenagers, the Martyrs Cemetery and the al-Ahrash area on the southern outskirts of Hasakah. Meanwhile, dozens of government soldiers, fleeing from the captured Division 17, reached the Al-Thawrah air base, also known as Al-Tabqa. Also during this time, ISIL forces retreated from the Kwayres air base due to heavy shelling. =Syrian Army counterattack= On 31 July, ISIL fighters retreated from the Al Mashtal area towards Mafraq Sediq, 7 kilometers west of Al Hasakah city, because of potential shelling by government forces. Meanwhile, ISIL itself shelled Al Hasakah with mortars, leaving three people dead. On 1 August, the military counter-attacked and ISIL forces retreated from areas south-east of Al Hasakah city. Government troops captured the villages of Al Homor, Al Slaleyyi, Al Fallaha, Al Ma’ruf and Al Maqbara, eventually reaching the old junction of Al Shaddadi during the advance. =Further ISIL advances= After overnight clashes that started with a triple suicide bombing, on 7 August, ISIL forces captured large parts of the Brigade 93 base. The next day, ISIL was in full control of the base and started preparing to attack Al-Tabqa air base, the last government stronghold in Raqqa province. In the past, different rebel groups besieged the Al-Tabqa air base at different time periods. On 25 November 2013, they had shot down a government helicopter outside the base, killing all of its crew members. By this time, the number of confirmed soldiers killed at Division 17 was updated to 105, while another 140 soldiers remained missing. 108 of the missing soldiers arrived at the air base on 14 August. On 8 August, ISIS repelled a Kurdish and pro-government forces attempt to recapture the Geweran neighbourhood of Hasakah city through the Beiruti bridge. =Battle of Al-Tabqa airbase= Around 10 August 2014, ISIL started to continuously attack Al-Tabqa airbase. After two weeks of fighting, and several repelled ISIL assaults, on 24 August, ISIL fighters breached Al-Tabqa and took control over large parts of the air base. This attack occurred when the Army was already retreating from the base to the Ithriya area, leaving a small garrison behind. The base was eventually captured that day. In the final assault, Syrian 170 soldiers were killed, while since the start of the battle, 346 ISIL fighters and 195 Syrian soldiers had been killed. The number of dead soldiers was later updated to 200. Another 150 soldiers were reportedly captured,ISIS seizes last Syrian regime base in Raqqa province while 700 soldiers managed to retreat. = Mohasan and Baath Dam = On 28 August, Syrian fighter jets launched a precise attack on an ISIL HQ in the city of Muhasan, during a meeting between military leaders and sharia judges. The attack resulted in the death of most leaders inside (numbering six), while others were wounded. Another airstrike occurred the same day against an ISIL camp near Baath Dam, killing and wounding dozens of insurgents. According to SOHR, ISIL executed 160 Syrian soldiers between 27 and 28 August. At the beginning of October, 29 soldiers missing from the Brigade 93 base managed to reach the Army headquarters at Al-Hasakah city.  Aftermath  An ISIL training camp in eastern Syria was bombed by the Air Force on 14 September, resulting in 17 ISIL casualties. The next day, Special forces and Syrian Army engineers blew up the Political Bridge in Deir ez-Zor, killing all the militants who were on it. ISIL thus lost the only available land route to move into parts of the city it controlled. Further supplies had to be delivered by boats.

He was one of the first photographers to use flash-lamps for photography. He owned the first successful photography studio in Los Angeles where he photographed many famous Californians in the 1870s in 1880s. After returning to Sweden, Wolfenstein owned Atelier Jaeger, the official court photographer's studio in Stockholm, from 1890 to 1905. He was a pioneer in his field and possibly the first in Sweden to make interior pictures in theaters using flash-lamp photography. He took pictures of theater scenes and actors' dressing rooms. A particular skill he developed was taking \\"look-alike pictures\\", a double exposure technique that combined images of the same person in two different poses, for example, sitting and standing. Early life Wolfenstein was born August Valentin Wolfenstein on 19 April 1845 in Falun. His parents were Viktor Adolf Wolfenstein (1817–1881) and Anna Elisabeth Brostrom (1807–1851).Ancestry.com \\"Wolfenstein Family Tree\\" He emigrated to the United States during the American Civil War and enlisted in New York City on 31 January 1865.Ancestry.com Military records After the war he worked as a photographer in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he had a photography studio in 1867.

When he failed at some Los Angeles side businesses in the 1880s, he sought new surroundings and went to Guatemala and Mexico where he ran photographic studios. He returned to Sweden in the 1890s, sometime after Clara died, and settled in Stockholm, where he became an employee of the royal photographer Johannes Jaeger at his studio, Atelier Jaeger. In the 1890s Wolfenstein established a photographic studio at Drottninggatan 33 in Stockholm. When Jaeger moved back to Germany, his home country, Wolfenstein bought both of his studios for 60,000 kronor.

Leslie (October 27, 1937 - July 9, 1976), known as Jim Leslie, was a journalist for The Shreveport Times who became a public relations and advertising executive in Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. He is known for having been a homicide victim in the state capital, Baton Rouge on July 9, 1976, in a case described by the police as a \\"professional hit.\\" George W. D'Artois, the Public Safety Commissioner in Shreveport, was twice arrested in the case; the first time he was released for lack of evidence. He was arrested again on charges of first-degree murder in April 1977, suspected of contracting for the murder of Leslie, but he died in June of that year during heart surgery. No one was tried in the case. Leslie had been hired by D'Artois in 1974 to manage communications in his reelection campaign; he had been in office since 1962. In the mid-1970s, D'Artois was the subject of an extended investigation by the Shreveport Times. Leslie had told a friend earlier in 1976 that D'Artois had tried to pay him with city funds for his work on his 1974 campaign, and warned him against testifying before a grand jury. With a full-scale investigation of the commissioner underway, Leslie was called to testify to a grand jury about alleged corruption in D'Artois's department. Biography James S. Leslie, called \\"Jim\\" much of his life, was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1937. He attended public schools before going to college. After graduation, he became involved in journalism and worked for The Shreveport Times for years as a reporter. He developed a wide network among colleagues, and with people in city and state government. Leslie later went into public relations for businesses. Ultimately he became an advertising executive, and also became involved in political communications. He conceived of a number of campaigns. He married Carolyn S. and they had two sons, Scott and Mickey. 1974 campaign In 1974 George D'Artois, the Public Service Commissioner in Shreveport since 1962, hired Leslie to create his communications as part of his campaign for reelection. In 1970 D'Artois faced a greater challenge from a Republican competitor, and he was aware of growing Republican strength in the city and state, as white conservatives started to leave the Democratic Party. D'Artois gained reelection. A team of reporters from the Shreveport Times began working on a series of investigations about D'Artois in the mid-1970s. One line led to Leslie, who still held two uncancelled checks from the 1974 campaign. He told reporters that D'Artois had tried to pay him with city funds for his services, rather than from the campaign account, which was the only legal source. He told friend and former colleague, Elliot Stonecipher, that D'Artois had told him to cash the checks, and warned him against testifying in an upcoming grand jury. 1976 activities In the summer of 1976, Leslie was involved in the advertising campaign in support of a right-to-work bill under consideration in the Louisiana State Legislature. It was controversial, as labor unions strongly opposed it. Much of the lobbying in favor of the bill had been directed by Edward J. Steimel of the relatively new organization, Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, which opposed strong unions in the state. The Taft- Hartley Act permits states to prohibit closed shops that require employees of companies to join or pay dues to a labor union. Leslie had been staying in the capital as the bill was considered in the state senate. After celebrating the victory with colleagues near the state capitol, Leslie returned to the Prince Murat Inn in Baton Rouge, where he had been staying while the bill was being considered. He parked in one of the few spaces available. Before he could reach the hotel, he was shot and killed instantly in the parking lot by an unknown assailant. It was found a panel in the boundary fence had been removed, and the shooter used the space to hit Leslie. Given the lack of evidence, Baton Rouge detectives described it as a \\"professional hit.\\" The Sheriff of Caddo Parish was Harold Terry (1925–2016), who had taken office nine days before. He informed the Leslie family in Shreveport about the executive's killing. Josiah Lee \\"J. L.\\" Wilson, III (1940–2015), then a reporter for The Shreveport Times, reported that deputies told him that Sheriff Terry's eyes were red from weeping as he left his office to meet with the Leslie family. There was speculation that George W. D'Artois, Shreveport Public Safety Commissioner, had hired a man to murder Leslie, in relation to a Caddo Parish grand jury. D'Artois was arrested in August 1976 on charges related to Leslie's murder, and forced to resign his office. He was released at the time for lack of evidence, but was going to be tried in a separate case for theft of city funds in the amount of $30,000 for payment of police informants. After his trial was repeatedly postponed because of his poor health, D'Artois was later arrested again on April 19, 1977 on charges of first-degree murder of Leslie; the warrant was signed by District Judge Gonzalez of Baton Rouge. Initially D'Artois barricaded himself in the attic of his house and refused to accept the warrant. Saying he refused to go to the Caddo Parish Jail and would only go to the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail, he had appealed to the state supreme court against arrest because of his health. The Louisiana State Supreme Court refused to block a trial of D'Artois on other charges, of theft of $30,000 in city funds, as noted above. While there had been media speculation that Leslie had been murdered because of his activities on the right-to-work bill, the East Baton Rouge Parish police said there was no evidence to support that. The same day, police from Concordia Parish arrested Donald Gardner of Shreveport in the 1976 shotgun murder of Russell Griffith, Jr. in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, and first-degree murder of Leslie. Griffith had been suspected as Leslie's murderer. Gardner was first arrested in the fall of 1976 and described as the key figure between D'Artois and Leslie's murderer(s). Also arrested in connection with Griffith's murder in 1977 was Kenneth C. Brouillette of Lettsworth, Louisiana, who was being held at the Concordia Parish Jail. The East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's office said that Gardner and Griffith were accused of killing Leslie for $30,000, paid by D'Artois, in retaliation for Leslie's testimony before a Caddo Parish grand jury about D'Artois's activities.AP, Monroe News-Star, 19 April 1977; accessed 17 March 2019 D'Artois died in June 1977 during open heart surgery in San Antonio, Texas. He never faced trial for his role in the case. The killing of Leslie was never fully solved, and no one was convicted of either Leslie's or Griffith's murders. Recent studies In 2009 Bill Keith published a book related to the case: The Commissioner: A True Story of Deceit, Dishonor, and Death, a study of the D'Artois administration, the commissioner's connection to crime bosses, and the unsolved Leslie murder. Keith was a state senator from Shreveport at the time of Leslie's homicide. He had also served as a journalist with The Shreveport Times and the since defunct Shreveport Journal. In 2013, Jere Joiner, a retired police detective from Shreveport, published Badge of Dishonor, an exploration of the corruption of the D'Artois administration, and the commissioner's ties to the alleged murders of Leslie and Griffiths. Elliott Stonecipher, a political consultant, analyst, and friend of Leslie, was reported as saying that he \\"never once doubted that D'Artois was behind the assassination.\\" Stonecipher said that Leslie had told him that he believed D'Artois would try to have him killed. Others had suggested in 1976 and 1977 that passage of the controversial right- to-work bill may have been the catalyst for Leslie's homicide, but the East Baton Rouge Parish police said there was no evidence for that. They said they found many strands between D'Artois and Leslie's killers. Leslie is interred at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport. After George W. D'Artois died, he was also interred there. Each was a lifelong resident of the city.

Her photography helped to expose the human rights abuses in the Congo Free State under the regime of Leopold II, King of the Belgians. Family and origins Alice Seeley was born in Malmesbury to Aldred and Caroline Seeley. Her sister, Caroline Alfreda, was a school teacher. Alice married John Hobbis Harris (later Sir John) at a registry office in London. They had four children: Alfred John, Margaret Theodora, Katherine Emmerline (known as “Bay”) and Noel Lawrence. Alice spent many years in Frome in Somerset and died at the age of 100 in 1970 at Lockner Holt in Surrey. Career In 1889, aged 19, Alice entered the Civil Service and was later appointed to the Accountant General’s office in General Post Office, London. Alice gave her spare time to Frederick Brotherton Meyer’s mission work at Regent’s Park Chapel and later Christ Church in Lambeth. Alice left the Civil Service to enter Doric Lodge, the training college of the Region Beyond Missionary Union. In 1894, she met her future husband John Hobbis Harris. Finally in 1897, after seven years of trying, Alice was accepted to go out to the Congo Free State. Shortly afterwards, Alice and John got engaged and were married on 6 May 1898. Four days later, as her honeymoon, Alice sailed with John on the SS Cameroon to the Congo Free State as missionaries with the Congo-Balolo Mission. They arrived in the Congo three months later, on 4 August 1898, and then travelled to the Mission Station Ikau near Basankusu. Alice was appalled and saddened at what she witnessed there and began campaigning for the human rights of the Congolese natives to be recognised. =Campaigner= Tinted lantern slide titled \\"The Congo Atrocities\\" showing a mutilated young woman (part of a set by Alice Seely Harris, who with her husband used these slides in magic lantern shows across the country to bring the injustices against Congolese workers to public attention) Alice was stationed with her husband John from 1898 to 1901 at the Mission Station at Ikau, near the Lulonga River, which is a tributary of the River Congo in the Balolo Tribal region. Later, from 1901 to 1905, they were stationed at the Mission Station at Baringa, a village in Tshuapa District, Befale Territory, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It stands on the banks of the Maringa River, approximately 100 km upriver from Basankusu. During her time in the Congo, Alice taught English to the local children, but her most important contribution was to photograph the injuries that were sustained by the Congolese natives at the hands of the agents and soldiers of King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold was partly exploiting the local population so fiercely to profit from increased rubber demand after the invention of the pneumatic or inflatable tyre by John Boyd Dunlop in Belfast in 1887. Methods of coercion included whipping, hostage-taking, rape, murder and burning of gardens and villages. Nsala of Wala in Congo looks at the severed hand and foot of his five-year old daughter The most famous and shocking atrocity, whose aftermath Harris captured in her photography, was the severing of hands. In 1904, two men arrived at their mission from a village attacked by 'sentries' of the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) after failing to provide sufficient rubber. One of the men, Nsala, was holding a small bundle of leaves which when opened revealed the severed hand and foot of a child. Sentries had killed and mutilated Nsala's wife and daughter. Appalled, Alice persuaded Nsala to pose with his child's remains on the veranda of her home for a picture. Initially, Alice's photographs were used in Regions Beyond, the magazine of the Congo Balolo Mission. In 1902, the Harrises returned to Britain temporarily. In 1904, Alice's photographs reached wider distribution including Congo Slavery, a pamphlet prepared by Mrs. H. Grattan-Guinness, wife of the editor of Regions Beyond, and in King Leopold's rule in Africa by E. D. Morel. The same year saw the founding of the Congo Reform Association by Morel. In 1906 Alice and her husband began working for Morel's Congo Reform Association. In early 1906, Alice and her husband toured the United States. John wrote that they had presented her images at 200 meetings in 49 cities via magic lantern screenings. In December 1906, the daily paper New York American used Harris's photographs to illustrate articles on atrocities in the Congo for an entire week. In 1908, Alice and John became joint organizing secretaries of the Congo Reform Association and, in April 1910, they became joint organizing secretaries of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society. Alice soon relinquished her official position, but assisted John at the Society until his death in 1940. She continued her active speaking career and was listed with Christy's Lecture Service alongside luminaries such as Winston Churchill and Ernest Shackleton. In November 1908, Leopold II ceded administration of the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, thus creating the Belgian Congo. The Harrises returned to the Congo from 1911–12, following the handover of the Congo to Belgium. They noted improved conditions in the treatment of natives and later produced a book, Present Conditions in the Congo, illustrated with Alice's photographs. Soon thereafter, hundreds of Alice's African documentary photographs were displayed at an exhibition at the Colonial Institution. In 1933, she became Lady Alice when her husband was knighted, but was known for saying, \\"don't call me Lady!\\" Some commentators think that Alice should have received an honour for her services, in her own right, having been one of the first people to use photography in a human rights campaign. In 1970, Alice reached 100 years old and was interviewed by BBC Radio 4 on a programme called Women of Our Time. She was the first centenarian to be a member of the Frome Society for Local Study, which has placed a plaque near where she lived in Frome.

They are known as Adam and Brad; names given by Newton County coroner Scott McCord. Despite the efforts put forth, neither of the two have been identified, nor have they been returned to their families. They have not had dignified burials, nor have their full, given names been able to be carved on headstones, further humanizing the victims. In efforts to discover the identity of these individuals, a forensic anthropologist named Stephen Nawrocki has developed forensic facial reconstructions of each decedent. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has also created composite drawings of the decedents, depicting how the individuals may have appeared in life. Furthermore, DNA has been extracted from both decedents for genetic testing against the DNA of any individual who may be related to them. These unidentified decedents are collectively known as the Newton County John Does due to the name of the county in which their bodies were discovered.Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler p. 144 Discovery On October 18, 1983The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 70 a middle-aged couple gathering wild mushrooms discovered two partially buried human skulls alongside an oak tree close to an abandoned farmhouse in Lake Village, Indiana. The couple immediately reported their discovery to authorities. Indiana State Police investigators at the abandoned Lake Village farmhouse. October 19, 1983 Investigators discovered the partially decomposed bodies of four murder victims at this location. Each victim had been deceased for several months, and all four decedents had been partially buried, face upwards, with sections of the body of each victim remaining exposed above ground and loosely covered with leaves and soil, suggesting the murderer had made only rudimentary efforts to conceal each victim. Three of these victims were buried at one side of the tree, three feet apart, with their heads facing north. The fourth decedent was buried at the other side of this tree. All four victims had been bound and stabbed more than two dozen times, and the trousers and underwear of each victim were discovered around their ankles. Furthermore, the body of one victim had been dismembered after death. All four murders were almost immediately linked to the collective manhunt for a serial killer known as the Highway Murderer, who at the time of the discovery of these bodies was believed to have already murdered up to nineteen young males across several Midwestern States.Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler pp. 144-149 The level of decomposition of each victim and the clothing discovered upon each body suggested several weeks or months had elapsed between each murder. One victim had worn a parka, whereas the other three victims had worn clothing suggesting they had been murdered in the spring or summer.Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler p. 199 In addition, evidence retrieved from the farmhouse would lead investigators to conclude the murderer had evidently used this location as a site to restrain and torture these victims before burying their bodies alongside the oak tree. By December 1983, two of these four murder victims had been identified via dental records as Michael Bauer and John Bartlett; both of whom had been murdered by serial killer Larry Eyler in early March 1983. The third and fourth victims discovered at this location remain unidentified. =Perpetrator's confession= Eyler posthumously confessed to these four murders following his death due to AIDS-related complications in March 1994 while incarcerated on death row at the Pontiac Correctional Center, where he had been detained since 1986 for the 1984 murder of a 16-year-old Uptown male prostitute. Eyler's confession specifically states the two unidentified victims found at this abandoned farmhouse were the third and fourth victims he had murdered at this location.Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler p. 111 A major factor as to why neither Adam nor Brad has been identified is due to the fact that Eyler encountered both decedents by happenstance.Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler p. 150 According to his posthumous confession, Adam was a hitchhiker who agreed to submit to a sexual act for $75; Brad was an individual whom Eyler claimed to have been introduced to by his alleged accomplice, Robert David Little. He was unaware of either of their actual identities. In addition, he is known to have disposed of any forms of identification that he would find upon his victims' possession. \\"Adam\\" Victim A, or Adam, a black male, was the third of the four victims to be discovered at the burial site. This victim is believed to be around fifteen to eighteen years of age, although he may have been aged in his early twenties. His hair was cut short and was black, and he was most likely between five feet eight inches and six feet two inches in height. He had received several fillings in life. The clothing worn by this decedent included a distinctive red and black belt, inscribed with the word \\"devil\\" multiple times. The buckle contained the word \\"jeans\\". A pair of jeans and pajama bottoms were found on his remains, along with a pair of boots. The boots were made in the Hush Puppies design and had metal buckles to fasten them on each side. As with the vast majority of Eyler's murder victims, Adam was found with his trousers and underwear around his ankles. Eyler specifically stated this murder had been committed in July 1983, and confirmed investigators' suspicions that the victim had been a hitchhiker whom he had lured into his vehicle near Indiana State Road 63 in Terre Haute, Indiana. Investigator Scott McCord believes that Adam was likely native to the region, perhaps from Chicago or St. Louis. =Eyler's confession= In a formal confession released by Eyler's defense attorney, Kathleen Zellner, following her client's death, Eyler claimed that on a date he believed to be a Monday in early- or mid-July 1983, following several heated arguments with his boyfriend, John Dobrovolskis (whom Eyler had recently discovered to be engaging in a discreet sexual relationship with another man), Eyler had driven toward Terre Haute. While traveling upon State Road 63, he had encountered a hitchhiker whom he confirmed to be Adam and who he described as being aged in his late teens or early twenties. According to Eyler, he offered this victim seventy-five dollars to allow Eyler to bind and \\"perform a sexual act\\" upon him, to which the victim agreed. After Eyler had plied the young man with vodka and ethchlorvynol, he drove him to the abandoned farmhouse in Lake Village where he had earlier murdered John Bartlett, Michael Bauer, and Brad. At this location, the victim was bound to a wooden post, blindfolded, and stabbed multiple times in his upper and lower midsection. According to Eyler, his last words to the victim were, \\"Okay, make your peace with God, nigger.\\" He had then waited four or five minutes before stabbing this individual to death. Eyler further claimed to have confessed to this murder to his alleged accomplice, Robert David Little, whom he claimed had asked him the question, \\"Did he grunt or did he groan?\\" Eyler's confession further revealed he had intentionally buried this victim separately from the three Caucasian victims he had previously murdered at this location as he did not believe it to be \\"proper\\" to bury an African-American alongside European Americans. \\"Brad\\" Victim B, or Brad, was the fourth and final murder victim discovered at the abandoned farmhouse. This victim was determined to be a white male most likely aged between seventeen and twenty-three years old. He had medium length, reddish or auburn, wavy hair, weighed between 130 and 180 pounds and was most likely between five feet eleven inches and six feet one inches in height. This decedent had also received several fillings in life and, in the years prior to his murder, had severely fractured his nose and left ankle. In addition, staining evident upon the teeth indicated he may have been a smoker. The clothing worn by this decedent included size 30x30 brown slacks and jockey undershorts which had been lowered to his ankles, and brown leather hiking boots described as being ankle-high with a fleece interior. This decedent had two known tattoos on opposite sides of his right forearm—both of which were moderately preserved and recognizable. One of these tattoos depicted either a crudely inscribed Chinese character or a cross with two circular marks. This tattoo was located on the underside of the decedent's arm close to the wrist; the other was a rectangular (or possibly U-shaped) marking containing one circular mark, which was located on the other side of his forearm. The crude nature of these tattoos indicates a possibility this decedent may have served time in jail or a juvenile detention center in life. Reconstruction of the cross-like tattoo located on Brad's right forearm Eyler specifically stated this murder had been committed in either mid- or late-May 1983, on a date he believed his alleged accomplice, Robert Little, had been on a sabbatical from his employment as a library science professor at the Indiana State University. As with Adam, DNA has also been extracted from one of this decedent's bones for genetic testing against the DNA of any family member who may be related to Brad. =Eyler's confession= Eyler's posthumous confession released by his defense attorney, Kathleen Zellner, stated that, following a weekend of arguing with his lover, he had drove from his lover's home in Greenview, Illinois to Robert Little's Terre Haute residence, where he had first encountered this victim. According to Eyler, Little confided to him he had \\"picked this guy up\\" at an unknown location, although he did observe the two had \\"seemed sort of familiar\\" with each other. Shortly thereafter, Little persuaded this individual to participate in a sexual act at the abandoned farmhouse where Eyler had earlier murdered Bartlett and Bauer, upon the promise of being paid one-hundred dollars. According to Eyler, as the trio drove to this location, Little had informed this individual, \\"We're looking for something really far out\\".Freed to Kill: The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler p. 220 At this location, the victim was blindfolded, handcuffed, and bound to a wooden post resembling a cross before Robert Little took several photographs as Eyler removed or adjusted several items of his clothing. He was then stabbed to death after Eyler—responding to an instruction from Little—had informed him, \\"Okay, make your peace with God, motherfucker.\\" Ongoing investigation =Theories= Given the fact Eyler's identified victims lived in either Indiana or Illinois, these two unidentified decedents are possibly native to the Midwestern United States. However, investigators have not discounted the possibility that either victim could have hailed from anywhere in the United States or Canada. =Facial reconstructions= The two victims' faces have been reconstructed several times by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The facial reconstructions by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reportedly took approximately eighteen months to complete. The investigation to determine the identities of these two individuals is ongoing; dental records of both are in the possession of investigators; and the DNA of both individuals is stored within national DNA databases. In July 2020, the DNA Doe Project announced renewed genetic testing efforts to identify Adam. Interrment In October 2016, a public funeral for Adam and Brad was held in Brook, Indiana. Both decedents—plus a further unidentified decedent whose death is unrelated to these cases—were interred inside of a mausoleum in Riverside Cemetery in Brook, Indiana.

She died after accidentally pricking her finger with a needle containing lethal scrub typhus while attempting to develop a vaccine for the disease.  Early life  Lush was born in Hawthorn, Victoria, the daughter of John Fullarton Lush, a clerk, and his wife Dora Emma Louisa . She had two brothers, who served as officers in the Second AIF and RAAF during World War II. She was educated at Fintona Girls' School and the University of Melbourne, gaining a B.Sc. in 1932 and an M.Sc. in 1934. She was an active sportswoman, being selected for the University of Melbourne's women's basketball team.  Research  Lush worked at the National Institute for Medical Research, London, from early in 1939. She returned to Australia. Her work on the influenza virus was praised in 1940. She worked with Frank Macfarlane Burnet at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne on a scrub typhus vaccine in 1942, as scrub typhus was a serious health risk to Australian soldiers engaged in jungle warfare in the New Guinea Campaign during World War II.  Death  On 27 April 1943 Lush accidentally pricked her finger with a needle containing scrub typhus while inoculating a mouse. There was no effective treatment at the time for this often fatal disease. She died four weeks later, on 20 May 1943. Before her death she insisted that blood samples be taken from her to aid research. Unfortunately, the researchers were ultimately unable to develop a satisfactory vaccine. Lush was cremated at Springvale Crematorium on 22 May 1943. A memorial tablet was placed outside the laboratory where she worked at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.  Legacy  The National Health and Medical Research Council now offers postgraduate scholarships named in her honour. Lush Place in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour.

He served as an executive vice president and then treasurer of Macy's before taking on the roles of director and merchandising counsel. In 1935, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia appointed Knauth director of the city's Bureau of Emergency Relief. In this role, Knauth examined the cost of relief projects to improve the economy and stimulate growth. He conducted these activities for only a couple of months before the U.S. took over work relief activities. After resigning as director, Knauth served as president of the Associated Dry Goods Corporation from 1936 to 1943. He taught courses on economics at Columbia University from 1948 to 1951. Sailing from Long Island Knauth was a member of Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, one of the oldest yacht clubs in the U.S. Situated in the town of Oyster Bay, New York on Long Island, the club provides access to the Long Island Sound. Knauth gained widespread notoriety for his expertise on sailing the Sound. He spent summer vacations sailing his boat in the Caribbean Sea. Commenting on his sailing activities in an article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Knauth noted: \\"You know, I've found that living on a boat is the cheapest way of all. It's much less expensive than if we had a Summer place to keep up.\\" Family Knauth married Anna Dixwell Clements. They had three children together: Oliver, Basil, and Arnold.

It is situated approximately east of Elliston and south of Wudinna on the Eyre Peninsula near Lake Newland. The eastern part of Kappawanta includes most of the Bascombe Well Conservation Park. In 1862 Kappawanta was owned by Thomas Horn and Edward Kent when they dissolved their partnership. In 1863 the station was stocked with 5,345 sheep. In 1888 the property that had an estimated £3,182 worth of improvements was placed on the market for auction. The following year all the station stock and plant was sold off and the property was effectively abandoned. Messrs R Myers and Son, who had acquired the property some time prior to 1893, placed the property up for auction in 1896. At this time Kappawanta occupied an area of and was stocked with 6,200 sheep, 15 cattle and 5 horses and had been divided into 18 paddocks. By 1898 the property was owned by Edward Morris, who acquired it after winning the lottery. Morris remained on the property routinely producing between 90 and 160 bales of wool each year until he died after a brief illness at age 56 in 1908. Elizabeth Morris continued to run the property, with her sons eventually taking over management. In 1932 large areas of Kappawanta and neighbouring properties Hillside and Portanna, were all swept by bushfires that started from lightning strikes. Severe storms hit the area in 1942 with the homestead being unroofed and many windmills being blown over. George and Edward Morris owned the station until 1948, when they sold it to R. Sheehan. The boundaries of the locality of Kappawanta were formalised in November 1999 for the long established local name. It includes the cadastral hundreds of Kappawanta, Blesing and Hudd, and sections of the hundreds of Barwell, Cowan and Tinline.

Elbourne was brought up near the village of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. His first job, at age fifteen, was working for the local stately home Knebworth House which in the mid-seventies became the biggest venue in the United Kingdom for outdoor shows and hosted bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. He is best known as the promoter of rock concerts and is a well-known figure for his work in music and music festivals in the UK. He has been an advisor to, and one of main bookers for, the Glastonbury Festival for 30 years and has helped and advised numerous other festivals.  Career  Born on 19 January 1957 in Carlisle, Cumbria, Elbourne grew up in Hertfordshire, north of London. In 1977, he set up his own political party the Epicurean (ethical hedonist \`0\` movement) which won the student union elections. One of the election pledges was to open up the student union venue to non-students, leading it to become the main venue in Bristol for punk and post-punk bands. He studied Economics at Bristol University, in South West England earning an Honours B.A. The main bar at the University is still named after the Epicurean movement. He started promoting bands outside of the student union and became involved with the Ashton Court Festival, then the largest free event in the UK, and started going to Glastonbury. Upon leaving university he founded the award-winning Bristol Recorder, a combined vinyl LP compilation and a magazine. This led to his meeting local resident Peter Gabriel. Elbourne and Gabriel among others ended up funding and co-promoting the first WOMAD Festival. Whilst critically acclaimed, the resultant financial losses led to Gabriel playing a reformed Genesis Concert and Elbourne relocating to London. Elbourne ended up working for Rough Trade as a booking agent. His most famous clients were New Order and The Smiths. His relationship with New Order continued until the death of Rob Gretton. He managed various bands including Green on Red, David Rudder, and Gaye Bykers on Acid, and gradually became more involved with the Glastonbury Festival, ending up as its main booker. In 2003, Elbourne co-founded The Great Escape Festival, held in Brighton, which has music industry related conferences during the day and features live music in the evenings. Sébastien Nasra collaborated with Elbourne and, in 2006, co-founded M for Montreal, a platform for showcasing local musicians and helping them expand their international networks. U.K.-based artist manager Stephen Budd, Jon Mac, who co-founded The Great Escape; Vijay Nair, the managing director of India-based promoters and artist management company Only Much Louder; and Elbourne organized the NH7 Weekender Rock Festival in India in 2010. In 2012, the Don Dunstan Foundation, in partnership with Adelaide City Council, the Australia Council, Arts SA, Adelaide Fringe, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet and Regional Development Australia Barossa hired Elbourne as a thinker-in- residence on a project named \\"Reverb\\". The project aimed \\"to create collaboration and unified action for a healthy, more sustainable music scene\\" in South Australia. A report based on his recommendations was produced in 2013, entitled The future of live music in South Australia.

She is interested in young clubman Howard Turner (Fischer), who has not remained devoted to her during the period of her latest divorce. She is furious at his waning ardor and considers herself practically jilted as she plots revenge on him. She succeeds in interesting him in Marjorie (Wilson), a charming guest of hers, and soon brings about a marriage between the couple. Then, with the assistance of unprincipled lawyer Elijah Stone (Allardt), she separates the pair and begins to frame up a case against which no marital happiness could live. Many misunderstandings occur which make the couple miserable that cannot be explained. They continue to suffer until confederates of the divorcee and attorney turn state's evidence and the guilty man and woman are convicted. The bride and groom, greatly relieved, continue their honeymoon in peace and quiet.

The 'discuss' section may be used for discussing different relevant issues affecting the nation. It may also be used for providing vital information regarding the topic and also suggest and propose new ideas. The users are awarded activity points based upon their individual contributions. Users may also volunteer and submit their own entries. These are reviewed by other members, evaluated by experts and approved subsequently. Approved tasks earn credit points. MyGov also serves as a digital library of topics regarding India. Open Forum The Open Forum is for discussion of issues of national importance. It spans across various groups and every registered member of MyGov is eligible for participation.

This ell is attached to a 1-1/2 story barn which has Greek Revival styling.National Register nomination for Marion Parsons House (1987); available by request from the National Park Service The house is most significant for its association with Marion Parsons (1876-1968), a pioneering nurse and nursing educator active in the early 20th century. Miss Parsons had a distinguished career, first as a nurse in hospitals in Boston and San Francisco, and was for two years a nursing instructor at New York City Hospital. During World War I she volunteered her services to the military, serving several tours of duty at military medical facilities in France. In 1919 she was dispatched by the American Red Cross to Czechoslovakia, where she established a nurse's training school.

Dajani Daoudi (; born March 19, 1946) is a Palestinian professor and peace activist. Dajani gained international recognition for his work in helping to raise awareness concerning the Holocaust through a variety of media. Dajani has also been active in forming relationships with Jewish and Christian religious leaders and peace activists to spread the Wasatia message of understanding, tolerance, coexistence and brotherhood. Dajani is tackling the ideological roots of extremism. In 2014, he became the center of a controversy when he led a group of students from Al-Quds University to Auschwitz. Early life Dajani was born to one of Jerusalem's historic Arab families. The honorific \\"Daoudi\\" was added to the family name in 1529 when Suleiman the Magnificent designated an ancestor keeper of the Tomb of King David on Mount Zion. His family fled to Egypt when Israel declared its independence in 1948, but returned to the Old City of Jerusalem the following year (then under Jordanian rule). Dajani's parents, well-educated secular Muslims, sent him to English-speaking Quaker-run schools. As an engineering student at the American University of Beirut, Dajani joined Fatah. Although he received military training, he was put to work in the English-language public relations department of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1975, Lebanon deported Dajani. Banned from both Israel and Jordan because of his Fatah activities, he decided to travel to the United States to continue his education. He eventually earned a Ph.D. in government from the University of South Carolina and another Ph.D. in political economy at the University of Texas at Austin. Career By this time, Dajani's father was successful in getting his son a pardon from King Hussein of Jordan. Dajani was hired by the Applied Science Private University in Amman, where he created and chaired the political science and diplomacy department. In 1993, his father won permission from Israel for Dajani to return to Jerusalem. Dajani accompanied his father to chemotherapy treatments at Ein Kerem, an Israeli hospital in Jerusalem, where the younger man was surprised at the way his father was being treated: \\"I was expecting that they would be treating him differently—with discrimination—as a Palestinian, as an Arab, as a Muslim. I found out that this was not the case. They were treating him like a patient.\\" Dajani saw many other Palestinians receiving medical care from Israeli doctors. Several years later, a second experience with Israeli health care affected Dajani; his mother became ill near Ben Gurion Airport. \\"I did not believe that anybody would help her, being an Arab and coming to an airport where Israelis are very keen about security.\\" Dajani was surprised when an ambulance was called and paramedics tried to revive his mother for more than an hour. \\"I became confused about my enemy, who did their best to help my father and my mother. I started to see the other side of my enemy, which is the human side.\\" During the late 1990s, Dajani trained Palestinian civil servants for the United Nations Development Programme and various Palestinian organizations. In 1999, he was invited to Turkey to lead a program for Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders, which he developed into a conflict-resolution model called \\"Big Dream, Small Hope\\". Dajani was invited to join the faculty at Al-Quds University in 2001, and the following year he established its American Studies Institute. In 2007, with his brother, Munther Dajani Daoudi, he co-founded Wasatia (\\"Moderation\\"), an organization that promotes the Islamic traditions of nonviolence and compromise. Auschwitz trip In March 2014, Dajani took a group of 27 students from Al-Quds University to visit the Nazi death camps at Auschwitz. They are believed to be the first group of students from Palestine to visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. The trip to Auschwitz was part of a joint project with the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, whose purpose was to teach Palestinian and Israeli students about the \\"suffering that has helped shape the historical consciousness of the other side\\". (For their part, the Israeli students visited the Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem.) After the Israeli newspaper Haaretz wrote about the trip, and the Hebrew article was mistranslated into Arabic, Dajani was vilified as a \\"traitor\\" and \\"collaborator\\" by some Palestinians. Al-Quds University issued a statement saying Dajani and the students were acting in a \\"personal capacity\\", and the faculty union expelled Dajani. On May 18, he submitted a letter of resignation, \\"hoping the university authorities would reject it and denounce the campaign against him. Instead, he received a response from the university personnel department that his resignation would take effect on June 1.\\" In January 2015, Dajani's car was set on fire and destroyed in front of his home. Dajani told The Times of Israel that the attack saddened him more than it frightened him. Later that year, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. In September 2016, Dajani told Haaretz he was moving back to Jerusalem and that he was \\"hoping and thinking about organizing\\" another trip to Auschwitz, but he didn't want the details published.

She also played an important role in developing competitive riding in Saskatoon. Life Wynona (\\"Nonie\\") Croft Mulcaster was born on 10 April 1915 in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. She was interested in horses, and often made them the subjects of her early drawings. She was thirteen when she became owner of her first horse. In 1935 she rode in the Prince Albert Horse Show. Mulcaster died in August 2016 at the age of 101 at her ranch in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. =Education= Mulcaster studied art under Ernest Lindner from 1935 to 1945. One of her motives was to learn how to draw horses. In 1942 she obtained a BA in Art and English from the University of Saskatchewan. She studied under Henry George Glyde and A. Y. Jackson at the Banff School of Fine Arts in 1946, and under Arthur Lismer at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts School of Art and Design in 1947. Mulcaster participated in Emma Lake Artist's Workshops led by Joseph Plaskett, Will Barnet and Kenneth Noland. The Canada Council gave her a grant that let her visit major art galleries in Europe in 1958–59. In 1976 she was awarded a Master of Fine Arts at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. =Teacher= Okema beach, Emma Lake, December 1939. Left to right: Nonie Mulcaster, Dr. Leslie Saunders, Bodil Lindner, Ernest Lindner (?), Edith Cook (?) In the late 1930s, Mulcaster helped establish what would later become the Emma Lake Artist's Workshops in Emma Lake in northern Saskatchewan. She was to attend workshops there from 1937 until 1993. Between 1937 and 1943 she taught art to school children in Prince Albert and rural Saskatchewan. Mulcaster became a teacher at the Saskatchewan Teachers' College in Saskatoon in 1943, and was Director of Art Education there from 1945 to 1948. One of her students at the teacher's college in 1947 was Henry Bonli (1927–2011). Otto Rogers (born 1935) attended Saskatoon Teacher's College in 1952-53, where Mulcaster introduced him to cubism, a style he was to adopt for himself. Mulcaster helped establish the Canadian Society for Education through Art in 1955 in Quebec City. Charles Dudley Gaitskell was elected the first president. From 1964 until 1977 Mulcaster was Associate Professor in the Department of Visual Art at the University of Saskatchewan. Her students included Robert Murray and Allen Sapp. Allen Sapp made oil and acrylic paintings of life on an Indian reservation. Mulcaster said his paintings were marked by a personal realism, recording the people, landscape, and animals with restraint, freshness and honesty. =Horses= In 1945 Mulcaster became the unpaid instructor at the Saskatoon Pony Club, where she taught until 1973. She helped to get a pavilion built for the club on the Exhibition grounds, and managed to obtain noted guest instructors for riding clinics. Many riders were influenced by Mulcaster, including Valerie Johnson Matheson, who represented Canada at the Pan-American Games in 1967, and Cathy Wedge, who competed for Canada at the Pan-American Games in 1971 and the Olympic Games in 1976. Wedge was on the Canadian team that won gold at the 1978 world championships. Gina Smith won a bronze medal at the 1988 Olympic Games and a gold medal at the 1991 Pan- American Games. Mulcaster was inducted into the Saskatoon Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. =Artist= Mulcaster works were mainly in acrylics on canvas or paper. She is known for her prairie landscapes, which show the form and vitality of the land and the sky. She was given a Lifetime Award for Excellence in the Arts by the Saskatchewan Arts Board in 1993. As of 2014 she lived in San Miguel de Allende. Mulcaster's work has been widely exhibited in Canada. Richard Simmins, first director of the Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery in Regina when it opened in 1953, arranged an exhibition of Ten Artists of Saskatchewan 1955. He featured young landscape artists such as Mulcaster, Reta Cowley and Dorothy Knowles and abstract painters such as Henry Bonli who later became well known. In March 1975 her work was included in an exhibition of Major Saskatchewan Artists at the Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon. Mulcaster's work is now held in many public and private collections. These include the Saskatchewan Arts Board in Regina, the Canada Council Art Bank in Ottawa, the MacKenzie Art Gallery, the Mendel Art Gallery and the Glenbow Museum in Calgary.

Fans were dancing, cheering, and waving pom poms. However, 35 people were arrested by the police for starting fires and overturning cars in celebration of Connecticut's second men's and fifth women's national championships. The university police reported that a dozen of fires were set outside and two cars were overturned at the Celeron Square apartment complex about a mile month of campus following Connecticut's victory over Georgia Tech. Connecticut became the first school ever in Division I to win NCAA titles in men's and women's basketball in the same season. The Huskies would repeat this feat in 2014.

Alongside a foreword by President George W. Bush, it features articles from academics and businesspeople, including five winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Background The 4% Solution was published by Crown Business and edited by Brendan Miniter. It was the first book produced by the George W. Bush Institute, a think tank located at the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas.Book Review: “The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs” – George W. Bush Institute, HACER, August 15, 2012George W. Bush promotes economic ideas in new book , WAFF, July 15, 2012Jamie Stengle, Bush institute launches book on economic growth, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, July 18, 2012Sonia Smith, George W. Bush's Armchair Economic Advice, Texas Monthly, July 17, 2012 The foreword is written by George W. Bush, who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. At the end of his presidency, the nation was headed into the Great Recession due to a downturn in the economy and the Financial crisis of 2007–2008.Peter Baker, Enlisting Economists, Bush Adds Book to Fiscal Debate, The New York Times, July 14, 2012 The idea for the book was originally conceived as part of the 4% Growth Project at the Bush Institute, which called for setting sustained annual 4% gross domestic product (GDP) growth as a target for national policy makers. A 4% growth rate would be significantly higher than growth rate the nation experienced during the period between the end of World War II and the Great Recession that began in 2008. The average growth rate for that period is approximately 3%. As part of the 4% Growth Project, the Bush Institute held an economic conference on the campus of SMU in May 2011, where leading economists (including Ed Prescott and Robert Lucas) offered ideas on how to spark significant economic growth in the United States. Following the conference, the Bush Institute decided to produce a book offering specific ideas on how to grow the economy at an accelerated rate. To produce the book, essays were commissioned from several economists who attended the May conference at SMU and from other leading thinkers. The book is built on the premise that significant economic growth is possible even in the highly-developed economy of the United States. The book is also built on the belief that a free-market approach of lower taxes and less government regulation can help foster such growth. The book was published on July 17, 2012.Texas PolicyCast: The 4% Solution, Texas Public Policy Foundation, July 19, 2012 Promotional efforts On July 17, 2012, President Bush presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Following President Bush's remarks at Parkland, Brendan Miniter (the editor of the book and an author of a chapter) and Jason J. Fichtner and Kevin A. Hassett (both chapter authors) gave remarks about the content of the book. The discussion was moderated by James K. Glassman, then executive director of the George W. Bush Institute. The presentation was broadcast five times on Book TV from August to December 2012. It was also presented by Amity Shlaes and Brendan Miniter at the Harvard Club of New York.William McGurn, The 4% Solution, Ricochet, July 27, 2012 Moreover, the Philadelphia Media Network published an excerpt by Brendan Miniter.Brendan Miniter, The 4% Solution: Reaching potential through growth, Philly.com, July 15, 2012 It was also promoted by George W. Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, who served as the Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.Michael Noer, Jeb Bush: We Must Grow Out of Our Economic Crisis, Forbes, August 02, 2012 He suggested the book should be used by then presidential candidate Mitt Romney to offer a bold vision for leadership and win the election, instead of simply criticizing President Barack Obama's policies. Content The book contains essays by academics and businesspeople, five of which are Nobel Prize-winning economists: Robert Lucas, Gary Becker, Edward Prescott, Vernon Smith and Myron Scholes.Charles Blahous, Jason J. Fichtner , The 4% Solution , Mercatus Center, July 02, 2012 The book features chapters on education, energy, immigration, monetary, regulatory, and tax policy as well as other issues. There is also a chapter on the housing industry by Vernon Smith and Steve Gjerstad that offers new research into the role housing plays in predicting the direction of the national economy. The target of sustained 4% annual GDP growth is not universally accepted among economists. Even some of the authors of chapters in The 4% Solution disagree that such an accelerated growth rate is possible on a sustained basis in the United States. Robert E. Lucas, Jr., for example, is noted in an introductory chapter as being skeptical that such a growth rate is sustainable in the U.S. His caution is particularly noteworthy because he was a leading economic growth theorist. He also wrote a paper for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in 2004The Industrial Revolution Past and Future that considered economic growth rates throughout history and calculated that global economic growth rates were stagnant at 1% before the industrial revolution and have accelerated in the centuries since to reach around 4% globally. But, as noted in the book, global growth of 4% is possible because several countries, such as China, can grow at a much faster rate as they \\"catch up\\" to more industrialized nations, while its hard for those nations already industrialized to grow at such a rate for a sustained period of time. According to a review published in The New York Times, \\"The ideas in the book include lowering corporate tax rates, shifting away from taxing income to taxing consumption and property, promoting innovation by letting professors keep gains from their research, expanding free-trade pacts with Japan and other countries, refocusing immigration policy to recruit more high-skill workers, and expanding the work force by lowering payroll taxes on employees with children.\\" Critical reception In The Daily Beast, Paul Begala wrote that Bush was \\"right to focus on growth\\", adding \\"Growth is the secret sauce.\\"Paul Begala, Paul Begala on George W. Bush’s Very Bad Economic Advice, The Daily Beast, July 29, 2012 The Asia Times \\"agree[d] with the authors of the Bush Institute volume that the entrepreneurial engine can be jump-started\\" as opposing to \\"derid[ing]\\" entrepreneurship as \\"as in Obama's now infamous \\"You didn't build that!\\" gaffe\\".Spengler, The Bush Institute bells the cat, Asia Times, August 1, 2012 However, they suggested the book's solutions were \\"like Pascal's wager\\". Adding that \\"economics is more like medicine than rocket science,\\" they suggested that those solutions would have to be tested to know if they would lead to positive results. They concluded that should those solutions not be applied immediately (in 2012), \\"the medicine may no longer work\\" four years later (in 2016).

She was also the wife of Date Masamune. She was also known as Lady Tamura (田村御前). After fulfilling her pravrajya, her posthumous Buddhist name was Yōtokuin (陽徳院).  Life  In 1579, she married her second cousinFrom Megohime's lineage, her paternal grandmother (Tamura Takaaki's wife) and maternal grandmother (Lady Yakata, Sōma Akitane's wife) were both daughters of Tanemune Date, Masamune's great-grandfather. Masamune at the age of twelve. Unfortunately, her wet nurse was killed by Masamune, who suspected that betrayers from the Tamura clan were involved in the assassination attempt on him. It is said that her marriage got worse for a while because many other handmaidens serving her were executed. However, after she moved to the Date residence in Jurakudai in Kyoto, her marriage seemed to be restored and she gave birth to Irohahime (Matsudaira Tadateru's wife) in 1594. From there, she had four children with Masamune, including Irohahime, Date Tadamune (the second lord of the Sendai Domain), Munetsuna Date, and Takematsumaru Date.Since the Tamura family had no daughter other than Megohime, when Megohime married Masamune, the agreement was reached that the Tamura family would adopt their second son, but the second son, Munetsuna died young at the age of 16. Even after she lived in the Date residence in Jurakudai, she might have played a role of a woman diplomat to inform Masamune of the Kyoto situation. In a letter addressed to him, she wrote: > \\"The world has not been stabilized yet. You should decide your course of > action in accordance with the cause of the universe. Don't worry about me. I > always have a knife with me. I'll promise not to be shamed.\\" When Masamune died on June 27, 1636, she entered the Buddhist priesthood under the Ungo Zenji and called herself Yōtokuin.Before the seventh anniversary of Masamune's death, a wooden statue of him was created by the order of Megohime and it is a valuable historical material to tell his appearance. Megohime died on February 21, 1653, at the age of 86.Ōshima Kōichi, Ichinoseki Domain (Clan Stories Series), , page 15 It was the same day as the mensiversary of Masamune's death. Her graveyard is located in the Yotokuin mausoleum near the Zuigan-ji Temple.Ungo Zenji, a doshi (ceremony leader), left word about Megohime which tells her character, saying \\"she managed a household very well and was a merciful wise wife.\\" The statue of Megohime in a nun's attire kept in the Zuigan-ji Temple is beautiful and she seemed to be a woman nicknamed as \\"a beautiful princess\\". It is said that she was Christian temporarily. Megohime once had a shrine in the precincts of Aoba Shrine, but has since been moved to the main shrine.The excavation research on Zuihōden in 1974 showed that her husband, Masamune had blood type B and her son, Tadamune, A-type blood, and therefore it is assumed that Megohime had A- or AB-type blood.

He is a leading artist from Amaṯa, in north-western South Australia. His work has been shown in exhibitions since 2003, in several cities in Australia and other countries. His first solo exhibition was held in 2004 in Melbourne. Examples of his paintings are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Flinders University. Early life Burton was born in 1937. He was born near what is now Pipalyatjara, in north-west South Australia. A member of the Pitjantjatjara people, his childhood was spent living a traditional lifestyle in the bush. When he was still a child, Burton and his parents came out of the desert and settled at Ernabella. As a young man, Burton worked as a ringer at the large cattle station called Curtin Springs. He later moved to Amaṯa where he worked building dams, fences and cattle yards outside the town. He also later worked on a building project in Ernabella. Burton was a senior custodian of traditional Pitjantjatjara law (' or Dreaming). His father's homeland, to the west of Irrunytju, is closely associated with the (Caterpillar Dreaming) and the (Red Kangaroo Dreaming). His mother is from Lake Wilson, about 170 km South-west from Yulara. These legends are the subjects of many of his paintings. Painting Burton started painting in 2002. He paints for Tjala Arts, Amaṯa's community-based art company. When he started, the company was called Minymaku Arts. Painting among Pitjantjatjara was originally done by women only (minymaku means \\"women's\\"). Men did not join the women until several years later, because they were afraid of revealing too much spiritual knowledge (which in Western Desert cultures is meant to be kept secret). Burton was one of the first men at Amaṯa to begin painting; the company changed its name to Tjala Arts in 2004, after several other men joined him. The art community at Amaṯa is still strongly conservative. Only the basics of traditional beliefs are described in their works. To keep the meanings of his paintings hidden, Burton uses dotting and other techniques to disguise sacred figures and ancient symbols. He is a strong supporter of maintaining strict forms of secrecy when it comes to art produced in his community. He is now a board member of Tjala Arts, and often coordinates projects and exhibitions with the other artists. Burton's early paintings represent legends from his family's Dreaming. They also show strong Christian influences. Burton was taught by Presbyterian missionaries when he was growing up at Ernabella, and he mixed these beliefs with his family's Dreaming. When he was older, he was ordained as a minister, and is now a senior member of the Church on the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. Since the later part of 2011, Burton and several other men from Amaṯa have led a project to change the subject of their artists' work. Instead of depicting sacred Dreaming knowledge, he and the other board members of Tjala Arts have encouraged their artists to paint about other things (such as the landscape or wildlife). Burton and the other leaders decided that the popularity of Western Desert art had resulted in people asking too many questions about their traditional designs and too much secret knowledge being revealed. The centre's first exhibition under this project was held in March 2012, in Alice Springs. The exhibition was called Punu-Nguru (From the Trees) and its paintings depicted traditional designs of trees from the artists' home countries. Burton died on 27 February 2017 in Ernabella aged 80. Awards Burton had paintings chosen as finalists for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards in 2011 and 2012. In 2014 received the Red Ochre Award.Hector Tjupuru Burton wins top Indigenous art prize Vogue Living Australia References Category:Indigenous Australian artists Category:Artists from South Australia Category:Australian painters Category:Pitjantjatjara Category:2017 deaths Category:1937 births ","title":"Hector Burton"},{"id":"43403099","text":"Parapoynx epimochla is a moth in the family Crambidae.

Accounts compiled by the Moro Women's Center in General Santos City state that 1,500 male Moros aged 11–70 were killed inside a mosque, 3,000 women and children aged 9–60 were detained – with the women being raped – and that 300 houses were razed by the government forces. The massacre occurred two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in September 1972. The massacre started after the first four days on the feast of Ramadan when members of the Philippine Army arrived and captured barangay officials along with 1,000 other Muslims. For more than a month, the military murdered residents of the area. Testimonies show that victims were made to strip and dig their own graves before being killed by gunshot. Remuneration for victims In 2011, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front sought compensation for the Moro victims of martial law violence in the wake of the distribution of $7.5 million in compensation for more than 1,000 individuals who filed a class action suit against the Marcoses. The MILF claimed that thousands of Moros were killed in massacres such as what took place in Malisbong, perpetrated by soldiers and state-sponsored paramilitary forces during martial law. These included the Manili massacre, Kauswagan massacre, Tictapul massacre, Patikul massacre and Pata Island massacre. In 2014, the Philippine government finally recognized 1,500 Moro residents of Malisbong village killed in the massacre as martial law victims. Representatives of the Commission on Human Rights helped facilitate the claims of the survivors and the families of the massacre victims to the Php 10 billion fund set by the government for the indemnification of human rights victims during the martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos, in keeping with the provisions of Republic Act No. 10368, or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013.

The United States border station was built in 1933, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The Canada border station was built in 2007, replacing the previous facility that was built in 1954. This crossing was a historical flashpoint during the bloodless Aroostook War of the 1830s, in which the US and Great Britain disputed the border's location. That dispute was ended with the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842. United States station Fort Fairfield border station as seen in 1934Open 24 hours a day, the United States border station is located about west of the international border, on the north side of Boundary Line Road. It consists of a single Colonial Revival brick building, with flanking garage sections (for performing vehicle inspections), and a projecting two-lane porte-cochere. The building is 1-1/2 stories in height, five bays wide, and topped by a gable roof. On either side are banks of four garage bays, some of which have been repurposed as office space and no longer serve their historic function. The main entrance to the building is now through a lobby area in one of the former garage bays on the west side. The interior of the building is divided into sections for customs and immigration processing respectively.Paul, Daniel; Starzak, Richard (2011). NRHP nomination for US Border Crossing - Fort Fairfield; available by request from the Maine SHPO Prior to the construction of this station, customs and immigration formalities took place at offices in the town of Fort Fairfield. With the advent of increased automobile traffic in the 1920s, as well as the need to interdict the movement of contraband liquor due to Prohibition, the federal government realized the need for border stations where immigration formalities and vehicle inspections could be performed close to the border, and consequently planned the construction of a series of such stations. The Fort Fairfield station is a \\"Type 1\\" rural station that was probably designed by Louis A. Simon, head of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury Department, and was built in 1933 with funding from the Public Works Administration. It is the only surviving station of this type to retain the original height of its porte-cochere. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014 for its architecture and historical associations. Canada Border Inspection station The Canada border station is one of the few on the border that is larger than the US station. It includes two buildings. The current border station was built in 2007. Prior to that, Canada used a 1950s-era brick facade template similar to that still in use at the Piegan-Carway Border Crossing.

An Idea of Buffer State  Lieutenant-General Rozanov with Japanese officers. In 1919 the White forces in Western Siberia were defeated by the Reds. Now the main threat for the young Soviet State was in Europe (Poland). The Russian Far East was occupied by the forces of different foreign countries (mainly Japan). The Central Committee of Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RCP(b)) issued an order \\"to find a way of solving the complicated question of Eastern Siberia, trying to avoid a military conflict with Japan\\". At the end of December the SR-led Political Centre had overthrown Aleksandr Kolchak in Irkutsk. During negotiations with the Revolution Military Council of the Red 5th Army in January 1920, the Political Centre offered to organize a buffer republic in the Far East region with Irkutsk as its capital. Alexander Krasnoshchyokov - representative of the Irkutsk Revolution Committee - offered a similar idea. The Soviet government rejected the attempt of the Political Centre to lead the creation of such a buffer state, but the idea itself was approved. At that time, Vladivostok - the capital of Maritime Territory - was ruled by general Sergey Rozanov, who was subordinated to Admiral Kolchak. At the beginning of January, 1920, an underground bolshevik's conference in Vladivostok decided to organize an uprising against Rozanov with the slogan \\"Whole power to Soviets!\\". In the middle of January a strong group of cooperative merchants and Zemstvo members organized itself in Vladivostok to oppose the Rozanov's dictatorship. The Bolsheviks in Vladivostok realized that establishing a Soviet regime in the Maritime Territory could slow the evacuation of foreign troops and Japanese troops could fight against the rebels, and decided to transfer the power to the Zemstvo Board after overthrowing the Rozanov dictatorship. On January, 26, military revolution organisations created a United Revolution Operation Staff, led by Bolsheviks. It was decided to start the uprising on January, 31.  Vladivostok Uprising  At the same time, the White authorities had learned about the revolutionary mood in the Jager Battalion and had decided to disarm it, but the soldiers arrested the officers and created a Battalion Committee. General Rozanov then engaged Gardes de la Marine and Junkers to suppress the mutiny. On January, 26, after a fierce battle, the White Guards managed to surround the Jager Battalion, disarm it and send it to Russky Island, but this could not prevent the following events. In the night of January, 31, the Vladivostok Uprising began, and by the middle of the day, the whole city was captured by the rebels. Foreign troops had to keep neutrality, but helped Rozanov to flee and escape to Japan. The Provisional Government of Zemstvo of Maritime Territory set as goals: * To free the political prisoners * To destroy the remains of Kolchak Dictatorship * To reestablish social and political freedoms * To organize a public control over the trade and industry * To organize the food supplying and trade * To remove foreign troops The Bolsheviks organized a party conference at the beginning of February and decided to support the Provisional Government of Zemstvo of Maritime Territory, on the condition of keeping a significant Bolshevik influence in it (especially in the military and organizing sections).  Building of a Buffer State  For the organization of the buffer state, the Central Committee of RCP(b) created on March, 3, the Dal'biuro (, an abbreviation of \\"Дальневосточное бюро\\" - \\"Bureau for Far East\\"). I.G.Kushnarev, S.G.Lazo and P.M.Nikiforov became the Vladivostok members of the Dal'biuro. But the members of the Dal'biuro had different opinions about the creation of the buffer state: for example, in Vladivostok, Kushnarev supported an idea of buffer state, but Lazo was against it. By the middle of March, 1920, a representative of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee - V.D.Vilenskij - arrived at Vladivostok with party's directives about the creation of the buffer state. Between March 16 – 19, during the Territorial Party Conference in Nikolsk- Ussuriysky Lazo contradicted Vilenskij. Lazo said: \\"We don't have to organize here the democratic buffer. If the centre wish us to organize a buffer - it will be a soviet buffer\\". The Conference members supported Lazo. The Centre representatives had to compromise between the will of the people and strategic necessity. To stop the spontaneous sovietizing of the Maritime Territory, the Siberian Revolution Committee sent a message (transferred by Kushnarev, who returned from Moscow): \\"There is a process of organizing a government in Verkhneudinsk; Alexander Krasnoshchyokov is our representative there. All Far Eastern governments should coordinate their movements and organize themselves similar to Transbaikal government\\". In this situation the Dal'biuro decided on March 29, to stop the sovietizing of the Maritime Territory and to offer the Regional Zemstvo Administration to expand its authority by a special law over the whole Russian Far East. On March 31, the Zemstvo issued such a declaration and organized an election for a People's Assembly on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. This people's Assembly of Primorye elected the Council of Ministers headed by a A.S. Medvedev of the PSR. The Government of the Zemsko Administration was also preserved.  Far Eastern Republic and Zemstvo of Maritime Territory  On April 6, 1920 an Assembly of workers of the Western Transbaikal Region proclaimed in Verkhneudinsk the creation of the Far Eastern Republic. The \\"Declaration of creation of an independent Far Eastern Republic\\" set as purpose uniting the whole Russian Far East. Therefore there became two pretenders for the position of its capital: Vladivostok and Verkhneudinsk. The Amur Oblast, with its pro-Soviet government, recognized Verkhneudinsk, but the Russia Eastern Outskirts wanted to negotiate with Vladivostok. Grigory Semyonov - head of Russia Eastern Outskirts - and N.P.Pumpianskij - representative of Maritime Territory government - met at Manzhouli railway station, but couldn't agree about the unification. The directions of the Siberian Revolution Committee weren't too strict, and the Bolsheviks of Vladivostok used this situation for supporting the idea of making Vladivostok the capital of the Far Eastern Republic. This situation was favourable for Semyonov, because the Maritime Territory Popular Council negotiated with Semyonov's government as equals. On August 13, 1920, the Political Bureau of Central Committee of RCP(b) approved \\"The Short Thesises about the Far Eastern Republic\\". After reading it, representatives of Vladivostok in Verkhneudinsk signed a preliminary agreement with the government of the Far Eastern Republic, recognizing Verkhneudinsk as its capital. On August 24, 1920, at the Khadabulak railway station, Grigory Semyonov and representatives of the Maritime Territory Popular Council signed an agreement about the unification of the Maritime Territory and the Transbaikal Territory under the leadership of the Maritime Territory government. Representatives of the Transbaikal Territory should have one third of the places in the united Popular Assembly of the Far East. Semyonov agreed to organize an election in the Transbaikal Territory according to the election law of the Maritime Territory. But the Maritime Territory Popular Council rejected to ratify this agreement. In October, 1920, Chita (capital of Russia's Eastern Outskirts) was captured by the Reds. At the Chita Conference (October, 28 – November, 11) three local governments (the Transbaikal Government, Amur Government, and Maritime Government, which also ruled the Kamchatka and Chukotka Peninsulas) joined in the united Far Eastern Republic. Only formally part of the Far Eastern Republic, and with Japanese troops still present, the Zemstvo of Maritime Territory kept a certain autonomy. A new Provisional Priamurye Government would be created between May 27, 1921 and October 25, 1922 in the Maritime Territory after a coup by White forces supported by the Japanese Army.

The Bemis Brothers Bag Company established the town in 1900 to be the site of a cotton mill and housing for the mill workers. A area of Bemis was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as the Bemis Historic District. Much of the area is also a local historic district. History Around 1900, Judson Moss Bemis, founder and head of the Bemis company, decided to that it would be advantageous for his company to have a cotton mill in a cotton-growing area in the southern United States. The site in Madison County was selected after the county government agreed to purchase near the Illinois Central rail line and transfer it to the bag company for the project. Construction began in 1900 and the first mill, with capacity of 21,000 spindles, was in operation by June of the following year. A planned community was built around the production facilities, largely under the direction of Albert Farwell Bemis, the son of Judson Bemis. Albert Bemis had trained as a civil engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He endeavored to make the community appear to have grown over time. Several distinct residential neighborhoods were built around the mill buildings. Each neighborhood had its own set of varied house designs patterned upon the region's characteristic house styles, including shotgun and double shotgun, cubical, L-plan, and hall-and-parlor designs. The first of the residential neighborhoods, named Old Bemis, was built in 1900. A second neighborhood, named Bicycle Hill, was built in 1903 to support a new mill facility that opened that year. A segregated neighborhood for African American workers was created on a street named Congo Street (later renamed Butler Street) between 1903 and 1905. Additional residential areas were built later, including the Silver Circle neighborhood in 1919–1921 and West Bemis in 1926. Community facilities provided in Bemis included schools, churches, sidewalks, fire protection services, company stores, a United States post office, a hotel, a boarding house, a railroad depot, an 850-seat auditorium designed by Massachusetts architect Andrew Hepburn and completed in 1922, a YMCA building, a swimming pool, parks, a bath house, a six-hole golf course, and a company farm. Atypical for a company town, employees were not required to live in Bemis; transportation services were available for employees living elsewhere. The mills at Bemis produced complete lines of fabric sheeting and thread for shipment to other Bemis company facilities for use in sewing bags. In 1950, the company reported that its mills in Bemis held 50,000 spindles and 1,710 looms and that they employed 1,250 workers who processed 26,000 bales of cotton annually, producing 50 million yards (45,720,000 m) of cotton cloth and one million pounds (about 450,000 kg) of thread. The success of the community for the Bemis Company helped encourage the company to establish a second company town, Bemiston in Alabama (now part of Talladega), in the late 1920s. Around 1965, the Bemis company began a process of selling off the company town. Workers were given the opportunity to purchase houses with company financing. By the end of the decade, most of the houses had been sold. In 1977, Bemis was annexed by the city of Jackson. In 1976, Bemis lost its status as a postal city, but the post office continued to operate. The Bemis Company sold the mills in 1980. The new owner operated them until 1991. In 1991, the year that the mills closed, Bemis was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Bemis Historic District. The listing included and 511 contributing buildings, three contributing sites, eight contributing structures, and one contributing object. Buildings of particular interest in the historic district include the cotton mill building, the auditorium which now houses the Bemis Museum; and the Bemis United Methodist Church, built in 1908 as the Union Church to serve residents all faiths and later dedicated as a Methodist church after several other denominations had built churches in Bemis. In 2014, the city of Jackson announced plans to tear down the Bemis Mill and create a memorial park on the site where it stood. Although the mill was included in the Bemis National Register historic district, it was not part of the local historic district, so it was not protected by local historic district regulations against demolition of historic properties. It has been noted by Tennessee Historical Society authors that shotgun houses were disappearing due to negative real estate pressure in nearby downtown Jackson, Tennessee, but were valued and being preserved by homeowners and the community of Bemis. Industrial facilities currently operating in Bemis include the cotton gin and a modern cotton warehouse located south of the old Bemis Mill.

It premiered on ABC as the ABC Movie of the Week on October 4, 1972. Plot Lonnie, a former star athlete in high school, now works for low pay as a tow truck driver on a racetrack. When he spots his wife, Crystal, rendezvousing with Harold Duncan, a stock car driver, at a bar he attempts to force her to come home but she leaves with Harold instead. Lonnie chases them down the road in his truck and their car rolls over down a hillside while driving away and catches fire. Lonnie attempts to rescue his wife from the blazing vehicle but fails. In his anger he beats Harold's head in with the car's bumper. He is taken away from his two sons and sent to prison for four years for the assault. His cellmate teaches him how to run gimmicks in prison, and he begins recording personalized love songs on vinyl for other inmates. He gets prison tattoos of his sons' names in a heart and Crystal's name in a rose on his right arm and a lucky symbol on his left arm. Upon his release he finds that his newspaper clippings from high school are no longer being displayed in town. He visits Crystal's grandmother, with whom he left his sons, but she does not recognize him and calls him \\"Larry\\", the name of her other grandson. Lonnie asks about his sons but she explains that she has suffered a stroke and was forced to sell Lonnie's things from his trailer and give the children to her cousin Slye, and his wife. Her cousin has lost his job and moved his wife and Lonnie's sons across the country. He spends a night drinking and dancing with Bebe Lotter, an old acquaintance from the racetrack who also performed once at the prison, and asks her to put in a good word for him to get a different job at the racetrack. She is hurt by the question because of her feelings for him, and sends him away, but he convinces her to help him find his sons and she lets him stay the night with her, promising to always be there for him. Bebe gets Lonnie work driving in the stock car races, but he wrecks the car in the first race and ends up owing money to the car's owner as well as several people with whom he made bets. He quickly escapes the racetrack and hitchhikes out of town. He stops at a diner where the bored waitress takes pity on him, and gives him a free meal while telling him the story of her own failed dream to become an actress. She takes him home for the night, but knows that he will not stay. Lonnie calls his old employer, Chuck, on New Year's Day and Chuck tells him that Bebe is upset and has been looking for him. Chuck also says that Lonnie's grandmother received a letter from Mildred Slye, and gives Lonnie the return address in Amarillo, Texas. Lonnie hitchhikes there and finds Mildred, but she explains that along the way while she was moving west, she gave the children to a couple of roving fruit pickers, The Maynards, who were heading toward California to pick oranges. Lonnie hitchhikes to California and searches every orange grove, until he finds Wilbur Maynard, but Wilbur explains that the boys ran away three weeks earlier. Lonnie leaves, angrily crying that he doesn't deserve to be happy. Bebe finds him there, and takes him back with her, and she makes missing posters for the kids while he laments his situation, and decides to finally kill Harold over it. He hitchhikes back to the racetrack, and uses a gun to force Harold into a stock car. He holds Harold at gunpoint as Harold drives around the track explaining his perspective on the situation with Crystal, and apologizing for what happened. Lonnie sees Harold's weakness and decides not to kill him. Bebe catches up with him, bringing with her his sons she has found in the meantime.

An additional branch was completed in 1960. Overflow tank for Winnipeg aqueduct prevents pressure rise if water demand is low. Tache Ave. Winnipeg near History The first water supply system in Winnipeg was installed and operated by The Winnipeg Water Works Company -- a private concern -- which obtained its charter on 30 December 1880. The charter was for a twenty-year period and the works were put into operation in 1882. The source of supply was the Assiniboine River, the intake and pumping station being located on the north bank of the river immediately downstream from the Maryland Street Bridge.City of Winnipeg Municipal Manual, 1959. City of Winnipeg Archives. In April 1899, the City of Winnipeg purchased the plant of the Water Works Company for $237,650, making it a municipally owned and operated utility. At this time, the source of supply was changed from the Assiniboine River to artesian wells. In October 1900, the well supply was placed in operation. Between 1900 and 1908, a group of seven wells was dug. These averaged about 18 feet (5.5 metres) in diameter and varied in depth from . In some years, their yield was not consistent and it was evident that a more adequate supply was needed for the rapidly increasing city population. On 23 July 1906, a commission was appointed to investigate the best available source of water supply. The commission engaged the services of a group of engineers which, on 29 August 1907, submitted a report that recommended the City to go to the Winnipeg River for its future water supply. The commission endorsed this recommendation and forwarded it to the Winnipeg City Council on 30 October 1907. At this time, the City was undertaking the building of a hydro electric generating station at Pointe du Bois and was committed to the expenditure of a large sum of money. Consequently, the water supply project was postponed until 1912. In 1912, the Public Utilities Commissioner, at the request of the City of Winnipeg, caused an investigation to be made and obtained an engineering report that recommended Shoal Lake -- the western arm of the Lake of the Woods -- as the source of water supply. The engineer's report also recommended sinking of additional wells to maintain a supply until the larger system could be completed. A comprehensive plan was developed in 1913 to form a metropolitan water district to supply not only the City of Winnipeg but several municipalities in the surrounding region. This resulted in the creation of the Greater Winnipeg Water District, incorporated by an Act of the Manitoba Legislature, and receiving Royal assent on 15 February 1913. The Act was passed contingent on the plan being approved by Winnipeg voters. The matter was submitted to vote on 1 May 1913 with 2,226 people in favour and 369 against. On 7 April 1913, the Winnipeg City Council appointed a Board of Consulting Engineers to estimate the cost and general plan of the project to supply the Greater Winnipeg Water District with water from Shoal Lake. This report was submitted on 20 August 1913 and contained the following recommendations: * That Shoal Lake water is of excellent quality for domestic and for manufacturing purposes; * That Shoal Lake can be depended on to furnish all the water required for the Greater Winnipeg Water District until the population shall have reached about 850,000 and with the help of the Lake of the Woods can furnish a practically inexhaustible supply; * That this water be brought from Shoal Lake through a covered concrete aqueduct 84.5 miles in length under open flow conditions to within about eight miles from St. Boniface, thence through a 5-foot 6-inch reinforced concrete circular pipe under pressure to the eastern bank of the Red River, thence through a diameter cast iron pipe in tunnel under the river, and thence through a diameter reinforced concrete pipe to the reservoirs at McPhillips Street. The aqueduct between Shoal Lake and the Deacon Reservoir was to have a capacity of 85 million gallons per day and the pressure portion to be capable of delivering to the McPhillips Street reservoirs about 30 million gallons per day. The engineers estimated the total cost of the intake, Falcon River diversion works, concrete aqueduct, pressure portion, and tunnel to be $13,045,600, excluding costs for land acquisition and for interest charges during construction. The engineering report was adopted by the Administration Board of the Greater Winnipeg Water District on 6 September 1913. A by-law was passed to raise the sum of $13,500,000 for the project by the issue and sale of debentures. The plan was put to Winnipeg voters on 1 October 1913 and was approved by a vote of 2,951 in favour and 90 against. The project was carried out as outlined in the engineering report with the addition of a 250 million gallon reservoir at Deacon (about eight miles west of St. Boniface), a second 5-foot 6-inch pressure pipe from Deacon to the Red River, and a booster pumping station on the east bank of the Red River capable of delivering 50 million gallons per day to the reservoirs at McPhillips Street. Surveying along the route of the aqueduct began in 1913 and construction commenced on 1 March 1914. The first work to be undertaken was the building of a railway, including siding and spurs, a telephone line, clearing and fencing of the right-of-way, and completion of the Falcon River diversion. Construction of the aqueduct began in May 1915 and was virtually completed by the end of 1918. On 29 March 1919, water from Shoal Lake arrived at the McPhillips Street reservoir and distribution to the City of Winnipeg began on 5 April 1919. As a result of steadily increasing demand for water, construction of a booster pumping station adjacent to the Greater Winnipeg Water District's surge tank in St. Boniface was completed in 1950. This station allowed the District to fully develop the capacity of the existing works and to increase the flow to the City of Winnipeg from 30 to 42 million gallons per day. The station was equipped with three 20 million gallons per day pumping units with electrically controlled switchgear and electrically operated discharge valves. This was the first major addition to the District's aqueduct since the original works were completed in 1919. In 1954, the District completed a direct diameter pipe connection between the aqueduct and the Municipality of St. Vital, the cost being borne between the District and St. Vital. A pumping station was paid for and operated by St. Vital. Equipment to fluoridate the water supply was installed at the aqueduct intake and operations commenced on 28 December 1956.  Description The entry structure is located at Indian Bay, Shoal Lake Ontario at . On its way to Winnipeg the aqueduct and railway pass through East Braintree, McMunn, Hadashville, Spruce, Larkhill, Monominto, Millbrook and Deacon stations. http://www.ryerson.ca/~amackenz/history/national/w.html Shoal Lake Aqueduct, retrieved 2014 08 30 The system consists of about of buried concrete unpressurized conduit and of buried pressurized inverted siphons. Over its length the aqueduct crosses eight rivers. The conduit was built using the \\"cut and cover\\" method with an unreinforced concrete arch resting on a cast in place base invert. Sections at road and rail crossings had reinforcing steel. Siphon crossings of rivers were made as reinforced round concrete tubes. The interior dimensions of the aqueduct were selected so that no internal pressure was developed by the water flow; nineteen different interior sections were required. For inspection and maintenance, manholes were provided at approximately 1 mile intervals, which allow insertion of a small boat for inspections. Vent pipes in the manholes allowed controlled entry of air. Structural design was complicated by the widely varying ground conditions, ranging from rock to soft peat soil. In some places, gravel fill was brought in to replace unsuitable material excavated. The depth of backfill was intended to protect the aqueduct from freezing. To allow surface water to drain freely across the path of the aqueduct, inverted siphons were installed at fifty-six locations. Freezing was prevented by ensuring the outlet level was always below water level, preventing cold air from entering the siphon. Since the Falcon River entering Shoal Lake drains a considerable area of muskeg, a dike was built in the lake to prevent brown, organics-laden water from being drawn into the aqueduct. The intake structure included dual intake chambers to allow for maintenance of one while the other was in use. Again, to prevent cold air from entering, the intake level was well below the lake level. Initially the aqueduct terminated at a reservoir built on McPhillips Street, which had been the center of the city's original water system. The design of the project included provisions for an additional reservoir approximately east of the McPhillips reservoir. This would allow for peak loads to be served in excess of the aqueduct's nominal capacity and allow for maintenance shutdowns of the aqueduct without interrupting the city's water supply. The McPhillips reservoir in the north-west part of the city holds 227 megalitres. The Wilkes reservoir in the southern part holds 251 megalitres. The McLean reservoir in the eastern part of the city holds 205 megalitres. The Deacon reservoir near , built in 1972 with eight open cells, holds 8800 megalitres, equal to a 20-day supply for the city. It is named after Thomas Russ Deacon, who as Mayor of the city drove efforts to secure the Shoal Lake water supply. Greater Winnipeg Water District The Greater Winnipeg Water District was a 64.42-square-mile area that included the City of Winnipeg (25.2 square miles), part of the City of St. Boniface (6.84 square miles), part of the City of St. James (7.27 square miles), part of the City of East Kildonan (3.46 square miles), part of the Town of Transcona (4.95 square miles), part of the Municipality of Fort Garry (8.04 square miles), part of the Municipality of St. Vital (5.53 square miles), part of the Municipality of West Kildonan (2.38 square miles), and part of the Town of Tuxedo (0.75 square miles). The District was administered by a Board composed of the Mayor and four other members of the Winnipeg City Council, the Mayor and one member of the St. Boniface City Council, and the Mayors of St. James, East Kildonan, Transcona, Fort Garry, St. Vital, West Kildonan, and Tuxedo. The Mayor of Winnipeg was the ex officio Chairman and the work of the corporation was managed by a Board of Commissioners consisting of one to three persons. The District sold water in bulk — without pressure — and at the same price, to the several participating municipalities. This price was at first based on the cost of maintenance, operation and management, the Greater Winnipeg Water District Act providing that interest and sinking fund charges should be levied on land only. The GWWD Act was amended in 1927 to allow a maximum price of five cents per thousand gallons to be charged, which became effective on 1 January 1938. Any surplus from sales was used to reduce the annual level based on the findings on an equalization board. The District also operated a railway service between St. Boniface and Shoal Lake, and a sand and gravel business.

She is known for her pioneering work in Kathak choreography, especially in dance ballets, and is credited for bringing Kathak, a North Indian-dance style to South India, when she opened her dance school, Natya Institute of Kathak and Choreography (NIKC) in Malleswaram, Bangalore in 1987. She was also the founder director of her dance company, \\"Natya and Stem Dance Kampni\\", an amalgam of NIKC and the STEM Dance Kampni ( founded by her daughter Madhu Nataraj) based in Bangalore.

Early life She was born in Malleswaram, Bangalore to orthodox Konkani Saraswat Brahmin family of Hattangadi Sanjeev Rao, a renowned architect in the city, and Subhadra Bai. She had three brothers and three sisters. At an early age she learnt Hindustani classical music – vocal and instrumental dilruba from Rama Rao, being from an orthodox family where girls didn't learn dance, considered a taboo. However this changed when at age 12, after she and her architect father watched dancer Uday Shankar's troupe perform at BRV Talkies auditorium in Bangalore. Moved by the performance, his father wanted his daughters to learn dance. Her guru Pandit Ramarao Naik, was a disciple of Ustad Faiyaz Khan, and vocalist of the Agra gharana. He ran music and dance school at Benson Town, Bangalore, where various dance and music styles were taught. Here Sohan Lal from Jaipur Gharana was in charge of the Kathak section. Soon, her younger sisters, Uma and Chitra, six years and four years old respectively, started learning Kathak from under Guru Sohanlal, while she at age twelve was considered too old for Kathak. Finally, her father allowed her to start her Kathak training in 1942, with a promise to never dance professionally or on stage, which she was soon break. She learnt from him for next two years. However, when she gave a first performance in 1944, at the Town Hall for a Saraswat Samaj community programme, her father didn't object. After completing her schooling she joined B.A. (hon.) in English literature at Central College, Bangalore in 1945, and later studied at Maharani's College in Bangalore. Here, she formed a club to dance and presented dance-dramas. This paved way for her first major performance, a ballet \\"Sita Haran\\" in 1947, for poor students at Maharani's College. Meanwhile, her father died in 1946, after being cheated in business and incurring heavy losses. Their family home was auctioned within a year and the family moved to a one-room house.

The toilet cleaner is dispensed from an in-tank package. History 2000 Flushes was created by Al Eisen, founder of New Jersey-based Flushco, Inc.US trademark #73176664, \\"2000 FLUSHES\\", CLEANER FOR TOILET BOWLS filed June 30, 1978 According to the company, Eisen's wife asked him to clean the toilet; he hated the job and tried to find a better way. His initial experiment, a cup with chlorine weighted with rocks and installed in the toilet tank, worked well at keeping his toilet clean for months. The idea behind 2000 Flushes was born. The first newspaper advertisements appeared in 1978;New 2000 Flushes automatic bowl cleaner (Boscov's advertisement), Reading Eagle - Nov 11, 1978 in March 1979 this was supplemented by simple broadcast advertising with the tagline If there's one job I hate, it's scrubbing the toilet.Newspaper advertisement, \\"I quit the job I hate most\\", The Pittsburgh Press - Apr 11, 1979 The product was well-enough received in its initial US markets to represent a credible rival to Vanish (brand), which held a dominant market position at the time with a Sani-Flush like crystal toilet bowl cleaner. Before 2000 Flushes could complete its national expansion westward, Vanish began disparaging advertising suggesting calcium hypochlorite toilet cleaners damaged plumbing. In fall 1981, a group of manufacturers led by Twinoak (which made \\"120 Day Automatic Toilet Bowl Cleaner\\" since 1965) obtained an out-of-court settlement against Drackett Company, maker of Vanish. As part of the undisclosed cash settlement, disparaging advertisements were withdrawn. Block Drug purchased Flushco, acquiring \\"2000 Flushes\\" toilet bowl cleaner in 1983. Block distributed multiple versions of the product, such as \\"2000 Flushes Blue\\" and \\"2000 Flushes Powder Foam\\". It sold the brand as part of a larger 1998 corporate restructuring. Al Eisen (as inventor of 2000 Flushes) made personal appearances in many early ads for the product, in which he holds up four fingers and boasts \\"It works up to four months!\\" In October 1993, toilet fixture manufacturers reported rapid degradation of flush valve flappers; some new, water-saving toilets (introduced to meet a 1994 US federal water conservation deadline) were leaking within months of installation. The growing popularity of in-tank drop-in cleaning tablets quickly drew suspicion as many contain chlorine bleach; if a toilet is flushed infrequently, the amount of chlorine in the tank may build to problematic levels. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) began tests of flapper materials in 1994-1997. By 1998, flappers had been redesigned to withstand continuous immersion in 2000 Flushes or Clorox bowl cleaners, then the most popular products.TOILET FLAPPERS: The Weak Link of Water Conservation, John Koeller, P.E, revised July 21, 2004 A rival in-tank cleaner introduced by Vanish in 2000 caused problems until new durability and marking requirements for flappers were added to the ASME A112.19.5 standard in 2005.Toilet flappers - The former weak link of water conservation , Koeller, April 2008 In 2001, San Diego based WD-40 Company acquired Global Household Brands, a company founded in 1998 to acquire X-14, 2000 Flushes and Carpet Fresh. 2000 Flushes is now packaged as a solid tablet for in-tank use, like many of its rivals. There are multiple product versions and reformulations; some add a detergent, some add a concentrated bleach. In 2008, a disinfectant was added to \\"kill 99.9% of bacteria flush after flush\\" in an apparent response to competitive pressures; Ty-D-Bol has claimed to \\"kill 99.9% of toilet bowl germs with every flush\\" since 1994 and crystal bowl cleaners have made claims to \\"kill millions of germs\\" since Sani-Flush's 1911 introduction. While toxicity varies between the differing 2000 Flushes formulations, most are not pet-safe.

The LSG was first created during World War II. As a state defense force, the LSG is a part of the state militia of Louisiana, and can serve as a stateside replacement of the Louisiana National Guard while the National Guard is deployed. Unlike the Louisiana National Guard, the Louisiana State Guard is solely under state control, and cannot be federalized or deployed outside of Louisiana, guaranteeing additional soldiers will always be available to the governor to deploy in response to crises. History of predecessor units Both the National Guard and the state defense forces are descended from the state militias which augmented the relatively smaller professional federal military in times of war. During the War of 1812, numerous Louisiana militia units were raised to aid in the defense of the city during the Battle of New Orleans. Later, in the American Civil War, both Union units and Confederate units volunteered to fight. After the passage of the Militia Act of 1903, state militias were placed under federal control and reorganized as the modern National Guard of the United States, meaning that states who wished to provide a military response to man-made or natural disasters, insurrections, or military invasions while the National Guard was federalized had to raise their own state defense forces to replace these National Guard units. World War II The Louisiana State Guard was authorized by the Louisiana State Legislature in 1942 by a vote of 85-5 in favor of creating the state militia. Unlike other state guards, who were organized and trained around the possibility of repelling an invasion, the Louisiana State Guard was created with the intent to primarily take over civil defense responsibilities such as evacuating civilians during an attack or arresting saboteurs. However, it was not organized until March 1943, due largely to the difficulty of recruiting members when most able-bodied men were being drafted into the federal military. By October 1943, the Louisiana State Guard had reached a strength of nearly 3,000 guardsmen. =Equipment= The War Department agreed to equip state defense forces, though often with outdated equipment. Louisiana was provided with reconditioned military trucks and cars, and obsolete uniforms and weapons, including sixty machine guns. =Plaquemines Parish incident= In October 1943, Louisiana Governor Sam Jones attempted to fill a vacancy for the position of sheriff in the Plaquemines Parish. Simultaneously, Leander H. Perez, an Assistant District Attorney and Democratic political boss of Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes, attempted to fill the position through a special election. ADA Perez raised a local militia of deputies and armed citizens and fortified the town in order to prevent Governor Jones’ appointee from taking office, and Governor Jones moved several State Guard units closer to the parish after a supreme court ruling affirmed the Governor’s right to make the appointment. On October 9, the Governor declared martial law and ordered the State Guard to advance into the parish. Guardsmen in armored cars entered the parish and ended the crisis without meeting any resistance. Disbandment After the end of World War II, the federal government rescinded the right of states to maintain military forces separate of the National Guard. Although many states disregarded such a directive at the time, the Louisiana State Guard was disbanded on June 30, 1947. Later reactivation Louisiana National Guardsman Sgt. Denise Sonnier reaches for a sidewall to secure a trailer full of water, while Sgt. Maj. (Ret.) James Serio, a Louisiana State Guard warehouse manager, stages pallets of water at Camp Villere in Slidell, La. Louisiana later began rebuilding the Louisiana State Guard to a cadre-level organization throughout the 1980s. As of 2003, the Louisiana State Guard was organized as teams of soldiers and desk officers, trained as experts in operations and logistics, and organized for deployment to each parish (county) emergency operations center during a crisis. The Guard contains a pool of retired military personnel that can be called back to active duty if needed. Key Louisiana state employees are also members of the force so they can be mobilized more effectively in order to deal with emergencies. All units of the Louisiana State Guard were deployed in support of the Louisiana National Guard in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Legal basis State defense forces are authorized by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Currently, 23 states and the territory of Puerto Rico maintain active state defense forces. In 2005, state defense forces from several states were activated to aid the National Guard in sheltering the large number of refugees leaving Louisiana and assist in other disaster recovery operations after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. The Louisiana State Guard is also authorized under Louisiana state law in Title 29 §5 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes. Legal protection Employers in the state of Louisiana are required by law to grant a leave of absence to any employees who are members of the Louisiana State Guard who are activated for any military service, and to restore those employees to their previous positions upon their return from their deployment.

Satyabhama (4 November 1937 – 13 September 2015) was an Indian classical dancer, teacher and choreographer, known for her performances and scholarship in mohiniyattam. She is regarded as a matriarch of the classical dance form. She was also well versed in other classical dances of Kerala. She was awarded the Padma Shri, in 2014, for her contributions to the art and culture, by the Government of India. Biography Koothambalam at Kerala Kalamandalam Satyabhama was born in 1937, in a family with limited financial resources, at Shornur, on the coast of Bharathapuzha, in Palakkad, in the south Indian state of Kerala, to Krishnan Nair, a petty businessman and Ammini Amma. She started learning dance, at a very early age, as a part-time student of Kerala Kalamandalam, under the tutelage of Kalamandalam Achutha Warrier and Kalamandalam Krishnankutty Warrier, concurrently with her academic schooling at Government High School, Shornur. After completing her 8th standard there, she joined Kalamandalam as a full-time student. That was when she started learning Mohiniyattom, under the Kalamandalam stalwart, Thottassery Chinnammu Amma, the first long-serving dance teacher at Kalamandalam, though the main focus of study remained Bharatanatyam. Chinnammu Amma introduced the young Satyabhama to various dance techniques such as adavu (basic movements), cholkettu, jathiswarams (syllables and musical notes) in Chenchurutty and Todi. Soon, the young girl came to the notice of the legendary Malayalam poet, Vallathol Narayana Menon, the founder of Kerala Kalamandalam, who nurtured the young aspirant's skills by providing her with a scholarship with which she could pay the school fees. Satyabhama's debut on major stage was in 1955, during the silver jubilee celebrations of Kalamandalam, in front of the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The next six years of study at the institution gave her opportunities to visit Singapore and Malaysia, as a part of the touring Kalamandalam troupe, where she performed Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kathakali. After completing the course, she joined Kalamandalam as a junior teacher. She also had a stint of training from the doyen of classical dance, Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma. It was during this time, Satyabhama met Kalamandalam Padmanabhan Nair, the noted Kathakali guru, widely regarded as the master of Kathakali grammar. Their acquaintance soon took a romantic turn, resulting in their marriage. Satyabhama and Padmanabhan Nair, at the time of the latter's death, had four daughters of which two are active in mohiniyattam. She died on 13 September 2015, aged 77, at a hospital in Palakkad where she was undergoing treatment. Positions Kalamandalam Satybhama was the first woman Vice Principal of Kerala Kalamandalam and, later, became its Principal till she retired in 1992. She sat on the selection committee to decide annual Kalamandalam fellowships She was also functioning as the Dean of Kerala Kalamandalam. Legacy Satyabhama is credited with the adaptation of costumes and hair-do seen in Ravi Varma paintings Kalamandalam Satyabhama quietly retired from performances at a young age of 24 to attend to her duties a teacher and choreographer. As such, she is respected more for her contributions to the dance form than for her on stage performances. Satyabhama is credited with purifying the dance form by weeding out external influences. She modified the performance techniques so that the emotive aspect of the performance strictly sticks to Lasyam. She is also said to have revolutionized the mohiniyattam curriculum at Kerala Kalamandalam which is said to have resulted in the evolution of Kalamandalam style mohiniyattam. She also tried to add more spice into the presentation of the dance form by evoking drama through exaggerated body kinetics through mudras (palm and finger gestures), poses and steps, which at times, have also attracted criticism. Another major contribution of Satyabhama is the changes she has brought to the mohiniyattam costumes. The designs she has created follows Kerala traditions in color, pattern and accessories and have become the signature of Kalamandalam style. She also changed the way the dancer styles the hair, which was vaguely adapted from Raja Ravi Varma paintings. She also left a rich legacy of 35 mohiniyattom compositions, the details of which are narrated in her book, Mohiniyattam - History, Techniques and Performance. Awards and recognitions Satyabhama was honored with several awards and recognitions by regional and national bodies. Apart from the prestigious Padma Shri Award, she was the first to receive the Nruthya Natya Puraskaram of the Government of Kerala in 2005 and the first Swati Tirunal Puraskaram by Kollam Kathakali Club and Ttroupe, in 2006. Some of the notable awards bestowed on Satyabhama are: * Padma Shri - 2014 * Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi Award - 1976 * Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, New Delhi - 1994 * Nruthya Natya Puraskaram of the Government of Kerala- 2005 * Kerala Kalamandalam Award - 1988 * Swati Tirunal Puraskaram * Shadkala Govinda Marar Award - 2013 Kerala Kalamandalam has instituted an award, in honor of Satyabhama, which is distributed to deserving students of mohiniyattam, in the form of a scholarship annually.

It is similar to the SEGA ALL.Net game distribution system. Taito uses NESiCAxLive to distribute not only its own games, but also allows other companies to use it as a publication platform. On its introduction SNK Playmore, Cave, and Arc System Works had agreed to distribute games on NESiCAxLive.Currently 8 games are operated as alone running titles and 29 titles as downloadable titles on candy cabinets. History The system was first revealed in September 2010 at the 48th Amusement Machine Show in Chiba, Japan, as the Taito Vewlix NESiCA arcade cabinet, and was launched on 9 December 2010. The first game to be released for the system was Arc System Works' BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II. Taito introduced the NESiCAxLive 2 system in June 2017. System The NESiCAxLive system consists of an arcade system board combined with a dedicated router to access and download games. The system currently works on the Taito Type X2, Taito Type X Zero, Taito Type X3, and Taito Type X4 arcade boards. The connected machines access the Taito NESYS online network to allow arcade operators to download games from Taito's servers directly to the arcade cabinet; previously arcade operators had to purchase new game boards (as well as dispose of old ones) to run a new game. Games can also be downloaded to a local server to allow quicker distribution to machines, as well as allow rapid swapping in and out of games according to player demand. Taito allows arcade operators to download games free, as part of a revenue sharing system, with income split with Taito and the game developer. The original NESiCAxLive system was originally exclusively available in Japan, however there has been a gradual introduction to the US market. Taito introduced the NESiCAxLive 2 platform in June 2017. The upgraded system allows player versus player competition between machines in different locations, as well having improved CPU and GPU performance.

The label also represents rapper Beenzino. Despite its small size, Illionaire Records was considered one of the most influential hip hop record labels in South Korea due to the popularity of its artists. As of 6 July 2020, Illionaire Records announced via their official social media accounts that they are now defunct.  History  Friends and rappers The Quiett and Dok2 formed Illionaire Records on January 1, 2011. They signed rapper Beenzino later that year. The Quiett later said in an interview with Complex that he wanted to start a small label to avoid the traditional k-pop major label system. \\"On major labels, the money made by the artists is first given to the company to pay the bosses, managers, and staff members. In our case, we’re the bosses,\\" he said. The label has only one employee and none of the three rappers are bound by contracts. The label experienced a surge of popularity in its first few years due to Dok2's many collaborations with Korean-American singer and rapper Jay Park. Illionaire Records toured Korea in the summer of 2012. On November 11, the three artists released the free track \\"Illionaire Gang\\" to coincide with their \\"Illionaire Day Concert.\\" In 2014, the label were the headliners for the \\"Asian Music Festival Summer Concert\\" in New York City on May 21. That summer the label also released a compilation album entitled \\"11:11.\\" Dok2 and The Quiett represented Illionaire Records on the third season of the TV rap competition show Show Me The Money, where they were the producers of winning contestant Bobby of IKON. They, being famous only under-ground, became famous to people after they appeared in the Show Me the Money. Showing the genius recording ability, Illionare Records became even more spotlighted. On 6 February 2020, Illionaire Records announced via Instagram, founding member Dok2 and the label mutually agreed to terminate his contract. No official reason was given for the departure. Illionaire Records announced on 6 July 2020 that they will close their record label via their official Instagram and Twitter account. They stated they will continue to support their artists in their future endeavours. No other reason was provided for their sudden departure.  Subsidiary Projects  Dok2 and The Quiett formed a new label under Illionaire in September 2016. After announcing Ambition Musik, they introduced three rappers, Kim Hyo-eun, Changmo, Hash Swan, and later, Ash Island and Leellamarz through the official Ambition Musik Instagram account. For the first time, Dok2 and The Quiett didn't think to scout Changmo, Ash Island, and Hash Swan, so fans guessed that it would be Superbee and myunDo or Microdot, but it wasn't true. After establishing Ambition Musik, new members joined through Ambition Musik, not Illionaire.  Influence on Korean Hip-Hop  Before Illionaire Records came out, showing off money to people was not ethically right in Korean culture. People used to think that rappers were always having trouble with earning money, and it was actually true as the first generation of Hip-Hop artists had trouble with earning money. However, Dok2 didn't care what other people say or think about him, so he showed him making tons of money with his rap music. Hip-hop used to be a music genre that not many people liked, but Illionaire Records has helped to lead the Hip-Hop culture to the mainstream from the underground.

Especially, the biggest change was accepting Hip-hop culture. Since Korea had really conservative beliefs, it was hard to mingle with a culture that expresses freedom and criticizes society, like Hip-hop does. However, as people's thought has been changed, Hip-hop gained a lot of popularity. Dok2 is one of the pioneers of Hip-hop in Korea.

She was the first daughter of Date Masamune and Megohime, as well as the wife of Matsudaira Tadateru, the sixth son of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Her Buddhist name is Tenrin'in (天麟院).  Life  Irohahime was born in Jurakudai. She was Masamune's first conjugal child. Although the married couple would obviously have been longing for a boy to take over the Date family, the baby born to them was a girl. As Masamune was expecting a son, he personally chose a masculine name. After she was born, however, the name was kept, but pronounced more femininely.\\"They say they gave the child a boy's name because they were anticipating celebrating Kitanokata (legitimate wife; here, Yoshihime) giving birth to an heir.\\" (from Date Jige Kiroku).\\"五郎八\\" is classic common boy name in Japan and usually pronounced as go-ro-hachi with On'yomi, but Masamune pronounces \\"五\\" as \\"i\\" with Kun'yomi against convention to be used as a phonic equivalent of Iroha. Having moved from place to place, from Jurakudai to Fushimi, and then to Osaka, Irohahime was engaged to Ieyasu's son, Tadateru, on January 20, 1599, as part of Ieyasu's strategy for strengthening relationships with powerful daimyō. In 1603, she moved from Fushimi to Edo, and on December 24, 1606, she married Tadateru. Though the two got along, they had no children. In 1616, she divorced Tadateru when he was stripped of his position, and returned to her father, Masamune, thereafter living in Sendai. As she lived in the Nishikan (the west annex) of the main castle in this period, she was also called Lady Nishikan (西館殿). She died on June 4, 1661, at the age of 68. Her grave is in Tenrinin Temple in Matsushima.Zuigan-ji Blue Dragon（Treasure Hall）Now, in the museum annex to Zuigan-ji Temple, beside statues of her father, Masamune, and mother, Yotokuin Yoshihime, there is a statue of their daughter, Tenrinin Irohahime, dressed in priestess's clothes.  Legends  *Irohahime was such a beautiful and intelligent daughter that her father was led to lament, \\"imagine if she had been a boy.\\" Date Tadamune, a younger brother by the same mother, also relied on her for her intelligence. *Irohahime was allegedly a Christian, as her real mother Megohime had been a Christian for a time. When she divorced Tadateru, she was still in her early twenties and her father and mother, concerning about their beloved Irohahime, allegedly asked her to remarry, but she kept refusing. It is generally accepted that she refused offers of marriage throughout the rest of her life, no matter how earnestly her parents and those around her advised her to remarry because she believed in the Christian doctrine, which does not allow divorce. *Because Irohahime was born and raised in Kyoto, her words and customs were also in the Kyoto style. When she moved to Sendai after her divorce, she had a hard time getting used to the Tōhoku dialect as well as Tōhoku's way of living.  In popular culture  She makes an appearance in the NHK taiga drama Dokuganryū Masamune, and she is portrayed by Sawaguchi Yasuko.

Bjarnason (14 December 1867 – 30 October 1941) was an Icelandic politician, suffragist, schoolteacher and gymnast. She was the first woman to become a member of the Althing, the parliament of Iceland. Early life and education Ingibjörg was born in Thingeyri, Iceland, in 1867 to Hakon Bjarnason and Johanna Kristin Þorleifsdóttir, and was one of five children. As a teenager, she moved to Reykjavík after her father died and attended Kvennaskólinn (the Reykjavík Women's College). She graduated from the college in 1882 and relocated to Denmark to study gymnastics, making her the first Icelander to do so. She returned to Reykjavík in 1893 to teach gymnastics at a children's school, and in 1903 she returned to the Women's College as a teacher. She became the school principal in 1906 and held the position for 35 years until her death. Political career She first became involved in the women's suffrage movement in Iceland in 1894. In 1915, when Icelandic women won the right to vote, Ingibjörg was chosen by a women's organisation to address parliament and present a celebratory speech, and was elected the head of a committee which raised funds to build a hospital, Landspítali (the National University Hospital) to commemorate the suffragists' win. She led the Women's Slate, a precursor to the feminist Women's List political party, and in 1922 was elected to the Althing. She thereby became the first woman to sit in the Icelandic parliament. She initially ran as an independent member, but in 1924 she joined the Conservative Party and stayed in office as a Conservative member until 1927. In her political career, she promoted women's and children's rights, although she never married or had children. Career after politics After retiring from politics, she remained active in the Icelandic women's liberation movement, and in 1930 she became the founding chairperson of the women's organisation Kvenfélagasambands Íslands. However, she faced criticism for some women for her alignment with the Conservative Party, for supporting causes such as the establishment of a home economics school, and for suggesting that Icelandic women had achieved full equality when they received the right to vote in 1915. She also served on the Landsbanki committee from 1928 to 1932, and was part of the Icelandic Education Council from 1928 to 1934. She died in October 1941. Legacy In November 2011, 70 years after Ingibjörg's death, it was announced that a vote had passed in the Reykjavík City Council to construct a permanent memorial in Reykjavík in her honour. A celebration was held in the Althing in July 2012 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Ingibjörg's election. References Category:1867 births Category:1941 deaths Ingibjorg H. Bjarnason Ingibjorg H.

The race was \\"one of the chief swimming events in the world\\", with a world record 623 entrants in 1929. The race ceased running in 1991 due to high levels of pollution in the Yarra River. However, the race was also cancelled due to pollution concerns from 1963 until 1987.  Course  The course runs from the old Twickenham Ferry crossing (now MacRobertson Bridge) downstream to Princes Bridge (formerly Prince's Bridge) in the heart of Melbourne. The race has changed course several times throughout history, starting from as far upstream as Macaulay's boatsheds, Studley Park.  Popularity  The race often attracted a large number of spectators, who were able to cheer on competitors from the banks of the river or from floating crafts among the swimmers. The high popularity of the event as a spectator friendly occasion is well documented: \\"It is without a doubt the most popular aquatic event of the season...The banks of the river for the whole three miles were lined with groups of interested spectators, and over the last two miles hundreds of motor-cars followed the race\\" The Australasian, 8 March 1930. \\"Now regarded as the most important long distance swim in Australia...\\" The Referee, 11 March 1931 \\"The race was followed with great attention by many spectators, and the contests were keen\\", The Bathurst Times, Jan 29, 1913. \\"A great crowd of persons of both sexes assembled at the wharf at Grange-road to witness the start of the race, and other spectators were in motor or other boats on the river...The banks of the river on either side of the different bridges were lined with sightseers...On arriving at Princes-bridge there was a large concourse of people to witness the finish.\\" The Age, Jan 27, 1914.  History  The first event was held on January 27, 1913, in which 44 swimmers completed the race conducted by the Victorian Amateur Swimming Association. In following years, the race soon grew to become a premier swimming event with the inclusion of high-profile competitors, notably Ivan Stedman and Frank Beaurepaire. The earliest known footage of the race is from the 1932 event that attracted 549 entrants. The swim began as a handicap race, with a team category (awarded the 3LO Cup) to cater for the local swimming clubs. The Race to Prince's Bridge was held from 1913 - 1963 when the race was halted due to pollution. The annual race was revived in 1987 for two years by Swimming Victoria along with sponsorship from Manchester Unity, however, the race has not run since 1989. Historically, the race has also been referred to by the media as the Annual Three Mile Yarra River Swim and other variations of this name.  Pollution  The Annual Three Mile Yarra River Swim has changed course throughout history and been cancelled due to pollution, a continuing problem faced by the Yarra River, particularly downstream. The Yarra River is particularly polluted after heavy rain events that wash debris and pollutants into the flow. Reporting of the swim in local media and newspapers often mentions the courage of competitors tackling the pollution and debris: \\"After the heavy rains of Friday night the colour of the water was almost chocolate, with a considerable amount of debris floating about.\\" The Australasian, 10 March 1928. \\"Channel Two technical producer Steve Pickering is indulging in a bit of understatement when he says the water in the Yarra River is a bit murky\\" Discussions with The Age's Ron Carter regarding the filming of the 1988 event. Race Official:\\"How was the Yarra?\\" Miss Gill, 1932 female winner: \\"Pretty dirty\\" From the 1932 footage of the race. While the colour of the river is often referenced when describing the state of the river, particularly by swimmers, this is not a major indicator of pollution. The muddy colour of the downstream portions of the Yarra is instead caused by suspended sediment and clay particles resulting from the high turbidity of the Yarra. The Environment Protection Authority delivers regular reports to warn recreational river users of current pollution levels. Information A historical event since the early 20th Century, the Race to Prince's Bridge is a part of Melbourne history. *In the 1914 race, 11-year-old Thomas Holland received a special medal for a plucky race. The young boy's performance (1hr 59min) received \\"great applause\\" at the landing stage. *The prizes for the 1914 event were as follows: 1st Place - £2 2/ trophy and £2 2/ gold medal; 2nd Place - £2 2/ trophy; 3rd Place - £1 1/ trophy; Fastest Time - £1 1/ trophy. * In 1928, \\" more than 1.5cwt (76.2kg) of grease and cocoa-nut oil was applied to the competitors to keep out the cold...\\" *In 1931, J.Campbell, aged above 55 years, had started and finished all 15 3-mile Yarra River Swim events. *J.P Sheedy covered himself in lard and used a rubber breathing apparatus for the 1931 event. *The Twickenham Ferry service (the original start line for the race) was closed after the completion of the MacRobertson Bridge in 1934. *R.

Officials soon discovered that the winner had hopped out of the river during the race, jumped on the back of a motor bike and sneaked into the water again just before the finish.
