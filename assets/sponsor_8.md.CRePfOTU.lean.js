Nothing is known about her life between that year and 363, when Zhang Tianxi seized the throne from his nephew Zhang Xuanjing (Duke Jingdao) and honored her as princess dowager. (The exact title he honored her with is disputed historically; Zizhi Tongjian gave it as Taifei (太妃, translate as princess dowager), while Shiliuguo Chunqiu gave it as Taihou (太后, translate as queen dowager or empress dowager). No other mention was made of her until an arguable one in 376, when Zhang Tianxi, under attack from Former Qin, received a rebuke from, according to historical accounts, \\"his mother Lady Yan.\\" This appears to be an erroneous record, and it was likely Princess Dowager Liu that was referred to, because the records of 363 was unambiguous that Princess Dowager Liu was Zhang Tianxi's mother.

Forewing: costa broadly, apex and terminal margin very broadly black, this black on the termen narrowed towards the tornus, and traversed by a transverse subterminal series of bluish-white spots that are variable in number; the spot in interspace 3 shifted inwards; sometimes the posterior two spots of the series are all but joined onto the streaks of the ground colour between the veins. Hindwing: dorsal and costal margins broadly whitish: terminal margin broadly black, especially at apex, the black area covered, except at the tornus, with specialised opaque-looking scales. Underside: paler blue, the terminal margins of the wings obscurely fuscous, traversed by a subterminal, very indistinct, transverse series of whitish lunulated spots. Forewing: the veins more or less broadly bordered with black, this edging broadened towards the termen; apex broadly, terminal margin decreasingly to the tornus, suffused with a somewhat obscure pearly-while lustre. Hindwing: the subcostal vein and veins 6, 7, and 8 broadly, the rest of the veins very narrowly edged with black; a very fine black line in interspace 1. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings very narrow and white. Antennae black, head, thorax and abdomen fuscous, the thorax clothed with long bluish hairs; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale silvery bluish-white. Female: Female dimorphs Female on Bougainvillea species in Kolkata, West Bengal, India First form. Upperside: black; the markings bluish white. Forewing: cell with two streaks, the anterior one from the extreme base, the posterior one from the end of the basal third, but extending beyond the anterior streak; below and beyond the cell is a series of streaks in the interspaces; the streaks very irregular in length, that in interspace 1 the longest, angulated anteriorly and divided longitudinally from near its base, the streak in interspace 3 short and broad forming an elongate spot, those in the anterior interspaces more or less obliquely placed; beyond these streaks follows a subterminal transverse series of spots, of which the spot in interspace 3 is shifted inwards and those opposite the apex curved backwards. Hindwing: costa and dorsum broadly white; cell and the interspaces beyond with a series of streaks and sub-terminal spots, more or less as in the forewing but more regular; the streak in cell and interspace 1 divided longitudinally, the subterminal series of spots evenly curved. Underside: similar to the upperside, but the ground colour dull, dusky and diffuse, the markings broader but less clearly defined; the apical area on the forewing obscured by a powdering of whitish scales. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen much as in the male but darker. Second form. Very like the first, the markings both on the upper and under sides similar, but the ground colour on the upperside of the hindwing at base of interspace 1a, over the whole of interspace 1, area of cell and at base of interspace 2 suffused with bright yellow. On the underside the same areas are dull ochraceous. The extent of the bright yellow colour on the upperside and of the dull ochraceous tint on the underside is variable, in some specimens more restricted, in others it spreads further towards the costa. The common form of female mimics glassy tiger to avoid predation. The philomela form is rare and identified by yellow colouration at the base of the wings. this form is reported more in north-east India. According to Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth this form mimics Danais aspasia, which is not found west of Myanmar. He rejects the assumption that the wagtail carries the eggs of D. aspasia to India. It seems that in bygone era the D. aspasia might have been found in India in the past along with the common wanderer and later eliminated.

It measured in circumference, and, reportedly, featured branches over long. History In the middle of the 14th century, All Saints church was erected immediately east of the site of the tree. According to folk legend, the tree had previously been a site for pre-Christian worship and may have been a part of a larger grove. In 1795, the oak was severely damaged. The oak was heavily pollarded and the removed bark and some of the wood was sold to the Hardys of Letheringsett for tanning. Norfolk historian Rev. Blomfield recorded use of the oak in the 18th century:Archie Miles :A great oak at bathele near the church, its hollow so large that ten or twelve men may stand within it and a cobbler had his shop and lodge there of late and it is or was used for a swinestry. Deemed dangerous by the local populace, the abuse of the tree lead to its destruction in 1860. The Lord of the Manor Sir Willoughby Jones ordered the tree removed and, with much local mourning, the remains taken carted to Cranmer Hall at Fakenham. The site is now covered by a grove of Holm oaks and is protected by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. Further sources * Leaflet: Joyce E. Stone. 1966.

He had amazing success, taking them to their first finals series in 2001 and their first Grand Final in 2002, losing to the Sydney Roosters. The 2002 Dally M Coach of the Year was awarded to Anderson. He took the Warriors to another Finals series in 2003, the same year he replaced Gary Freeman as head coach of the New Zealand national rugby league team.Daniel Anderson celebrityspeakers.com.au Anderson resigned from the Warriors in June 2004 after a bad start to the season; winning only three out of eleven games. Anderson retained his position as coach of the New Zealand Kiwis until June 2005. St Helens He was appointed the coach of St Helens R.F.C. in 2005, succeeding the previous coach Ian Millward who had been sacked by the club. He left the position at the end of 2008's Super League XIII, returning to Australia. In August 2006, St Helens won the Rugby League Challenge Cup after beating Huddersfield Giants 42–12 at Twickenham in the final. The club then went on to win the 2006 Grand Final. In December 2006, Anderson was rewarded for St Helens' dominance throughout the season when he won the BBC Coach of the Year Award. This was the first time a rugby league coach had received the award. He was also named Super League's coach of the year in 2006 and again in 2007. In February 2007, Anderson won the World Club Challenge with St. Helens, defeating Australian champions, the Brisbane Broncos. He then went on to coach St Helens to win the 2007 Challenge Cup final, defeating the Catalans Dragons 30–8 at the new Wembley Stadium. St. Helens made it to 2007's Super League XII Grand Final at Old Trafford against the Leeds Rhinos, but they lost 33–6. In August 2008 Anderson won the Rugby League Challenge Cup with St Helens for a third successive year beating Hull FC 28–16 at Wembley Stadium. He is the brother-in-law of former Hull Kingston Rovers coach Justin Morgan. He coached St Helens in their loss to the Leeds Rhinos in 2008's Super League XIII Grand Final. Parramatta Eels On 17 November 2008 Anderson was announced the head coach of the Parramatta Eels NRL squad for three years, beginning in 2009. He guided the Eels to a remarkable 2009 National Rugby League Grand Final from a position where after 18 rounds the Eels were tipped 150/1 to win the NRL. On 25 September 2010, it was announced that Anderson's contract had been terminated with immediate effect by the club, who replaced him with Stephen Kearney. On 18 October 2013, it was announced that Anderson would leave his post as NRL Referees elite performance manager to return to Parramatta in the newly created job as general manager of football operations. In 2014, a report revealed that a review was conducted in order to determine whether Anderson should have been granted a contract extension as head coach back in 2011. Anderson \\"had suggested his position would be untenable for the 2011 season and the level of undermining and the resultant instability would make his job impossible\\", the report read. \\"He was very disappointed and it was going to be a long year for all. He claimed his staff were ‘not on his bus’ and that it was a toxic environment\\". The report also alleged that players had turned up to recovery sessions intoxicated or smelling of alcohol and that \\"he also struggled to handle relationships that longer serving staff and players had with the board.\\" In 2016, Anderson along with four other board members were de-registered by The NRL and had their contracts terminated by Parramatta in the wake of the club's salary cap scandal. It was alleged that Anderson along with the other board members which the media dubbed \\"The gang of five\\" had been aware of or made payments to players outside of the game's rules. If found guilty of this, Anderson could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail for fraud. Sydney Roosters On 30 January 2019, it was revealed that Anderson had joined the Sydney Roosters in a recruitment role. Before Anderson was allowed to join the club, the Eastern Suburbs outfit had to convince the NRL that he was a fit and proper person befitting registration. An NRL spokesman said Anderson had been approved to join Easts with some restrictions on his role after two years out of the game.

It is also called the zero or empty type, and is sometimes denoted with the up tack (⊥) symbol. A function whose return type is bottom cannot return any value, not even the zero size unit type. Therefore a function whose return type is the bottom type cannot return. In the Curry–Howard correspondence, the bottom type corresponds to falsity. Computer science applications In subtyping systems, the bottom type is the subtype of all types. (However, the converse is not true—a subtype of all types is not necessarily the bottom type.) It is used to represent the return type of a function that does not return a value: for instance, one which loops forever, signals an exception, or exits. Because the bottom type is used to indicate the lack of a normal return, it typically has no values. It contrasts with the top type, which spans all possible values in a system, and a unit type, which has exactly one value. The bottom type is frequently used for the following purposes: * To signal that a function or computation diverges; in other words, does not return a result to the caller. (This does not necessarily mean that the program fails to terminate; a subroutine may terminate without returning to its caller, or exit via some other means such as a continuation.) ** When coupled with the Curry–Howard correspondence interpretation of bottom as \\"falsity\\", this yields a computational interpretation of non-constructive logic in terms of control flow operators. * As an indication of error; this usage primarily occurs in theoretical languages where distinguishing between errors is unimportant. Production programming languages typically use other methods, such as option types (including tagged pointers) or exception handling. In Bounded Quantification with Bottom, Pierce says that \\"Bot\\" has many uses: # In a language with exceptions, a natural type for the raise construct is raise ∈ exception -> Bot, and similarly for other control structures. Intuitively, Bot here is the type of computations that do not return an answer. # Bot is useful in typing the \\"leaf nodes\\" of polymorphic data structures. For example, List(Bot) is a good type for nil. # Bot is a natural type for the \\"null pointer\\" value (a pointer which does not point to any object) of languages like Java: in Java, the null type is the universal subtype of reference types. \`null\` is the only value of the null type; and it can be cast to any reference type. However, the null type does not satisfy all the properties of a bottom type as described above, because bottom types cannot have any possible values, and the null type has the value \`null\`. # A type system including both Top and Bot seems to be a natural target for type inference, allowing the constraints on an omitted type parameter to be captured by a pair of bounds: we write S<:X<:T to mean \\"the value of X must lie somewhere between S and T.\\" In such a scheme, a completely unconstrained parameter is bounded below by Bot and above by Top. In programming languages Most commonly used languages don't have a way to explicitly denote the empty type. There are a few notable exceptions. Since Haskell2010, Haskell supports empty data types. Thus, it allows the definition \`data Empty\` (with no constructors). The type \`Empty\` is not quite empty, as it contains non-terminating programs and the \`undefined\` constant. The \`undefined\` constant is often used when you want something to have the empty type, because \`undefined\` matches any type (so is kind of a \\"subtype\\" of all types), and attempting to evaluate \`undefined\` will cause the program to abort, therefore it never returns an answer. In Common Lisp the symbol \`NIL\`, amongst its other uses, is also the name of a type that has no values. It is the complement of \`T\` which is the top type. The type named \`NIL\` is sometimes confused with the type named \`NULL\`, which has one value, namely the symbol \`NIL\` itself. In Scala, the bottom type is denoted as \`Nothing\`. Besides its use for functions that just throw exceptions or otherwise don't return normally, it's also used for covariant parameterized types. For example, Scala's List is a covariant type constructor, so \`List[Nothing]\` is a subtype of \`List[A]\` for all types A. So Scala's \`Nil\`, the object for marking the end of a list of any type, belongs to the type \`List[Nothing]\`. In Rust, the bottom type is called the never type and is denoted by \`!\`. It is present in the type signature of functions guaranteed to never return, for example by calling \`panic!()\` or looping forever. It is also the type of certain control- flow keywords, such as \`break\` and \`return\`, which do not produce a value but are nonetheless usable as expressions. In Ceylon, the bottom type is \`Nothing\`. It is comparable to \`Nothing\` in Scala and represents the intersection of all other types as well as an empty set. In TypeScript, the bottom type is \`never\`. In Python, the bottom type is \`typing.NoReturn\`. In Kotlin, the bottom type is \`Nothing\`.

The station is served by the Q train at all times.  History  The station was opened around 1900 as a two-track surface station and named Manhattan Terrace. It was renamed \\"Avenue J\\" in 1907, the same year the railroad line was grade separated. Vestiges of the spur built to reconnect the Brighton Line and Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch after grade separation still exist to this day. This station underwent reconstruction from September 2009 to December 2011. Both platforms were rebuilt with new windscreens, canopies, and tactile strip edges. A temporary platform over the express tracks was used to provide service on the side that was under rebuilding. The new windscreens were controversial with nearby community members, since the windscreens contained gaps that allowed trash and noise through while causing privacy issues for residents whose backyards faced the station. Station layout The station is located on a raised earthen embankment. There are four tracks and two side platforms. The two center tracks are used by the B express train on weekdays.

It was directed by Allen Hughes and written by Jamal Joseph (story and teleplay) and Dianne Houston (teleplay). Plot summary The movie is based on the true story of David MacEnultyChessville news who taught schoolchildren of the Bronx Community Elementary School 70 to play at competition level, eventually winning New York City and the New York State Chess Championships. The screenplay portrays whistle-blowing and a mid-life crisis that combine to remove Richard Mason (played by Ted Danson) from his old life. He becomes a substitute teacher and is assigned to a fourth-grade class in a South Bronx school. In the class are students with parents who are drug addicts or in jail or just scrambling to pay the bills. Few of them see a purpose in school other than meeting society's requirements, and he struggles, mostly in vain, to reach them. Then a student whose father is in jail sees Mason in the park playing a simultaneous exhibition, and beating fourteen opponents at once. He asks to learn the game. One thing leads to another, and soon the entire class is interested in the game. Mason convinces them that on the chessboard it doesn't matter how much money you have or what clothes you're wearing or where you come from, and that it's only the moves you make, then and there. The class forms a team to compete in ever-larger tournaments.

It modified state law to allow the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana by doctor recommendation for patients with certain medical conditions. The Act does not affect federal law, which still prohibits the cultivation and possession of marijuana. Measure 33 in 2004 sought to extend the law by mandating distribution centers, but was rejected by voters. Measure 74 in 2010 sought to provide access to medical cannabis for patients through licensed and regulated non-profit dispensaries, fund medical research, establish a program to assist low-income patients and help finance Oregon health programs.  History and specifics of the law  The Act made Oregon the second state in the United States, after California's Proposition 215 in 1996, to remove criminal penalties for medical marijuana. It established the first state registry for medical marijuana users. Since the U.S. federal government does not recognize medical marijuana, the Act affects only state law. In other words, U.S. federal penalties remain. The official ballot title given by the Oregon Secretary of State for the 1998 campaign was \\"Allows Medical Use of Marijuana Within Limits; Establishes Permit System\\". The measure removed state criminal penalties for patients with \\"debilitating medical conditions\\" whose doctor verifies the condition and that medical marijuana may help it. Some qualifying conditions include: cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy and other disorders characterized by seizures, glaucoma, HIV or AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other disorders characterized by muscle spasticity, and nausea. Patients obtain permits through the Oregon Department of Human Services and in 1998 could cultivate no more than seven marijuana plants, of which no more than three could be mature. They could possess no more than four ounces of usable marijuana (one on the person and one per mature plant). The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program administers the program within the Oregon Department of Human Services. As of April 1, 2009, there were 20,974 patients registered, with 10,626 caregivers holding cards for these patients. Data as of 2009-04-01.  Supporters and opponents  Groups supporting the ballot measure included Oregonians for Medical Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union, who stated that medical marijuana was a way to manage pain of those who were suffering from medical conditions. The measure was opposed by various groups including the Christian Coalition, Oregonians Against Dangerous Drugs, and then–Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Noelle, who claimed legalizing marijuana would be dangerous.  Attempts to change the law  Measure 33 was placed on the ballot by initiative petition in 2004. It would have expanded the law, allowing the creation of nonprofit, state-licensed marijuana dispensaries which could sell marijuana to patients, and increasing the maximum amount of marijuana that patients could possess. The dispensaries would have been required to provide the drug to indigent patients for free. If, after six months of the measure's passage, a county lacked a dispensary, the county health division would have been granted a license to open a dispensary. The measure would also have increased to the amount of marijuana the patient may possess. Supporters of Measure 33 claimed that the prohibition on marijuana sales to patients hindered their ability to obtain the quantities they need for treatment. They viewed this measure as a responsible solution to that problem. Some opponents argued that the measure was a back door legalization attempt. Some also feared that this expansion would have attracted the ire of the federal government, who would have attempted to shut down the entire Oregon medical marijuana program. Voters rejected the measure, with 42.8% of votes in favor, 57.2% against. The 2005 Oregon Legislature passed Senate Bill 1085, which took effect on January 1, 2006. The bill raised the quantity of cannabis that authorized patients may possess from seven plants (with no more than three mature) and three ounces of cannabis to six mature cannabis plants, 18 immature seedlings, and 24 ounces of usable cannabis. The bill also changed the penalty for exceeding the amount allowed for state-qualified patients. The new guidelines no longer give patients the ability to argue an \\"affirmative defense\\" of medical necessity at trial if they exceed the allowed number of plants. But patients who are within the limits retain the ability to raise an affirmative defense at trial even if they fail to register with the state. Donna Nelson introduced a bill in the 2007 legislative session that would have prohibited law enforcement officials from using medical marijuana. Kevin Mannix, a former state legislator and former candidate for governor, circulated an initiative petition that would have asked voters in the 2008 general election to scale back the law. Neither was successful. Medical cannabis reform activists filed Initiative 28, an initiative that would create a licensed and regulated medical marijuana supply system through non-profit dispensaries. The initiative was co-authored by John Sajo who helped draft the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act and Anthony Johnson who co-authored successful marijuana law reform measures while in law school at the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law. Supporters argue that the measure is needed to ensure that patients have a supply of medical cannabis and that the imposed licensing fees will generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. Fees collected from the dispensaries and their producers will be utilized to fund medical research, establish a program to assist-low income patients and help finance Oregon health programs, such as the Oregon Health Plan. The Coalition for Patients Rights first turned in over 61,000 signatures on January 11, 2010, to the Oregon Secretary of State and needed 82,769 valid signatures to qualify the measure for the November 2010 ballot. Members of the patients' rights coalition, including Oregon Green Free, Voter Power and Southern Oregon NORML eventually collected enough signatures to place the initiative on the ballot. On August 2, 2010, the Oregon Secretary of State announced that the non-profit dispensary proposal would be placed on the November ballot as Voters' Pamphlet, Measure 74, page 59. Measure 74 has received great publicity across Oregon and earned the endorsement of the Democratic Party of Oregon, providing medical cannabis more mainstream support than it ever achieved in Oregon. 11 Oregon Voters' Pamphlet Arguments were submitted in support of Measure 74. Arguments were submitted by former Portland Police Chief and Mayor, Tom Potter; retired Oregon Supreme Court Justice Betty Roberts; former federal prosecutor Kristine Olson; as well as several doctors and nurses, including, Dr. Richard Bayer, Chief Petitioner of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act. Progressive Reform of Oregon (Pro- Oregon), a new 501 (c)(4) federal non-profit released the first commercial urging voters to support Measure 74. Pro-Oregon is dedicated to ending the War on Cannabis and implementing policies that promote freedom and equality under the law. See also * Cannabis in Oregon * Medical cannabis * Gonzales v.

Although they can occur singly, they most frequently occur as joint sets and systems. A joint set is a family of parallel, evenly spaced joints that can be identified through mapping and analysis of the orientations, spacing, and physical properties. A joint system consists of two or more intersecting joint sets. The distinction between joints and faults hinges on the terms visible or measurable, a difference that depends on the scale of observation. Faults differ from joints in that they exhibit visible or measurable lateral movement between the opposite surfaces of the fracture (\\"Mode 2\\" and \\"Mode 3\\" Fractures). As a result, a joint may have been created by either strict movement of a rock layer or body perpendicular to the fracture or by varying degrees of lateral displacement parallel to the surface (plane) of the fracture that remains “invisible” at the scale of observation.Mandl, G.

Routledge New York, New York. 578 pp. Joints are among the most universal geologic structures as they are found in most every exposure of rock. They vary greatly in appearance, dimensions, and arrangement, and occur in quite different tectonic environments. Often, the specific origin of the stresses that created certain joints and associated joint sets can be quite ambiguous, unclear, and sometimes controversial. The most prominent joints occur in the most well-consolidated, lithified, and highly competent rocks, such as sandstone, limestone, quartzite, and granite. Joints may be open fractures or filled by various materials. Joints infilled by precipitated minerals are called veins and joints filled by solidified magma are called dikes.  Formation  Joints result from brittle fracture of a rock body or layer as the result of tensile stresses. These tensile stresses either were induced or imposed from outside, e.g. by the stretching of layers; the rise of pore fluid pressure as the result of either external compression or fluid injection; or the result of internal stresses induced by the shrinkage caused by the cooling or desiccation of a rock body or layer whose outside boundaries remained fixed. When tensional stresses stretch a body or layer of rock such that its tensile strength is exceeded, it breaks. When this happens the rock fractures in a plane parallel to the maximum principal stress and perpendicular to the minimum principal stress (the direction in which the rock is being stretched). This leads to the development of a single sub- parallel joint set. Continued deformation may lead to development of one or more additional joint sets. The presence of the first set strongly affects the stress orientation in the rock layer, often causing subsequent sets to form at a high angle, often 90°, to the first set.  Types of joints  Joints are classified either by the processes responsible for their formation or their geometry.van der Pluijm, B.A. , and S. Marshak (2004) Earth structure : an introduction to structural geology and tectonics, 2nd ed. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., New York, New York. 672 pp. 10110 = Classification of joints by geometry = The geometry of joints refers to the orientation of joints as either plotted on stereonets and rose-diagrams or observed in rock exposures. In terms of geometry, three major types of joints, nonsystematic joints, systematic joints, and columnar jointing are recognized. Nonsystematic joints Nonsystematic joints are joints that are so irregular in form, spacing, and orientation that they cannot be readily grouped into distinctive, through-going joint sets. Systematic joints Systematic joints are planar, parallel, joints that can be traced for some distance, and occur at regularly, evenly spaced distances on the order centimeters, meters, tens of meters, or even hundreds of meters. As a result, they occur as families of joints that form recognizable joint sets. Typically, exposures or outcrops within a given area or region of study contains two or more sets of systematic joints, each with its own distinctive properties such as orientation and spacing, that intersect to form well-defined joint systems. Based upon the angle at which joint sets of systematic joints intersect to form a joint system, systematic joints can be subdivided into conjugate and orthogonal joint sets. The angles at which joint sets within a joint system commonly intersect is called by structural geologists as the dihedral angles. When the dihedral angles are nearly 90° within a joint system, the joint sets are known as orthogonal joint sets. When the dihedral angles are from 30 to 60° within a joint system, the joint sets are known as conjugate joint sets. Within regions that have experienced tectonic deformation, systematic joints are typically associated with either layered or bedded strata that has been folded into anticlines and synclines. Such joints can be classified according to their orientation in respect to the axial planes of the folds as they often commonly form in a predictable pattern with respect to the hinge trends of folded strata. Based upon their orientation to the axial planes and axes of folds, the types of systematic joints are: :* Longitudinal joints - Joints which are roughly parallel to fold axes and often fan around the fold. :* Cross-joints - Joints which are approximately perpendicular to fold axes. :* Diagonal joints - Joints which typically occur as conjugate joint sets that trend oblique to the fold axes. :* Strike joints - Joints which trend parallel to the strike of the axial plane of a fold. :* Cross-strike joints - Joints which cut across the axial plane of a fold. Columnar jointing Columnar jointing is a distinctive type of joints that join together at triple junctions either at or about 120° angles. These joints split a rock body into long, prisms or columns. Typically, such columns are hexagonal, although 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-sided columns are relatively common. The diameter of these prismatic columns range from a few centimeters to several metres. They are often oriented perpendicular to either the upper surface and base of lava flows and the contact of the tabular igneous bodies with the surrounding rock. This type of jointing is typical of thick lava flows and shallow dikes and sills.McPhie, J., M. Doyle, and R. Allen (1993) Volcanic Textures: A guide to the interpretation of textures in volcanic rocks. Centre for Ore Deposit and Exploration Studies, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. 196 pp. Columnar jointing is also known as either columnar structure, prismatic joints, or prismatic jointing.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. Rare cases of columnar jointing have also been reported from sedimentary strata.Young, G.M. (2008) Origin of Enigmatic Structures: Field and Geochemical Investigation of Columnar Joints in Sandstones, Island of Bute, Scotland. Journal of Geology. 116(5):527-536. = Types of joints with respect to formation = Joints can also be classified according to their origin. On the basis of their origin, joints have been divided into a number of different types that include tectonic, hydraulic, exfoliation, unloading (release), and cooling joints depending on the specific author and publication. Also, the origin of many joint sets often can be unclear and quite ambiguous. Often, different authors have proposed multiple and contradictory hypotheses for specific joint sets and types. Finally, it should be kept in mind that different joints in the same outcrop may have formed at different times and for different reasons. Tectonic joints Tectonic joints are joints that formed when the relative displacement of the joint walls is normal to its plane as the result of brittle deformation of bedrock in response to regional or local tectonic deformation of bedrock. Such joints form when directed tectonic stress causes the tensile strength of bedrock to be exceeded as the result of the stretching of rock layers under conditions of elevated pore fluid pressure and directed tectonic stress. Tectonic joints often reflect local tectonic stresses associated with local folding and faulting. Tectonic joints occur as both nonsystematic and systematic joints, including orthogonal and conjugate joint sets.Davis, G.H., and S.J. Reynolds (1996) Structural Geology of Rocks and Regions (2nd ed.). New York, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 776 p. Hydraulic joints Hydraulic joints are joints thought to have formed when pore fluid pressure became elevated as a result of vertical gravitational loading. In simple terms, the accumulation of either sediments, volcanic, or other material causes an increase in the pore pressure of groundwater and other fluids in the underlying rock when they cannot move either laterally of vertically in response to this pressure. This also causes an increase in pore pressure in preexisting cracks that increases the tensile stress on them perpendicular to the minimum principal stress (the direction in which the rock is being stretched). If the tensile stress exceeds the magnitude of the least principal compressive stress the rock will fail in a brittle manner and these cracks propagate in a process called hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic joints occur as both nonsystematic and systematic joints, including orthogonal and conjugate joint sets. In some cases, joint sets can be a tectonic - hydraulic hybrid. Exfoliation joints Exfoliation joints are sets of flat-lying, curved, and large joints that are restricted to massively exposed rock faces in an deeply eroded landscape. Exfoliation jointing consists of fan-shaped fractures varying from a few meters to tens of meters in size that lie sub- parallel to the topography. The vertical, gravitational load of the mass of a mountain-size bedrock mass drives longitudinal splitting and causes outward buckling toward the free air. In addition, paleostress sealed in the granite before the granite was exhumed by erosion and released by exhumation and canyon cutting is also a driving force for the actual spalling.Twidale, C.R., and E.M. Campbell (2005) Australian Landforms: Understanding a Low, Flat, Arid and Old Landscape. Rosenberg Publishing Pty. Ltd. Revised edition, 2005. P. 140. Unloading joints Unloading joints or release joints are joints formed near the surface during uplift and erosion. As bedded sedimentary rocks are brought closer to the surface during uplift and erosion, they cool, contract and become relaxed elastically. This causes stress buildup that eventually exceeds the tensile strength of the bedrock and results in the formation of jointing. In the case of unloading joints, compressive stress is released either along preexisting structural elements (such as cleavage) or perpendicular to the former direction of tectonic compression. Cooling joints Cooling joints are columnar joints that result from the cooling of either lava from the exposed surface of a lava lake or flood basalt flow or the sides of a tabular igneous, typically basaltic, intrusion. They exhibit a pattern of joints that join together at triple junctions either at or about 120° angles. They split a rock body into long, prisms or columns that are typically hexagonal, although 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-sided columns are relatively common. They form as a result of a cooling front that moves from some surface, either the exposed surface of a lava lake or flood basalt flow or the sides of a tabular igneous intrusion into either lava of the lake or lava flow or magma of a dike or sill.Goehring, L., and S.W. Morris (2008) Scaling of columnar joints in basalt. Journal of Geophysical Research. B113:B10203, 18 pp.Goehring, L.

(1995) Fracture surface markings in Liassic limestone at Lavernock Point, South Wales. Geological Society, London, Special Publications; v. 92; p. 175-186]Bahat, D., A. Rabinovitch, and V. Frid (2005) Tensile Fracturing in Rocks: Tectonofractographic and Electromagnetic Radiation Methods. Springer-Verlag Berlin. 569 pp.  Shear fractures versus joints  Some fractures that look like joints are actually shear fractures, which in effect are microfaults, instead of joints. Shear fractures do not form as the result of the perpendicular opening of a fracture due to tensile stress, but through the shearing of fractures that causes lateral movement of its faces. Shear fractures can be confused with joints, because the lateral offset of the fracture faces is not visible at the scale of outcrop or hand specimen. Because of the absence of diagnostic ornamentation or the lack of any discernible movement or offset, they can be indistinguishable from joints. Shear fractures occur in sets of planar parallel fractures at an angle of 60 degrees and can be of the same size and scale as joints. As a result, some conjugate joint sets may actually be shear fractures. In case of such joint sets, it might be possible to distinguish joints from shear fractures by looking for the presence of slickensides, which are products of shearing movement parallel to the fracture surface. The slickensides are fine-scale, delicate ridge-in-groove lineations that are found on the surface of fracture surfaces.  Importance of joints  Joints are important not only in understanding the local and regional geology and geomorphology, but also are important in development of natural resources, the safe design of structures, and environmental protection. Joints have a profound control on weathering and erosion of bedrock. As a result, they exert a strong control on how topography and morphology of landscapes develop. Understanding the local and regional distribution, physical character, and origin of joints is a significant part of understanding the geology and geomorphology of an area. Joints often impart a well-develop fracture-induced permeability to bedrock. As a result, joints strongly influence, even control, the natural circulation (hydrogeology) of fluids, e.g. groundwater and pollutants within aquifers, petroleum in reservoirs, and hydrothermal circulation at depth, within bedrock. Thus, joints are important to the economic and safe development of petroleum, hydrothermal, and groundwater resources and the subject of intensive research relative to the development of these resources. Also, regional and local joint systems exert a very strong control on how ore-forming (hydrothermal) fluids, consisting largely of , , and NaCl, that formed most of Earth's ore deposits circulated within the Earth crust. As a result, understanding their genesis, structure, chronology, and distribution is an important part of finding and profitably developing ore deposits of various types. Finally, joints often form discontinuities that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of soil and rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction. As a result, joints are an important part of geotechnical engineering in practice and research.

He represented Australia in test matches and Queensland in the State of Origin. His position of choice was . Murray has also coached in the National Rugby League and State of Origin. Playing career Murray, a qualified teacher, was an instrumental player in the early Queensland State of Origin sides, and played 17 games (15 State of Origin) between 1981 and 1986. He also represented his country on six occasions between 1982 and 1985 (not including one non-test international against Wales), and toured with the famous 1982 Invincibles, and made his test debut for Australia from the bench in a pre-Kangaroo Tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby in 1982, though he would not play any of the 5 tests on the Kangaroo tour against Great Britain or France. Murray also played in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership with the Norths Devils, captaining them to a famous premiership win over Souths in 1980 under the coaching of Kiwi Graham Lowe, before moving to the Valleys Diehards for the 1982 season to play alongside representative team mate Wally Lewis. In 1983 he shifted to the Redcliffe club and played for them up until midway through the 1986 season. Coaching career Murray's playing career was cut short that year by an eye injury which required surgery. After coaching Redcliffe to a Woolies Trophy win and minor premiership in 1990, he was appointed coach of the Eastern Suburbs Roosters in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership between 1991 and 1994, before he was sacked mid- season and replaced by Arthur Beetson. Before his sacking, Murray had already been effectively demoted from the role as Roosters head coach, to be officially designated as \\"co-coach\\" with former Roosters player John Peard for much of the 1994 season. Murray was appointed coach of Queensland in 1999, but was released as coach after the 2000 series, in which the Maroons lost the series 0-3 and were beaten in the last match by 56-16. He and Michael Hagan are the only two coaches in Queensland's history not to have won an Origin series for the state as head coach (although Murray did coach the side in 1999 when the Maroons retained the shield and Hagan was assistant coach when they won the series in 2010). Murray also has the worst winning percentage of any Queensland coach, with only one win and one draw from six matches at 16.6%. Murray was also the coach of the Brisbane Norths rugby league team in 1998 when they defeated the Wests Panthers in the QLD Cup Grand Final. After the resignation of Chris Anderson as coach of the Melbourne Storm in April 2001, Murray took over the role for his second stint as a mentor in the NSWRL/ARL/NRL. He was unable to repeat the success of his predecessor however, and was ultimately released in favour of Craig Bellamy after the 2002 season. He since became the CEO of the Norths club.

It was published in 1986 by the Crown Publishing Group and it is out-of-print. Plot Hartford tells the exciting true story of the incident in the life of an Ohio River steamboat around 1910. The boat, the Virginia, was subject to the rather fickle nature of the river at that time and ended up stuck in a cornfield. This steamboat navigated the river before locks and dams were constructed to help regulate the waterway. Hartford recounts the hard times faced by this particular steamboat company which pressured the captain to make an ill-advised venture. The book uses old photos and maps to show the steamboat and trace its route. The accomplishment of what was seemingly an impossible task to refloat the steamboat is documented. The book ends with a coda, describing the fate of the characters. In May 1991, the Gasoline Alley comic strip featured Hartford in a storyline that paralleled that of the children's book.

The documentary was commissioned by the Chogyal (King) of Sikkim at a time when he felt the sovereignty of Sikkim was under threat from both China and India. Ray's documentary is about the sovereignty of Sikkim. The film was banned by the government of India, when Sikkim merged with India in 1975. In 2000, the copyright of the film was transferred to the Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim. The ban was finally lifted by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in September 2010. In November 2010 the director of the Kolkata film festival stated that upon screening the documentary for the first time, he received an injunction from the court of Sikkim again banning the film. Production Satyajit had planned several documentaries about with people in their setting in focus, like musicians of Rajasthan, dancers in Ellora, but eventually ended up making only one. Ray's cousin who lived in Darjeeling, had appeared in film, Kanchenjungha (1962) also shot in Darjeeling, was acquainted with Chogyal of Sikkim Palden Thondup Namgyal and his American wife Hope Cooke, the couple commissioned the film and his cousin convinced Ray to take on the project. Overview No critics have seen the film, but Ray described it in the following way: \\"While they're reaching this point, I cut to a shot of a piece of telegraph wire. It's raining and there are two drops of rain approaching on a downward curve. It's a very poetic seven minutes. And the end is also very lively, very optimistic, with children, happy, laughing, smoking, singing. The whole thing builds up into a paean of praise for the place.\\" The documentary was screened for public viewing for the first time in 39 years at the 16th Kolkata Film Festival. Mathures Paul of The Statesman wrote in his review, \\"Sandwiched between Pratidwandi, Seemabaddha and Asani Sanket, Sikkim is beautiful, more an essay from a respected travel journal from Ray’s era accompanied by detailed photographs that graced magazines like Life\\". Censorship Revival Except a screening for the Chogyal family, the film never got formally released. For many years, the film was considered to be lost and it was thought that the only surviving record of the film is a scene-by-scene written reconstruction of the film by the remaining film team members. However, in January 2003 it was reported that a good quality print has been kept by the British Film Institute.Screen India archives When the Kolkata-based Satyajit Ray Society traced a print with the Chogyal’s family it was found to be damaged beyond repair, finally, a print that had made its way to London was traced and restored by the Academy Film Archive in 2007. A restored version was shown in 2008 during a \\"Ray Retrospective\\" at the Nantes Three Continents Film Festival in France. After the government overturned the ban, the restored copy reached the Gangtok-based Art and Culture Trust of Sikkim in September 2010, which has earlier received the prints and right for the film in 2000. Amidst a lot of controversies, this was finally screened at a film festival at Kolkata in Nandan in Nov 2010. People waited hours and sat on the movie hall floors to watch the single screening of this movie. This was again removed after a single show, as a Sikkim court ordered a stay on the screening of this documentary.

R. James & P. Westney, eds., New Linguistic Impulses in Foreign Language Teaching (Tübingen: Gunter Narr Verlag, 1981), esp. pp. 88–93. The term metalocutionary act originated as metalocution (Gibbon 1976, 1983) in functional descriptions of intonation in English and German, by analogy with locution (locutionary act), illocution (illocutionary act) and perlocution (perlocutionary act) in speech act theory. The term metalocutionary act has developed a more general meaning and may include, for example, quotation acts and comments on preceding speech acts. Definition Metalocutionary deixis is the denotation (in the strict semantic sense) of utterance constituents at points and over intervals in the temporal structure of utterances by means of prosodic deictic indices such as pitch accents, intonation contours and boundary tones. In the prosodic literature, \\"mark\\" is often used informally instead of the strict \\"denote\\". The metalocutionary functions are structural rather than attitudinal or emotional functions of prosody. A precursor of the concept of metalocutionary function is found in the configurational function of intonation proposed by the Prague School of linguistics (e.g. Trubetzkoy 1939), with the more specific culmination function and delimitation function, as in accentuation on the one hand and domain or boundary marking on the other. Examples Example 1: In orthography, e.g. Are Henry and Catherine REALly going?, capitalisation (or other highlighting) of the syllable real and punctuation (including the initial capital a and the interrogation point) are orthographic metalocutions: capitalisation denotes the syllable real and the word really, of which the syllable is a constituent, while the punctuation denotes the domain of the question function. Example 2: In the pronunciation of Are Henry and Catherine REALly going? (where the syllable real may receive a pitch accent, and the interrogation point may be rendered with a rising final tone and a globally rising pitch contour), the pitch accent is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the syllable real and the word really, and the final rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the end portion of the utterance (as well as a non-final or question speech act); the global rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes an intonation domain.

He reigned from 20 January 1189 to 29 December 1208.Tao, p. 85-86 Life Emperor Zhangzong was the sixth emperor of the Jin dynasty. He inherited the throne from his grandfather, Emperor Shizong and was succeeded by Wanyan Yongji. To some extent, Emperor Zhangzong continued his grandfather's policy of encouraging intensive use of the Jurchen language and promotion of Jurchen customs. He forbade wearing of Han Chinese clothes and required his subjects to perform the Jurchen kowtow ceremony. He required his meng'an and mouke (Jurchen hereditary feudal nobility) to take an archery test if they wanted to sit for a jinshi examination. On the other hand, he permitted Jurchens to follow Han Chinese funeral practices, and Tang and Song dynasty rituals are known to have been performed at his court in 1194. Resuming one of the projects of the Prince of Hailing, Emperor Zhangzong established Confucian temples in all prefectures and counties of his empire. Emperor Zhangzong ordered the construction of the Taiye Lake in Beijing for him to go fishing. Unlike his grandfather, Emperor Zhangzong did not consider hunting as a natural and necessary way of military training but viewed it as recreation.Tao, p. 85-86 Emperor Zhangzong's favorite concubine was Li Shi'er (李師兒). Zhangzong once romanced Concubine Li on Qiong Island (瓊島), where Concubine Li said that the emperor was like the sun (日), while she was the moon (月). Together, they make the character for \\"bright\\" (明). Emperor Zhangzong in his later years began to spoil Concubine Li and gave her family members positions in the government, while ignoring his duties as the emperor. As such, the Jin Empire began to decline during his reign. =Song invasion of the Jin= When, in 1206, the troops of the Southern Song chancellor Han Tuozhou invaded the Jin dynasty, trying to reunify China from the south, Emperor Zhangzong's armies defeated the invaders. The conflict began when the Song were informed of Jurchen troubles with the rising Mongols and natural disasters. The Song began provoking Emperor Zhangzong in 1204 and onward by orchestrating raids on Jin settlements. The fighting continued to escalate, partly aggravated by Song officials in support of revanchism, and war against the Jin dynasty was officially declared on June 14, 1206. The Song advance was impeded by Jin military successes and declining soldier morale that forced many to desert. By the fall of 1206, multiple towns and military bases had been captured by the Jurchens. Neither side was willing to continue fighting, and a peace treaty was signed on November 2, 1208. To obtain peace, the Song dynasty had to yield territory, pay an indemnity, and execute their hawkish chancellor. The Song dynasty was obligated to pay an annual tribute of 50,000 taels of silver and 50,000 packs of fabric. They also delivered the severed head of the minister who had instigated the war to the Jurchens.

Perkins (often stylized as TJP). He is best known for his time with WWE, where he was the winner of the Cruiserweight Classic tournament and became the inaugural WWE Cruiserweight Champion. In his first Impact Wrestling tenure, he was a one-time TNA X Division Champion, where he used the ring name Manik, a spin-off of the character Suicide. He is also known for his time on the independent circuit as T.J. Perkins, TJP, or under a mask as Puma (also stylized as PUMA).  Early life  Theodore James Perkins was born on September 3, 1984 in Kansas City, Missouri. His mother is from Manila, Philippines, and he learned Filipino culture growing up with his family in Riverside, California. He attended St. Thomas the Apostle School and Poly High School in Riverside, California. At the age of 18, he began training in boxing, mixed martial arts, and catch wrestling.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1998–2001) = Perkins first began his training at the age of 13, at a local lucha libre school in his hometown of Los Angeles, California. Perkins debuted in August 1998, under a mask as promoters felt he looked too young to be wrestling. Initially, he wrestled under the ring name T.J. Perkins, utilizing \\"Pinoy Boy\\" as a nickname. In order to attend shows, he had to not attend school most Fridays. He wrestled on independent cards in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Mexico during his first two years. = New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2001–2005) = In 2001, Perkins began training at New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)'s Inoki Dojo in Los Angeles along with Ricky Reyes, Rocky Romero, and Bryan Danielson. They all made their debut in NJPW on the same Korakuen Hall card in October 2002, with Perkins debuting as the maskless \\"Pinoy Boy\\" T.J. Perkins. At the age of 18 in 2003, following his third tour with NJPW, he was given the gimmick (character) of Puma, a masked character with similarities to Tiger Mask, and he began teaming with Tiger Mask IV. Perkins stated the character was created due to perceived similarities between himself and the original Tiger Mask, Satoru Sayama, and the idea was that he would be the American version of Tiger Mask. = Independent circuit (2003–2016) = Perkins in the ring in 2008 In 2003, Perkins spent time in Mexico with Rocky Romero and Bobby Quance, where the trio trained with and wrestled for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. In January 2004, the masked Puma wrestled on two Major League Wrestling television tapings, teaming with Bobby Quance in a loss to The Stampede Bulldogs (Harry Smith and TJ Wilson). The following night, Puma lost a four-way match featuring Jack Evans, Chasyn Rance and MLW Junior Heavyweight Champion Sonjay Dutt. In December 2004, Puma won the All Pro Wrestling (APW) Worldwide Internet Championship by defeating J.J. Perez. He held the championship until July 2005, when he lost it to Perez. In January 2005, Perkins as Puma debuted in Full Impact Pro (FIP) by defeating Azrieal. At Unfinished Business, Puma was attacked by Azrieal and his ally CM Punk, and at the following show Puma lost a singles match to Punk. On February 12, Puma won a four-way match against Azrieal, Jerrelle Clark, and Eddie Vegas. Four years later, he returned to FIP as T.J. Perkins, in a loss to Davey Richards on March 28, 2009. He developed a winning streak, defeating Jay Bradley, Nigel McGuinness, and Sal Rinauro. In November 2009, Perkins entered the 2009 Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup, defeating Arik Cannon and Shane Hollister en route to the semi-finals, where he lost to Richards. In April 2010 at Southern Stampede, he returned to FIP using the ring name TJP, where he participated in a battle royal before he defeated Chasyn Rance. Puma wrestled in the 2005 edition of the East Coast Wrestling Association'a Super 8 tournament and made it to the final by defeating Eric Matlock and J.J. Perez, before losing to Petey Williams. He also competed in Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling's Pacific Cup in 2005, where he faced Aaron Idol and Bryan Danielson in a three-way match in the final, which was won by Idol. In August 2005, Perkins debuted in UWA Hardcore Wrestling as Puma, in a loss to Ricky Reyes. In May 2006, Puma defeated M-Dogg 20 to win the UWA Canadian Championship. He successfully defended the championship against Petey Williams the following month, before losing the championship to M-Dogg 20 in July. In October, Puma participated in UWA's Grand Prix Tournament, where he defeated Kazuchika Okada and Dan Paysan en route to the final, where he lost to Sonjay Dutt. He continued wrestling for UWA throughout 2007, competing against wrestlers including Último Dragón and Daisuke Hanaoka. Perkins at a Evolve show against Timothy Thatcher in 2016 Perkins debuted in the Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) on September 22, 2005, at Chaos, teaming with Dan Kobrick to defeat Big Ugly and Vinnie Massaro. On December 23, at EWF's Holiday Fear Perkins challenged EWF Cruiserweight Champion Joey Harder in a Triple Threat Championship match, which also involved Rocky Romero and was won by the defending champion Harder. Perkins continued to challenge Harder for the Cruiserweight Championship. In a match on February 12, 2006, Harder defeated Perkins by submission. On September 8, Perkins faced EWF World Champion Bino Gambino, defeating him by countout. When the match was restarted, they wrestled to a draw.

Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete subtype. Abstract types are also known as existential types.Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; Abstract Types Have Existential Type, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502 An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as protocols, interfaces, signatures, or class types. In class-based object-oriented programming, abstract types are implemented as abstract classes (also known as abstract base classes), and concrete types as concrete classes. In generic programming, the analogous notion is a concept, which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept. Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that can be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include abstract methods or abstract properties that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include traits, mixins, flavors, roles, or type classes.  Signifying abstract types  Abstract classes can be created, signified, or simulated in several ways: * By use of the explicit keyword in the class definition, as in Java, D or C#. * By including, in the class definition, one or more abstract methods (called pure virtual functions in C++), which the class is declared to accept as part of its protocol, but for which no implementation is provided. * By inheriting from an abstract type, and not overriding all missing features necessary to complete the class definition. In other words, a child type that doesn't implement all abstract methods from its parent becomes abstract itself. * In many dynamically typed languages such as Smalltalk, any class that sends a particular method to this, but doesn't implement that method, can be considered abstract. (However, in many such languages, like Objective-C, the error is not detected until the class is used, and the message returns results in an exception error message such as \\"Does not recognize selector: xxx\\" as \`- [NSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector:(SEL)selector]\` is invoked upon detection of an unimplemented method). = Example (Java) = //By default, all methods in all classes are concrete, unless the abstract keyword is used. abstract class Demo { // An abstract class may include abstract methods, which have no implementation. abstract public int sum(int x, int y); // An abstract class may also include concrete methods. public int product(int x, int y) { return x*y; } } //By default, all methods in all interfaces are abstract, unless the default keyword is used. interface DemoInterface { [abstract] int getLength(); //Abstract can be used here, though is completely useless //The default keyword can be used in this context to specify a concrete method in an interface default int product(int x, int y) { return x * y; } }  Use of abstract types  Abstract types are an important feature in statically typed OOP languages. Many dynamically typed languages have no equivalent feature (although the use of duck typing makes abstract types unnecessary); however traits are found in some modern dynamically-typed languages. Some authors argue that classes should be leaf classes (have no subtypes), or else be abstract. Abstract types are useful in that they can be used to define and enforce a protocol; a set of operations that all objects implementing the protocol must support. Abstract types are also an essential part of the Template Method Pattern.  See also  * Class * Concept * Type class  References  Further reading * *Core Java: An Integrated Approach by R.

Its mission is to preserve and promote Bluegrass music and Old-Time music in and around Minnesota. The organization presents five annual festivals: Winter Bluegrass Weekend, Cabin Fever Festival, Homegrown Kickoff, Minnesota Bluegrass & Old-Time Music Festival, and Harvest Jamboree. Additionally MBOTMA organizes the Minnesota Bluegrass Community Concert Series, the Lonely Pines Concert Series, various jam sessions, educational workshops and school programs, and publishes a monthly magazine-style newsletter called Inside Bluegrass.  Organizational history  Mountain Heart performs at the 2008 Minnesota Bluegrass & Old-Time Music Festival. MBOTMA was started in September 1975 by Minnesota bass player Tom O'Neill. He circulated a proposal to people that he knew were interested in bluegrass and old-time music, and sent out a preliminary newsletter announcing the Minnesota Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Association (MBOTMA), based on the San Diego Bluegrass Club and its newsletter format. MBOTMA sent its first official newsletter to a membership of 40 people in October of the same year. The Association's membership grew steadily and, in August 1976, MBOTMA was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in Minnesota. During the first three years membership grew to over 400. The organization introduced its first three-day summer bluegrass festival at Wildwood Campground in Taylors Falls, Minnesota, in August 1980. Later this event became the Minnesota Bluegrass & Old-Time Music Festival, located at El Rancho Mañana in central Minnesota. 1980 was also the year that MBOTMA held the first Buy, Sell, Swap Meet, which developed into the Winter Bluegrass Weekend: A Festival of Bluegrass & Old- Time Music & Dance, held annually the first weekend in March at the Crowne Plaza Hotel & Conference Center in Plymouth, Minnesota (formerly known as the Radisson Hotel & Conference Center). In 1988, the summer MBOTMA Festival moved to Camp in the Woods Resort near Zimmerman, Minnesota, where volunteers constructed a permanent stage facility. The Minnesota Homegrown Kickoff Music Festival was started in June 1993 at the same venue. Both festivals flourished, but in 2001, Camp In The Woods was sold to a housing developer, and a larger location with a long-range future was sought. In 2002, the two festivals moved to El Rancho Mañana, a campground and riding stables west of St. Cloud, Minnesota. Volunteers designed and contributed much of the labor to build the concert area and stage, and it is now considered one of the Midwest's most beautiful outdoor festival grounds. In 2001, MBOTMA hired its first professional executive director, Jed Malischke, to better serve its membership and mission. The organization now has a steady membership of approximately 1000 individuals and 125 member bands. Two winter concert programs are well established: the Community Concert Series brings MBOTMA member bands to venues in small communities throughout Minnesota, and the Lonely Pines Concert Series features professional touring bands in a series of concerts in large and small cities. Since 2003, the organization has partnered with the Minnesota State Fair to present the Minnesota Flatpicking Guitar & Duet Championships. A fourth annual festival, the Harvest Jamboree, was launched in 2006, It is an indoor multi-day festival with concerts, workshops and jamming. MBOTMA also hosts various jam sessions, sponsors children’s educational programs, and helps support events sponsored by other organizations and its member bands. MBOMTA’s monthly publication, Inside Bluegrass, has twice been voted “Best Newsletter” by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPBGMA). The Minnesota Bluegrass & Old-Time Music Festival was nominated in the \\"Event of the Year\\" category by the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) in 2005 and 2007.1 External links *Minnesota Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Association Category:Bluegrass music Category:Music festivals in Minnesota ","title":"Minnesota Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Association"},{"id":"3893587","text":"PalaLottomatica, formerly known as Palazzo dello Sport or PalaEUR, is a multi- purpose sports and entertainment arena in Rome, Italy. It is located in the heart of the well known modern EUR complex. The arena hosted the 1960 Olympic basketball tournaments.1960 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. pp. 68, 70, 72. The venue features 8 meetings points, a restaurant for 300 people, and a 2,700 square metre (3,229 sq. yard) outdoor terrace. It has a seating capacity of 11,200 spectators for basketball games. The PalaLottomatica Rome, together with Mediolanum Forum of Milan, is a member of the European Arenas Association (EAA). History Palazzo dello Sport during its construction in February 1959 Palazzo dello Sport was designed by architect Marcello Piacentini, in 1957, and its reinforced concrete dome was engineered by Pier Luigi Nervi. It was constructed in two years, from 1958–1960, in time for the 1960 Summer Olympics. The facility was designed and built along with a smaller facility, the Palazzetto dello Sport, its dome also engineered by Nervi. Formerly known as PalaSport, and informally known as PalaEUR, from the name of the arena's neighborhood, the \\"EUR\\", the arena was renamed to \\"PalaLottomatica\\", with the name of Lottomatica coming from the main sponsor that financed the arena's modernization work, from 1999 to 2003. =Modernization of the arena= The arena was renovated between 2000 and 2003. It was made more functional, especially in terms of acoustics, in order to be able to accommodate important musical events. Other changes were made to the original aesthetics of the stadium, particularly the night lighting of its exterior. That was done by adding glazing to the \\"tabellone della tombola\\", with numbers dramatically illuminated behind the glass. After the remodeling, the arena became able to accommodate up to 11,200 seated spectators. The structure was made to be able to host multiple sporting events (including internal competitions of, for example, the pro basketball club Pallacanestro Virtus Roma), concerts, conferences, and theatrical events. Events hosted Interior of PalaLottomatica, during a game of Virtus Roma, in 2006 The arena hosted the 1960 Olympic basketball tournaments,1960 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. pp. 68, 70, 72. the EuroBasket 1991Basketball in Serbia And Montenegro (SCG) and the 1997 EuroLeague Final Four. It is currently the home arena of the Italian professional basketball team Lottomatica Roma. In 1997, the PalaLottomatica hosted the EuroLeague Final Four (in the final, Olympiacos defeated Barcelona, by a score of 73–58), and the final stage of the 2005 Men's European Volleyball Championship, hosting the final between Italy and Russia. An audience of over 14,000 spectators was disappointed, due to a 3–2 comeback victory in Italy, after a thrilling game that lasted over two hours. The WWE held a show at the arena, on November 7, 2008. The PalaEUR was also a venue of the 1978 and 2010 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championships, as well as the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship. The venue was also named the host of the 2016–17 CEV Champions League Final 4 of volleyball, on April 29 and 30, 2017 - which followed the prior hosting rights to the 2011 event. Many artists have performed at the Palazzo dello Sport / PalaLottomatica since the late 1960s and early 1970s: among them, the Rolling Stones in 1970, and the Depeche Mode several times, since 1987, the Cure, Paul McCartney, Iron Maiden, Dire Straits and many others. In 1975, a Lou Reed concert was cancelled because of turmoil between the police and groups of people who were protesting against the high prices of concert tickets; because of that turmoil, the Palazzo dello Sport was seriously damaged, and foreign artists refused to perform in Italy for the following 5 years, until Bob Marley performed in Milan in 1980. AC/DC performed a show at the arena in May 1996, during their Ballbreaker World Tour. This arena also hosted an Avril Lavigne concert, during her The Black Star Tour, on September 10, 2011. The first artist to perform after the modernization of the arena, and its renaming to PalaLottomatica, was Santana, in 2003. On 9 December 1989, the final draw for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, was held at the Palazzo.

He was born into a family of musicians. His father, Teodor Cosma, was a pianist and conductor, his mother a writer-composer, his uncle, Edgar Cosma, composer and conductor, and one of his grandmothers, pianist, a student of the renowned Ferruccio Busoni. Career After receiving first prizes for violin and composition at the Bucharest Conservatoire of Music, he arrived in Paris in 1963 and continued his studies at the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique de Paris, working with Nadia Boulanger. As well as for classical music, he discovered early on a passion for jazz, film music and all forms of popular music. From 1964 he made a number of international tours as a concert violinist and began to devote himself more and more to composing. He wrote various compositions including: Trois mouvements d'été for symphony orchestra, Oblique for violoncello and string orchestra, music for theatre and ballet (Volpone for the Comédie Française, the opera Fantômas...). In 1968, Yves Robert entrusted him with his first film music for Alexandre le Bienheureux. Vladimir Cosma has since composed more than three hundred scores for feature films and TV series. His numerous successes in the cinema have notably been in collaboration with Yves Robert, Gérard Oury, Francis Veber, Claude Pinoteau, Jean-Jacques Beineix, Claude Zidi, Ettore Scola, Pascal Thomas, Pierre Richard, Yves Boisset, André Cayatte, Jean-Pierre Mocky, Edouard Molinaro, Jean-Marie Poiré... and among which: Le Grand Blond avec une chaussure noire, Diva, Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob, La Boum, le Bal, l'As des As, la Chèvre, Les Fugitifs, Les Zozos, Pleure pas la bouche pleine, Dupont Lajoie, Un éléphant ça trompe énormément, La Dérobade, Le Père Noël est une ordure, L'Étudiante, La Gloire de mon père, Le Château de ma mère, Le dîner de cons ...

Carl Baugh, a 1989 alumnus, was the university's president. Background The school was founded in 1980 as Pacific College of Graduate Studies by Clifford Wilson, PhD, and incorporated in 1987 as Pacific International University in Missouri. It was also sometimes known as Pacific College Incorporated.A Matter of Degree-Carl Baugh's Alleged Credentials from TalkOrigins Archive (Originally published in NCSE Reports Vol 9, No. 6, Nov- Dec. 1989.) In 1993, while operating in Australia, the school was accredited by the Higher Education Division of Victoria, and allowed to offer both Masters and Doctoral programs. However, this accreditation was only in place for a short time.Brown, George. (2004). \\"Protecting Australia’s Higher Education System: A Proactive Versus Reactive Approach in Review (1999–2004)\\", Proceedings of the Australian Universities Quality Forum 2004. Archived from the original, 7 March 2013. The school offered distance learning courses in biblical theology, ministry, cults, and many related subjects. It is unknown what credentials the professors had in these fields. The school offered B.Min., B.D., B.Th., M.B.S. (Master of Biblical Studies), M.Div., M.Th., and five religious doctoral degrees (Doctor of Ministry, Doctor of Biblical Studies, Doctor of Christian Education, Doctor of Theology and Doctor of Theological Studies.)  Criticism and controversy The university had an administrative office but no campus, so did not offer physical classes on site. It offered correspondence education and franchised some of its degree programs to other colleges in Australia. There were no minimum educational requirements to apply for certificate courses other than two references, one academic and one church related. Undergraduate degrees required high school graduation for admission, although exceptions could be made for advanced experience. The admission requirements for junior master's degrees was a bachelor's degree, and admission to senior master's degrees required a junior master's degree. Most doctoral degrees required a master's degree for admission. The fees ranged up to 2,500-3,000 USD for a Doctor of Theological Studies degree. The university had no recognized accreditation. The university noted it \\"is in good standing with the American Accrediting Association of Theological Institutions, Inc. (North Carolina) and is also a member of the Association of Christian Colleges and Theological Schools (Louisiana),\\" but for legal reasons made it known that \\"these memberships do NOT constitute accreditation by the U.S. Office of Education.\\" These accreditations were not recognized by government or accredited institutions because these accreditation agencies were not recognized by the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.Fact Sheet for Diploma Mills from Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The web site listed faculty, but did not mention where the staff received their doctorates, what subjects they specialized in, and whether they were associate professors or have full professorships. Moreover, Baugh received a Ph.D. from Pacific International University in the Fall of 1989.

It provides education to 1,150 secondary 1-5 students in the southeastern region of the Eastern Townships. (There are similar English-language regional high schools in Richmond and Cowansville.) History of regional schools The regional school concept emerged in the 1960s, in both the English and French language systems. Schooling was previously divided four ways: English or French, Catholic or Protestant. All high schools within a large catch area were closed and students bused to high school daily. High schools in communities like Magog, Sherbrooke, Lennoxville, Stanstead, Scotstown, Sawyerville, Coaticook and Cookshire were converted to elementary schools, where younger children from the baby boom were swelling the capacity. The loss of identity based on their local high school was a challenge which many small communities did not survive. Facilities The school is on a fenced campus on the outskirts of Sherbrooke in viewing distance of Bishops University and Lennoxville. It was constructed with concrete blocks and red brick in a Celtic cross-shape, nestled in a depression with a surrounding roadway level with the second floor. The central block is three-floors high with the administrative offices and auditorium on the ground floor; the cafeteria, kitchens, and music rooms on the second floor; and the library is alone on the top floor. The gym's east wall butts against the stage wall of the auditorium on a level even lower than the ground floor. The classrooms, shops, and labs are in the three wings, each divided into two houses. The wings are connected to the central block by glass walkways on the second and third floors, with a courtyard on ground level. (In the early years the wings were Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, Blue and Green. Students were assigned a homeroom with students from all grades, and where they had a locker.) Each of the stairwells have outside exits. The school has limited structural accommodations for wheelchair or limited mobility users. Part of the building (one wing) is used by the Eastern Townships Technical Institute -- a vocational education center. The school offers and is not limited to: * Music facilities with private practice booths * Fully equipped home economics facilities * Art rooms * Fully equipped woodworking and print shop for exploratory courses =Outdoor sports and recreation= The school boasts a large outdoor greenspace which consists of five soccer fields, two baseball fields, a football field and two running tracks. The running tracks consist of one paved, five-lane track that encircles the football field and a backed dirt trail that hugs the outside perimeter of the school property for endurance running. All of these (minus half of a soccer field) are out of bounds to students during the school day. During the winter season, the school clears some of the soccer fields for winter activity days (winter carnival, etc.). =Indoor sports and recreation centre= The school contains one wing with the multi-functional gymnasium, and boys' and girls' changerooms. There is one large gymnasium and a smaller gym in a T-configuration. The large gym can be divided using curtains that can be automatically raised or lowered from the ceiling. By using the curtains, the space can be divided to allow for two full-sized basketball courts or four half-sized courts. The curtains reduce noise and distractions for multiple classes or groups using the space simultaneously. The smaller gymnasium contains a rock climbing wall, a half- size basketball court, and a fully equipped weight training room. =Auditorium= The auditorium is between the central hub and gymnasium. Public access is quite easy, unlike navigating in the rest of the building. It has a seating capacity of 600 people and wheelchair access. The auditorium is equipped for professional theatre with standard sound and lighting equipment system. Each year, the community is invited to attend the school's showpiece theatrical production. The auditorium has been used as a movie theatre for students, when the gym is closed for maintenance or another activity. A majority of the seats in the auditorium are original to the school's opening in 1969. Some of the seats in the back have been replaced due to damage, involuntarily encouraging users to sit in the back of the auditorium. =Cafeteria= The cafeteria has a seating capacity of 1,000 people and serves hot lunches every day to students for a fee ($5.00). It is in the centre hub on the second floor. =Library= The library is in the central hub of the building, on the third floor. The library offers its students access to its 28,000 books and 14 computers, with racks of laptops left over from the Enhanced Learning Strategy (ELS). =Computer access= The school has many portable Apple laptops and desktop computers all with internet access. (See Enhanced Learning Strategy.) Programs The courses and programs at AGRHS include Drama, English language arts, English-History (Enriched Literature and Canadian Studies), Ethics and Religion, French language, French Geography, History, Contemporary World, Contemporary World and Literature, Home Economics, Mathematics, High Mathematics (Science or Technical Science), Integrative Project, Media Literacy, History of the 20th Century, Advanced Music, Multi-Sport, Music, Physical Education, School Community Service (Community Skills), Sciences which include Chemistry and Physics, and Spanish. Concentration Blocks Students in AGRHS can choose from four concentration blocks. They may choose to do Sports, Science, Visual arts or performing arts concentrations. A concentration takes the space of the passing blocks (piper blocks) to turn them into what the student's concentration is, Ex. Sports. Sports and activities AGRHS has many sports and extracurricular activities such as Basketball, European football, Tennis, Badminton, Dance, Canadian football, Hockey, Rugby, Intramural Activities, Softball, Swimming, Cross-country running, Cheer-leading, Training and coaching. Additionally, activities are offered to students who sign up for the related courses in Band Concerts and Drama Play. =Sports activities= The sports teams at the school have try-outs and have practices on a three-or-more per week basis. They participate in games at the AGRHS or at a neighboring school. =School band= The AGRHS school band (often referred to as the \\"Galt Band\\") tours elementary schools and other high schools in the Eastern Townships School Board, usually on days like Halloween or the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, playing songs related to the theme of the day. There have also been mini-concerts in the cafeteria the promote nonsmoking week. The band is made up of the rhythm section (drums, guitars, and basses) backing the brass and woodwind section (tubas, trombones, trumpets, alto and tenor saxophones, clarinets, and flutes). Most of the band's repertoire consists of pop and classic rock songs (\\"Smoke on the Water\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\", \\"More Than a Feeling\\"), as well as some other well-known songs such as the signature Ghostbusters' theme song performed at every Halloween concert, or the more traditional \\"Ode to Joy\\" or \\"O Canada\\". The school sometimes requests a few of the more distinguished players from the rhythm section (usually a drummer, a bassist and one or two guitarist) to play songs of their choice for the general public, usually for open houses and such gatherings. Every year features a year-end concert where everyone in the band program is invited to play for the general public with their respective grade. In addition, the school is looking into developing a music concentration option – should there be enough interest – for those interested in learning the finer points in songwriting and producing one's own music, as well as how to work with other musicians and synergize each other's ideas to create the best possible music possible.

Bear canisters are seeing increased popularity in areas where bears have become habituated to human presence, and are required in some places, such as Yosemite National Park in the United States. Construction Bear-resistant trash bin may be opened only by humans, not bears. A bear canister typically weighs between 2-4 lb (1-2 kg), and has a storage capacity of 400 - 900 in3 (6 - 15 liters). The actual capacity in number of days of hiking food stored varies with the appetite of the hiker, the selection of food, and the skill in which it is packed, but a 700 in3 canister likely holds up to a week's worth of food for the average hiker. Hard-sided bear cans employ such materials as polycarbonate, ABS plastic, carbon fiber, and aluminum in their construction. An effective canister must resist both the tremendous strength and high intelligence of an attacking animal. Most containers are too large for a bear to simply pick up and carry away. A captive bear attempting to open a bear canister The lid of a canister is usually recessed in order to prevent it being pried off, and tool use, or at least an advanced degree of motor skills, is required to remove it. Some bear canisters contain gaskets that block the scent from escaping the container. At least one model of soft-sided \\"bear bag\\" is made from Spectra (UHMWPE) fabric. While a soft-sided container may prevent a bear from eating its contents, the food inside is likely to be reduced to purée in the attempt. A newer model comes with an aluminum stiffener that protects the contents more effectively than the bag alone. Regulations A few national parks and national forests require backcountry visitors to carry \\"approved\\" food storage containers. Backpackers who ignore this policy may face fines, property impounded, or eviction from the wilderness. Rangers may stop hikers and require them to produce their containers for inspection. The Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group (SIBBG) and the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee regulate the approval of food storage containers in parts of the western United States. Containers effective against the American black bears in the Sierra Nevada may not be effective against the grizzly bears found elsewhere. SIBBG conducts visual inspection and various structural tests, then containers are filled with food and left in the cages of captive black bears in a zoo in California. If the canister survives the zoo test, it is then conditionally approved. Full approval is only given after three months' successful field tests by users. A stationary steel food storage box at a campsite. Popular destinations equipped with these enable backpackers to do without a bear canister. It is recommended that canisters be left on the ground, at least 100 feet /30 metres from the campsite. Suspending the canister can allow the bear to smash it to the ground or use the suspension gear to carry it away. To prevent a bear from rolling it away, a hiker can leave the container in a bush, a shallow depression, or wedged between rocks or logs. Placing the canister near water could allow the container to float away. Reflective tape and labelling the container helps in recovery.Bear Resistant Canisters FAQs from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Bear bagging An alternative is bear bagging, wherein items attractive to a bear such as food or other perishables are placed in a bag and then raised into the air with a rope -- out of its reach. The rationale is that bears, being unable to reach the food, are less drawn to campsites and pose less of a threat to campers and their equipment. Lightweight nylon stuff sacks are often used for bear bags, but they can be made simply of a large enough square or rectangular piece of cloth or tarp with the food items placed in the center of the tarp and the corners brought up and tied around with rope. The rope is then used to tie the bag in the air where it cannot be reached from the ground or from a tree by a bear. Often this is done by tying another length of rope tightly between two trees or other tall objects. In problem areas, a bear bag should be at least 12 feet (3.5 m) high and 10 feet (3 m) from any vertical support. The counterbalance method, Marrison system, and Pacific Crest Trail method are a few different techniques to use when hanging a bear bag. In areas where trash cannot be burned (much of the United States, especially during dry seasons) and no fortified trash containers are available, trash may also be raised in a separate bear bag to keep the food smells from attracting bears. In areas where bears pose severe problems, such as a majority of Yosemite National Park, bear bagging is ineffective and has been banned.Bears and Food Storage from the Yosemite National Park official website Product failure Yellow-Yellow, a wild 125-pound black bear in the Adirondacks near North Elba, New York, has figured out how to open several models of the BearVault, an approved container. Other bears there have reportedly also learned the skill, but those suspicions have not been confirmed. For a period, the manufacturer discouraged use of the BearVault in the bears' territory.\\"Product Notices \\" BearVault.

The following season he played with Wests Wollongong in the Illawarra Rugby League competition. It was whilst playing for Wests Wollongong that he first represented for Country, NSW and Australia. He spent two seasons with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in 1974 and 1975. Injury forced him into premature retirement in 1976 but in 1978 he was coaxed to make a comeback by his former coach Warren Ryan and returned to the Western Suburbs Magpies for a few games in 1978 before retiring again and taking up coaching.  Representative career  Waite was a Country and New South Wales representative in 1973 before being selected for international representation as a winger in 1973. He played in two Tests of the Ashes tour of Great Britain and two Tests against France. In 1974 he took part in two Tests in the Ashes series in Australia. He scored three tries in the Kangaroos versus Rest of The World match in early 1974 but broke his jaw that season and missed the early representative games. He returned to the Test team for the opening match of the Ashes series but was dropped following Australia's 16-11 second Test loss. Waite is named in the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 447.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 56 Coaching career In 1984 he was appointed coach of the Australian Schoolboys team.

He joined St George in 1996 and went on to guide them to the 1996 Grand Final against great odds and again coached St. George to the 1999 Grand Final. To Waite's surprise, in May 2000 it was announced that he would not be retained as coach for 2001. Instead, the St. George Illawarra board favoured Waite's co-coach, Andrew Farrar for the position. He was reportedly offered the job of New Zealand coach in 2000 but instead moved to Britain to work as a coaching co-ordinator in 2000 for the Rugby Football League. In February 2001, he was appointed head coach and technical director of the Great Britain rugby league team. Waite stepped down from this role in 2003.

He holds eleven honorary doctorates and was knighted in 2001. =Career at Queen's= Bain's gregarious and extrovert personality was in marked contrast to the sombre leadership offered by his predecessor Sir Gordon Beveridge. The latter's tenure was marked by an acrimonious dispute within, and without the University over symbols and the use of the national anthem at graduations ceremonies. Bain pushed Queen's further up the research league table, the RAE but as this was achieved in part by the axing of long-standing departments like Geology, Classics and Irish Studies he suffered from a letter-writing campaign in the Belfast press from supporters of the staff whose posts were closed.\\"Classics closure decision must be reversed\\" Belfast Telegraph, 21 May 2003 Perhaps the most public disappointment of his time at the helm of Belfast's senior university was the failure of the £60 million \\"Lanyon II\\" campaign to create a new 'student village'.\\"Queen's postpones £60m development\\" Belfast Telegraph, 30 May 2002 The self-styled pressure-group \\"QUB Watch\\" also kept him under relentless scrutiny over the closure of the Armagh campus,\\"University to close campus\\" BBC website, 5 May 2004 and over what it considered his failure to reduce the number of cases of religious discrimination being taken against the university by members of staff.\\"Senior Catholic employee paid £150,000 in religious discrimination claim\\" Socialist Worker Online, 23 November 2002 His tenure at Queen's was also notable for a successful fundraising campaign for the Seamus Heaney Poetry Centre and for a new Library building.

He played as a for the St. George Dragons and St. George Illawarra Dragons in the National Rugby League (NRL), also coaching the latter. He then spent time in the Super League coaching the Huddersfield Giants and St Helens, with whom he won the 2014 Super League Grand Final, before returning to Australia to coach the Newcastle Knights in the NRL. Playing career At the end of his debut season Brown played for the St. George Dragons in the 1993 Winfield Cup Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. He also played for them in the 1996 ARL season grand final loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Brown played for the newly formed St. George Illawarra Dragons at hooker in their 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to the Melbourne Storm. He was forced to retire following a neck injury in a 2001 NRL season trial game. Coaching career =St. George Illawarra Dragons= Brown was appointed coach of the Dragons for the 2003 season, becoming the youngest non-playing coach in years in the NRL at age 29. During his first season, at a match on Sunday, 13 April 2003 against Manly at WIN Stadium, a frustrated Nathan Brown berated captain Trent Barrett, Brett Firman and Lance Thompson on the sideline in the 53rd minute with the scores locked up at 12-all. Brown slapped Barrett across the cheek and grabbed the jerseys of Barrett and Thompson. The incident was seen by the crowd and other players on the big screen and proved a decisive turning point as Manly ran in five second half tries to win 38-12. After the match, Brown was apologetic to Barrett and was later fined $5,000 by the NRL. On 19 July 2005, Brown was fined $10,000 by the NRL after claiming that referees are biased against St George Illawarra. Brown made the comments after his team were penalised 9-3 by the referees in St George Illawarra’s 10-36 defeat by Manly-Warringah. After finishing second in the 2005 competition, Brown's team lost the preliminary final to the eventual premiers, Wests Tigers. Following many injuries and team losses throughout the 2007 season, he was under pressure to keep his job heading into the 2008 season. On 1 April 2008, it was announced that Brown would not coach the Dragons in the 2009 season, which ended an association with the club that stretches back to the start of the joint venture. He was replaced by Wayne Bennett. on 18 July 2008 it was announced that Brown had signed a 3-year deal with Super League club, Huddersfield, the same club Tigers superstar Brett Hodgson joined. =Huddersfield Giants= In his first season at Huddersfield he took the team to the 2009 Challenge Cup final. =St Helens= He left Huddersfield at the end of the 2012 season to take control of St Helens. In his first season as coach, Brown guided St Helens to 5th place in Super League. However, they were defeated 11-10 by Leeds Rhinos in the play-offs stage of the competition. In his second season, Brown guided St Helens to 1st place in Super League and victory in the Grand Final, after defeating the Wigan Warriors 14-6 at Old Trafford. Brown's side playing against a 12-man team for 78 minutes, after Warriors prop Ben Flower was sent off for punching Lance Hohaia in the second minute of the match.

Based in Sydney, Brown worked on scouting assignments and provided specialist coaching for the club's s. On 9 September 2015, Brown signed a 3-year contract to coach the Newcastle Knights. =Newcastle Knights= The 2016 NRL season was Brown's first as head coach of the Newcastle Knights. In his first two seasons at Newcastle, Brown's side collected back to back wooden spoons, finishing last on the ladder. In 2018, after Newcastle defeated Brisbane, Brown claimed at the press conference that Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett was to blame for Newcastle's problems over the last few seasons. He went on to say “I just don’t think he needs to behave like that myself but the reality is when Wayne came to town if he thought with his big head rather than his little head, I wouldn’t have had to rebuild the joint,’’. Brown went on to apologize for his remarks a few days later. In June 2018, Brown signed an open ended performance based contract with the Knights with no set term but a payout agreement should the contract end. In the 2019 season, the Knights won their first game, lost their next 5, then won 5, before going back on a 5-game losing streak. This prompted discussions between Brown and club CEO Phillip Gardner, resulting in a mutual agreement that Brown would not coach the Knights in 2020, but would stay on until the end of the season. However, on 27 August, the Knights announced that Brown would depart the club effective immediately.

History The Levy family founded a record shop that also sold bicycles and sewing machines at 19 High Street, Whitechapel, and later moved to 139 High Street. Oriole recorded popular music in England, and also issued masters from the United States Vocalion Records in May and June 1927. The original label was discontinued in 1935. Jacques Levy produced records starting in 1931 at the West End studios at Rosslyn House, 94-98 Regent Street, London, where they stayed until 1937 when they moved to 73 New Bond Street, with chief engineers Ted Sibbick and Bill Johnson, built into what was once an art gallery. In 1949, they segregated the work and the label, with Oriole Records Ltd moving into 104 New Bond Street, London, and with Levy moving out to a factory at Aston Clinton, near Aylesbury. From 1938 or 1939, David Morris Levy lived nearby at Flat 98, Clarence Gate Gardens, near Baker Street, until his 1971 death, and also maintained a residence in Birchington, Kent. The owner, David Morris Levy, and his brother Jacques (no relation to his Roulette Records namesake) revived the Oriole label in 1950. For a few years (ending in 1955) it was the exclusive UK licensee for the American Mercury label, with releases by artists such as Frankie Laine, Vic Damone and Patti Page. These releases appeared first on the Oriole label itself, and later on Mercury. =First hits= Oriole achieved a few home-made hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group's version of \\"Freight Train\\" (featuring Nancy Whiskey on vocals), \\"Like I Do\\" by Maureen Evans (based on the same music as Allan Sherman's \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\" – Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours – and the label's biggest hit), and Russ Hamilton's \\"We Will Make Love\\", which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and the B-side of which (\\"Rainbow\\") reached number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100 on Kapp Records. Another success for Oriole came from Clinton Ford's 1962 version of the George Formby song, \\"Fanlight Fanny\\", which had accompaniment by the 'George Chisholm All Stars'. It also, with permission, had added new words written by Ford. \\"Fanlight Fanny\\" was Ford's third UK chart hit and his most successful single, reaching 22 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1962. It spent ten weeks in that chart. The label also had successes with tracks licensed from European labels, notably Domenico Modugno's original recording of \\"Volare\\" and recordings by the Swedish instrumental group the Spotnicks. In the 1960s Oriole licensed several productions by Joe Meek, performed by the Dowlands, Alan Klein and Screaming Lord Sutch. It also distributed several American hits from Columbia Records in the US. On the long playing LP front, Oriole had a big success in 1954 with the original cast list recording of the smash hit West End musical, Salad Days, which broke all box office records. =Embassy Records= Oriole also produced cover versions of the hits of the day, which it released on its Embassy label, sold exclusively in Woolworths stores. The repertoire consisted of cut-price cover versions of British pop hits of the day; the first releases were in November 1954. One such release was a version of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" by Don Arden (father of Sharon Osbourne), who did his best to impersonate Elvis Presley. Embassy later included session cover performances by such future stars as Elton John (then singing as Reg Dwight). =Tamla Motown on Oriole American= During the tenure of A&R; manager John Schroeder, Oriole was the first UK label (after the odd release on London and Fontana) to license recordings on a regular basis from the US Tamla and Motown catalogues, but none of the releases charted (it was not until a few years later, and on EMI's Stateside label, that the Detroit-based company would begin its run of hits in the UK). Nonetheless, several of the singles have since come to be highly regarded, with famous recordings including \\"Do You Love Me\\" (by the Contours), \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\" (the Miracles), and \\"Fingertips\\" (Little Stevie Wonder). Oriole released nineteen Motown releases on their black and white Oriole American label, while seven albums appeared on the normal black and yellow Oriole label. The company was known as Tamla Motown outside the US, and these were some of its rarest releases. =Takeover by US Columbia= The Oriole record company had two record pressing factories, one situated in Aston Clinton and the other in Colnbrook. It lasted until 21 September 1964, when it was bought by CBS, parent of the American Columbia Records, which was looking to set up their own manufacturing facility in the UK. The result ended the CBS label's distribution by Philips, and began the phasing out of the Oriole label. The Oriole company was officially renamed CBS Records in 1965. David Morris Levy originally stayed on as managing director, but severed all ties with CBS in 1967. David Morris Levy's sons, John Jacob, an attorney at Nicholas Morris in London, and Edward Frederick, principal of Chelsea Music Publishing in London, are still active in the music industry. The Oriole catalogue is now handled by Sony Music, CBS's successor, which was formed after Japanese conglomerate Sony bought CBS Records in 1988 and renamed it Columbia Records in 1991. Reissues from Oriole's releases are distributed by Columbia Records UK.

Characteristics Traits both provide a set of methods that implement behaviour to a class, and require that the class implement a set of methods that parameterize the provided behaviour. For inter-object communication, traits are somewhere between an object-oriented protocol (interface) and a mixin. An interface may define one or more behaviors via method signatures, while a trait defines behaviors via full method definitions: i.e., it includes the body of the methods. In contrast, mixins include full method definitions and may also carry state through member variable, while traits usually don't. Hence an object defined as a trait is created as the composition of methods, which can be used by other classes without requiring multiple inheritance. In case of a naming collision, when more than one trait to be used by a class has a method with the same name, the programmer must explicitly disambiguate which one of those methods will be used in the class; thus manually solving the diamond problem of multiple inheritance. This is different from other composition methods in object- oriented programming, where conflicting names are automatically resolved by scoping rules. Whereas mixins can be composed only using the inheritance operation, traits offer a much wider selection of operations, including: * symmetric sum: an operation that merges two disjoint traits to create a new trait * override (or asymmetric sum): an operation that forms a new trait by adding methods to an existing trait, possibly overriding some of its methods * alias: an operation that creates a new trait by adding a new name for an existing method * exclusion: an operation that forms a new trait by removing a method from an existing trait. (Combining this with the alias operation yields a shallow rename operation). Traits are composed in the following ways: * Trait composition is commutative; the ordering of adding traits does not matter. For example, given trait S = A + B, then trait T = B + A is the same as S. * Conflicting methods are excluded from the composition. * Nested traits are equivalent to flattened traits; the composition hierarchy does not affect the traits behaviour. For example, given trait S = A + X, where X = B + C, then trait T = A + B + C is the same as S. Supported languages Traits come originally from the programming language Self and are supported by the following programming languages: * AmbientTalk: Combines the properties of Self traits (object-based multiple inheritance) and Smalltalk's Squeak traits (requiring explicit composition of traits by the programmer). It builds on the research on stateful and freezable traits to enable state within traits, which was not allowed in the first definitions. *C#: Since version 8.0, C# has support for default interface methods, which have some properties of traits. * C++: Used in Standard Template Library and the C++ standard library to support generic container classes and in the Boost TypeTraits library. * Curl: Abstract classes as mixins permit method implementations and thus constitute traits by another name. * D: Since version 2.003, the __traits language extension and std.traits module helper templates provide compile-time traits. Together with other language features (notably templates and mixins), they allow flexible automatic generation of methods based on interfaces and types. D also allows explicit aliasing of member methods and variables, including forwarding to multiple member classes. * Fortress * Groovy: Since version 2.3 * Haskell: In Haskell, Traits are known as Type classes. * Haxe: Since version 2.4.0. Called Static Extension in the manual, it uses \`using\` keyword * Java: Since version 8, Java has support for default methods, which have some properties of traits. * JavaScript: Traits can be implemented via functions and delegations or through libraries that provide traits. * Julia: Several packages implement traits, e.g., * Kotlin: Traits have been called interfaces since M12. * Lasso * OCaml: Traits can be implemented using a variety of language features: module and module type inclusion, functors and functor types, class and class type inheritance, et cetera. * Perl: Called roles, they are implemented in Perl libraries such as Moose, Role::Tiny and Role::Basic. Roles are part of the sister language Raku. * PHP: Since version 5.4, PHP allows users to specify templates that provide the ability to \\"inherit\\" from more than one (trait-)class, as a pseudo multiple inheritance. * Python: Via a third-party library, or via higher-order mixin classes * Racket: Supports traits as a library and uses macros, structures, and first-class classes to implement them. * Ruby: Module mixins can be used to implement traits. * Rust * Scala trait is builtin supported with the key word \`trait\`. * Smalltalk: Traits are implemented in two dialects of Smalltalk, Squeak and Pharo. * Swift: Traits can be implemented with protocol extensions.  Examples  = C# = On C# 8.0, it is possible to define an implementation as a member of an interface. using System; namespace CSharp8NewFeatures { interface ILogger { // Traditional interface methods void Log(string message); void LogError(Exception exception); // Default interface method void LogWarning(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); } } class Logger : ILogger { public void Log(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); } public void LogError(Exception exception) { Console.WriteLine(exception.ToString()); } } class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { ILogger logger = new Logger(); logger.LogWarning(\\"Some warning message\\"); } } } = PHP = This example uses a trait to enhance other classes: // The template trait TSingleton { private static $_instance = null; private function __construct() {} // Must have private default constructor and be aware not to open it in the class public static function getInstance() { if (null = self::$_instance) { self::$_instance = new self(); } return self::$_instance; } } class FrontController { use TSingleton; } // Can also be used in already extended classes class WebSite extends SomeClass { use TSingleton; } This allows simulating aspects of multiple inheritance: trait TBounding { public $x, $y, $width, $height; } trait TMoveable { public function moveTo($x, $y) { // … } } trait TResizeable { public function resize($newWidth, $newHeight) { // … } } class Rectangle { use TBounding, TMoveable, TResizeable; public function fillColor($color) { // … } } = Rust = A trait in Rust declares a set of methods that a type must implement. Rust compilers require traits to be explicated, which ensures the safety of generics in Rust. // type T must have the \\"Ord\\" trait // so that \\">\\" and \\"<\\" operations can be done fn get_max(a: &[T]) -> Option<&T;> { let mut result = a.get(0)?; for n in a { if *n > *result { result = &n; } } Some(result) } To simplify tedious and repeated implementation of traits like \`Debug\` and \`Ord\`, \`derive\` can be used to request compilers to generate certain implementations automatically. Derivable traits include: \`Clone\`, \`Copy\`, \`Debug\`, \`Default\`, \`PartialEq\`, \`Eq\`, \`PartialOrd\`, \`Ord\` and \`Hash\`.

Armadale, formerly known as Barbauchlaw, is an ex-mining town which was also known for its brick manufacturing. It is named after Armadale in Sutherland, this estate being owned by Sir William Honeyman who later acquired the land of Barbauchlaw. Overview The town has a great number of different public places. There are eight public bars in the town - Coppies, The Corrie, The Cross Bar, The Cavalier, The Bucks Head Tavern, The Highlander, The Regal, and The Goth, which provides the town clock at the front of the building and The Rowan Tree. There are local shops like Coia's Sweet Shop, Coia's Fish and Chip shop, John Dewar and Sons Butchers and more. There is also a small Scotmid supermarket on West Main Street. Armadale from the north-west before the last lum was demolished. West Main Street, looking westwards. Armadale (Woodend Farm) is officially the site of Ogilface Castle. Woodend Farm has another site nearer Blackridge, marked as 'Ogelface in ruins' on a 1773 map. These sites have been the subject of archaeological geophysics surveys by the Edinburgh Archaeological Field Society and Dr Peter Morrishttp://www.eafs.org.uk/ and kite aerial photography by the West Lothian Archaeological Trust which now also manages the Armadale Community and Heritage Website. History Before the building of a new turnpike road between Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1786 the village of Armadale was little more than a rural farm community but its location at a main highway junction brought additional traffic and a toll house was built where the new road intersected with an existing road in the east of the estate. The estate comprising the lands of Barbauchlaw was sold to Sir William Honeyman in 1790 and upon his elevation to the bench in 1797 he took the title of Lord Armadale (from his mother's estate in Sutherland) and this name was then applied to the township The discovery of large coal deposits and also ironstone in the area attracted the attention of a number of companies and several pits were sunk in the area. A coal company was formed in 1819 and began to work the \\"Woodend Pit\\" to the north-west of the toll house. The resulting boost in prosperity brought railway companies onto the scene transporting an influx of workers requiring housing and all the usual attendant facilities such as shops, village halls, churches etc.. A school was first formed in the town also in this year, and it eventually became necessary to build a dedicated school house in 1839 to accommodate the growing number of students. As with most mineral dependent communities, as the deposits were exhausted and the pits closed, many moved away but enough local industry remained for the township to survive and today it has also become a commuting hub for those employed in the major towns. Transport The station at Armadale, first opened by the defunct Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway was constructed as part of the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in the south end of Armadale and re-opened on 4 March 2011. First Scotland East and Lothian Country Buses also run bus services into the village linking Armadale with Blackridge, Whitburn, Bathgate, Livingston, Broxburn and Edinburgh. Culture and sport Armadale Stadium features speedway. It was also used in the past for stock car racing and, until 2016, for greyhound racing. Speedway started in 1997 when the Edinburgh Monarchs team moved here competing in the Premier League, which it won 5 times, until the 2016 season. Reorganisation of the sport the following year saw the team enter the SGB Championship. The town also has a long- established football team, Armadale Thistle, whose home, Volunteer Park, is located on North Street. Armadale Bowling Club located in South Street was established in 1867 and celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2017. The Armadale Flute Band, established in 1983, has won competitions all over Scotland. In May 2013, following the death of Trustee Rosie Wells, and her subsequent bequest, the Armadale registered Scottish Charity No SC043118 (The West Lothian Archaeological Trust) set up the Scottish National Aerial Photography Scheme for children and students. International recognition came in the same month, with the Trust being invited to become an Associated Partner of the ArchaeoLandscapes Europe Project, part of the European Union's Culture Programme, which is managed by Dr Axel Posluschny of the Roman-Germanic Commission of the German Archaeological Institute. Education The old \\"Armadale Academy\\" building The local high school Armadale Academy was originally built at the site that now plays host to Armadale Primary School. It was rebuilt and opened in 1967, at West Main Street, Armadale, and was again rebuilt and opened in August 2009, immediately behind the 1967 Academy building. The site of the old building will be used for new car parking facilities, and new playing fields. The current headmaster is Graham Paris.

Although he resigned this appointment after a ship escaped, Stewart was a highly regarded Naval officer and his career continued. He served under Admiral Richard Howe in his expedition to Gibraltar. Stewart became a Rear Admiral in 1790, and Vice Admiral in 1794. He was awarded the Order of the Bath. =Political career= He represented Wigtown Burghs for a short time in 1762, between winning a by- election on 19 February 1762 and resigning before a new MP was elected on 15 April 1762. He was MP for Wigtownshire from 1768 to 1784.History of Parliament: House of Commons 1754-1790, by Sir Lewis Namier and James Brooke (Sidgwick & Jackson 1964) Personal life On 13 May 1782, Stewart was married to Georgina Isabella d'Aguilar, daughter of Ephraim Lópes Pereira d'Aguilar, 2nd Baron d'Aguilar.

He played over 29 Tests and World Cup games as Australia representative and captained his country in two Tests of the 1973 Kangaroo tour. Background Raudonikis was born Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. He is the son of a Lithuanian immigrant father and a Swiss immigrant mother. He joined the RAAF as an Engineering Apprentice in 1967 and spent three years under training at RAAF Wagga. Club playing career He played 202 games for the Western Suburbs Magpies between 1969 and 1979 before moving to the Newtown Jets for 37 games in three seasons between 1980 and 1982. He played under two famous coaches, Roy Masters at Wests and Warren Ryan at Newtown. Some rate him the toughest player ever to have played in the halves and in September 2004 he was named in the Western Suburbs Magpies team of the century. Raudonikis was Western Suburbs Club Captain from 1971 to 1979, and was Newtown Club Captain from 1980 to 1982.Rugby League Project *240+ senior game for Western Suburbs Magpies and Newtown Jets *Won the 1972 Rothmans Medal Representative playing career Raudonikis was first selected in an Australian squad in 1971 behind Souths halfback Bob Grant and made his run on debut in 1972 against the Kiwis (the same year he won the Rothmans Medal for best club player for the season). He was the regular Test halfback for the next six years. He made Test appearances up until 1980 by which time he was being challenged by Greg Oliphant and Steve Mortimer. He was the captain of the New South Wales State of Origin team in the inaugural 1980 contest. *NSW and Australian halfback throughout the 1970s *First NSW state of origin captain in 1980 *Coached NSW Blues in 1997 and 1998 Origin Series *NSW Sporting Hall of Fame *Kangaroos captain in 1973 for the deciding Ashes test against Great Britain (won 15–5) and the opening test against France (won 21–9) *29 Test and World Cup caps Awards Raudonikis in 2008 *Awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 1982 *Team of the Century with Wests Tigers and Western Suburbs *Wests Magpies # 1 club man in 100 years and Magpie Immortal *Voted Newtown's Greatest Import in 100 years *Men of Leagues' Toughest 12 in last 50 years *ARL's greatest 100 in past 100 years Coaching career Raudonikis' final playing year was in a captain coach role at Brisbane Brothers in 1983. He later coached Brisbane Norths and the Ipswich Jets in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. Returning to Sydney, he was coach of the Western Suburbs Magpies from 1995 until the formation of the Wests Tigers joint venture with the Balmain Tigers at the end of 1999. He had some initial coaching success making the finals in 1996, but Wests were ultimately unable to build on this and only won six games in their final two seasons. Raudonikis coached the Blues in the 1997 and 1998 series. In those series he entered State of Origin folklore when he introduced the \\"Cattledog\\" call to which NSW players responded by breaking from the scrum with fists flying, resulting in two infamous all-in-brawls. In the media Raudonikis is a long-term friend of 2GB radio station owner John Singleton. Through this friendship, he also participated as a commentator for the Continuous Call Team with Ray Hadley on 2GB. Raudonikis' hospitalization in August 2006 for a heart bypass operation made Australian sports news and drew messages of support from a spectrum of famous former players including Wests icons Arthur Summons (the subject of the NRL trophy with Norm Provan). Raudonikis made an appearance in the 2007 rugby league drama film The Final Winter. Raudonikis at one stage worked as a part of the Channel 9 rugby league commentary team. In February 2008, Raudonikis was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Also in 2008 the Western Suburbs Magpies celebrated their centenary by inducting six inaugural members, including Raudonikis, into the club's Hall of Fame.

Their first team plays in the Western League and in 2017–18 won promotion from the First Division to the Premier Division. History The club started in 1920 when two local sides amalgamated. Westbury Old Comrades FC had just won promotion to the First Division of the Wiltshire County League, and to strengthen the side they joined forces with a local junior side, Westbury Great Western Railway XI, and together they became Westbury United Football Club. In its first season, the Club finished third from bottom of the County league and in the 1920s they struggled, but in the 1930s they won everything possible in Wiltshire football. In 1936 the Club reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup. They were led by a magnificent player, Billy Pearce, who captained the County throughout the decade. Also in the side at the time was prolific goal scorer Bill Butler, who scored more than eighty senior goals in one season, and thirty in one month. The Club purchased and moved to its present ground in Meadow Lane in 1934, the cost of the four-acre site being £475. The first game played on what was then the Jubilee Playing Field was against Bristol City and a crowd of around 4000 attended. The Club has produced many players who have gone on to make the grade at professional football, two of them being centre forwards for Bristol City. The first was Reg Smith who played for City in the 1930s and was then transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers for what was described in the Press as a 'considerable fee'. The other was John Atyeo, for whom City played a presentation game against Westbury and made a donation of £100. Atyeo played over 600 games for City and scored 359 goals; he also played six times for England in which he netted five goals. He died suddenly in June 1993, aged 61, and now has a grandstand named after him at City's Ashton Gate ground as well as a street in his home village of Dilton Marsh (a few miles from Meadow Lane). The Club has strong family traditions. Wilf Alford left Westbury before the last War to play for then First Division Portsmouth. His son, Phil, managed the Reserve Team for many years as well as stints helping at First Team level, while his grandsons have also played for the Club. Westbury joined the Western League in 1984 and initially struggled. In 1988 floodlights were erected and Southampton were the visitors for the official switch-on. Season 1988–89 saw the club win its first honour in the League, winning the Sportsmanship Trophy. In 1991, under the management of Ian Harris, they won the First Division title to gain promotion to the Premier Division. The highest League placing to date came in the 1994–95 season when they finished fifth. The Club has had its share of dedicated officials who have given a lifetime of service. Former Club President, Ernie Barber, who died in December 2012, carried the team kit as a seven-year-old in 1933, and after the war he started playing. When he finished playing he became Secretary and held the post until the end of the 1996–97 season when he decided to retire. Recent years In recent years the Club has, with the help of the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, been able to replace the drainage system on the pitch as well as erect fencing around the ground and a wall around the pitch. Following several seasons in the 2000s where the aim of promotion to the Toolstation Premier League wasn't achieved, long standing manager Paul Brickley stood down and there were six seasons of struggle from 2010/11 till 2015/16 under various managers, with the team finishing in the bottom three every time. Matthew Bright took over as Chairman in November 2014, installing Shaun Gardner as 1st team manager. Bright aims to make the club more family orientated and make Westbury United the centre of the local community. The club now have a strong link with the local youth football club, Westbury Youth FC, which provides a pathway for youth footballers. Gardner's team finished the 2014/2015 season bottom of the league table but avoided relegation. In September 2015, Gardner resigned as first team manager. His assistant manager, James Goddard, was appointed as his successor after three games in temporary charge. Westbury finished the 2015/16 season in 20th position. Season 2016/17 started with them winning half of their games up until the middle of November, followed by a run of nine games with only one win and one draw. Morale amongst the players was low and the officers of the club were concerned Westbury would be involved in another relegation battle; the decision was made to relieve James Goddard from his duties at the club after a home defeat by Chippenham Park, at that time a relegation rival. Westbury's reserve manager, Marc Lanfear, stepped in to lead the first team whilst a new manager was sought. He was assisted for those two matches by Nathan Hallett-Young; they won both of their games against two of the top three teams in the division. Father and son, Neil and Joe Kirkpatrick, were appointment joint managers on 1 February 2017. They suffered defeat in their first three league games in charge, but after that they oversaw a five league game winning streak, the first time Westbury United achieved this since 2009. Westbury started the 2017/18 season with three teams: the first team competing in the Toolstation Western League Division One, the Reserves competing in the Wiltshire Senior League and the Development Team in the Trowbridge and District League. The Kirkpatricks had attracted a strong group of players and Westbury started the season amongst the favorites to be promoted. They started the season well, staying unbeaten for the first 13 league games, winning 8 and drawing 5. Chairman Matt Bright stepped down in early October to spend more time with his family, and Secretary Greg Coulson was elected to become Chairman at a Special General Meeting in early November. The club won the First Division and secured promotion to the Premier Division. They scored more points (95, previous best 91) and more goals (97, previous best 95), and conceded the fewest goals (29, previous best 39) in the club's history. The 2018/19 season saw Westbury stay unbeaten until Boxing Day (17 games, 14 wins and 3 draws) before losing to local rivals Bradford Town FC 1-0 at home. They continued their good form and ended up finishing in their joint highest league position ever, 5th place with 74 points. In their first venture into the FA Cup since 2010 they reached the first qualifying round, beating Cribbs and Saltash before being knocked-out by Bitton. In the FA Vase they got to the first round proper, where Saltash took their revenge and earned a 2-1 win on a very windy day. They also got to the semi-final of the Wiltshire FA Senior Cup, before losing 4-1 (aet) to Swindon Supermarine FA. The highlight of the 2019/20 season was their match against Swindon Town FC – the county's only professional team – in the quarter-final of the newly formed Wiltshire FA Senior Shield competition, where Westbury lost 7-0. The 19/20 season was brought to a premature end due to COVID-19 with Westbury positioned 12th in the league. It also saw the end of the Kirkpatricks' reign after three successful years at the club. Current season Ex-players Lewis Porter and Ricky Hulbert were installed as joint managers. FA competitions The club has competed in the FA Cup in most seasons since 1922, with the highlight being reaching the First Round Proper in 1937–38, losing to London side Walthamstow Avenue at home by 3–1. They are one of the few clubs to have taken part in every FA Vase since that competition's inception, but have yet to reach the later stages – their best showing being reaching the third round (last 64), on three occasions. Ground Westbury United play their home matches at Westbury Park Engineering Ground, Meadow Lane, Westbury, Wiltshire, BA13 3AF. The ground has two small stands, one being along the length of the pitch with 96 seats, and the other in one corner behind the goal. There are trees that surround the ground making it look enclosed, and there is plenty of space for additional stands to be built if necessary. The pitch has a small wall around the outside, and has a set of nets behind one goal to stop balls from going into the adjacent housing. The ground has a café which serves hot drinks, pies, pasties and sausage rolls on match days and a licensed bar which is open to the public. The clubhouse contains the licensed bar, a skittles alley and a pool table. The clubhouse is available for the local public to hire for social events.

It was sold to the Sanctuary Records Group in 2001 and ceased any activity in 2007 due to the bankruptcy of Sanctuary. The Noise catalogue was consequently acquired by Universal Music Group later on. In April 2016, BMG Rights Management, which had acquired Sanctuary Records in 2013, announced that it would revive the Noise Records label. History In 1981, Karl-Ulrich Walterbach founded the independent record company Modern Music Records GmbH in Berlin, Germany. In the first years of activity, the label division called Aggressive Rock Produktionen (AGR) published only punk German-speaking groups (Slime, Daily Terror, Toxoplasma, compilation series like \\"Soundtracks zum Untergang\\") and American punk bands (Black Flag with Henry Rollins, Hüsker Dü, Misfits, Angry Samoans, etc.). In 1983, Walterbach was working closely with Black Flag and the American label SST and was also in contact with American West Coast underground metal bands such as Saint Vitus. From this nucleus he developed the label Noise Records, which was in 1984 the first specialized outlet for European thrash metal bands such as Kreator, Tankard, Sabbat and Coroner, but released also the works of bands with other metal styles, such as Helloween, Running Wild, Celtic Frost, Grave Digger, Voivod, and Rage. In the early days, there was a two-year collaboration with the New York-based label Megaforce Records, which was the first publisher of Metallica. Through this deal, Noise published under license the albums of American thrash metal band Overkill and at the same time Megaforce issued Grave Digger works in the United States. Noise Records most successful band was the Hamburg-based power metal band Helloween. The Keeper of the Seven Keys albums achieved worldwide top chart positions and sales of over 1 million alone for Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II in the late 1980s. A European label deal in 1990 with the German EMI for four bands (Helloween, Running Wild, Celtic Frost, V2) was short-lived, because the management of Helloween decided unilaterally to have the group put under contract directly with the English EMI. The subsequent altogether 16 lawsuits where decided by the German courts in favor of Noise Records and settled out of court after a two-year legal battle. The settlement cost Helloween a seven-digit figure. The other result of the legal battle was that Helloween stopped releasing albums and touring for two years and then went their own way. With a stylistic change towards glam metal in Pink Bubbles Go Ape their sales declined to 25% of their Noise Records heights and resulted in EMI dropping the band after just two studio albums. Machinery Records (or simply Machinery) was a record label founded by Jor Jenka and Anna Rosen in 1989 and also based in Berlin, Germany. The label was best known for releasing industrial and experimental acts, several of which (such as Oomph! and Cubanate) went on to achieve later success. The label's heyday was the early 1990s when it was considered one of the most important labels for EBM and electro-industrial music. In 1991, Machinery came under the Noise Records banner, as part of the Modern Music Records group. By the end of the 1990s Machinery was releasing less music, with many of the original acts instead releasing on the Dynamica sub-label. When Modern Music was acquired by the Sanctuary Records Group in 2001, the Machinery imprint was finally dropped. The imprint T&T; Records was born in 1993, as a subsidiary of Noise Records and brought to the roster more melodic heavy metal bands (Virgin Steele, Stratovarius, Elegy, etc.), while the cooperation with the Berlin label Hellhound Records in 1994 introduced Noise in the doom metal scene. The productions of Noise Records were sold or licensed through a worldwide distribution in about 42 countries. In the United States and the United Kingdom the label had its own offices. Noise Records was sold together with the whole Modern Music Group to the English Sanctuary Records Group in 2001. After the acquisition by Universal Music Group in August 2007, Sanctuary Records was closed as an independent label. This at the same time meant the end of Noise Records. An unofficial biography on Noise Records entitled Damn the Machine - The Story of Noise Records, was released in 2017. The book was authored by American metal journalist David E. Gehlke, who received full cooperation from Walterbach and the Noise Records roster. Future As of 2016, the label has been reactivated and BMG has launched a reissue campaign from some of the label's most prominent acts.

The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. Wellington joined the Western League in 1978, and have remained in Division One of that league ever since, except for a three-season spell in the Premier Division from 1981–84. They escaped Division One again in 2008 after winning the title and gaining promotion to the Premier. The club entered the FA Cup for four seasons in the early 1980s, twice winning a preliminary round tie, but never progressing past the first qualifying round. Their best FA Vase run dates to 1990–91, when they reached the third round (last 64). Although officially named simply Wellington A.F.C., the county in which they play is often appended to their name to differentiate them from Wellington F.C. based in Herefordshire. They are also sometimes erroneously listed as Wellington Town. In September 2010 the club launched a ladies team called Wellington Town Ladies who currently play in the Somerset County Women's League Division 1. In April 2017, Wellington won the Western League Division 1 title, securing promotion to the Premier Division for the 2017-2018 season.

The film was released on November 1, 1947, and features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. It parodies the Mocambo nightclub in Los Angeles--in the cartoon referred to as \\"The Mocrumbo\\". Mel Blanc voices Bugs, Arthur Q. Bryan voices Elmer Fudd and impressionist Dave Barry portrays Humphrey Bogart. The title is a pun on \\"hair\\", from an era when hair slicked down by oil was a popular fashion style for men. Plot The cartoon opens with various shots of 1940s celebrities dining and drinking at the Mocrumbo club--including such personalities as Gregory Peck using a straight razor to cut his steak in reference to his character in Hitchcock's Spellbound,https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005676884/ Ray Milland (in a spoof of The Lost Weekend, he pays for his drink with a manual typewriter and receives miniature typewriters as change) and Frank Sinatra (depicted exaggeratedly thin, so much so that he slips into his straw when trying to take a sip from his drink). Fudd is a waiter at the Mocrumbo and comes out to find that his next customer is Humphrey Bogart. Bogart tells Elmer that he wants fried rabbit, within 20 minutes--or else! (pulls out a tommy gun). This puts Elmer in a bind, as the restaurant is \\"fwesh out of wabbit.\\" However, during his frantic search for one, Elmer hears the sound of Bugs munching on some carrots in a corner of the kitchen. Elmer lets Bugs know that Bogart wants to \\"have\\" him for dinner. Bugs immediately dresses in a tailcoat and wants to have a peek at what is cooking. Elmer quickly puts a mirror into a pot. Bugs, taking a look inside, soon realizes that he himself is the main course. Bugs eventually manages to escape the kitchen, dressing like Groucho Marx in an attempt to fool Elmer. Elmer then appears next to Bugs, dressed as Harpo Marx. Bugs tries to make a getaway, but is stopped by the large stomach of Sydney Greenstreet. He runs into Carmen Miranda's dressing room and hides in her fruit headdress. Carmen then performs a song and as she exits the stage, Elmer starts chasing Bugs. Elmer runs away from the audience leaving Bugs to dance to the orchestra's samba rhythms. Bugs then makes his way back to the kitchen, where he revels in the audience's appreciation of his performance (\\"Ah, my public! How they love me! A-huh-huh!\\") (the little laugh being a Jack Benny shtick). Fudd then runs towards Bugs, and Bugs immediately pretends to be a waiter ordering pies and twice splatters Elmer in the face, first with a lemon meringue pie, then with a banana cream pie. The third time (a comic triple), when Bugs orders a coconut custard pie with whipped cream, Elmer finally realizes that the waiter is Bugs (\\"Say, ya know what I think? I think that's the wabbit! Well, he who waughs wast, ha ha ha!\\") and after making the pie, in an attempt to take the last laugh, he throws it at Bugs, but Bugs ducks and the pie sails out into the seating area, accidentally hitting Bogart in the face. Bogart walks into the kitchen, grabs Elmer by his collar and asks him, \\"Why did you hit me in a face wid a coconut custard pie with whipped cream?\\" Bogart then warns Elmer that he has just 5 minutes to come up with his fried rabbit. Elmer searches frantically, but cannot find one in time. Bogart returns, and sticks his hand in his jacket menacingly. Elmer thinks he's about to die, but Bogart only pulls out a handkerchief to dab his forehead as he says resignedly, \\"Baby will just have to have a ham sandwich instead.\\" Upon hearing \\"Baby\\", Bugs jumps out of his hiding place and takes his place as the main course (Lauren Bacall being \\"Baby\\"), noting, \\"Remember, garçon, the customer is always right! If it's rabbit Baby wants, rabbit Baby gets!\\" before howling and wolf whistling at Bacall. Cast * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Waiter, Bartender and Ray Milland * Arthur Q.

History This street was once part of a unique rue de Morny that extended until the Place d'Iéna. Already with its present name, its section between the avenue George V and the abovementioned place was renamed avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie in 1918. Present name Pierre Charron (1541–1603) was a French philosopher, author of Traité de la Sagesse (Treatise on Wisdom), and a friend of fellow philosopher Montaigne after whom the nearby avenue Montaigne is named. Closest Métro station The Rue Pierre Charron empties into the avenue des Champs-Elysées about midway between métro line 1 stations George V and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Also nearby are metro line 9's Saint-Philippe du Roule (to the north) and Alma-Marceau (to the south).

The recording sessions took place in a supposedly haunted house somewhere in the deserts of Nevada. While many at the time thought it nothing more than a gimmick, the band claimed that it inspired them to create what is now considered one of the more deranged albums ever recorded. Rather than opting for one musical style, the album alternates between hard, razor-sharp, creepy- crawly punk rock with echo-like wolf howls to textural synthesizer soundtracks filled with strange noises. But, while the musical style varied, the themes remained rooted in modern horror.

Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is yet to be determined. Very weird. *OPtion Magazine, Los Angeles - Hard, razor sharp, creepy crawly rock'n'roll with echo-like wolf howls. Rumored to have been recorded in an actual haunted house in the Nevada desert, with khemical/magikal rituals to \\"inspire\\" the musicians and derange their music. \\"A Wagonload of Corpses\\" sounds like time warp travel back to Middle Ages Black Plague Epidemic Rot. These maniacs were born to score horror flicks.-- Nik Wax.\\"Reviews\\". (July/August 1985, Issue C). OPtion, p.19 *Unsound Magazine, San Francisco, California - This is the first release from the band which describes their sound as a fusion of Suicide's minimilism, Chrome's psycadelia, Snakefinger's pop and Throbbing Gristle's violent confusion. This album is well produced and moves smoothly within its conceptual nature. Their focus is the morbid, bloody horror of B-monster movies with the campy mystery of blood and guts. Textural synthesizer lines and strange noises create a soundtrack style piece, a great substitute for ghost stories around the campfire.\\"Reviews\\". (October 1983, Vol. 1 No. 3). Unsound, p.43 *Flipside (fanzine), Los Angeles, California - Moody post punk to experimental droney music. Perhaps the \\"scariest\\" album ever. *OP, Seattle - The Haunting by Theatre of Ice features end-of-world vocals over throbbing industrial beats. Abrupt cuts of TV audio, weird hypnotic trumpets (?), synths. Excellent. Unlike anything before it. *Cause and Effect, Indianapolis, Indiana - Theatre of Ice are masters of the B-monster movie sound. This is raw primitive punk music whose subject matter deals with the morbid and macabre. Features a savage, echoey guitar sound and vocals straight-from-the-crypt. Recorded in a haunted house in the middle of the Nevada desert, The Haunting is made up of 21 tracks with titles like The Burning Man, Monsters From Beyond, A Wagonload of Corpses, Brain Damage and, From the Ruins of my Mind. *SPAMM, Sacramento, California - Extra moody experimental music. Throbbing synth, spastic but melodic guitars and haunting vocals makes this the music to blast out the window this October 31 to scare the trick or treaters away, the Halloween soundtrack of the 80's. Every composition is well above exceptional standards. *Phoenix New Times, Phoenix, Arizona - The Haunting is a success in bringing a modern approach to gothic-horror themes. The band seems to have tackled the idea of a futuristic, underground spook show, but even as an alternative offering there are grave (sorry) deficiencies. At its best, The Haunting shows Theatre of Ice as an outfit with a future in soundtracks and/or audio performance art. The album's droning ambiance and scattered electronic background cries at times almost pulls the listeners inside the gloomy atmosphere. At its worst, the album is a Mr. Hyde of monotonous noise that leaves the listener gasping for a quick, clean pop song. It will now be interesting to hear how the group decides to progress–either as underground practitioners of the macabre, or more accessible musicians who can wrap it all up in a song.

Lee began modeling as a teenager and made her entertainment debut in the Super Elite Model Contest in 1998. She switched quickly to acting, playing supporting roles in television dramas such as Beautiful Days, Girl's High School Days, Into the Sun, and Phoenix. Personal life In May 2003, Lee held a press conference and tearfully acknowledged that she was of mixed race. She had previously denied the rumors that she was biracial, but fans had long suspected the truth from her 5-foot-9 stature (5 inches taller than the average Korean woman) and naturally creased eyelids. Lee told reporters that she had been afraid of being discriminated against, saying, \\"People ask why didn't I come out earlier and why this is such a big deal. It wouldn't be anywhere else, but Korea is still a closed society where people like to talk about the purity of the race.\\" Lee was born to a South Korean mother and a Hispanic-American U.S. Army soldier; her parents married in 1976 while her father was stationed in Korea, but they divorced when she was 1 year old and he returned to the United States. Lee has had no contact with her birth father and she was raised solely by her single mother. South Korea uses a traditional Confucian-inspired family registry that requires children to be listed under their fathers' names and their fathers to be Korean—so that children with foreign fathers are in effect nonpersons under the law.

The modern city is located at , while the ancient city is located at . The city is home to one of the largest Coptic Catholic churches in the country.  History  = Names and etymology = The name of the city is derived from early Egyptian Zawty (Z3JW.TJ) (late Egyptian, Səyáwt) adopted into the Coptic as Syowt , which means \\"Guardian\\" of the northern approach of Upper Egypt. In Graeco-Roman Egypt, it was called Lycopolis or Lykopolis (, \\"\\"),Ptol. iv. 5. § 63; Steph. B. s. v.; Strabo xvii. p. 813) ('wolf city') Lycon,(Plin. v. 9. s. 11) or Lyco.(Itin. Anton. p. 157) = Ancient Asyut = Statue of the chief royal scribe Yuny of Asyut and his wife Renenutet, 1290–1270 BCE early Dynasty 19. Ancient Asyut was the capital of the Thirteenth Nome of Upper Egypt (Lycopolites Nome) around 3100 BC. It was located on the western bank of the Nile. The two most prominent gods of ancient Egyptian Asyut were Anubis and Wepwawet, both funerary deities. During the First Intermediate Period, the rulers of \\"Zawty\\" (Khety I, Tefibi, and Khety II) were supporters of the Herakleopolitan kings, of whose domain the Nome formed the southern limits. The conflict between this Nome and the southern Nomes under the rule of the Eleventh Dynasty ended with the victory of Thebes and the decline of Asyut's importance. Skull of Khety from Asyut, 1950 BCE. Lycopolis has no remarkable ruins, but in the excavated chambers of the adjacent rocks mummies of wolves have been found, confirming the origin of its name, as well as a tradition preserved by Diodorus Siculus,(ii. 88; comp. Aelian. Hist. An. x. 28) to the effect that an Ethiopian army, invading Egypt, was repelled beyond the city of Elephantine by packs of wolves. Osiris was worshipped under the symbol of a wolf at Lycopolis. According to a myth, he had come \\"from the shades\\" as a wolf to aid Isis and Horus in their combat with Typhon.(Champollion, Descript. de l'Egypte, vol. i. p. 276; Jollois, Egypte, vol. ii. ch. 13.) Other ancient Egyptian monuments discovered in Asyut include; the Asyut necropolis (west of the modern city), tombs which date to dynasties Nine, Ten and Twelve, and the Ramessid tombs of Siese and Amenhotep. In Graeco-Roman times, there was a distinct dialect of Coptic spoken in Asyut, known as \\"Lycopolitan\\", after the Greek name for the city. Lesser-used names for this dialect are \\"Sub-Akhmimic\\" and \\"Assiutic\\". A large Byzantine Treasure was discovered near the city in the early twentieth century and is now dispersed amongst a number of museums in the West. The hoard is composed of some of the most elaborate jewellery to survive from late antiquity. Asyut was the end of 40 Day Road that connected the city to Darfur through the Selima and Kharga Oases. The history of the road, known by local herders as Darb al- Arba'in, goes back over 700 years. It was used as a pathway for great caravans of up to 12,000 camels at its peak in the 14th century.  Modern Asyut  Today, the city of Asyut has almost 400,000 inhabitants. It is the Egyptian city with one of the highest Coptic Christian concentration of approximately 50%. It is also home to the Assiut University, one of the largest universities in Egypt, to the Assiut Barrage, and to the Lillian Trasher Orphanage. The city is one of the only cities in the world that still makes silver appliqué- work shawls and is home to a large textile industry. The city also produces fine pottery, inlaid woodwork, and rugs. The Virgin Mary is reported to have appeared in Asyut on 17 August 2000. This apparition is recognized as an official Marian apparition by the Coptic Orthodox Church and remembered in the Deir el-Muharraq, Monastery of the Virgin Mary. Asyut is the terminus of the Ras Shukheir-Asyut oil pipeline, the terminus of the Cairo-Asyut gas pipeline and the beginning of the proposed Asyut-Qena gas pipeline, the last two being part of the Nile Valley Gas Company Pipeline Project. Aysut is next to the Aysut Dam across the Nile river in the neighboring port of Al-Hamra. The dam was built in 1902 and a hydroelectric plant was added in the 1980s. = Coptic Catholic Eparchy = On 10 August 1947, a Coptic Catholic eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Assiut (or Lycopolis) was established on southern Egyptian territory split off from the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Luqsor, each suffragan of Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria. Its episcopal see is the cathedral of the Mother of Divine Love, in Assyut. ;Suffragan Eparchs (Bishops) of Assiut (all Coptic Rite) * Alexandros Scandar (9 August 1947 – death 29 December 1964) * Youhanna Nueir, Friars Minor (O.F.M.)

Luxor, Minya, Qena and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost difference. The city of Asyut is sandwiched between two mountain ranges of about 600m height. There is also a lowering in elevation in mid Egypt, from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This gives the city and nearby towns and villages the similar properties of a continental climate, meaning that the city has harsh and chilly cold winter weather, and very hot but non-humid summers. During summer the temperature can exceed . Yet, in winter Asyut gets below temperatures during the night and frost can easily form, while hail or snow are rare because of the low average of the city's precipitation and general low humidity. The highest record temperature was , recorded on July 23, 1994, while the lowest record temperature was , recorded on January 16, 2008.

It was established in 1941 as Delhi Polytechnic. In 1952, it started giving degrees after being affiliated with the University of Delhi. The institute has been under the Government of Delhi since 1963 and was affiliated with the University of Delhi from 1952 to 2009. In 2009, the college was given university status, thus changing its name to Delhi Technological University. History =Delhi Polytechnic= The Delhi Polytechnic was visioned as a follow up of the Wood and Abbott Committee of 1938. It was established as Delhi Polytechnic in 1941. The technical school was created to cater to the demands of Indian industries. At that time, Delhi Polytechnic offered courses in Arts, Architecture, Commerce, Engineering, Applied Science and Textiles. Walter William Wood, became the founder Principal of Delhi Polytechnic. It became Delhi's first engineering college and was amongst the few engineering institutions in India set up prior to independence. The National Diploma awarded by Delhi Polytechnic was considered an equivalent to the B.E. Degree by the then UPSC. The college was affiliated with the University of Delhi in 1952 and started formal degree level programmes. = Delhi College of Engineering = Up till 1962, the college was under the direct control of the Ministry of Education, Government of India. Since 1963, Delhi Polytechnic was taken over by the then Delhi Administration and Chief Commissioner Delhi was the ex-officio chairman of the college. It later became a college of the Union Territory of Delhi. In 1963, Department of Arts became the College of Arts and Department of Commerce & Business Administration was converted to several institutes of Commerce & Secretarial Practices. Fragmentation of Delhi Polytechnic ultimately left behind an engineering institute alone. In 1962, the college was affiliated with University of Delhi. In 1965, the Delhi Polytechnic was renamed as Delhi College of Engineering and became the first engineering college of Delhi, Now it is called Delhi technological university. B.E. degree course in Production & Industrial Engineering was started in 1988 while B.E. degree course in Computer Engineering was started in 1989. B.E. degree level courses were started in Polymer Science & Chemical Technology and Environment Engineering in 1998. Information technology played a vital role during this era and the beginning of new millennium witnessed the introduction of B.E. in Information Technology in 2002. B.E. in Bio-Technology was introduced from the academic session 2004-2005. The Department of Architecture of the Delhi College of Engineering became the School of Planning and Architecture, now a Deemed University and Institution of National importance. The Department of Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the Departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology were shifted out en- block to mark the beginning of the IIT Delhi at its new campus at Hauz Khas. The Department of Commerce was later abolished and the Faculty of Management Studies of the University of Delhi was established by Prof. A. Das Gupta, of DCE. Delhi Administration established Delhi Institute of Technology (Presently Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) in 1985 and the new college was established under the patronage of Delhi College of Engineering. DCE shared its campus with NSIT at Kashmiri Gate campus, although later, NSIT was shifted to Dwarka as a follow-up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. Delhi College of Engineering is thus the mother institution of a number of national institutes including Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, College of Art, Delhi and Faculty of Management Studies. =DCE-DTU Reconstitution and related protests in 2009-10= In July 2009, Delhi College of Engineering was downgraded to a state university from being a college under a central university and renamed Delhi Technological University (DTU), through the Delhi Technological University Bill, 2009. P. B. Sharma was nominated as the university's first Vice-Chancellor. The move was met with student protests over the erosion of the DCE brand (due to being downgraded from being part of a central university to a state university) and the reduction in the supposed value of their degree. which culminated to a face-off in March 2010, with the students boycotting the mid-semester exams, and demanding reconsideration of the change and replacement of the VC. However, the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit informed the students that the change will not be reconsidered, and by the end of March the protest dwindled down, with the students taking their exams. In April 2010 Times City reported that the government will be willing to change the name to \\"DCE Technological University\\" (DCE TU),, quoted at however, the university name remains unchanged till date. Campuses right Delhi Technological University (Delhi College of Engineering) operated from the Kashmiri Gate campus in the heart of Old Delhi until 1989, when construction began at the New Campus at Bawana Road in May.

The protests saw #cancelDTUexams trend on Twitter for over 2 weeks with articles in media outlets Education Times(TOI),Navbharat Times,Hindustan,India TV,Careers 360. https://twitter.com/hashtag/cancelDTUexams?src=hash Students also came out with online petitions to voice their concerns. Students have sighted that conducting exams of intermediate semesters is a clear violation of UGC guidelines. Other reasons sighted by students are lack of resources(laptop, internet connection), incomplete syllabus after lock down, internships & skill development courses, mental stress (many haven't even stepped out of their house for months now due to COVID-19), online exams not being conducted by top engineering institutes like IITs, for cancellation of exams. Students also claim that when the university already has the result of past semesters, internal assessment, mid term examination then why can't a provisional result be declared on that basis and those who aren't satisfied can appear later. The credibility of online examinations is debatable, students claimed. As per an article in Navbharat Times, The Vice Chancellor of DTU Prof Yogesh Singh claimed that if students make up their mind for the exam they will provide them with all resources.This claim was further disputed by the students who said that the university wasn't actually providing them with any resources upon being approached & was rather asking them to come to the Campus and appear for the exams which isn't at all feasible seeing the rising no. of COVID-19 cases in the capital. The Controller of Examination has claimed to the Education Times that Majority of Students want to appear in the online examination, a claim which further fueled the protests as students claimed that it was completely baseless.https://www.educationtimes.com/article/campus- beat-student-speak/76835525/dtu-undeterred-to-change-plans-to-hold-exams-even- as-students-protest.html#gsc.tab=0 The protests finally ended on 11 July 2020 with the press release of the Deputy CM cancelling all exams in State Universities of Delhi. On 14 July 2020,more than 3 days after the press release of the Govt of NCT of Delhi, the DTU administration finally released the official notification confirming the cancellation. Even this delay in the official notice lead to student outrage on social media for the mentioned time period.http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/notice/2020/july/file0712.pdf 2020 Annual Fee Protests The DTU administration released a notice dated 24 July 2020 via the official site on 30 July 2020 demanding a hefty annual fees of INR 1,90,000 to be paid just within 5 days. The notice has a punitive clause that after 5 August students will have to bear hefty fines and after 27 August their names may be struck off from the university records. http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/notice/2020/july/file0734.pdf The move has seen massive student protests with widespread national media coverage. Students sighted that for the last 4 months they haven’t utilized any of the college infrastructure like Library, Computer Center, Lab Infrastructure and other campus amenities and the next session being online will not utilize the same due to the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19. DTU being primarily an undergraduate institute with more than 80% students pursuing UG courses like B.Tech and majority of students coming from humble backgrounds, it is almost impossible for them to pay such a hefty fees right now within 5 day of which three are bank holidays, especially due to the adverse effects the pandemic has had on their economic condition. The Fee Structure of INR 1,90,000 of B.Tech course has more than 40% charges on Miscellaneous Heads in the name of facilities and services which the students aren’t utilizing. Hence, the students are being asked to pay for something they haven’t availed. The Govt of NCT of Delhi passed an order on 15 April 2020 asking schools be it govt or private in the capital to only charge tuition fees. Then why is the same not applicable on higher education govt institutes like DTU. The protests saw #dtufeesrelaxation trend on Twitter for a week. https://twitter.com/nidhiindiatv/status/1289003052314189824 Anoop Lather, Public Relations Officer of DTU in a statement to The Indian Express on 1 August said that the expenses of the university remain the same as they were prior to the pandemic and students who have problems in paying can submit an application which shall be considered on the case-to-case basis. The statement further received backlash from the students who said that the university administration wasn't responding to any of their emails and letters for concession and payment in installments and further it would be insane to suggest that the expenses of the university functioning via free online platforms like Google Meet could remain the same as before. Students also claimed that many other government institutes like IIT Kharagpur and NIT Patna had already given concession to students on miscellaneous heads and moreover, none were demanding a one time annual fee payment. http://www.nitp.ac.in/uploads/Notification%20No.%20487-31.07.2020.pdf After getting no positive response from the Govt of NCT of Delhi and the university administration by the fee payment deadline of 5 August, the students wrote an open letter to LG of Delhi Anil Baijal who is also the Chancellor of the university on 6 August 2020 asking him to take action against the Vice Chancellor of DTU Prof Yogesh Singh for displaying yet again an absolutely apathetic attitude towards the concerns of students and their families who are already under severe economic and mental stress amid the pandemic. They also alleged that the university administration intimidated some Class Representatives via the Office of the Vice Chancellor to either pay the fee or face disciplinary action. NSUI also wrote to the LG asking him to take back the annual fee notice. https://twitter.com/VaibhavConnects/status/1290540624450424833 On 7 August, some students organized a protest march in the DTU campus. Protesters claimed that no one from DTU administration met them on the given day. TOI claimed that the university didn't respond to any of its calls on the same day. Students also claimed that the university was using Training and Placement Dept to intimidate them by asking to pay their fees immediately, or else they won’t be allowed to sit for placements for the year 2020-2021 On 8 August, some students met BJP Delhi president Adesh Kumar Gupta who then wrote to the CM Arvind Kejriwal asking him to intervene in the matter on the request of the students. https://twitter.com/BJP4Delhi/status/1292318073047805953?s=19 As of 8 August more than 50% students have still not paid the annual fee as per the PRO of DTU. Until 9 August, DTU admin has refused to budge any concessions and relaxations to the students . As of now, the office of LG has forwarded the matter to Directorate of Training and Technical Education for further action as per the complaint filed by DTU students.https://twitter.com/VaibhavConnects/status/1290970453574471680?s=19 Notable alumni  References  External links * Category:Universities and colleges in Delhi Category:Engineering colleges in Delhi Category:Education in Delhi Category:Educational institutions established in 1941 Category:All India Council for Technical Education ","title":"Delhi Technological University"},{"id":"3893899","text":"Donji Lug is a geographic area in Bosnia and Herzegovina situated in the northern Bosnia in the lower basin of the river Liješnica, left tributary of the river Bosna.

In a long career spanning 40 years, Abu Abraham worked for various national and international newspapers including The Bombay Chronicle, Shankar's Weekly, Blitz, Tribune, The Observer (1956–66), The Guardian (1966–69), and The Indian Express (1969–81). He was a lifelong atheist and rationalist.\\"His strongest theme, as India sank faster into factional and religious politics, had remained adherence to the original vision of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru for a wholly secular state: Abu was a rationalist and atheist.\\" Michael McNay, 'Obituary: Abu Abraham', The Guardian, 7 December 2002, Pg. 26. Early years Born in Mavelikara, KeralaMark Bryant, Fleet Street's Star of India, History Today, 57(6) pp. 58–59 (June 2007) as the son of A.M. Mathew and Kantamma, Abu started drawing cartoons at the age of 3. After studying French, Mathematics, and English at University College, Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) and being the tennis champion, he graduated in 1945. He moved to Bombay where he became a journalist in The Bombay Chronicle and its sister paper, The Bombay Sentinel while contributing cartoons to Blitz and Bharat. In 1951, he was invited by K. Shankar Pillai to move to New Delhi to work in Shankar's Weekly. Work in London In 1953, he met Fred Joss of the London Star, who encouraged him to move to London.Mark Bryant, Fleet Street's Star of India, History Today, 57(6) pp. 58–59 (June 2007) At 32, Abu arrived in London in the summer of 1953 and immediately sold cartoons to Punch magazine and the Daily Sketch and started to contribute material to Everybodys' London Opinion and Eastern World using the pen name 'Abraham'. In 1956, after two cartoons were published in Tribune, he was sent a personal letter by David Astor, the editor of The Observer, the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, offering him a permanent job as its first ever political cartoonist. Astor asked Abu to change his pen name as 'Abraham' would imply a false slant on his cartoons, and so he settled on 'Abu', a schoolboy nickname of his. Abu immersed himself in British culture and produced incisive political cartoons. He was described in The Guardian as \\"the conscience of the Left and the pea under the princess's mattress\\". He also produced reportage drawings from around the world. In 1962 in Cuba he drew Che Guevara and spent three hours in a nightclub with Fidel Castro. In September 1966, Abu moved to The Guardian and started to contribute a weekly cartoon to the Tribune. During 1968 he edited Verdicts on Vietnam, a collection of cartoons about the Vietnam war. Return to India He returned to India with his first wife (Sarojini, from Tamil Nadu, who he later divorced) and two daughters, Aysha and Janaki, in 1969 to work as the political cartoonist on the Indian Express until 1981. In 1970 he was given a special award by the British Film Institute for a short film based on Noah's Ark called No Arks. From 1972 until 1978, he was nominated a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. In 1975 Indian Emergency was declared and the freedom of the press was suspended, and Abu fell out of favour with Indira Gandhi. The direct result of this was the publication of the book Games of the Emergency in 1977, which contained the political articles and cartoons that he could not print during the Emergency. As well as illustrating other books, other collections of his cartoons were Abu on Bangladesh (1972), Private View (1974), and Arrivals and Departures (1983). He also edited the Penguin Book of Indian Cartoons (1988). The hallmark of Abu Abraham's cartoons was their merciless attack upon the corruption in politics. As a mark of the man, his cartoons were an assortment of simple lines that stood out for their directness of expression augmented by arresting punch lines that never missed the mark. From 1981, Abu worked as a freelancer, syndicating his work to several newspapers and commencing a new strip cartoon, Salt and Pepper. The crow and the elephant in this philosophical strip begin to take over from the political cartoons, according to his daughter Ayisha Abraham. In 1988 Abu moved back to Kerala. He died on 1 December 2002 and was survived by his British-born wife Psyche. His death was marked by a two-minute silence in the Rajya Sabha and he was cremated with full state honours.

The club played in the Western League Premier Division and in March 2008 the club entered into a partnership with Newton Abbot to share administrative resources, although the playing staff remained separate. In October 2003 Chris Myers took over as manager. After relegation at the end of that season, Dawlish Town rebuilt. A 4th-place finish the next season was again something to build on and in the season 05/06, they came back up as First Division Champions. The 06/07 season saw Dawlish Town consolidate in the Premier League of the Toolstation Western League with a 10th-place finish. Season 07/08 was a season to remember for Dawlish Town and their supporters. A runners-up spot behind League Winners Truro City and two major cup wins in the Les Phillips Cup and the Devon St Lukes Cup finished off a great season for the club. On 8 June, manager Chris Myers resigned to move to the North west of England. Club history Dawlish Town Association Football Club was formed in 1889. The original name was Dawlish Argyle but the Argyle was dropped many years ago. The name ‘Town’ was added in recent years in order to distinguish the club from other local teams. In the early years the club played at two different locations before moving to its present-day site, now known as Sandy Lane, midway through the 20th century. Originally, there was only one team, but the club added another side around the same time as they moved to Sandy Lane. By 1950, Dawlish introduced a third team into Junior Football. The success of the junior side was not far away, with the team winning their Junior 3B League in season 1953–54 with a 100% record and the League Cup as well. One of the earliest recorded honours occurred in season 1931–32 when the club lifted the East Devon Senior Cup. In 1960, Dawlish played a Torquay based side for what transpired to be for the title of \\"East Devon Champions\\". Dawlish won the game 3 – 0 and were duly recognised as East Devon Champions. Dawlish Town’s best ever season was in 1972–73. There were only two sides at this time but both sides won every competition they entered – a total of seven trophies in all! The first team won the following: Exeter & District Premier League; Devon Premier Cup; East Devon Senior Cup; Sellick Memorial Cup; Rothmans Invitation Trophy. The second team won the following: Exeter & District Senior League; Geary Cup. After such success, the club decided that the first team should join the Western League in season 1973–74 with the second team moving up to the Devon & Exeter Premier Division. At this time, the town of Dawlish had two other senior Saturday sides playing under the banner of AL Dawlish. An agreement was made that AL Dawlish would join Dawlish Town and with two Sunday senior teams running from 1983 to 1990, the senior playing strength of the club was considerable. In the 1970s Dawlish ran a Youth team with their first honours being the Bevin Trophy at Under 15 level in season 1973–74 and the Devon Youth Cup at Under 18 level in season 1975–76. A full Youth Section was formed in 1983 and under its separate committee, five teams represented the club in various age groups. 1989 was one of their best years with the Under 14s not only winning their league, but also their League Cup final at Torquay United's Plainmoor ground. Youth football continues to flourish within the town and is under the banner of Dawlish United Youth & Mini Soccer. In season 1988–89, Dawlish third team won the Devon & Exeter League Senior Division 3 remaining unbeaten for the entire season and only dropping 3 points. As a requirement of Western League football, Dawlish Town installed floodlights on their ground in 1987, and the official opening was the 9 February 1987, celebrated when Queens Park Rangers brought their full squad to play the 1st team. At the beginning of the 1987–88 season, Dawlish played host to Aberdeen and in season 1988–89 both Chelsea and Watford visited Dawlish. Chelsea in fact played twice at Dawlish, playing Torquay United in a pre-season friendly as Torquay United’s ground was not ready to host pre- season friendlies. Dawlish have also played Crewe Alexandra on several occasions having established a close relationship with their manager Dario Gradi. It was Dario Gradi who spotted the talents of a Dawlish Youth player Seth Johnson, and for those who do not know – Seth Johnson not only played for Crewe Alexandra, but went on to play for Derby County and Leeds United as well as becoming a full England international. As part of the Western League development standards, Dawlish built new changing rooms in readiness for the 1989–90 season. Since this time, Dawlish have hosted many football league teams including Burnley, Lincoln, Leyton Orient, Bury, Bristol City, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Wimbledon as well as our local senior teams Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United and Exeter City. Not every club in the country can say that one of their teams have played at Wembley Stadium even once let alone twice! But in May 1996 Dawlish Town won the inaugural Carlsberg Pub Cup Final with Wembley Stadium hosting the final. Dawlish Town won the cup 4 – 2 on penalties with the undoubted hero being Dawlish Town’s goalkeeper Jamie Day who saved two penalties. Dawlish had also won their semi- final at Anfield by two goals to nil. The second visit to Wembley was on the 22 September 1996 when Dawlish played the Dutch Carlsberg Champions Brigade Bodega in a first ever Carlsberg European Pub Cup Championship. On this occasion Dawlish lost 1 – 0 after conceding a late goal. In season 1999-00, Dawlish regained their Western League Premier Division place after finishing as runners-up in Division One. Due to some fantastic support from second team players under the guidance of Dave Cleave and Ray Green, and wonderful support from Dawlish United Under 16s, Dawlish were able to endure a difficult period in its history at this time. Season 2002–03 also saw the introduction of a Ladies team who in their first season secured third position in the Devon League First Division. Season 2003–04 saw the club re-enter a third team in the Devon & Exeter League Intermediate Division Three and they immediately gained promotion to Intermediate III which sadly saw the first team relegated back to the Western League Division One and the second team to Devon & Exeter Senior Division Two. At around 04:00 hrs on the 5 August 2004, the club was hit by another devastating blow when their wooden stand (built in 1942), and which had witnessed so much of the history of the club was completely destroyed by fire. Season 2004–05 saw the first and second teams establish their league positions. The third team however continued to flourish under manager Tim Bradshaw and secured promotion to Devon & Exeter League Intermediate Division Two. Season 2005–06 was a resounding success for the 1st team. Promotion to the Western League Premier Division was secured as champions, with Carl Cliff-Brown being the top goalscorer for the entire League. The 2nd team were placed in Devon & Exeter League Division Senior 3 after a league re-organisation and they just missed out on promotion. Yet again the third team enjoyed another promotion year, this time finishing as runners-up to secure their position in Intermediate I for 2006–07. At the beginning of season 2006–07 Dawlish Town played a pre-season friendly with Torquay United and marked the occasion by having their new grandstand officially opened jointly by Torquay United Chairman Mike Bateson, Dawlish Town’s Managing Director Terence Stone and Chairman and Director Dave Fenner. In recognition of outstanding support given to the club by Terence Stone, the grandstand was duly named the \\"Terence Stone Stand\\". Season 2006–07 saw the first team consolidate themselves in the Premier Division of the Western League and the Reserves finishing runners up in the Devon and Exeter Football League Senior Division Three. Season 2007–08 was outstanding with the First Team winning two cups – the Les Phillips Cup and the Devon St. Luke's Bowl – and finishing in their highest ever league position – Western League Premier Division runner-up. Season 2008–09 was the end of an era for manager Chris Myers but saw the first team have an unbeaten start to the season under new manager Adam Kerswell until eventually losing his job to see Adam Shearer return to the club where they finished third in the league. Striker Joe Bushin hit 39 goals to be league top scorer. Season 2009–10 saw Ex. Barnstaple Manager Jeff Evans take over the managerial role of the club with Chris Porter his assistant. Chris is known for taking the Torquay Boys Grammar School to the national cup final held at Manchester City's City of Manchester ground and won the cup. Season 09/10 saw the goodbye of striker Joe Bushin, who joined Tiverton Town. Since then, the two have worked to bring in many new faces at the club. The club reached the FA Vase 5th, being defeated by Gresley Town in a replay at the Moat Ground after two battling legs of football. In the 2010/11 Season saw Adam Kerswell take over again but lasted no longer than a month in charge before Captain Gary Fisher was given the role of player/manager. March 2011 saw Dave Fenner step down as chairman to concentrate more on his work commitments. Fishers managerial campaign proved to be a high success bringing in the results that have seen Dawlish rise from a low 15th up to 6th in the table. With Jules Ematti-Ematti and Joe Bushin leaving the club to pursue careers at a higher level, a new look Dawlish team including the likes of Karl Baker, Liam McAuley, Clay Bond, Alex Narramore and even the manager himself battled hard in what proved to be a memorable final season for the club. Dawlish Town quit the Western League on 23 July 2011.

The peak is bounded by Catalunyan Saddle on the west and Shipka Saddle on the east, and is heavily glaciated and crevassed, with precipitous western, southern and eastern slopes. It surmounts Huron Glacier to the northwest and northeast, and Macy Glacier and Brunow Bay area to the south. Its northern offshoot forms Zograf Peak, and is linked to Lozen Nunatak, Erma Knoll and Aheloy Nunatak in Huron Glacier. The peak is named after Lyaskovets, a town in central northern Bulgaria. Location Lyaskovets Peak is located at , which is 2.3 km east-northeast of Mount Friesland (the summit of Friesland Ridge and Livingston Island, 1,700 m), 3.2 km south-southeast of Kuzman Knoll, 1.33 km south by east of Zograf Peak, 1.3 km west of Levski Peak, and 4.6 km west by north of Great Needle Peak (the summit of Levski Ridge, approx. 1,690 m). The feature was mapped by the UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys in 1968, and by Bulgaria in 2005 and 2009. History The first ascent of Lyaskovets Peak was made on 14 December 2004 by Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev from Camp Academia (541 m) during the Tangra 2004/05 Survey. Their route (UIAA grade III) started with 4 km of solid but crevassed firn surface ascent up to Catalunyan Saddle (1,260 m) on the main crest of Tangra Mountains, from where they traversed the precipitous west slope of the peak until the north slope was reached, from where the summit – itself split by a crevasse – was easily reached.L.L.

George Augustus Selwyn (11 August 1719 – 25 January 1791, age 71) was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Parliament of Great Britain. Life He was the eldest surviving son of John Selwyn MP of Matson House and his wife Mary, the daughter of General Thomas Farrington. He was educated at Eton College and Hart Hall, Oxford (1739) and studied law at the Inner Temple (1737). He succeeded his father in 1751, including the inheritance of Matson House in Gloucester. Selwyn spent 44 years in the House of Commons without being recorded as making a speech. He put his electoral interest, as the person who controlled both seats in Ludgershall and one in Gloucester, at the disposal of the King's ministers (whoever they might be), because he was financially dependent on obtaining (a total of three) sinecure offices and a pension, which offset his expenses of bribing the electorate, and his gambling debts. He was MP for Ludgershall in 1747–1754 and for the constituency of Gloucester 1754–1780. After he lost his interest in Gloucester, Selwyn was again member for Ludgershall from 1780 until his death in 1791. He was Mayor of Gloucester for 1758 and 1765. He was also elected for the Scottish constituency of Wigtown Burghs in 1768, when he thought he might be defeated at Gloucester. He was the first Englishman to be elected to Parliament by a constituency in Scotland. He chose to retain the English seat. Selwyn was a friend of Horace Walpole, and a member of the Hellfire Club. He was known for his fascination with the macabre and other forms of sexual eccentricity.BBC History Magazine. February 2011 vol 12 no 2 pp 53–54. \\"George Selwyn, a necrophiliac, gay transvestite, sat mute, loved, and undisturbed in the House of Commons for 44 years.\\" He was also a keen observer of public executions. When Selwyn visited a dying Henry Fox, he was refused admission. When Fox learned of this he quipped, \\"If Mr. Selwyn calls again, show him up. If I am alive, I shall be glad to see him, and if I am dead, I am sure he will be delighted to see me!\\" He died unmarried in 1791 and was buried in the Selwyn vault at St. Katherine's church, Matson, Gloucester on 6 February 1791. However, the vault has since been filled in and the brass plate from his coffin is now to be found on a wall inside the church. He left his estate to his adopted daughter, Maria Emilia Fagnani, who married Francis Seymour- Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Friz Freleng, and starring Bugs Bunny. It is a sendup of the Little Red Riding Hood story, and is the first time in which Mel Blanc receives a voice credit. In 1994, Little Red Riding Rabbit was voted #39 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. Plot Red, about to get even \\"redder\\". Animation by Virgil Ross. Little Red Riding Hood is depicted as a typical 1940s teen-aged girl, a \\"bobby soxer\\" with an extremely loud and grating voice (inspired by screen and radio comedian Cass Daley, provided by Bea Benaderet). After she sings the first verse of \\"Five O'Clock Whistle\\" in the opening to establish this fact, Bugs pops out of her basket to ask where she's going. She replies that she's going to \\"bring a little bunny rabbit to [her] grandma ta HAVE.\\" With this part of the story set up, the wolf is now introduced. The wolf switches a \\"Shortcut to Grandma's\\" sign, so that Red has to take an unnecessarily long mountain path, while the wolf uses the genuine shortcut – literally a few short steps to the house. Seeing a note pinned on the door that Grandma isn't home (apparently, Grandma is a \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" type who's working the \\"swing shift\\" at Lockheed), the wolf sneaks inside and dresses like Grandma, only to find that three other wolves are similarly dressed and all waiting in the bed for Red! The wolf (voiced by Billy Bletcher) growls for the others to \\"COME ON! COME ON! Take a powder – this is MY racket!\\" The other wolves leave, grumbling to themselves, and a small wolf who was hiding under the pillow, sheepishly follows suit, too. Once in bed, the wolf waits for Red to arrive. But in a twist, the wolf isn't interested in eating Red, but rather the rabbit she is bringing to Grandma. Red arrives and begins her \\"Grandma, what big eyes you have\\" spiel, but is impatiently interrupted by the wolf who quickly shuffles her out the door and tries looking for Bugs in the basket. Bugs, of course, quickly gets the better of the wolf and runs around the house, with the wolf in hot pursuit. Along the way, Bugs subjects the wolf to the famous lots-of- doors in-and-out routine (which will be repeated in Buccaneer Bunny). The wolf, however, is constantly interrupted by Red, who continues her lines from the actual story. The wolf begins to flirt with her in a faux French accent, then suddenly yells at her to get out. When cornered by the wolf, Bugs mimics the wolf's speech and gestures, irritating him and eventually distracting the wolf into singing Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet. Bugs manages to get a glowing coal from the fireplace and sends the wolf screaming in pain to the ceiling by scorching his backside. When the wolf comes down, Bugs has a large shovelful of hot coals waiting for him. However, the wolf manages to catch his feet on the ends of two benches just in time, doing the \\"splits\\". Instead of simply kicking one of the benches away, Bugs proceeds to dump heavy weights into the wolf's arms. After clearing out just about everything in the house (except the kitchen sink), Bugs is about to apply the coup de grace on the wolf – by placing the last straw on top of the mass of junk and furniture the wolf is holding – when Red reappears, bellowing \\"Hey, GRANDMA!\\" (By now, Red has managed to comment on the wolf's big eyes, big nose, big ears and sharp teeth, and one wonders what she was planning to say next.) By this time, even Bugs has had enough of Red's interruptions, prompting him to say, \\"I'll do it, but I'll probably hate myself in the morning.\\" He descends the ladder, and out of frame, there's a shuffling noise... and now RED is the one trying to avoid getting her bottom scorched, holding the weights and assorted junk, while Bugs and the wolf, arms around each other's shoulders, share a carrot and self- satisfied looks, and await the inevitable.

He is the chairman of Sunshine Uzbekistan, the main party in opposition to president Islam Karimov's authoritarian rule. He was arrested in October 2005 for embezzlement--charges his supporters say are politically motivated--and was imprisoned until November 2009, when he was freed and allowed to move to the United States. Biography Umarov was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, as the middle child of five in a large family of intellectuals. His father, Guiess Ekub Umarov, was a physicist; his mother, Nabira Shamsieva, was a university English instructor. Umarov attended the Tashkent University of Irrigation and Mechanization of Agriculture, earning a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Following this, he served as an intercontinental ballistic missile technician at Bauman's Technical University in Moscow. He went on to the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute for a PhD; his dissertation, defended in 1982, was on applications of solar energy. Upon earning his degree, Umarov gained a position at Algeria University in Biskra, Algeria, teaching physics and engineering. He returned to Uzbekistan in 1988, where he participated in the establishment of Uzbekistan's first business school in 1989. Following his return, he became interested in the possibilities of mobile phones in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, and founded telecommunications company Uzdunrobita in February 1991, with the backing of investors from the United States. Following Uzdunrobita's success, Umarov went on to found a number of other businesses in Uzbekistan; in addition to telecommunications, he concentrated on companies related to agriculture, petroleum, and natural gas. He became particularly known for his close ties with western investors, and worked largely to facilitate foreign investment. In 2005, he founded Sunshine Uzbekistan Coalition, an association of civil groups and intellectuals, which sought to open a dialogue with the Government of Uzbekistan concerning economic reforms that could dramatically improve the quality of life of Uzbek citizens. Advocating free trade and private ownership of the agricultural industry, Sunshine Uzbekistan Coalition emerged in March 2005 as a pro-democracy organization advocating economic reforms. In October 2005, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement and money laundering. His supporters allege that these charges are politically motivated, pointing to the fact that his arrest came shortly after he sent a letter to Parliament advocating reforms. Umarov's lawyer further claims to have found him naked and incoherent during a visit to his jail cell, and supporters allege that he was drugged. Human rights groups accuse Uzbekistan's government of regularly drugging prisoners to extract confessions, an allegation the government denies. Umarov's trial began in January 2006, and he was convicted in March 2006 of heading a criminal group laundering money through offshore companies, tax avoidance, and hiding foreign currency. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison (reduced to 10 years under an amnesty agreement) and over US$8 million in fines. Umarov was held in Prison Camp Kizil-Tepa, Uzbekistan for four years. As a result of diplomatic pressure, Umarov was released on November 7, 2009 and returned home to his family in Germantown, Tennessee two weeks later, on Saturday, November 21. Umarov has since been living in United States and has continued to work with Sunshine Uzbekistan to promote human rights in Uzbekistan. References * BBC News. Uzbek opposition leader on trial.

He was prominent in developing coalmines in the Swansea area of Wales and in supplying settler needs in Nova Scotia. Career The son of Jonathan Townsend, he started his business career as a London linen draper, before becoming a merchant in about 1740. He developed extensive interests in coal mines in the Swansea area, along with mining, smelting, and refining copper and lead. From 1744, he was as a government contractor supplying military and settler needs in Nova Scotia. By the time of his death, most of Townsend's money had been consumed by the mining business. Parliament Townsend was a regular supporter, in the House of Commons, of whatever government the King appointed. He represented Westbury between 1748 and 1768. He was elected for Wigtown Burghs in 1768 and sat for them until his death in 1770. He was the second Englishman to be elected and the first to actually sit in Parliament, for any Scottish constituency. Despite being a Member of Parliament for 22 years, he is not recorded as ever having spoken in the House.

Philippe Cousteau was proficient filming from the air, on land and underwater. He was the lead cinematographer for most of the Cousteau films during his lifetime; he was nominated for and won several awards. Early life and education Born in Toulon, Philippe Cousteau first dived with an aqua-lung in 1945 when he was 4 years old. His father brought home a miniature version of the aqua-lung he had co-invented a few years before. Though Philippe had not yet learned to swim, he followed his father into the water. Growing up, he spent each school vacation aboard his father’s ship, RV Calypso. As a teenager, he began to feel the drive to explore. While his father had pursued the horizon on the sea, Philippe Cousteau dreamed of pursuing horizons in the sky and began to study aerodynamics at the age of 16, flying first as a glider pilot, and then earning his airplane pilot license at a young age. Cousteau spent two years in the French Navy during the Algerian war as a sonar operator and member of the landing party of the Le Normand ship, later earning his degree in science, spent another year at MIT, and then went to Paris to train in cinematography, graduating from I'École technique de photographie et de cinéma (now called École nationale supérieure Louis-Lumière) in Paris. Biography Philippe Cousteau filming during an expedition In 1965, Cousteau was an Oceanaut on the Conshelf III, an undersea habitat for saturated diving down to 325 feet near Ile Levant in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to his duties as Oceanaut, Cousteau was an underwater photographer and did all of the underwater filming, which became a National Geographic documentary film that aired in 1966. Cousteau appeared as himself on the March 28, 1966 episode of the CBS game show To Tell the Truth. He received three of the four possible votes from the panel. In February 1967, Cousteau accompanied his father on the RV Calypso for an expedition to film the sharks of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. As well as being the lead photographer for the expedition, Cousteau also chronicled his experiences in the 1970 publication The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea. In 1969, Cousteau lent his technical expertise to the U.S. Navy's SEALAB program. In the aftermath of aquanaut Berry L. Cannon's death while attempting to repair a leak in SEALAB III, Cousteau volunteered to dive down to SEALAB and help return it to the surface, although SEALAB was ultimately salvaged in a less hazardous way.Craven, John Piña (2001). The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea, New York: Simon & Schuster. . Until his death in 1979, he co-produced numerous documentaries with his father, including Voyage to the Edge of the World (1976, for the cinema theatres) and his own PBS series, Oasis in Space (1977, for the television), concerning environmental issues. Piloting Philippe Cousteau piloting PBY, Lake Victoria, Uganda, July 1978Philippe Cousteau was a highly experienced pilot. He earned his glider pilot license at the age of 16 and went on to obtain pilot credentials to fly balloons, hang gliders, single- and multi-engine airplanes and seaplanes, gyrocopters and helicopters. He acquired a PBY Catalina seaplane in 1974. The amphibious aircraft was a converted U.S. Navy Catalina flying boat. Christened the Flying Calypso, the aircraft was in many of the Cousteau films and the home base for Cousteau's team. Personal life Cousteau met Janice Sullivan in the crowded ballroom of St. Regis Hotel in New York City, USA, in February 1966. She was a fashion model originally from Los Angeles and more recently from New York. On 10 February 1967, they were married in Paris, France. Sullivan joined Cousteau on most of his father's expeditions (20 of 26 filming expeditions that spanned 13 years). They had two children, Alexandra Cousteau and Philippe Cousteau Jr. Death Cousteau died in 1979, aged 38, when his PBY Catalina flying boat crashed in the Tagus river near Lisbon. The aircraft nosed over during a high-speed taxi run undertaken to check the hull for leakage. The propeller detached from the engine and killed Cousteau instantly. All others on board survived. His son Philippe Cousteau Jr. was born six months later. Awards Philippe Cousteau received many awards and honors for his contribution to diving and underwater photography: He was nominated for four Emmy's, NOGI Award for Arts from the Underwater Society of America (now presented by The Academy of Underwater Arts and Sciences) (1977), World Wildlife Award and many others.

The first son of ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, he is the father of Fabien Cousteau and Céline Cousteau. Life and career Cousteau is the son of Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Simone Melchior. Cousteau first dived with an aqua-lung in 1945 when he was 7 years old. Although he went to school to study architecture, he joined his father's Cousteau Society, serving for twenty years as executive vice president before striking out on his own in 1993 to produce environmental films. Cousteau and his father disagreed on the management and policies of the Society. After Cousteau opened a resort on a Fiji island utilizing the family name, Jacques- Yves Cousteau filed a lawsuit against him in 1996. In June 1996, a court signed an injunction requiring him to add, with equal prominence in placement, his first name to the hotel. Jean-Michel then founded the Ocean Futures Society in 1999, a marine conservation and education organization. In 2003, Francesca Sorrenti and Marisha Shibuya of the SKe GROUP project, in partnership with Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, collaborated to produce Water Culture, a Trolley Books publication featuring a wide variety of photographer's water-related imagery and interviews with prominent world personalities on the problems facing our water supply. Cousteau is also Chairman of Green Cross France. Cousteau advocates for a world free of nuclear weapons, and is a member of the Advisory Council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. Cousteau is working on a documentary highlighting the epic and disastrous 2010 Gulf Oil Spill in which 11 workers were killed during an explosion of deepwater rig off the coast of Louisiana, United States. In 2012, he published the book My Father, The Captain: My Life with Jacques Cousteau. Jean-Michel Cousteau is the President of Green Cross France & Territoires, a NGO proposing keys for actions towards a better environment for an unburdened future. =Film production and appearances= He has produced over 70 films. He appears in the 2003 IMAX documentary film Coral Reef Adventure. He appeared on a documentary-type special feature, Case of the Sponge \\"Bob\\", on the DVD version of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004) in which he and Stephen Hillenburg talk about all of the real-life counterparts to the sea creatures seen in the cartoon series and movie. He did a similar feature for the DVD of the Disney/Pixar movie Finding Nemo: Exploring the Reef with Jean-Michel Cousteau. In Disney's DVD release of Finding Nemo, Cousteau makes an appearance interacting with the characters from the film, Marlin, Nemo and Dory, and touting the need for better pollution control, showing videos of polluted coral reefs. Jean-Michel Cousteau made a new documentary series Ocean Adventures released in 2006. Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, KQED and PBS are continuing production on the Ocean Adventures series for 2007 and 2008. In October 2006, Jean-Michel Cousteau, and an expedition team that includes his son Fabien and daughter Céline, began filming along the Amazon River. Twenty years ago scientists predicted devastation and irreversible environmental damage here, and 25 years ago Jean-Michel Cousteau and his legendary father traveled with their teams the entire length of the Amazon to document, learn, and see for themselves.

For the rest the characters of the genus. =Queen= Resembles the worker in colour; the mandibles are more coarsely striate, the clypeus is smooth, the front between the antennae and the cheeks longitudinally striate, the head posteriorly on the vertex and lateral angles coarsely reticulate. Thorax: the pronotum somewhat vaguely and transversely and the mesonotum posteriorly longitudinally striate; anteriorly the latter is smooth and polished, the scutellum rugose, the metanotum irregularly striate rugose, including the basal portion of the metanotal spines. Pedicel :the nodes rugulose, opaque; abdomen smooth, polished and shining. Wings hyaline; nervures brownish. =Male= Light chestnut-yellow, the apical margins of the abdominal segments more or less broadly brownish black; head and thorax somewhat densely pubescent, in places rugulose, giving them a dull subopaque look; head on each side of the ocelli longitudinally striate. Some few striae on the mesonotum posteriorly and on the basal portion of the metanotum, traces of the same on the apical face of the latter. Pedicel obscurely rugulose, subopaque; abdomen smooth, shining, but not highly polished. Wings flavo-hyaline; nervures yellowish. =Variation= Var. subcarinata, Smith, is slighter, more slender and lighter in colour, often nearly smooth; it occurs in Bengal, Burma, and Tenasserim, and extends down to Borneo. The colour and the rugosity, as well as the pilosity, vary very much; but, so far as a very long series has enabled me to judge, the one species with many slightly differing local races extends through India, Ceylon, and Burma.

The club are currently members of the and play at the Recreation Ground. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. History The club was established in 1889, and initially played in local leagues until joining the Western League in 1923. After finishing in tenth place in 1924–25, they were relegated to the newly established Division Two. However, after finishing bottom in 1926–27 and 1927–28, the club withdrew from the league. Minehead returned to the Western League in 1949, joining Division Three. After finishing third in their first season back, they were promoted to Division Two. A fourth-place finish in 1957–58 saw the club promoted to Division One. In 1970–71 they reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 2–1 at home to Shrewsbury Town. After finishing as runners-up in 1971–72, the club were elected to Division One South of the Southern League. A fifth-place finish in 1972–73 was followed by finishing fourth in 1973–74 and third in 1974–75, before the club won the division in 1975–76, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The 1976–77 season proved to be the club's greatest; they finished as runners-up in the Premier Division (at the time, the top level below the Football League), and also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, where they beat Swansea City 1–0 at the Vetch Field, before losing 2–1 at Portsmouth. Despite reaching the second round of the FA Cup the following season, the club were relegated after finishing second bottom of the Premier Division. In 1982–83 they finished second bottom in the Midland Division, and dropped back into the Premier Division of the Western League. In 1988–89 they were relegated to Division One after finishing bottom of the league, and finished bottom of Division One the following season. However, the club recovered to win Division One the next season, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In 1993–94 the club finished bottom of the Premier Division again, and returned to Division One, where they again finished bottom the following season. In 1998 the club changed its name to Minehead Town, and won Division One in the season that followed, losing only one match all season. However, the club finished bottom of the Premier Division for two consecutive seasons, before returning to Division One. In 2009–10 they finished bottom of Division One and were relegated to the Somerset County League. Ground Minehead play their home games at Irnham Road, Minehead, Somerset, TA24 5DP.

Located southwest of Cairo, in the Faiyum Oasis, it is the capital of the modern Faiyum Governorate. Originally called Shedet in Egyptian, the Greeks called it , and later . It is one of Egypt's oldest cities due to its strategic location.  Name and etymology  Its name in English is also spelled as Fayum, Faiyum or Al Faiyūm. Faiyum was previously officially named Madīnet Al Faiyūm (Arabic for The City of Faiyum). The name Faiyum (and its spelling variations) may also refer to the Faiyum Oasis, although it is commonly used by Egyptians today to refer to the city. The modern name of the city comes from Coptic / ' (whence the proper name '), meaning the Sea or the Lake, which in turn comes from late Egyptian pꜣ-ym of the same meaning, a reference to the nearby Lake Moeris; the extinct elephant ancestor Phiomia was named after it.  Ancient history  Archaeological evidence has found occupations around the Fayum dating back to at least the Epipalaeolithic. Middle Holocene occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of Lake Moeris, where Gertrude Caton Thompson and Elinor Wight Gardner did a number of excavations of Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic sites, as well as a general survey of the area. Recently the area has been further investigated by a team from the UCLA/RUG/UOA Fayum Project. In ancient Egypt, the city was called Shedet. It was the most significant centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek (borrowed from the Demotic pronunciation as Soûkhos, and then into Latin as Suchus). In consequence, the Greeks called it \\"Crocodile City\\" ( Krokodeilópolis), which was borrowed into Latin as Crocodīlopolis. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called in Koine Petsuchos, \\"the Son of Soukhos\\", that was adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors. When Petsuchos died, it was replaced by another. El Faiyum map Under the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the city was for a while called Ptolemais Euergétis (). Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) renamed the city Arsinoë and the whole nome after the name of his sister-wife Arsinoe II (316–270 or 268), who was deified after her death as part of the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, the official religion of the kingdom. Under the Roman Empire, Arsinoë became part of the province of Arcadia Aegypti. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name, it was called \\"Arsinoë in Arcadia\\". With the arrival of Christianity, Arsinoë became the seat of a bishopric, a suffragan of Oxyrhynchus, the capital of the province and the metropolitan see. Michel Le Quien gives the names of several bishops of Arsinoë, nearly all of them associated with one heresy or another., Vol. II, coll. 581-584 The Catholic Church, considering Arsinoë in Arcadia to be no longer a residential bishopric, lists it as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 840 Fayyum was the seat of Shahralanyozan, governor of the Sasanian Egypt (619–629). The 10th-century Bible exegete, Saadia Gaon, thought el-Fayyum to have actually been the biblical city of Pithom, mentioned in Exodus 1:11.Saadia Gaon, Tafsir (Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch), Exodus 1:11; Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Torah (ed. Yosef Qafih), Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1984, p. 63 (Exodus 1:11) (Hebrew) Around 1245, the region became the subject of the most detailed government survey to survive from the medieval Arab world, conducted by Abū ‘Amr ‘Uthman Ibn al-Nābulusī.The 'Villages of the Fayyum': A Thirteenth- Century Register of Rural, Islamic Egypt, ed. and trans. by Yossef Rapoport and Ido Shahar, The Medieval Countryside, 18 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), p. 3. = Faiyum mummy portraits = Encaustic on wood; Faiyum is the source of some famous death masks or mummy portraits painted during the Roman occupation of the area. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead, despite the Roman preference for cremation. While under the control of the Roman Empire, Egyptian death masks were painted on wood in a pigmented wax technique called encaustic—the Faiyum mummy portraits represent this technique. While previously believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt,Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Egyptian art and architecture - Greco- Roman Egypt accessed on January 16, 2007 modern studies conclude that the Faiyum portraits instead represent mostly native Egyptians, reflecting the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed. Ancient Faces : Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications). New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 27Riggs, C. The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion Oxford University Press (2005).Victor J. Katz (1998). A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, p. 184. Addison Wesley, : \\"But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfil numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \\"Hellenized,\\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.\\"  Modern city  Faiyum has several large bazaars, mosques,The Mosque of Qaitbey in the Fayoum of Egypt by Seif Kamel baths and a much-frequented weekly market. The canal called Bahr Yussef runs through the city, its banks lined with houses. There are two bridges over the river: one of three arches, which carries the main street and bazaar, and one of two arches, over which is built the Qaitbay mosque, that was a gift from his wife to honor the Mamluk Sultan in Fayoum. Mounds north of the city mark the site of Arsinoe, known to the ancient Greeks as Crocodilopolis, where in ancient times the sacred crocodile kept in Lake Moeris was worshipped. The center of the city is on the canal, with four waterwheels that were adopted by the governorate of Fayoum as its symbol; their chariots and bazaars are easy to spot. The city is home of the football club Misr Lel Makkasa SC, that play in the Egyptian Premier League. = Main sights = * Hanging Mosque, built when the Ottomans ruled Egypt by prince Marawan bin Hatem * Hawara, archeological site from the city * Lahun Pyramids, outside the city * Qaitbay Mosque, in the city, and was built by the wife of the Mamluk Sultan Qaitbay * Qasr Qarun, from the city * Wadi Elrayan or Wadi Rayan, the largest waterfalls in Egypt, around from the city * Wadi Al-Hitan or Valley of whales, a paleontological site in the Al Fayyum Governorate, some southwest of Cairo.

His family left a lasting legacy in Russian society and culture. Early life Nikolay Raevsky was born in Saint Petersburg.Sutherland, 13 He descended from the Rayevsky noble family which has claimed remote Scandinavian and Polish–Lithuanian ancestry.According to family traditions, their ancestors left Denmark to settle in Livonia during the fourteenth century and, by the 16th century, had acquired Polish nationality. They were granted the Łabędź coat of arms by King Sigismund III, in the early seventeenth century. See: Sutherland, 12–13. One of Peter the Great's great grandmothers came from the Raevsky family.See :ru:Нарышкина, Анна Леонтьевна. Nikolay's grandfather, Semyon Raevsky, was the Prosecutor of the Holy Synod. The family rose to prominence in Russia when Raevsky's father, Colonel Nikolay Semyonovich Raevsky, commander of the elite Izmaylovsky Regiment, married Ekaterina Samoylova.Montefiore, Simon Sebag. Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin, p. 452 London: Thomas Dunne Books, 2001 Ekaterina was a lady-in-waiting and close friend of Empress Catherine II, and a niece of the Empress’ influential favorite, Prince Potemkin.Roosevelt, Priscilla. Life on the Russian Country Estate, p. 182 New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995 Ekaterina's brother was the general and statesman, Count Alexander Samoylov. Nikolay Semyonovich Raevsky was killed in action during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) at Iaşi, dying several months before the birth of his son, General Nikolay Raevsky.Sutherland, 14 Not long after the Colonel's death, the Empress arranged for Raevsky's mother to marry a wealthy landowner, Lev Davydov, who proved to be a generous stepfather.Sutherland, 14, 16–17 Raevsky was enrolled in the Leib-Guard Semyonovsky Regiment at a very early age. On 30 April 1777 he was promoted to sergeant and on 1 January 1786 to ensign. On 23 February 1789 he was transferred to the Nizhegorodsky Dragoon Regiment with the rank of premier- major. With this regiment he took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1787–1792 and distinguished himself at Bendery and Akkerman. In recognition of his valor, Raevsky was promoted on 1 September 1790 to lieutenant colonel and became the chief of a Cossack regiment. After the peace treaty was concluded, he took part in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 with the Nizhegorodsky Dragoon Regiment. For this campaign he received on 28 June 1792 the Order of St. George of the 4th degree and the gold sword with an inscription for bravery. When the war with Persia erupted in 1796, Raevsky, under command of Count Valerian Zubov, took part in the taking of Derbent and in other engagements. Upon his ascension to the throne, Emperor Paul I recalled the army back to Russia, and had Raevsky dismissed from the military because of his relationship to Prince Potemkin, whom Paul detested. After Paul's murder, and Alexander I's assumption of the throne, Raevsky rejoined the army and was promoted to the rank of Major General.Sutherland, 17 Napoleonic Wars Raevsky his troops in battle The great monument on the Raevsky redoubt was dedicated by Nicolas I in 1839. After Russia's failures at the outbreak of the Napoleonic wars, Raevsky returned into the field on 25 April 1807. He served with Prince Pyotr Bagration in the vanguard of the Russian army. During the campaign of 1806–1807, Raevsky distinguished himself in numerous battles, and was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir of the 3rd degree. Raevsky, who had sustained a wound in the Battle of Heilsberg, commanded chasseurs of the advance-guard in the Battle of Friedland.Sutherland, 19 After the Treaty of Tilsit was concluded, Raevsky fought in the Finnish War, and was present at every major engagement. For this campaign, Raevsky received the Order of St. Vladimir of the 2nd degree and obtained the rank of lieutenant-general. The war over, he followed Count Nikolay Kamensky to the Moldavian army, which took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806–12.Sutherland, 20 His bold leadership made itself felt in the taking of Silistra. During Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, Raevsky led the 7th Infantry Corps, a part of the 2nd Army led by Prince Pyotr Bagration.Seaton, Albert. The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 30.

After Austria and Prussia joined the Allies, Raevsky's corps joined the Bohemian Army commanded by Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg. He received the Order of St. Vladimir of the 1st degree for the Battle of Kulm. Near Wachau, he was seriously injured. For his feats of arms he was promoted Full General (October 8, 1813) and received the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa of the 3rd degree. When the Russian army entered Saxony, Raevsky was forced to return to Russia because of his poor health.

The Raevskys had six children, two sons and four daughters. After the Napoleonic Wars ended, Raevsky settled with his family at Boltyshka, an estate left to him by his stepfather.Sutherland, 11, 16, 22–23 Boltyshka was a large estate near the banks of the Dnieper River in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine; the land was fertile and there were over ten thousand serfs to cultivate it. In May 1821, during a visit to the Caucasus, Raevsky befriended a young Alexander Pushkin and traveled with him to the Crimea. Pushkin would form close friendships with Raevsky's sons, his sons-in-law, and his half-brother, Vasily Davydov – all members of the Southern Society that helped plot the Decembrist Revolt of 1825.Sutherland, 56–59Davydoff, Alexander.

Pushkin, p. 158. New York: Doubleday & Co., 1970 While Raevsky's daughter Maria's youthful frolics inspired Pushkin to write some of the most famous lines in Russian literature (\\"Eugene Onegin\\", I-XXXIII). Raevsky's favorite child, Maria, was wed at the age of nineteen to Prince Sergey Volkonsky, a wealthy, liberal aristocrat, who had fought alongside General Raevsky during the Napoleonic Wars.Sutherland, 19–20 & 78 Raevsky's eldest daughter, Ekaterina, married the wealthy young General Mikhail Fyodorovich Orlov, also a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars.Sutherland, 61 Once interested in discussion of liberal reforms, western democracy, and the teachings of the Enlightenment philosophers, by 1825 Raevsky had abandoned his youthful idealism, rejecting the notion that Russia could be anything other than an absolute monarchy.Sutherland, 19–20 Both of Raevsky's sons and his son-in-law, Mikhail Orlov, withdrew from the Southern Society long before the Decembrist Revolt occurred, and took no part in the uprising.Sutherland, 72, 109 Raevsky's half- brother, Vasily Davydov, and Prince Volkonsky, remained in the Society. They were arrested along with their fellow conspirators days after the uprising in December 1825, and were taken to Saint Petersburg. They were held for several months, interrogated, tried, and sentenced to hard labor and exile in Siberia.Sutherland, 5 & 115–119 Against her father's wishes, Maria fought for the right to accompany her husband to Siberia, and managed to personally persuade the Emperor to allow her to share Prince Volkonsky's exile.Lednicki, Waclaw.

The school is bordered by Residency Road, St Mark's Road, Lavelle Road and Vittal Mallya Road, and is spread over of land in the heart of Bangalore. School heads in the early days included George Uglow Pope, Herbert Pakenham-Walsh, S. T. Pettigrew, William Elphick, Iowerth Lowell Thomas and A. T. Balraj. The Boarding has around 200 students from all over India and also International students from Thailand, Nepal etc. The sister school Bishop Cotton Girls' School is located on the opposite side of St. Mark's Road.  Origins  The school's past extends back to the British Raj and the Victorian era with its beginnings in a house on High Grounds over which now stands the great ITC Windsor Hotel. It was started in 1865 by Rev. S T Pettigrew, the then Chaplain of St. Mark's Cathedral who had a vision of starting a school for the education of children of European and Anglo-Indian families. In his own words, he wanted to \\"establish a day and boarding School for the Children of Christian residents in the station and its vicinity.\\" The school was named in honour of George Cotton, Bishop of Calcutta, under whose stewardship a scheme of education was organized for the Anglican Churches in India. After India gained independence from the British in 1947, the school began to be, and is still governed by the Church of South India. In the first five years of the school it had three principals. It was only with the arrival of George Uglow Pope, a distinguished Tamil scholar (who translated the famed Tirukkuṛaḷ into English) that the present site was acquired For Rs 47,500. The boys' school and the girls' school functioned on the same campus but under different heads. Under the stewardship of Pope, the school grew from strength to strength. A collegiate section was started and the school obtained recognition from the University of Madras. He gave the School its motto – 'Nec Dextrorsum Nec Sinistrorsum', meaning 'Neither to the right nor to the Left'. When Pope left India in 1892 to take up the post of Reader at Oxford University, the standard of the school began to decline. By 1906, closure of the school was contemplated. Henry Whitehead, Bishop of Madras, the chairman of the Board of Governors, as a last resort, invited the members of the Brotherhood of Saint Peter to save the school from closure. Herbert Pakenham- Walsh, of the Brotherhood of St. Peter, later to become Bishop, revived the school. The school still celebrates St. Peter's day amongst other traditions such as Guy Fawkes' bonfires. In 1911, the girls' school was moved across the road. William Elphick worked for a quarter of century for the growth of the school. The last living member of the Brotherhood of St Peter in India, Father David, died of old age. He lived and worked in the school as the school chaplain. Notable alumni = Military = * Lieutenant General A C Iyappa * Lieutenant General Jameel Mahmood * Major General Sultan Mahmood * Col.

Watson played with St Kilda in various positions, predominantly on the half back line or across the centre. Spotted as a schoolboy by Roy Cazaly and was brought to Melbourne in 1919 where he played some games with VFA side Port Melbourne. He played three games for St Kilda in 1920 before returning home to the country, and then returning to St Kilda mid-1922 where his career finally took off. He was outstanding in the 1924 interstate carnival, won the Brownlow medal in 1925 and was regarded as the best footballer in the land. In 1926, he accepted the position of captain-coach of Stawell, but St Kilda, perhaps not surprisingly, refused to clear him. After standing out of football for a year, Watson crossed to a different country club, Maryborough, without a clearance, and the Ballarat Football League was disqualified by the VFL as a consequence. Watson stayed in the country, initially with Maryborough, and later with his original club, South Warrnambool, for seven years. He returned to St Kilda in 1933 and was captain-coach of the side in 1934. In 1935 he left the side after the first game of the season and returned to the country.

The company was founded in 1905 as the \\"Parisian Photographic Studio\\" by Anthony Maurice Tooton (1886–1971) in St. John's. Tooton immigrated from Damascus, Syria in 1903 after studying photography in Paris. After five years of traveling door to door across the island, initially taking portraits in addition to running his flagship store on Water Street (operated from a half dozen different locations before settling on 307-309 Water Street in 1921), Tooton, at the age of 21, left for Rochester, New York to meet with George Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Company. Tooton's intention was to ask Eastman for the exclusive distribution rights to all Kodak product for Newfoundland, Eastman was so impressed by Tooton that he not only granted him the rights on all Kodak product (a monopoly which would last until Confederation in 1949) but also the exclusive right to use the Kodak name and marks on all major storefronts and materials, thus creating what would become known as: \\"Tooton's, The Kodak Store!\\" These relationships with Eastman and others helped keep Tooton's business up-to-date with photo technology as well as Industry standards. Tooton's passion for photography and acumen as a businessman made the name synonymous with photography, Tooton himself appearing on the popular Ed Sullivan Show.\\"Photograph signed by Ed Sullivan after appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show\\" , Tooton Films The company continued to experience growth in the following years and became a significant family endeavor. Before his death in 1971, Tooton passed the family business onto his son, Anthony Raymond Tooton (Ray), who grew the company significantly before subsequently handing it down to his own son, Anthony Geoffrey Tooton (Geoff) https://www.thetelegram.com/business/geoff-tooton-remembered-for-kindness- love-of-business-and-learning-286803/, who brought the company to greater heights expanding it into other markets and mediums and continuing to maintain dominant market share.

Initially it was rumoured that a national chain such as Black's might buy the company's remnants, but this never materialized. Some locations later reopened under a number of different names and owners, but with the rise of digital photography, most of those stores eventually closed for good.

Early life and career Milton Brent Buckner was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents encouraged him to learn to play piano, but they both died when he was nine years old. Milt and his younger brother Ted were sent to Detroit where they were adopted by members of the Earl Walton band: trombonist John Tobias, drummer George Robinson (Milt) and reedplayer Fred Kewley (Ted).Lars Bjorn with Jim Gallert, Before Motown: A History of Jazz in Detroit, 1920-60, University of Michigan Press, 2001, p. 24-25. Buckner studied piano for three years from the age 10, then at 15 began writing arrangements for the band, he and his brother going on to become active in the Detroit jazz world in the 1930s. Buckner first played in Detroit with the McKinney Cotton Pickers and then with Cab Calloway. In 1941 he joined Lionel Hampton's big band, and for the next seven years served as its pianist and staff arranger. Buckner was part of a Variety Revue of 1950 organized by Lionel Hampton at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 25, 1950. He led a short-lived big band of his own for two years, but then returned to Hampton's in 1950. In 1952 he formed his own trio and pioneered the use of the electric Hammond organ. He often played in Europe in the late 1960s. His last studio session took place in Paris on 4 July 1977. Milt Buckner is also known very widely for the use of his song \\"The Beast\\" in the title menu of the popular video game Battlefield: Bad Company, which was a huge success in part due to the use of good music and introducing many fans to the wonders of blues and jazz.

It is measured from . The station is managed by Great Western Railway but is not staffed; except for two trains in each direction per day, it is only served by local services, most notably as a commuter station for students for Torquay Girls' Grammar School and Torquay Boys' Grammar School, as many students commute from surrounding areas. History A broad gauge branch was opened by the South Devon Railway from Newton Abbot on 18 December 1848, this station being the terminus and known as Torquay. This line was extended by the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway on 2 August 1859, which opened the present Torquay railway station at Livermead so the original station was renamed \\"Torre\\". The station had a small extension to the single platform and a train shed built in 1855 but with the opening of the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway, a new platform had to be provided. The original station can still be seen standing alongside the track just north of the platform. Goods traffic was handled from October 1849. The goods yard was originally at the west end of the station. The original goods shed was destroyed by fire in 1857 and eventually replaced in 1865 by a stone building alongside the railway on the Newton Abbot side of the station. A coal yard was built on the west side of the station. The South Devon Railway amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876. The railway had originally been just a single track, but on 26 March 1882 the line to the north was doubled and a second platform opened. On 20 May 1892 the line was converted to standard gauge. The first signal box was opened in 1883 at the London end of the northbound platform. This was replaced in 1921 by a new three-storey building on that platform. The original signalling used just 16 levers; the new box contained 42. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. The buildings on the second platform were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a simple brick-built shelter. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 4 December 1967. =Accidents= On the afternoon of 17 June 1946 a passenger train from London Paddington station to Paignton collided with the rear of a freight train that was stationary north of Torre station. The signalman had made an error in setting the line as clear and so the passenger train had been allowed to leave Kingskerswell thinking the line was clear. Both lines were blocked and over 3,000 passengers had to be carried by bus between Newton Abbot and Torre. Another collision happened on 26 April 1958 when a passenger train approaching from Newton Abbot passed through two danger signals and collided with a freight train that was shunting in the station. Description The station is situated on Newton Road (the road from Torquay to Newton Abbot, just above the traffic lights where Avenue Road joins it). To the left of the station entrance is a Halfords store which is built on the cramped site of the first goods shed which burnt down in 1857. To the right is the original terminus building of the line from Newton Abbot which is now used by an electrical manufacturer and, beyond that, the 1865 stone goods shed is now a joinery workshop. The second station building is used by a furniture shop which has extended onto the platform by building a concrete block wall in line with the pillars of the canopy. The entrance passageway through this building opens onto the platform for trains towards Paignton. Access to the opposite platform is by way of a covered footbridge and it is on this platform that the tall but disused signal box stands. Chapel Hill rises behind this platform . The station buildings are Grade II listed. Services Torre is served by Great Western Railway local trains in both directions on an approximately half-hourly basis during the day. Most trains run between Exmouth and Paignton, though some start/finish at Newton Abbot; on Sundays the service is less frequent and most trains only run between Exeter St Davids and Paignton. Some longer-distance trains normally call here, such as the GWR Paignton to London Paddington route. As of December 2009 there are no longer trains to London Waterloo. As the station lies on the Riviera Line it sees many mainline charter services (including steam hauled) pass through, such as the Torbay Express which runs between Bristol Temple Meads and Kingswear on selected summer Sundays. Torquay engine house The engine house The South Devon Railway was designed to be worked as an atmospheric railway, the trains propelled by stationary engines that created a vacuum in a pipe laid between the rails. An engine house was built a short distance to the north of the Torquay terminus that would have powered trains up the 1 in 75 (13%) gradient from the station, but it was never brought into use and conventional locomotives worked the trains instead. The building still stands in Torquay Road near the Lidl supermarket (at ). It was used for many years by the Longpark Pottery but is currently a fruit and vegetable warehouse. It can be glimpsed above the cutting on the right of trains approaching Torre from Newton Abbot. Future In the Torbay Council Mayoral Vision, it is proposed that this station is re-branded to become 'Torquay Central Station', and the current Torquay Railway Station be renamed 'Torquay Seafront' although as of 2016 this has not materialized.

Designed in a 1960s modernist style, it was completed in 1971, and is an iconic symbol of Karachi as well as one of the most popular tourist sites in the city.http://www.tourism.gov.pk/karachi_sindh.html , Mazar-e-Quaid on Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation website, Retrieved 8 April 2016 The mausoleum complex also contains the tomb of Jinnah's sister, Māder-e Millat (\\"Mother of the Nation\\") Fatima Jinnah, as well as those of Liaquat Ali Khan and Nurul Amin, the first and eighth Prime Ministers of Pakistan respectively. The tomb of Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar, a stalwart of the Muslim League from Peshawar, is also located there. Location The mausoleum is located in a prominent and highly visible location in the Jamshed Quarters locality of central Karachi, along the northern edge of the colonial-era core at the end of Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road. The mausoleum is surrounded by a large garden laid out in a neo-Mughal style in the dense central city, with large traffic rotaries at three of its four corners.  History  Muhammad Ali Jinnah's corporal death occurred in 1948, and his final resting place was marked by a large white marble slab that was raised on a plinth accessed by marble steps. In 1949, the Quaid-e-Azam Memorial Fund (QMF) was established, which received numerous suggestions for the establishment of a memorial in Jinnah's honor. By 1952, his mausoleum was capped by a small dome, with a cabinet that contained some of his personal effects along a wall near his grave. The site had an air of neglect which angered many. Fatima Jinnah and the QMF received numerous letters from concerned Pakistanis at the sad state of his tomb, and advocated for a more befitting monument to Jinnah. In 1952, the QMF proposed to erect 4 monuments across Pakistan to Jinnah's memory - a mausoleum and mosque on the current site in central Karachi, a Dar-ul-Uloom religions school in Punjab, and a University of Science and Technology in East Pakistan.S. R Ghauri: \\"Humble Symbol of Gratitude\\", Editor Altaf Hussain, The Daily Dawn, Karachi: 12 Sept. 1962. In 1954, an Indian architect was selected to design the mausoleum, but was later dismissed. In 1955, a Turkish architect was hired, but his plan was rejected as well. In 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition to design a new mausoleum for Jinnah. The competition was initially won by British architect William Whitfield,Zahir-ud Deen Khwaja: Memoirs of an Architect. Lahore: Printhouse, 1998, p. 63. of the Raglan Squire and Partners firm. The state's efforts to select a design were paralleled by the efforts of the Jinnah's sister, Fatima Jinnah, who sought input from the public in the design of a monument to her brother. Fatima Jinnah effectively vetoed the 1957 proposal, and assumed control of the QMF. She then commissioned architect Yahya Merchant, a Bombay based architect who was a personal friend of Jinnah, to design the monument. President Ayub Khan laid the foundation stone for the monument on July 31, 1960. It was inaugurated by Yahya Khan on 18 January 1971. The gardens surrounding the mausoleum were not completed until December 24, 2000.  Proposed designs  Numerous proposals were submitted by Pakistani citizens following independence - ranging from a shrine, to a neo-Mughal monument. The idealists suggestions directly from ordinary Pakistani citizens reflected the \\"radical utopianism\\" that swept through the Muslims of the subcontinent around the Pakistan Movement. In 1954, an Indian architect was selected to design the mausoleum, but his design could not gain consensus among members of the QMF, and so was dismissed. In 1955, a Turkish architect was hired, but his plan was rejected as being \\"too elaborate,\\" and \\"almost despotic.\\" The QMF's mandate stalled as consensus over the design was lacking. Proposals from the Malay engineer and architect Ainuddin, suggested a complex reminiscent of a Sufi shrine, with mosques, libraries, school, restaurants, and shops to merge into the fabric of the city.Letter from Ainuddin to Fatima Jinnah, undated, National Archives, Islamabad, Fatima Jinnah Papers, Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum, Serial no. 518/ 1949-65/85, pp. 56-67. and Letter from Ainuddin to Fatima Jinnah, 4 October 1959, National Archives, Islamabad, Fatima Jinnah Papers, Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum, Serial no. 518/ 1949-65/85, p. 28. 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition to design a new mausoleum for Jinnah. 6 of the 8 jurists were European modernist architects. The 1957 competition was won by William Whitfield of the modernist Reglan Squire and Partners firm. The plan called for an avante garde neo-futurist mausoleum mounted on an elevated platform in a neo-Mughal garden, with a central parabola and pointed edges at its six corners reaching out \\"in an exuberant motion towards the sky.\\" Following the 1958 coup of President Ayub Khan, who presented himself as a moderniser, the Whitfield-Squire proposal gained favor among the military elite, although public reception was not warm. Fatima Jinnah opposed Whitfield's plan on several fronts, including its design, its selection by an international rather than Pakistani jury, and the fact that it was awarded to a British national, which challenged the desire of Pakistanis for a de-colonial future. Fatima Jinnah then assumed control of the design process, and chose the proposals of architect Yahya Merchant, a Bombay based architect who was a personal friend of Jinnah. Merchant’s design was of a cuboid structure with a dome, clad in white marble. The monument was placed on an elevated platform, set in a 61-acre gardened hill looking over the city. The new design was praised by eminent professor Ahmad Hasan Dani as “not a slavish imitation of the old tradition. Actually it partakes of the Muslim spirit of the past but it is created to meet the new demand of the present in the technique of the present day.”Ahmad Hasan Dani, introduction to The Quaid- i-Azam Mausoleum in Pictures, ed. Afsar Akhtar Husain and Dani (Islamabad: National Book Foundation, 1976) Architecture The design of the Mazar-e- Quaid was influenced by the Samanid Mausoleum in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, built between 892 and 943 CE. The mausoleum was designed in the modernist style popular during the 1960s and 1970s, and has been termed a \\"traditional monument of a modernist period.\\" It appears simple at a distance, but \\"exuberant in its use of material and complex in its detailing when viewed\\" closely. The use of white marble to suggest purity, and pure geometric forms, are designed to portray Jinnah as a larger-than-life figure. The location and style of the monument both serve to inspire passersby.Ahmed Hasan Dani, The Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum in Pictures.

Arrest and prosecution  In a street demonstration in The Square, in Bournemouth on 13 October 2001, Hammond held up a large double-sided sign bearing the words \\"Jesus Gives Peace, Jesus is Alive, Stop Immorality, Stop Homosexuality, Stop Lesbianism, Jesus is Lord\\". Some passers-by became angry, and tried to remove the sign; some threw water and soil at Hammond. Two police officers arrived and arrested Hammond, and charged him under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. No one in the crowd was charged.http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/08/10611/ The relevant provisions of the Act state: \\"(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he ... (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby …(3) It is a defence for the accused to prove ... (c) that his conduct was reasonable.\\" In April 2002, a Magistrates court heard that Hammond had travelled by bus to preach with the sign. During the bus journey the defendant covered the sign with a black plastic bin-liner as he believed the sign might cause a fracas if displayed inside the bus, because of reaction he had previously received because of it. The defendant began preaching, holding the sign upright so that it was clearly visible to passers-by. A group of 30 to 40 young people gathered, arguing and shouting; some people in the crowd were angry al while others were distressed and pummelled him. Police officers attended the scene; there was a disagreement as to whether they should protect Hammond or arrest him. One of them spoke to the defendant and asked him to take the sign down and leave the area. The defendant refused saying that he was aware that his sign was insulting because he had had a similar reaction before on another occasion, but that he intended to return the following Saturday to preach with the sign again. Hammond was convicted, fined £300, and ordered to pay costs of £395. The court ordered the destruction of the placards. Shortly after his trial, Hammond died.  Posthumous appeal  In January 2004, a posthumous appeal (Hammond v Director of Public Prosecutions) on the basis of the Human Rights Act failed. A two-judge panel, Lord Justice May sitting with Mr Justice Harrison, at the High Court in London, was told the sign caused a furore as a group of 30 to 40 people gathered round. Hugh Tomlinson, QC, appearing for Hammond's executors, said: \\"He (Hammond) was subjected to a number of assaults. Soil was thrown at him and water poured over his head. Someone tried to seize the sign and he was knocked to the ground.\\" The justices were of the opinion that the words on the sign were insulting and caused distress to persons who were present and that the defendant was aware of that fact. The judges ruled that Hammond's behaviour \\"went beyond legitimate protest\\" and that Hammond's right to freedom of expression under section 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights was constrained by a legitimate concern to prevent disorder and that there was a pressing social need for the restriction. A further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was dismissed. Social commentaries The case has become a cause celebre in the United Kingdom and has been discussed in commentaries by conservative columnist Peter Hitchens.Hitchens, Peter: The Abolition of Liberty. Atlantic Books, 2004. Peter Tatchell, though better known for his campaigns in support of gay rights than for his work on general human rights and free speech, offered to testify on Hammond's behalf at the appeal, calling the case \\"an outrageous assault on civil liberties.\\" References External links * Hammond v DPP, [2004] EWHC 69 (Admin) Category:1932 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Evangelists ","title":"Harry Hammond"},{"id":"3894242","text":"Location of Varna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland IslandsPerperek Knoll from Ongal Peak Topographic map of Livingston Island and Smith Island Perperek Knoll (Perperekska Mogila \\\\per-pe-'rek-ska mo-'gi-la\\\\\\\\) is a 360 m peak in Vidin Heights on Varna Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.

As compensation, Saroyan offers Maréchal the chance to drive a friend's 1964 white Cadillac DeVille convertible from Naples to Bordeaux, all expenses paid. Unknown to Maréchal, Saroyan is the leader of a criminal gang and the Cadillac is filled with heroin, gold and precious stones, including the largest diamond in the world, the Youkounkoun. Maréchal collects the car in Naples from where, unknown to him, Saroyan and his associates shadow him. Unknown to Saroyan, an Italian gang are aware of the Cadillac's contents and are shadowing it as well. After an accident, in which the repairman finds and removes the gold, Maréchal reaches Rome, where a pretty manicurist called Gina joins him. She only does it to make her fiancé jealous and then finds a pretty German hitchhiker called Ursula to accompany him.

Mickey, one of the Italian crooks, seduces Ursula, who invites him to join them. In an isolated spot, Mickey then tries to kill Maréchal, but Ursula sabotages the battery so that he cannot make off with the car and saves Maréchal's life. Left on his own, Maréchal gets a new battery and throws the ruined one, full of diamonds, into the sea.

He is also notable for pairing with General John Larsson in the composition of many songs and musicals. Childhood Gowans was born in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, on 13 November 1934, the third of five children. His parents were Salvation Army officers. At age 18, he undertook national service, with plans to train for the teaching profession. He eventually decided to join the British Army, where his first choice was the Army Catering Corps. However, the Army recommended he join the Royal Army Educational Corps. He then spent his two years of national service in Germany. Work in The Salvation Army In 1954, Gowans entered the Salvation Army International Training College (Soulwinners Session). There he met his wife Gisèle Bonhotal who, herself, was a qualified children's nurse. She was French by birth and her parents, like Gowans', were both Salvation Army officers. The couple were married in Paris in 1957 and have two sons, John-Marc and Christophe. Beginning in 1967 Gowans demonstrated his writing capacity when, with John Larsson, co-authored ten full-length stage musicals. These were Take-Over Bid (1967), Hosea (1969), Jesus Folk (1972), Spirit (1973), Glory (1975), White Rose (1977), The Blood of the Lamb (1978), Son of Man (1983), Man Mark II (1985), and The Meeting (1990). He has also written three books of prayer poems under the title of O Lord! and an autobiography, There's a Boy Here ... Gowans and his wife served in various corps in the British Territory over a period of 16 years. He was then appointed national stewardship secretary, while his wife combined her role as organiser of the International Youth Fellowship with work in one of the Army's maternity homes in London. After a period as divisional leaders in Manchester, UK, Gowans, then a lieutenant-colonel, became chief secretary of the France Territory. He was then appointed to Los Angeles in the USA Western Territory where he served as Secretary for Programme. After serving as leaders of the Southern California Division the couple returned to France in 1986 as territorial leaders. Seven years later they were appointed territorial leaders of the Australia Eastern and Papua New Guinea Territory, which included responsibility for the work of the Army in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australia Capital Territory and Papua New Guinea. In 1997, John Gowans was promoted to commissioner and took command of the United Kingdom Territory with the Republic of Ireland. On 15 May 1999, Gowans was elected the 16th General of The Salvation Army and took office on 23 July 1999, with Commissioner Gisèle Gowans as World President of Women's Organisations. When Gowans retired in 2002, his earlier musical partner John Larsson succeeded him as the next international leader of The Salvation Army. Death Gowans died on 8 December 2012. .

Choele Choel, with a population of 10,791 (), is located at the intersection of the National Routes #22 and #250, around 1000 kilometres from Buenos Aires, 180 from General Roca, 193 from the Las Grutas beach resort, and 460 from Puerto Madryn. Its long distance bus terminal is a common stop for buses going to both sea-side Patagonia (Puerto Madryn, Río Gallegos, Ushuaia) and North- Andean Patagonia (Bariloche, El Bolsón). During the 1990s, the airport used to serve regular flights to Buenos Aires, but currently serves only infrequent private charters. History Originally named Nicolás Avellaneda, it was founded on July 9, 1879 by General Conrado Villegas. After a flood, the inhabitants moved to a place known as Pampa de los Molinos. They would stay there until March 18, 1882, when the settlement was moved to its current location. The town acquired special importance during the Conquest of the Desert, when the border between the white man and the Native Americans was pushed south the shore of the Río Negro River. In 1883, a post office was installed in the town. Salesians arrived in 1890. The Provincial School #10 was created in 1904, and in 1917 the Library. Irish Argentine writer Rodolfo Walsh was born in the town in 1927. Choele Choel is home to a sizable Russian community; besides the European immigrant communities common to most of Argentina, the town received refugees from Laos in the 1970s.Russian Old Believers in Choele Choel, Argentina =Etymology= There are several versions regarding the meaning of Choele Choel: it might be from the Araucan language, translated as \\"Yellow flower race,\\" or from the Tehuelche language (\\"Small river rolling-stones\\").

In the following game, on 10 January 1998, Abou scored twice as West Ham beat Barnsley 6–0. Abou received his only red card in the next game, a 1–0 away defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Fouling Ramon Vega in an off-the-ball incident, Abou was dismissed by referee David Elleray. Abou finished the 1997–98 season with 6 goals from 26 games, including two on the last day of the season in a 4–3 home defeat of Leicester City.

When a poor and low caste village shoemender, Dukhiya(Om Puri) who lives with his wife Jhuria(Smita Patil), goes to the village Brahmin (Hindu priest) (Mohan Agashe) to get the date of his daughter's marriage fixed, the Brahmin in turn asks for labour without pay in exchange.The priest makes him sweep his house, cut logs of tree.

The name was used three more times for new and distinct Triumph models. Original Triumph: 6T Thunderbird Replica of Marlon Brando's mildly customised 1950 6T Triumph Thunderbird from The Wild One, surrounded by publicity stills from the film. To capture the American market, the 6T Thunderbird used a variant of the earlier Speed Twin's parallel twin engine, bored out from 500 cc to 650 cc to give the added horsepower American customers demanded. The concept of enlarging the Speed Twin, the Thunderbird name and its 'paper dart' logo were thought up by managing director Edward Turner on one of his regular trips to Triumph's operations in the USA. The 'paper dart' logo was embossed onto the chain case cover on Thunderbirds from 1955 to 1962 and can be seen upon closer examination on the supplied photograph of the 1962 model. Previously, it appeared as a decal on the headlamp nacelle. 1962 Triumph Thunderbird, the last with the 'pre-unit' engine. Note the nacelle, the merged exhaust system and the full version of the unpopular bathtub rear fairing. The 6T Thunderbird was launched publicly at Montlhéry near Paris, where three standard-production bikes were ridden around a circuit by a team of riders who between them averaged a speed of over a distance of . All three machines were ridden to the circuit and back to the Meriden factory. Triumph obtained further lasting publicity with Marlon Brando's 1953 motion picture The Wild One, in which he rode a 1950 6T Thunderbird. In the book Triumph Motorcycles In America, there is reproduced a letter from Triumph's importers objecting to the producers as to the use of their machine in this film about rowdy motorcycle gangs. From 1960, the Thunderbird acquired Turner's rear fairing nicknamed the 'bathtub' on account of its shape. This unpopular feature, dropped quickly in the USA market, remained in ever-abbreviated forms for the home market until disappearing altogether for the final year of production, 1966. Before then, in 1963, the Thunderbird, along with Triumph's other 650 cc models, was given the Turner-designed unit engine. Throughout this time, however, the Thunderbird retained its distinctive nacelle. A 1966 Thunderbird was prominently used by the leads in the popular 2006 romance film, Once. Triumph Meriden co-operative: TR65 Thunderbird The Triumph worker's co- operative at the Meriden factory re-introduced the Thunderbird model name to their range in April 1981. The Triumph TR65 Thunderbird 650 cc parallel-twin was a short-stroke version of the 750 cc T140 Bonneville engine and was the cheapest model in Triumph's range with budget features such as a drum rather than disc rear brake, the absence of a tachometer, a merged exhaust system, painted rather than polished alloy and economy Dunlop Gold Seal tyres. Moreover, whereas Triumph's 750cc range had electronic ignition, the TR65 was fitted with contact breaker points. Respecting its lineage, the model retained the Turner-designed 'paper dart' logo on its side panels but with a different, updated 'Thunderbird' script. The TR65 was priced upon introduction at £1,829.82. The economy finish was upgraded for 1982 'export' models although the contact breaker points and drum rear brake remained. 1983 Triumph Thunderbird with merged exhaust system. By then, polished alloy or chromed parts replaced the budget satin black engine finish on the initial 1981 model specification. A trail version of the TR65, the TR65T, was also introduced in 1981 but, likely as it was priced the same as the 750 cc version, suffered poor sales and was dropped from the range in late 1982. Planned for 1984, a custom-styled and further sleeved-down TR60 600 cc Thunderbird was exhibited but not produced,Guide Lines(Cycle Guide 6/83)Daytona Return ! Motor Cycle News (02.03.83) the co-operative closing down towards the end of 1983. The scheduled price for this model was £2,181. The prototype Thunderbird 600 was converted by the factory into a conventional TR65 to fulfil a Ministry Of Defence order. From the Meriden Triumph factory production records held by the Vintage Motor Cycle Club, that TR65, made on 1 June 1983, was the last 650 cc motorcycle and the second last motorcycle made at Meriden before the factory's closure that August. Norton-Villiers-Triumph (NVT): T180 Thunderbird III In 1975, an NVT prototype 870 cc triple, the T180 Triumph Thunderbird III, was developed. This was an enlarged capacity version of the Triumph T160, but the T180 did not reach production. NVT passed on the prototype to the Meriden co- operative which also chose not to proceed to production despite experimenting with installing the engine in their oil-bearing frame.  Triumph Hinckley: T309RT Thunderbird (triple)  Triumph 900 Thunderbird The new Triumph company based at Hinckley introduced the Triumph Thunderbird 900 in late 1994. Coded T309RT, the new Thunderbird was instrumental in Triumph's successful re-entry into the US market. The 'Thunderbird' name and retro styling recalls the original Triumph company's golden years of the 1960s. It was the first \\"classic\\" Triumph to be produced by the resurgent company. The engine, redesigned to give a period look and de-tuned for more torque at lower rpm, was a variant of the 885 cc triple engine. Peak power was down to from . Several variants of the Thunderbird were produced, Triumph T309TT Legend, Triumph T309RC Adventurer, and the Triumph T309RD Thunderbird Sport, which produced a claimed 82 bhp. The Thunderbird was produced until 2003 and the Thunderbird Sport until 2004. Hinckley also produced an accompanying clothing range consisting of sew-on patches, leather jacket and ankle boots, all featuring Edward Turner's original 'paper-dart' Thunderbird logo.

Her most recent poetry collection is Magdalene (W.W. Norton, 2017). In August 2012 she was named the State Poet for New York.https://online.wsj.com/article/APa0444add860c4deda7f84febf0f54925.html Early life Howe is the eldest girl of nine children. She attended Sacred Heart Convent School and earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Windsor. Career She worked briefly as a newspaper reporter in Rochester and as a high school English teacher in Massachusetts. Howe did not devote serious attention to writing poetry until she turned 30. At the suggestion of an instructor in a writers' workshop, Howe applied to and was accepted at Columbia University where she studied with Stanley Kunitz and received her M.F.A. in 1983. She has taught writing at Tufts University and Warren Wilson College. She is presently on the writing faculties at Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, and New York University. Her first book, The Good Thief, was selected by Margaret Atwood as the winner of the 1987 Open Competition of the National Poetry Series. In 1998, she published her best- known book of poems, What the Living Do; the title poem in the collection is a haunting lament for her brother with the plain-spoken last line: \\"I am living, I remember you.\\" Howe's brother John died of an AIDS-related illness in 1989. \\"John’s living and dying changed my aesthetic entirely,\\" she has said. In 1995, Howe co-edited, with Michael Klein, a collection of essays, letters, and stories entitled In the Company of My Solitude: American Writing from the AIDS Pandemic. Her poems have appeared in literary journals and magazines including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Poetry, Agni, Ploughshares, and Harvard Review. Her honors include National Endowment for the Arts and Guggenheim fellowships. In January 2018, Howe was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\\"Marie Howe\\" Poets.org  Literary themes and style  390x390px Marie Howe is praised for her poetry which captures the metaphysical and spiritual dimensions of everyday life . Her work explores the nature of the soul and the self through literary themes of life, death, love, pain, hope, despair, sin, virtue, solitude, community, impermanence, and the eternal. Despite the strong themes in her writing, Howe subtly expresses these messages through the explanation of daily tasks and regular lifestyles in most of her poems. Her first collection, The Good Thief (1988), was made philosophical and reflective with the incorporation of Biblical and mythical allusions. Margaret Atwood, who chose this book for the National Poetry Series, praised Howe’s “poems of obsession that transcend their own dark roots.” Additionally, Stanley Kunitz noted, “Her long, deep-breathing lines address the mysteries of flesh and spirit, in terms accessible only to a woman who is very much of our time and yet still in touch with the sacred.” Such an esteemed review justified the selection of The Good Thief for the Lavan Younger Poets Prize from the American Academy of Poets. A year after the publication of her first poetry book (1989), Howe’s brother John died from AIDs. According to Howe in an AGNI interview, “John’s living and dying changed my aesthetic completely.” Consequently in 1997, she published a second collection, What the Living Do, as an elegy for John which reflected a new style. Stripped of metaphors, her writing was described as “a transparent, accessible documentary of loss” by the Poetry of Foundation. In 2008, Howe distanced herself from the personal narrative and returned to the spiritual style in The Kingdom of Ordinary Time. This is most representative of Howe’s style now, a balance between the ordinary and unordinary. It is best put by playwright Eve Ensler, who describes her poems as “a guide to living on the brink of the mystical and the mundane.” Honors and awards * 1998 Guggenheim Fellowship * 1992 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship * 2015 Academy of American Poets Fellowship * 2017 Robert Creeley Award Published works Poetry Collections  * The Good Thief (Persea Books, 1988) Anthologies * In the Company of My Solitude: American Writing from the AIDS Pandemic, (ed., with Michael Klein, Persea Books, 1995) References Sources * Library of Congress Online Catalog > Marie Howe External links * Marie Howe's Official Website * Author's Booking Agency > Blue Flower Arts > Marie Howe Author Page * Marie Howe: Poems and Profile on Poets.org * Poem: The New Yorker > January 14, 2008 > The Star Market by Marie Howe * Poem: A Little Poetry > How Some of It Happened by Marie Howe * Personal Essay: O: The Oprah Magazine > Memoir by Marie Howe: Not to Look Away * Video: PBS > Poetry Everywhere > Marie Howe Reading The Gate Interview: Bomb Magazine > #61, Fall 1997 > Marie Howe Interviewed by Victoria Redel * Poet Marie Howe On 'What The Living Do' After Loss, NPR, October 19, 2011 * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Sarah Lawrence College faculty Category:New York University faculty Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:Writers from Rochester, New York Category:Poets from New York (state) Category:National Endowment for the Arts Fellows Category:The New Yorker people Category:Poets Laureate of New York (state) Category:American women poets Category:20th- century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American poets Category:21st-century American women writers ","title":"Marie Howe"},{"id":"3894352","text":"Prespa Glacier from Bransfield Strait, with St. Methodius Peak and St. Cyril Peak in the background.

Born to the regent Tokimune and his wife from the Adachi family, Sadatoki became a shikken at age 14 upon the death of his father. Sadatoki was under the guardianship of Taira Yoritsuna. Shimotsuki Incident The Hōjō clan had variously defeated many rival families, leaving only the Adachi clan, with whom the Hōjōs were allies. However, a plot by Adachi Yasumori to usurp the Hōjō resulted in Sadatoki authorizing Taira Yoritsuna to attack the Adachi. It is possible Taira Yoritsuna may have falsified the charges against Yasumori due to political rivalry. The attack occurred in November 1285 and is known as the Shimotsuki (old Japanese name for November) Incident. It was fought near the Adachi residence, and the Adachi were caught unaware. The fighting lasted five hours and Yasumori was forced to commit suicide, along with his family and many supporters. Over 500 died in all and the Adachi family was almost exterminated. Adachi Yasumori was Sadatoki's father's brother-in-law. Heizen Gate Incident Sadatoki's soldiers killed Taira Yoritsuna and 90 of his followers in the Heizen Gate Incident (平禅門の乱, Heizenmon no Ran) in 1293. He did this purge in confusion after the 1293 Kamakura earthquake. Regency ends and death Sadatoki ended his regency and entered the priesthood in 1301. Some sources claim that, although secluded in a temple, he continued to administer Japan until his death in 1311. He is enshrined with his father and Hōjō Takatoki.

He created the hair samples by processing hair from the bison he kept on his wild animal farm near Toledo. However, Chris Murphy notes that Ed Schillinger, \\"who is the only living witness from the Bluff Creek job\\" and \\"who considers himself almost an adopted son of the man [Ray],\\" strongly disputes the family's allegations.Murphy (2009), 146 Cryptozoologist Mark A.

This condition is an uncommon but treatable cause of periorbital pain. The trochlea is a ring-like apparatus of cartilage through which passes the tendon of the superior oblique muscle. It is located in the superior nasal orbit and functions as a pulley for the superior oblique muscle. Inflammation of the trochlear region leads to a painful syndrome with swelling and exquisite point tenderness in the upper medial rim of the orbit. A vicious cycle may ensue such that inflammation causes swelling and fraying of the tendon which then increases the friction of passing through the trochlea which in turn adds to the inflammation. Trochleitis has also been associated with triggering or worsening of migraine attacks in patients with pre-existing migraines (Yanguela, 2002).  Symptoms  Patients with trochleitis typically experience a dull fluctuating aching over the trochlear region developing over a few days. Some may also feel occasional sharp pains punctuating the ache. In patients with migraines, trochleitis may occur simultaneously with headache. Presentation is usually unilateral with palpable swelling over the affected area supranasal to the eye. The trochlear region is extremely tender to touch. Pain is exacerbated by eye movements looking down and inwards, and especially in supraduction (looking up) and looking outwards, which stretches the superior oblique muscle tendon. Notably, there is no restriction of extraocular movements, no diplopia, and often no apparent ocular signs such as proptosis. However, occasionally mild ptosis is found. The absence of generalized signs of orbital involvement is helpful in eliminating other more common causes of periorbital pain.  Cause  The cause of trochleitis is often unknown (idiopathic trochleitis), but it has been known to occur in patients with rheumatological diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, enteropathic arthropathy, and psoriasis. In his study, Tychsen and his group evaluated trochleitis patients with echography and CT scan to demonstrate swelling and inflammation. Imaging studies showed inflammation of superior oblique tendon/ trochlear pulley. It was unclear whether the inflammation involved the trochlea itself, or the tissues surrounding the trochlea.  Diagnosis  Trochleitis is diagnosed based on three criteria: 1) demonstration of inflammation of superior oblique tendon/ trochlea region, 2) periorbital pain and tenderness to palpation in the area of the sore trochlea, and 3) worsening of pain on attempted vertical eye movement, particularly with adduction of the eye. It is important to identify trochleitis because it is a treatable condition and the patient can benefit much from pain relief. Treatment consists of a single injection of corticosteroids to the affected peritrochlear region. Treatment A specific \\"cocktail\\" consisting of depomedrol and lidocaine can be injected into the trochlea; immediate relief due to the effects of the local anesthetic indicates successful placement. However, great care must be taken as the injection is in the region of several arteries, veins and nerves. The needle should not be too small (so as not to penetrate tiny structures), the surgeon should draw back on the syringe (to ensure not have pierced a vessel), the lidocaine should not contain epinephrine (which could cause vasospasm), and the pressure of the injection must always be controlled. Only a limited number of injections can be made as they would otherwise lead to muscle atrophy. Diagnosis can be confirmed by response to this treatment; pain and swelling are expected to disappear in 48–72 hours. Some patients experience recurrence of trochleitis.  History  Trochleitis was first identified in 1984 by Tychsen, et al. in a study of thirteen patients with orbital pain and point tenderness over the trochlear region. Previously, the trochleitis syndrome had been included in the broad category of idiopathic orbital inflammation (also called orbital pseudotumor). From the study, Tychsen and his group surmised that trochleitis was a subtype of idiopathic orbital inflammation distinct from the larger category in that it produced little/ no discernible ocular signs (the eye looked normal) and did not cause restricted extraocular movement.

Roos was born near the South African town of Stellenbosch on 30 October 1880 and completed his education there. Roos was a popular rugby player and was chosen by his own teammates to captain the 1906 tour. Throughout the tour he was articulate and gracious in victory and defeat, and saw the campaign as an attempt to improve the relationship between his fellow countrymen and the British after the events of the Second Boer War. A devout Christian, Roos was an excellent ambassador for the game and helped promote the South Africans as a fair and exciting sporting team. Rugby career Roos earliest recorded games of rugby were for Victoria College, for whom he played in the third team in 1897, progressing through the squads until by 1899 he was a prominent member of the first team.Platnauer (1907) With no first class team in the area, he joined the Villagers in 1900, before returning to the Stellenbosch University side in 1901. By 1902 Roos was captaining the team, and led the team with great success. By 1903 Roos had been selected for the Western Province team, but was such a devout Christian, he refused to play or travel on a Sunday.Paul Roos – Father of the Boks onthisdayinsport.com This led to Roos refusing to play for the Western Province team in the Currie Cup of 1904 as it would mean he would need to travel on a Sunday. The Western Province captain wrote to a professor at Stellenbosch University, where Roos lectured, to convince Roos to play. Roos' brother, Gideon Roos, followed his older brother playing for both Stellenbosch and Western Province before he himself played international rugby for South Africa.Gideon Roos rugby profile sarugby.co.za Before his first international match Roos faced the 1903 touring British Isles while representing Western Province; the game ending in an impressive 3–3 draw at Newlands.Nominees – 20th century Class of 2009. Candidates for induction into the IRB Hall of Fame IRB Hall of Fame nominees 2009 After his performance for Western Province, Roos was selected to represent the South African national team in 1903 in the final Test against the British Isles. The first two Test matches had both ended in draws, and when the South Africans won, they took their first series against a British team. Vincent Cartwright and Paul Roos before the 1906 East Midlands game In 1906 Roos was part of the first overseas touring South African team. The bulk of the team was made up of Western Province players, who had recently won the Currie Cup. Roos, who was the only player not to have undertaken a trial for the match as he was seen as a certainty for the team,100 years of South African rugby: Part two IRB.com was elected by the rest of the players to be the team captain. After being given the captaincy, Roos addressed the team by stating, \\"I would like to make absolutely clear at the outset we are not English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking, but a band of happy South African\\"; as the tour took place just several years after the end of the Second Boer War, where once team mates had fought on different sides of the conflict. The tour to Britain, Ireland and France took in 29 matches, including Test games against the four Home Nations and a non-Test with the French national team. The tour began with great expectations, as the previous season had seen the Original All Blacks tour Britain with incredible success. The first 15 games were against club and county teams, with the South Africans victorious in every encounter, though they were run close by an extremely strong Glamorgan County team.Billot (1974), pg 27–34. The first international encounter for the team was against Scotland, played in front of a record crowd of 30,000. Roos was forced to miss the game after he injured his collarbone in the encounter with Oxford University,Test Match Countdown irishrugby.ie and the captaincy was handed over to Paddy Carolin; the match ended in the first defeat for the South African's with Scotland scoring two tries in the second half. The Springboks were back on winning form the very next game against the North of Scotland, then travelled to Belfast to face Ireland. Roos lead his team out at the Balmoral Showgrounds in an exciting match. After the first half, Roos men were leading 3–12, but brilliant play from Ireland levelled the scores to 12–12 before a try from the wing settled the game in the South Africans favour. The game against Wales was the most anticipated of the tour. Wales had been unofficially crowned the World's best team after a Triple Crown winning season in 1905 and a win over the All Blacks in the 'Game of the Century'. The Glamorgan team that had run the South Africans close earlier in the tour had contained twelve internationals, and the Welsh were keen for revenge. Despite this, Roos was a popular figure in Wales, and with his deep impressive voiceBillot (1974), pg 12. and \\"pronounced Dutch accent\\",Parry- Jones (1999), pg 187. he had spoken at church meetings throughout the tour; and Roos' cordial manner had paid dividends earlier in the tour after the game against Newport. South Africa beat Newport by a goal and a try to nil, and after the game the two team captains sat down at the Westgate Hotel for a post-match dinner.Billot (1974), pg 21. Roos asked Charlie Pritchard, the Newport skipper, how the Newport forwards, who were lighter than the South Africans, had stolen the ball away so many times in the scrums. The tactic, which the Welsh team had used to counter the famous New Zealand scrum, was discussed with great openness between Pritchard and Roos, and when the South Africans left the next day Roos shook Pritchard's hand at the train station and thanked him.Billot (1974), pg 27. This revelation became a controversial talking point when the Welsh press heard of it. Roos' 1906 touring South Africa team The match against Wales was set for 1 December 1906, and was played at St. Helen's Ground in Swansea. Wales selected a strong team, with Teddy Morgan and Johnnie Williams on the wings, and captained by talismanic three-quarter Gwyn Nicholls, who had come out of retirement to lead the Welsh. Roos started the match with heavy strapping to protect an injured shoulder,Parry-Jones (1999), pg 188. and several of his team were suffering from coughs and sore throats brought on by the British winter weather. Although the Welsh started at a fast pace, the South Africans soon began to launch their own attacks and the firm surface of the St. Helen's pitch played to the Springbok's strengths. Wales under performed throughout the game, and the Springbok tactic to tightly mark Nicholls and Rhys Gabe at centre prevented the pair's normal open game.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 189. South Africa scored three tries without reply, dominating the game 11–0. At the final whistle the South African supporters, assisted by Welsh fans, rushed onto the pitch and carried Roos from the field. Roos later stated that 'he considered it to be the greatest honour of his life to be borne triumphant from the ground by supporters of his beaten opponents'.Billot (1974), pg 42. A week later the South Africans faced England at Crystal Palace and Roos was fit enough to lead his team out against international opposition for the third time. Conditions for the match were poor; the pitch resembled a morass and a drizzle that began half an hour before the kick off continued throughout the game.Griffiths (1982), pg 108. After 20 minutes the ball was extremely difficult to handle and the backs from both teams found themselves unable to interact in the game with any real purpose. The game ended in a 3–3 draw, and Roos took the opportunity after the game to again address the legacy of the Boer War, proclaiming, \\"...this tour will do far more to calm the troubled waters of South African life than years of legislation.\\"Allen, Dean; Tours of Reconciliation: Rugby, War and Reconstruction in South Africa, 1891–1907; pg 12 School of Sports Studies: University of Ulster Although a match against France was planned at the end of the tour, the game was not officially recognised, and the England encounter was Roos' final international game, ending with a record of played four, won three, drawn one. Joint photo of Oxford University and the Springboks, the game in which Roos was injured. As the tour headed towards its end, the South African's took control of the matches once again, beating Lancashire narrowly, but with decisive wins over Cumberland, Surrey and Cornwall. The team then returned to Wales for the last three games of the British leg of their tour. Continuing their impressive form, South Africa beat a Monmouthshire team and then Roos lead his team in a victory over Llanelli.Billot (1974), pg 57. The final game, before leaving for France, was against Cardiff, captained by Percy Bush. Several of the Cardiff players had represented Wales when the teams had met earlier in the tour, and amongst the Cardiff squad was Gwyn Nicholls, who had received much of the blame for the Welsh defeat. The conditions at the Cardiff Arms Park were worse than the England game, and after Roos lost the toss,Parry-Jones (1999), pg 194. the Welsh took advantage of the weather, using the wind to keep the ball behind the South Africans and choosing to dribble rather than handle the ball. The tour appeared to have caught up with the Springboks, who appeared slow, allowing Cardiff to score four tries without reply. For only the second time on the tour, the South Africans had been beaten, this time by a convincing 17–0 scoreline. At the after-match dinner at the Queen's Hotel in Cardiff, Roos stood to make a speech, \\"It is only human to be disappointed in having been beaten... but I am glad for one man's sake that you had such a glorious success, and that is our friend Gwyn Nicholls.\\"Billot (1974), pg 66. The final match of the series was against a France XV, and was played at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 3 January 1907, just two days after the Cardiff defeat. Despite coming from a bad defeat played in sapping conditions, Paul Roos' team beat the French side 55–6. =The Springboks= It was during the tour that the South African national rugby union team's nickname, Springboks, was first used. At an impromptu meeting, the tour manager Cecil Carden, vice-captain Carolin and Paul Roos invented the nickname 'Springbok' to prevent the British press from inventing their own nickname. Roos told the newspaper reporters that they were to call the team 'De Springbokken', the Daily Mail then printed an article referring to the 'Springboks'. The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride in the South Africans. Later life In 1910 he became Rector of the Stellenbosch Boys' High School, formerly Stellenbosch Gymnasium, of which he was a former pupil and teacher. He held this post for thirty years and retired in 1940. In 1941 the name of Stellenbosch Boys' High School was changed to Paul Roos Gymnasium in his honour. He was elected as a National Party member of parliament in 1948. He died on 22 September 1948.

The civilian provider is Airservices Australia, which controls civilian airfields and airspace. The military provider is the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which controls military airfields and adjoining airspace. This includes Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy aviation bases. Some airfields in Australia are categorised as Joint User airfields, where there are both civilian and military operations based at the airfield. Normally, Joint User airfields have air traffic control provided by the RAAF. Air traffic controllers manage the safe and orderly flow of aircraft into, out of, and between airports throughout Australia and with overseas regions adjoining Australian airspace. Australian air traffic controllers are employed under an Air Traffic Control Enterprise Agreement. History Civilian air traffic control developed after WWII when returning servicemen gained employment as both aircrew and ground control. From 1988 to 1995 air traffic control in Australia was the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA was split into two separate government organisations in July 1995: Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Airservices Australia took responsibility for airspace management, aeronautical information, communications, radio navigation aids, airport rescue fire fighting services, and aviation search and rescue, while CASA assumed control of safety regulations, licensing of pilots and aviation engineers, and certification of aircraft and operators. The role of aviation search and rescue was transferred from Airservices Australia to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in 1997. Civilian air traffic control Airservices Australia is a government-owned corporation that provides air traffic control (ATC) services, as well as other related services such as communications, navigation, surveillance, aeronautical data and airfield fire services. ATC services include tower, approach and centre (en route) services. Currently, most Airservices Australia ATC units use The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System. The introduction of the new computerised system increased controllers' productivity. =Towers= Sydney Airport Control Tower Airservices Australia operates from the following air traffic control towers: Major airports *Adelaide Airport (YPAD), SA *Brisbane Airport (YBBN), QLD *Cairns Airport (YBCS), QLD *Canberra Airport (YSCB), ACT *Gold Coast Airport (YBCG), QLD *Hobart Airport (YMHB), TAS *Melbourne Airport (YMML), VIC *Perth Airport (YPPH), WA *Sydney Airport Air Traffic Control Tower (YSSY), NSW Other airports Wagga Wagga Airport Control Tower (Now disused) *Albury Airport (YMAY), NSW *Alice Springs Airport (YBAS), NT *Archerfield Airport (YBAF), QLD *Avalon Airport (YMAV), VIC *Bankstown Airport Air Traffic Control Tower (YSBK), NSW *Broome Airport (YBRM), WA *Camden Airport (YSCN), NSW *Coffs Harbour Airport (), NSW *Essendon Airport (YMEN), VIC *Hamilton Island Airport (YBHM), QLD *Jandakot Airport (YPJT), WA *Karratha Airport (YPKA), WA *Launceston Airport (YMLT), TAS *Mackay Airport (YBMK), QLD *Moorabbin Airport (YMMB), VIC *Parafield Airport (YPPF), SA *Sunshine Coast Airport (YBSU), QLD *Rockhampton Airport (YBRK), QLD *Tamworth Airport (YSTW), NSW  Airports with aerodrome flight information service (AFIS) *Port Hedland Airport (YPPD), WA =Terminal Control Units= Airservices Australia has six terminal control units (TCU). Controllers in a TCU use radar and other surveillance technology to manage the flow of aircraft arriving and departing from major city airports. Airservices provides air traffic control services in an extended area around capital city airports, and maximize the safe use of this airspace. The TCU services are provided around the following major airports: *Adelaide, SA (integrated into Melbourne Centre, as of mid-2017) *Brisbane, QLD (integrated into Brisbane Centre) *Cairns, QLD (integrated into Brisbane Centre, as of mid-2017) *Canberra, ACT (integrated into Melbourne Centre) *Melbourne, VIC (integrated into Melbourne Centre) *Perth, WA (shared facility with Pearce air traffic controllers, located at Perth Airport) *Sydney, NSW (located at Sydney Airport) =Area control centres= Airservices Australia manages 11 per cent of the world's airspace, including very large portions of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and parts of the Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea. The airspace consists of two flight information regions (FIR), the Brisbane FIR and the Melbourne FIR. Each FIR is managed by its respective Area Control Centre (ACC), which provide en route services. Brisbane Centre The Brisbane FIR consists of New South Wales north of Sydney, all of Queensland, most of the Northern Territory and the northern half of Western Australia. It also contains the Australian Tasman Sea airspace. Due to the nature of the airspace, it controls most international flights in and out of Australia (except Indian Ocean flights), and domestic flights operating to airports within the FIR. As only two of eight capitals are located in the Brisbane FIR, it handles a lesser volume of traffic than Melbourne Centre. However, Sydney is just south of the border of the two FIRs (the Sydney Basin is part of the Melbourne FIR), and thus Brisbane Centre has control of flights arriving or departing in Sydney from the north. Brisbane Centre is located adjacent to Brisbane Tower at Brisbane Airport. It also contains Brisbane Approach and Cairns Approach. Melbourne Centre The Melbourne FIR consists of all other Australian airspace outside the Brisbane FIR. This includes Victoria, Tasmania, southern New South Wales including Sydney, most of South Australia and the southern half of Western Australia. It also contains the Australian Indian and Southern Ocean airspace. Apart from international flights arriving from the Indian Ocean, most international flights will pass through Brisbane Centre first. However, as the FIR contains six of the eight capital cities, a very large portion of domestic flights are controlled from Melbourne Centre. Melbourne Centre is located adjacent to Melbourne Tower at Melbourne Airport. It also contains Melbourne Approach, Canberra Approach and Adelaide Approach. Military air traffic control Like civil air traffic control, the Australian Defence Force provide tower and approach services but do not provide en route services. Although historically each of the three services had its own air traffic controllers, the Royal Australian Air Force exclusively provides air traffic control services to the Australian Defence Force. 44 Wing (44WG) was formed to centrally manage ATC personnel and facilities at 11 defence bases. 44 Wing is an Air Command unit, belonging to the Surveillance and Response Group and is headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, Williamtown, NSW. 44WG is divided into two squadrons; No. 452 Squadron which consists of all ATC units at bases north of the Queensland border, and No. 453 Squadron which consists of ATC units at bases south of the Queensland border. The ATC unit established at each base in known as a flight and belongs to one of the two squadrons. Each flight manages air traffic control services at the base, although is ultimately commanded from HQ452SQN, RAAF Base Darwin or HQ453SQN RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF provides both tower and approach services, and in some cases a limited centre (or en route) service. However, centre services are normally amalgamated with approach control. Two bases, Richmond and Edinburgh, provide only a tower service, given their close proximity to Sydney and Adelaide respectively. Civilian ATC provides approach services to these bases. Tower and approach services are normally located within the control tower or an adjacent building. Unlike civilian ATC, no approach or en route services are provided remotely. Currently, most military ATC units use the Australian Defence Air Traffic System. The RAAF use Airservices Australia's TAAATS systems in Perth to provide approach services to RAAF Base Pearce. =Military ATC units= Royal Australian Air Force RAAF Base Darwin/Darwin International Airport Control Tower *RAAF Base Amberley - 452SQN AMB FLT (Tower and Approach) *RAAF Base Darwin - 452SQN DAR FLT (Tower and Approach) *RAAF Base East Sale - 453SQN ESL FLT (Tower and Approach) *RAAF Base Edinburgh - 453SQN EDN FLT (Tower only) *RAAF Base Pearce - 453SQN PEA FLT (Tower, Approach and Centre) *RAAF Base Richmond - 453SQN RIC FLT (Tower only) *RAAF Base Tindal - 452SQN TDL FLT (Tower and Approach) *RAAF Base Townsville - 452SQN TVL FLT (Tower and Approach) *RAAF Base Williamtown - 453SQN WLM FLT (Tower, Approach and Centre) *RAAF Gingin - (Pearce provides a Tower and Approach service) Royal Australian Navy *HMAS Albatross Naval Air Station Nowra - 453SQN NWA FLT (Tower and Approach) *Jervis Bay Airfield (Nowra provides Approach services only, there is no Tower service) Australian Army *Army Aviation Centre/Army Airfield Oakey - 452SQN OAK FLT (Tower and Approach) Joint User Airfields *Darwin International Airport - (co-located with RAAF Base Darwin) *Townsville International Airport - (co-located with RAAF Base Townsville) See also *List of airports in Australia References Category:Air traffic control in Australia ","title":"Australian air traffic control"},{"id":"3894524","text":"300px Bumthang River (also known as Murchangphy Chhu) is a river in Bhutan.

They are a Central Coast Salish people. Through the years, they were assigned to reservations dominated by other Tribes, for instance, the Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation of Washington and the Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation. They are also enrolled in the Samish Indian Nation, formerly known as the Samish Indian Tribe, which regained federal recognition in 1996.\\"Treaty Rights, Recognition, and Territory.\\" Samish Indian Nation.

History =Pre-Contact with Europeans= The Samish fished in the islands and channels off the coast of Skagit County, Washington.Edson, Lelah Jackson. The Fourth Corner: Highlights From the Early Northwest, Bellingham, WA: Whatcom Museum of History and Art, 1968. The Samish had villages on Samish, Guemes, and Fidalgo Islands, and fished and harvested resources there and in the San Juan Islands. In 1847, Samish had more than 2,000 members. Epidemics of measles, smallpox, and ague, and attacks from Haida and Tsimshian from the north diminished the population to approximately 150 members in one village by 1855, at the time of the signing of the Point Elliott Treaty. After the Treaty, some Samish moved to the Swinomish or Lummi reservations.Microsoft Word - Boldt Decision8.5x11 layout for web.doc =Post-Contact with Europeans= Though 113 Samish were present at the treaty negotiations and signing, no Samish signed the Point Elliott Treaty. The Samish were attached to the treaty by the signature of the Lummi chief Chow-its-hoot. Lacking a reservation of their own, many Samish were sent to live on the reservations of the Lummi or the Swinomish. However, many Samish refused to go to the reservations and stayed in their traditional territory. They were often confused with the Skagit, and when they went to the Swinomish Reservation, they received only six household land allotments for the entire Tribe. Many members went to Guemes Island to establish New Guemes (now referred to as \\"Potlatch Beach\\"), where they built a longhouse that housed more than 100 people. By 1912, the Samish had either moved onto the Swinomish Reservation or into other communities. They had been pushed off the island by white settlers, as the Samish had occupied the land with the only fresh water. In 1926, a formal constitution was written by the Samish. They later altered it, but included a plan for electoral government. In 1971, in settlement of their land claim against the federal government, the Tribe was awarded US$5,754.96 for lands taken by the Point Elliott Treaty. The judgment deemed that they had exclusively occupied of land at the time of the treaty. In 1996, the Samish were officially re-recognized by the U.S. government. In 1998, they changed their official name to the Samish Indian Nation. Language The Samish language is a dialect of the Northern Straits Salish (Lkungen) language; a close sister language is Southern Straits Salish (Clallam or Klallam. Both are in the Central Coast Salish branch of Coast Salish, itself a branch of the large Salish(an) language family (Tim Montler 1999: \\"Language and dialect variation in Straits Salishan\\".

She competed in Miss Mexico 1952 where she came in 4th place. Life and career Derbez was born in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, the daughter of Maria de la Luz Amézquita and French-born businessman Marcel Derbez Gilly. She debuted in Mexican film as a teenager, participating in her first movie at the age of 15, when she acted in La Novia del Mar (Girlfriend of the Sea), filmed in 1947. In 1948, she participated in a classic of Mexican cinema: Allá en el Rancho Grande (Out on the Big Ranch). She was in three more movies before the decade of the 1940s had ended, including the classic cabaretera film noir Salón México. Derbez became a celebrity, both nationally and internationally, during the 1950s, an era in which she recorded sixteen films. Between 1951 and 1954, Derbez retired from filming, but she was in ten movies from 1954 to 1956. With television becoming popular in Mexico, Derbez was signed by Televisa to play \\"Nora\\" in the 1958 soap opera, Senda prohibida (Forbidden Way). In 1959, Derbez got the title role in another soap opera, Elisa. Derbez acted in seventeen telenovelas during the 1960s, many of them in which she starred. Among the soap operas she made during that decade was Maria Isabel I, where she once again played the title role. She returned to cinema in 1969, participating in three movies between then and 1970. During the 1970s, her work rate on television slowed slightly. She made twelve telenovelas during that time. Among the telenovelas that she participated in was 1970's Angelitos negros (Black Angels), as a nanny. She also acted in 1971's El derecho de los hijos (Your Children's Rights) and La Recogida (which loosely translates to The Picked up Woman). In 1975, she acted in a movie, El Andariego (The Walker). As Derbez began to age, her work rate numbers began to decline, and during the 1980s, she acted in only six telenovelas and four movies. In 1986, her husband, Eugenio González, a publicist, died. Nevertheless, Derbez recovered from that personal loss and participated in one of Latin America's most famed telenovelas of all time, Simplemente Maria, in 1989. In Simplemente Maria, Derbez acted alongside Victoria Ruffo, who would soon become her daughter in law. Simplemente Maria's 1989 version was popular in countries such as Puerto Rico and Venezuela. During the 1990s, Derbez's son Eugenio Derbez became famous as a television comedian. He and Ruffo got married. Derbez made three movies during the early 1990s, including 1993's Zapatos Viejos (Old Shoes), where she acted alongside singer Gloria Trevi. In 1994, Derbez was in Prisionera de Amor (Prisoner of Love), and in 1995, she played \\"Milagros\\" in Lazos de Amor. Those two soap operas became popular among Hispanic viewers in the United States. Derbez once again returned to cinema acting after Prisionera de Amor and Lazos de Amor, acting in three movies before returning to television as \\"Leonor\\" in Los hijos de nadie (Nobody's Children). In 1998, she participated in another highly acclaimed Mexican telenovela, La usurpadora (The supplanter), which starred Gabriela Spanic. Derbez's last work as an actress came in 2001's version of Caridad Bravo Adams' La intrusa (The Intruder).

Early life Alsop was born in Frampton Cotterell, Gloucestershire to Arthur George Alsop, a coal miner, and Florence Caroline Alsop (née Thornell). He had three older siblings; Frederick, Hilda and Arthur. After leaving school, he signed for local amateur side Latteridge for a time, before signing for Southern League Bath City in August 1927. Professional career In December 1929 he moved to Football League Third Division South side Coventry City on professional terms. He spent two seasons with the Sky Blues but failed to gain a regular starting place, making only 16 league appearances and scoring four times. He started the first of two very successful spells at Walsall in September 1931, scoring on his debut in a 2–0 win over Doncaster Rovers. He went on to score 15 times in his first season with the Saddlers. In January 1933 he scored the opening goal in Walsall's 2–0 win over Herbert Chapman's Arsenal in the FA Cup. A result still regarded as one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all-time. After a remarkable scoring return of 40 goals in all competitions in 1933–34 and 48 goals in all competitions in 1934–35, Alsop attracted the attention of clubs further up the league and moved to First Division West Bromwich Albion in November 1935. However, Alsop found his first team opportunities were severely limited by the form of W. G. Richardson and Harry Jones, managing only one league appearance for the club in his two seasons at The Hawthorns. Alsop signed for Ipswich Town in May 1937 and scored 30 goals in 39 senior matches in the Southern League and the Third Division South. He scored in Ipswich's first ever match in the Football League – a 4–2 victory over Southend United in August 1938. He returned to Walsall in October 1938 and, despite the outbreak of war, made a further 106 appearances and continued his prolific goalscoring form for the midlands side. He played his last full season at Fellows Park as player-coach to Walsall's third team in 1947–48, before eventually retiring in May 1948. In all competitions, Alsop played 324 times for Walsall and scored 226 goals. Later life Alsop worked behind the scenes at Fellows Park for a further 20 years or so after retiring and later became groundsman of the playing fields adjoining Walsall Arboretum. He was still attending home games at Bescot Stadium, right up to his death in April 1992 at the age of 83.

History Formed by childhood friends Koroshec and Kelly, the band was signed to Risk Records in 1997 and released an EP, Suicide at Strell Park, and album, The Angel Pool, the same year. The Angel Pool brought the band to the attention of the Cocteau Twins' Simon Raymonde and they decamped to London to record their second album In the Russet Gold of This Vain Hour with Raymonde at the controls. ...Russet Gold looked set to break the band to a wider audience, drawing interest from MTV and influential Los Angeles based radio station KROQ, but shortly after its release Risk collapsed and the band found themselves without a label. This was not a situation that bothered the group much (indeed Koroshec later stated, \\"It was for the best. That level of attention made us uncomfortable. And it wasn't the record to blow up. We were still searching and experimenting\\" ). In the following years The Autumns released a four-song recording of 1950s inspired love songs on pink vinyl (Le Carillon (EP)) and the covers EP Covers and also scored the film Searching for Angela Shelton, revelling in the artistic freedom that being unsigned provided. The band released their self-titled third album in 2004 on Pseudopod Records in America and Bella Union in the UK. The album was lauded extensively in the European press, receiving four-star reviews in The Times, MOJO, and 8/10 in NME. The band's fourth album, Fake Noise From a Box of Toys, was released by Bella Union in 2007. Lead singer Matthew Kelly also had guest vocals and guitar for The Sound of Animals Fighting and contributed to 2006's Lover, the Lord Has Left Us... and 2008's The Ocean and The Sun. Kelly and Koroshec contributed lyrics to the first volume of the Warner Books compendium, Revolution on Canvas. Kelly and Elkins contributed short stories to Revolution on Canvas 2. The Autumns disbanded quietly in 2008. The official website remained online until April 2013. In 2014, Matthew Kelly confirmed the end, stating they are done with that part of their lives but remain friends.

Punakha was the capital of Bhutan and the seat of government until 1955, when the capital was moved to Thimphu. It is about 72 km away from Thimphu, and it takes about 3 hours by car from the capital, Thimphu. Unlike Thimphu, it is quite warm in winter and hot in summer. It is located at an elevation of 1,200 metres above sea level, and rice is grown as the main crop along the river valleys of two main rivers of Bhutan, the Pho Chu and Mo Chu. Dzongkha is widely spoken in this district.  Pungthang Dewachen Gi Phodrang  Pungthang Dewachen Gi Phodrang in Punakha and jacarandas Pungthang Dewachen Phodrang (Palace of Great Happiness) or Punakha Dzong was constructed by Tuebi Zaow Balip under the great command of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in 1637 and believed to have been completed in a two year time period. It is also the country's most beautiful Dzong. It is the winter residence of Bhutan's Central Monastic Body led by the Je Khenpo. The Dzong houses the most sacred relics of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu school including the Rangjung Kasarpani, and the sacred remains of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal and Tertön Padma Lingpa. Punakha Dzong. In 1907, Punakha Dzong was the site of the coronation of Ugyen Wangchuck as the first King of Bhutan. Three years later, a treaty was signed at Punakha whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. In 1987, the dzong was partially destroyed by fire. Due to its location at the confluence of the Pho Chhu and Mo Chhu rivers in the Punakha-Wangdue valley, the dzong is vulnerable to flash flooding caused by glacier lakes (GLOF). According to a recent report, flash flood damage to Punakha Dzong occurred in 1957, 1960 and 1994. Currently (March 2010) work is in progress to protect the dzong from future flood damage by deepening the river channels and raising the embankments using four large steam shovels. A covered wooden cantilever bridge crossing the Mo Chhu river was built together with the Dzong in the 17th century. This bridge was washed away by a flash flood in 1957 or 1958. In 2006 work started on a new covered wooden cantilever bridge of traditional construction with a free span of 55 meters which was completed in 2008 with the help from the Germans.  Ritsha Village  Punakha valley is famous in Bhutan for rice farming. Both red and white rice are grown along the river valley of Pho and Mo Chu, two of the most prominent rivers in Bhutan. Ritsha (meaning at the base of a hill) is a typical village in Punakha. The village houses are made of pounded mud with stone foundations. Each house is only two stories high. Surrounding the houses are the gardens and the rice fields. The gardens also usually have fruit-bearing plants like oranges and papaya among the organic vegetables. The village is 1 km away from Punakha-Gasa high-way and currently, the villagers are engaged in constructing the 1 km farm road. In recent years, the farming work is mechanized and power- tillers instead of bullocks are used to plough the fields and villagers have become relatively prosperous. This village is often called the ‘rice bowl’ of Bhutan due to abundance of red and white rice.

He served over 20 years on the council for Hastings County and was warden for the county in 1873. His business had expanded from the sale of goods into the harvesting and sale of timber and the operation of warehouses and wharfs for storing and transporting goods. He also established towns along the Skootamatta River, with mills and factories, at Troy (later Actinolite) and Flint's Mills (now Flinton). He purchased mills at York Mills, later named Bancroft after his wife's mother's maiden name. Her name was Elizabeth Ann Clement (née Bancroft). He also helped promote steamships on Lake Ontario and railway links in the region. Although forceful and opinionated, he also donated land for schools and churches.

It was released during the birth centenary year of Sukumar Ray, who was born on 30 October 1887. The thirty minutes documentary features the life and some of the works by Sukumar Ray in the form of paintings, photographs and readings. This is the last documentary made by Satyajit Ray as a tribute to his father, before he died in 1992. The documentary used Sukumar Ray's photographs and paintings than video recording as the film was considerably a new medium in India when Sukumar Ray died in 1923. Background Sukumar Ray was a Bengali humorous poet, story writer and playwright who mainly wrote for children. Born in Bengali family on 30 October 1887 to Bidhumukhi and Upendrakishore Ray, Ray is a second children of six and illustrator of literary nonsense and nonsense rhyme in Bengali literature. Graduated with Honours degree in Physics and Chemistry from the Presidency College, Kolkata, Ray got training in photography and printing technology in England at the School of Photo-Engraving and Lithography, London. He formed the \\"Nonsense Club\\" and the \\"Monday Club\\", the members of which included some of the young artists, writers, scholars and critics of that time. Ray was also associated with Brahmo Samaj and wrote a poem called \\"Atiter Katha\\" for young readers. His works such as the collection of poems Abol Tabol (Gibberish), novella HaJaBaRaLa (The Absurdity), short story collection Pagla Dashu (Crazy Dashu) and play Chalachitta Chanchari are considered nonsense masterpieces. Father of film-maker Satyajit Ray, Sukumar Ray died of severe infectious fever, Leishmaniasis on 10 September 1923. Synopsis With Soumitra Chatterjee as a narrator, the documentary begins by showcasing some of the drawings by Sukumar Ray, drawn for the children books Abol Tabol, HaJaBaRaLa and a short story, Heshoram Hushiarer Diary (The Diary of Heshoram: The Clever). Explaining the lineage of Ray family starting from Hari Krishna Roy Chowdhury and Upendrakishore Ray, the documentary describes initial days of Sukumar Ray, his formation of the \\"Nonsense Group\\" in the college and publication of handwritten humorous magazine, \\"Thirty Two and a Half Fries\\". Utpal Dutt enacts as a teacher from Ray's first published poetical \\"nonsense\\"-play Jhala Pala (The Cacophony) and provides humorous explanation/translation of the sentence \\"I go up, we go down\\" in Bengali. Soumitra Chatterjee appears as Rama, the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, in a spoof based on an Indian epic Ramayana, Lakshmaner Shaktishel (The magical spear of Lakshmana). The spoof is based on Rama's dream about the central antagonist of the Ramayana, the demon-king Ravana and the spy (Tapen Chatterjee) providing further information about it. The documentary also focusses on Ray's college days in London while studying photography, lithography and his meeting with Nobel Prize–winning littérateur, Rabindranath Tagore. While narrating his first poem Khichudi (The mixture) published in children's magazine, Sandesh, launched by his father, the documentary explains how entire Ray family worked together for the growth of the magazine after the death of Upendrakishore Ray. Mentioning his association with Brahmo Samaj, the documentary ends with Sukumar Ray's terminal disease and his death on 10 September 1923.

Abdul Razak was born in Meiktila, Upper Burma, on 20 January 1898 to Sheik Abdul Rahman, an Indian police inspector and a Burmese Buddhist woman Nyein Hla. While his brothers and sisters chose to be Buddhists, he maintained the Muslim name Razak, in honor of his father. Although nominally Muslim, Razak was a secularist who deeply loved Burma and encouraged unity in diversity. He studied at the Wesleyan School in Mandalay, and continued his studies at the Rangoon College, earning a B.A. degree in English. Throughout his school years, Razak was involved in athletics. In 1920, Razak was a leader in organizing the first Burmese student boycott to the British colonial education system. In 1921, he became headmaster of Mandalay National High School. Razak's natural charisma was effective in persuading the Mandalayans. Mandalay, where he taught, was a center of Burmese Buddhist faith and culture. Yet Razak, of ethnic Indian-Burmese origin, was fully accepted by the community.http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=1107 When Japan invaded Burma in World War II, he was imprisoned. In 1945, Abdul Razak was named chairman of the Mandalay branch of Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) and was elected a Member of Parliament to represent Mandalay. He was Minister of Education and National Planning in Aung San's cabinet. He died on 19 July 1947 together with six other cabinet members. Razak initiated calls for unity between Burmese Muslims and Buddhists. He was a Muslim, but maintained ties to Buddhism, educating himself on Pali, the sacred script of Theravada Buddhism, and helped found the Mandalay College (modern Mandalay University). Razak fathered three children. References *Burmese Encyclopedia, Vol. 11, p. 73 printed in 1970.

They produced a number of small intros and demos in the mid-1990s for the PC, most notably CounterFactual (winner of the first Greek demo party ever, The Gardening 1995) and Beyond (Placed 4th in The Gardening 1996). ASD was quiet for the following years until 2001, when they presented Cadence & Cascade - their first accelerated demo - and won the Digital Nexus demoparty, held in Athens, Greece. From 2002 onwards, ASD started participating in major demoscene competitions, eventually winning the Assembly 2005 demo competition with Iconoclast. ASD is not associated with the Norwegian demo group Andromeda, however, ASD collaborated with Archmage of Andromeda for the production of their 2007 Assembly demo competition winner Lifeforce.  Style  In the accelerated era, ASD established themselves as a demogroup with an extremely distinctive style. Visually, their demos featured dynamic coherent flows of abstract visual elements subtly blending into each other in various unexpected ways, often to the point where the viewer wouldn't be able to distinguish the start- and endpoints of an effect. This led to many debates considering the demos, some viewers praise this type of design, while others consider this an unnecessary amalgam of otherwise unrelated visual effects. The two musicians of the group (aMUSiC and Leviathan, from Dreamchild) venture into the territory of progressive metal, akin to commercial bands such as Dream Theater or Liquid Tension Experiment. Their songs often feature live instruments, variating tempo and time signatures, constantly changing musical textures and a showcase of remarkable proficiency by the two composers.

N. Roy (11 December 1906 – 23 July 1964) was an Indian-born American mathematician and an applied statistician. Early life Roy was the first of three children of Kali Nath Roy and Suniti Bala Roy. His father, Kali Nath Roy was a freedom fighter and the Chief Editor of the newspaper The Tribune, then publishing from Lahore. During the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in April 1919, The Tribune published a news report titled \\"Prayer at the Jama Masjid\\", on 6 April 1919. For this \\"offence\\" Kali Nath Roy was sentenced to imprisonment of two years along with a fine of one thousand rupees. Roy secured first division in the Matriculation Examination in 1923 from the Khulna District School. He was the topper in the Intermediate Science (Higher Secondary) Examinations in 1925 from the Daulatpur Hindu Academy. He obtained first class and was the topper in both the BSc Mathematics (Honours) from Presidency College of the University of Calcutta in 1928 and the MSc in Mixed Mathematics - which later was renamed to Applied Mathematics - (with The Theory of Relativity as the elective) from the renowned Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta in 1931. Academic career In 1931, when Roy joined the Department of Applied Mathematics of Rajabazar Science College at the University of Calcutta as a research associate, he used computing facilities at the newly established Indian Statistical Institute, which was founded by Professor P. C. Mahalanobis. Roy along with several talented young scholars including J. M. Sengupta, H. C. Sinha, Raj Chandra Bose, K. R. Nair, K. Kishen and C. R. Rao, joined to form an active group of statisticians under Mahalanobis. Roy was one of the very early students of Mahalanobis, who initiated some of the early works in Statistics. He was well known for his pioneering contribution to multivariate statistical analysis, mainly that of the Jacobians of complicated transformations for various exact distributions, rectangular coordinates and the Bartlett decomposition. His dissertation included the Post master's work at the Indian Statistical Institute where he worked under Mahalanobis. It was Bose who first went to the United States as a visiting professor at Columbia University and then joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1947. Roy followed suit by later joining him at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the spring of 1950, after initially travelling to the United States to take up a Visiting Professorship of Statistics at Columbia University in New York in the spring of 1949. In between this Roy returned to India and became Head of the Department of Statistics at the University of Calcutta during the academic year 1949–50. Roy joined Bose as full Professor of Statistics in the Statistics Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. S. N. Roy had 15 doctorate students there from 1950 till 1963. To commemorate his Birth Centenary an International Conference on \\"Multivariate Statistical Methods in the 21st Century: The Legacy of Prof. S.N. Roy\\" was held at Kolkata, India during 28–29 December 2006. The Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference published a special issue for celebrating the Centennial of Birth of S. N. Roy. Personal life Roy was married to Bani Roy and had four children, Prabir, Subir, Tapon and Sunanda. He died while on holiday in Jasper, Canada. Selected publications * Potthoff, R. F. and Roy, S. N.

The origins  From 1948 until the end of the régime, unauthorized migration from Czechoslovakia was a crime. Between 1945 and 1987 172,659 people went into exile. After the Helsinki Accords, the Communist establishment wished to show some kind of mitigation of the thus far harsh attitude towards émigrés. Directive No. 4/1977 Official Journal of the Czech Socialist Republic, On Reconciliation Legal Relationships of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to Citizens Who Stay Abroad Without a Permit of Czechoslovak Authorities, was adopted. Hence the term \\"upravenec\\".  Categories  In 1980 there were 115,000 émigrés. Directives stipulated two categories of reconcilees: # those who wished to stay permanently abroad as citizens of Czechoslovakia (art. 3–5; 3,145 persons applied), or # those who wished cessation of citizenship of Czechoslovakia (art. 6–8; 4,533 applied). A prerequisite to receive a status of upravenec was an application for a pardon of conviction for illegal emigration (12,486 applied) or being amnestied. Applicants had to pay large sums (officially the cost of education) and after reconciliation were allowed to visit Communist Czechoslovakia with no obstacles. Those who wished to return to Czechoslovakia (art. 2 — first category; 452 persons applied) were called \\"navrátilci\\" (returnees). Directives also identified a further category of émigrés — enemies of the Communist régime (art. 9–12). These were deprived of Czechoslovak citizenship and prohibited from visiting Czechoslovakia. (They thus could not be ranked among returnees or reconcilees.)  Controversy  The unsuspendable condition for reconciliation was \\"good or neutral relationship\\" towards the Communist régime. Upravenci were therefore disliked by much of the rest of the exile community and called collaborators. Most reconcilees hid their reconciliation, and speculative accusation of being a upravenec was considered a slur. The famous Czech author Josef Škvorecký wrote satiric short stories about them. Hard-line émigrés speculated that upravenci were confidants of the Communist secret police.

It was ultimately not pursued as the British government chose to proceed with involvement in the American Joint Strike Fighter program instead, which ultimately led to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The design study was associated with the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) initiative, which was ultimately discontinued. A key attribute of the conceptualised aircraft was the integration of low observability features, which were intended to achieve a balance between reduced detectability and overall affordability. As part of the study, a full size model of the aircraft was constructed and was subjected to a rigorous test regime to determine its radar cross section. During early 2003, the existence of the Replica programme was revealed to the general public. According to reports, the Replica project is known to have been worked on from 1994 to 1999. It is widely believed that Replica may have been once intended to replace the RAF's Panavia Tornado fleet from 2017 onwards. Experience and data acquired through the program was later rolled into the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, while technologies from Replica have reportedly played a role in the development of other aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)s... Development =Background= During the 1980s and 1990s, various nations developed an interest in the development of a new generation of aircraft that incorporated stealth features. Considering its long term requirements and future inventory, during the 1990s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) launched the Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) programme, which sought to study various options for performing its missions, including unconventional methods along with concepts of both manned combat aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. British defense manufacturer BAE Systems, having taken an interest in the fledgling FOAS effort and keen to develop its technical experience in a relatively new field of military technology, quickly elected to participate. The company decided to embark upon a design study, conceptualising a stealthy strike aircraft, which came to be known by the name Replica. In concept, it is known that Replica had not been designed with the intention of achieving equivalent detection difficulty as some of the more exotic (and extremely expensive) advanced stealth aircraft that had been produced by that point, such as the American-built Lockheed F-117 Nighthawks strike aircraft and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit strategic bomber. According to international science publication New Scientist, British stealth specialists have stated of the programme that Replica's visibility characteristics had achieved the envisioned target, which involved a balance between low observability and overall affordability. It also demonstrated British expertise in the complex world of stealth technology. The Replica programme was received with official approval and backing, funding for proceeding with development work was provided by the Ministry of Defence, as well as self-invested by BAE Systems itself. During 2003, the reported overall cost of the programme was stated to have been £20 million. During its active years, the Replica programme was carried out under high levels of secrecy; its existence was unknown to the general public until the early 2000s. =Model and reveal= During the mid-1990s, development work on the project had proceeded so far as to prompt the company to commence construction of a full- scale model of the aircraft. According to press reports, this model was completed during 1999, by which point the Replica programme had been operational for five years. According to comments issued by BAE Systems, Replica was subject to a \\"rigorous test programme\\". One of the known aims of these tests was to acquire relevant data from which to evaluate the aircraft's radar cross section, which was deemed to have been a key component of its low observability characteristics. It is known that one major contributing factor to the overall radar signature of an airframe is the level of precision involved in both the fabrication and assembly of its components and sections into a finished aircraft. Any edges or gaps, which are prone to generating strong radar reflections, are to be typically avoided wherever possible. Replica's designers chose to approach this issue by producing a virtual model of the aircraft using computer-aided design (CAD) tools from which data was transferred directly to high precision computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems to produce components in the real world. This approach is known to have been used in the manufacture of the composite panels (composed of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer) which were used for the skin of the aircraft. Assembly methods employed the use of laser projector, which aided in the correct alignment of these panels. During early 2003, the existence of the previously secretive Replica programme was revealed to the public. This announcement on Britain’s stealth plane was made in the form of a brief statement, which was accompanied by a single photograph of the aircraft mock- up which had been declassified. Details on the purpose and specifics of the design's attributes have remained relatively scant, it is not known whether measures to minimise its infra-red, acoustic or visual signatures were used or of their effectiveness. At the time of the reveal, New Scientist speculated that technology derived from Replica would likely play a role in the development of future aircraft, potentially including both of the manned and unmanned concept aircraft which had been under consideration under the then- ongoing FOAS programme, which was seeking a replacement for the RAF's aging fleet of Panavia Tornado GR4 strike aircraft around 2017. =Further development= During February 2014, the testbed model of Replica was seen being transported around the BAE Warton test facility in Lancashire, England. During the brief 2014 sighting, the aircraft was sporting a new low-visibility coating and minor structural changes and was upside down on a platform being taken into an enclosed hangar. According to journalists, these changes were believed to be most likely to be related to the in-development unmanned Taranis aircraft, aiding in the further refinement of its design and supporting the development of new stealth coatings for the Anglo-Franco Future Combat Air System (FCAS). As of March 2014, the Replica testbed is back on its radar testing plinth at BAE Warton but now in its new paint scheme.. According to an article published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, Replica, representing a domestically developed stealth fighter and serving to showcase both Britain and BAE Systems' expertise in developing low observability technologies, had functioned as \\"Britain’s entry ticket to JSF at the highest level\\". It was alleged in this same article that the aircraft had been pursued as an insurance measure if collaboration in the American-led JSF programme had turned sour. In the aftermath of Replica, BAE Systems has participated in multiple programmes involving low observability, including participation on the F-35 and various UAV programmes, such as the Taranis UCAV demonstrator.Robinson, Tim. \\"Turkey’s TF-X fighter throws a lifeline to UK military aerospace.\\" Royal Aeronautical Society, 7 February 2017. Design The BAE Systems Replica was a studied twin-seat strike fighter. It was equipped with various stealth features, such as the adoption of a V-tail arrangement, to reduce the aircraft's radar cross-section, as well as its weight. Externally, the airframe resembled the American Northrop YF-23 prototype stealth fighter, as well as the jointly-developed BAE Systems/McDonnell Douglas/Northrop Grumman proposal that was submitted for the United States Air Force (USAF) Advanced Tactical Fighter (AFT), although Replica was developed independently of either of these aircraft.. To fulfill the stringent requirements of the FOAS programme, Replica is believed to have been designed with provisions to accommodate an internal weapons bay, capable of carrying both ASRAAM air-to-air missiles for self-defence purposes and a number of laser-guided bombs within the 2, 000 lb range..  Tempest  At the 2018 Farnborough Air Show, BAE Systems unveiled a mock-up of a proposed future combat aircraft, named Tempest. The mock-up bore a strong resemblance to the Replica test model.

He undertook further study through the Technical Correspondence Institute, Wellington, and the University of Auckland, gaining a Diploma of Town Planning, and eventually becoming a town planning consultant and registered surveyor. In 1961, Curtis married Miriam Ann Brook, and the couple went on to have three children. Career Curtis was first elected as a Manukau City councillor in 1968, three years after Manukau City was formed and was re-elected in 1971, 1974, 1977 and 1980. He was also elected in 1971 to the Auckland Regional Authority, the predecessor of the Auckland Regional Council and was re-elected in 1974, 1977, 1980 and 1983. From 1977 to 1983 he was chairman of the Authority's regional planning committee. In 1974, Curtis challenged Gavin Downie for the National Party nomination for the seat of Pakuranga after many local party members became dissatisfied with Downie's performance. He was unsuccessful in his challenge, but was persuaded to stand for the seat at the 1975 general election as an independent candidate. Curtis placed a distant fifth out of seven candidates with 356 votes (1.46% of the vote). Downie was re-elected. Curtis was elected Mayor of Manukau City in 1983, and was re-elected in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004. He stood down in October 2007 at the triennial elections, after 39 years of continuous service to the people of Manukau and the Auckland Region.

In 1814 he succeeded his father in the Lordship of Belhaven and Stenton. Career Hamilton sat on the Whig benches in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1819 and 1832. The latter year he was created Baron Hamilton of Wishaw, in the County of Lanark, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Hamilton also served as High Commissioner to the General Assembly and Kirk from 1831 to 1841, from 1847 to 1851, again from 1853 to 1857 and a last time from 1860 to 1866.

He was a member of Banu Alahrar (Sons of the free people), a Yemeni of Persian origin. He is counted among the Tabi‘in and a narrator of Isra'iliyat. Biography Wahb's father, Munabbih ibn Kamil, had been a convert to Islam and a companion of Muhammad. Wahb himself had turned from Judaism to Islam, according to Al-Tibr al-Masluk (ed. 1306 A.H., p. 41). Other biographers such as Al-Nawawi and Ibn Khallikan, did not write that he was Jewish. The fact that he was well versed in the Isra'iliyyat, on which he wrote much, probably gave rise to the statement that he was Jewish, although he might have acquired his knowledge from his teacher Ibn 'Abbas. Wahb was made a judge during the reign of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz.http://www.ghazali.org/articles/personalist.htm, referencing Tahdhib al-Tahdhib, XI. 166; Ab Nu‘aym, IV. 23-82; Mash…h†r, 122-3. He died at the age of ninety, in a year variously given by Arabic authorities as 725, 728, 732, and 737 CE, or at 110 AH in San'aa in the beginning of the Caliphate of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. It is also said that he died 114 AH. Yaqut agreed with the latter in his book, Mu’jamul-Udabaa. His full name is given as \\"Abu 'Abd Allah al-Ṣana'ani al-Dhimari\\", or \\"Wahb ibn Munabbih ibn Kamil ibn Sirajud-Din Dhee Kibaar Abu-Abdullah al-Yamani al-San'ani\\" . =Family= On his father's side he was descended from Persian knights, known as al-Abna', while his mother was a Himyarite. Wahb also had a brother named Hammam ibn Munabbih, who is reported to have written 138 Hadiths in his Sahifa.Hadith Book - Section Two Legacy Wahb is said to have read more than seventy books on the prophets, and he was an extremely prolific narrator (\\"rawi\\") of stories regarding Mohammed and Biblical personages. He had a son named Abdallah al-Abnawi. =Works= Among Wahb's many writings may be mentioned his \\"Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiya'\\" (\\"Story of the Prophets\\") and \\"Kitab al-Isra'iliyat\\" (\\"Book of the Israelites,\\" \\"Ḥajji Khalfa,\\" iv. 518, v. 40). The former, which is believed to be his earliest literary work, is, as its title indicates, a collection of narratives concerning Biblical personages, the accounts being drawn from Jewish folk-lore though presented in Islamitic guise. Thus, like Ibn 'Abbas and Ka'b al-Aḥbar, he was an authority for many legends narrated by Al-Ṭabari, Mas'udi, and others. The \\"Kitab al-Isra'iliyat,\\" or \\"Book of Jewish Matters,\\" is lost, but was apparently a collection of Jewish stories, many of them incorporated by a Jewish compiler into the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" In the latter collection there are indeed many stories that bear the Jewish stamp, and some of them, such as the \\"Angel of Death,\\" are ascribed to Wahb by the author of \\"Al-Tibr al-Masluk.\\" There are also other stories which are attributed to Wahb, and many more which, from their Jewish character, may be traced to him. His Jewish learning may be illustrated by his opinion of the Shekinah (Arabic, \\"Sakinah\\") as stated by different Arabic authors. According to Al-Baghawi in his \\"Ma'alim al-Tanzil\\" (Ignác Goldziher, \\"Abhandlungen zur Arabischen Philologie,\\" i. 182, Leyden, 1896), Wahb believed that the Shekinah was the spirit of God. On the other hand, Al-ḥabari (\\"Annals,\\" i. 544), in recording the fact that the Israelites sometimes took the Ark of the Covenant into battle when they were at war with their enemies (comp. I Sam. iv. 4 et seq.), quotes Wahb as saying in the name of a certain Jewish authority that the Shekinah which rested in the Ark was a being in the shape of a cat, and that when the Israelites heard the mewing of cats coming from the interior of the Ark, they were sure of a victory. Hadith He narrated hadith from: *Anas ibn Malik *Jabir ibn Abd-Allah *\`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas *Abd-Allah ibn Umar *Abu Hurairah *Abu-Sa'id al-Khudri *Tawoos ibn Kaysaan *Amr ibn Dinar *Amr ibn Shayb *Hammam ibn Munabbih *others =Students and intellectual heirs= F. Perles, in a series of papers contributed to \\"Monatsschrift\\" (xxii.), has pointed out that several of the stories of the \\"Arabian Nights\\"—mainly those taken from the Cairene additions—deal with Jewish topics or are derived from Jewish sources. V. Chauvin, in a special treatise on the Egyptian recension of \\"One Thousand and One Nights\\" (Brussels, 1899), has suggested that these Jewish tales and others were introduced by one of the last redactors, a converted Jew, probably the author of the \\"Story of a Man of Jerusalem,\\" sometimes attributed to Abraham, son of Maimonides. The Jew-ish tales themselves are probably extracted from a work of a Jewish convert to Islam, Wahb ibn Munabbih (638-738), entitled \\"Jewish Matters.\\" Jewish Encyclopedia The following are the tales of the \\"Arabian Nights\\" that appear from several investigations to be from Jewish sources.

It is known that Wahb and Ka'b al-Ahbar taught Tafsir their fellow Muslims. Scholars like Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud had warned people not to learn the Tafsir from the People of the Book, arguing that they used to interpolate their own biblical beliefs, teachings and history with the Islamic creeds and preaching., referencing Dr. Muhammad Husayn al-Dhahabi, in his book, Al-Tafsir wal-Mufassirun, Volume 1, Published by Dar al-Qalam, Beirut Ahmad ibn Hanbal said \\"he was a man of Persian descent\\" and also \\"Anyone from Yemen and has a 'Dhee' in his name, then his lineage is noble.

It was planned as a permanent Royal Ordnance Factory with the intention that it, unlike some other similar facilities, would remain open for production after the end of World War II; and, together with ROF Bridgend (Filling Factory No. 2), would replace the Royal Filling Factory located at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. It was built adjacent to the village of Euxton, but was known as ROF Chorley. After the privatisation of the Royal Ordnance Factories in the 1980s it became part of the Ammunition Division of Royal Ordnance plc and later a production unit of BAE Systems Global Combat Systems Munitions. Chorley factory closed in 2005-07 and the majority of the site is now home to the new Buckshaw Village on the outskirts of Chorley, although many remnants remain. The factory had a storage depot built deep into the Pennine hills, over Chorley, in the village of Heapey; the facility was used until closure in 2009 although its exact usage was not revealed.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/text/51109w29.htmhttps://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-11-15b.28156.h Early history In the late 1930s leading up to the outbreak of war in 1939, the British government developed a strategy to enhance the capacity of the existing three Royal factories and to disperse armaments and munitions production away from major cities and the southeast part of England which were felt to be especially vulnerable to bombing from the air. As a result, the Ministry of Supply built a number of Royal Ordnance Factories and satellite factories. ROF Chorley and ROF Bridgend were the two largest filling factories, but even before they were both finished it was realised that they would not have the necessary capacity to meet Britain's and the British Commonwealth's needs for ammunition. In all some 20 Government-owned World War II Filling Factories were built, but none was so large or employed as many people as these two. Safety considerations were paramount. The design, style and spacing of individual production buildings meant that they were separated by wide-open spaces, or, depending on the application, approximately 20 feet (6 m) high grassed embankments and extremely thick reinforced concrete walls and overbridges, called traverses. The purpose of the traverse was to deflect any explosion skyward rather than outward to any adjacent buildings or structures. The site was built with extensive underground magazines, comprehensive lightning protection and individual buildings linked by paths, roads and railways. The site Site of the ROF railway station, 2005. The old administration buildings are on the right and the site of the factory is on the left The site, which was built between Euxton and the town of Leyland, had a 9 mile (approximately 14.5 kilometer ) perimeter fence which until privatisation was guarded by was to become the Ministry of Defence Police (MOD Police) Force. After privatisation they were replaced by private security guards. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway, from Manchester Victoria to Preston, via Bolton and Euxton junction, with stations at Chorley and Leyland, cut the ROF site into two areas. The smaller area was the Administration site which lay between the railway and Euxton Lane. The factory's main Administration office was located here. It also contained test laboratories, a Medical Centre, the MOD Police and the main Canteen building. This large canteen was equipped with a stage and was used for Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) concerts and other entertainments during wartime. The larger area of the site lay to the north of the railway line and was the main Explosive, or ammunition filling, site. ROF Chorley had its own private railway station, ROF Halt, which was last used on 27 September 1965. The railway line, particularly the station, was separated from the ROF by brick boundary walls some 20 foot (6 metres) high along each side. Access to the site from the railway station was also by means of an over bridge. The railway station and platforms were demolished in 2002 as the former ROF site was systematically flattened for conversion into housing. The new Buckshaw Parkway railway station, which opened on 3 October 2011, is built close to the site of the old station. Chorley RoF in 2001 prior to demolition The image shown right was taken in January 2001. It clearly show 2 through platform faces with bays on either side of the main platforms. The main internal road, the Central Road, linking the two sites, crossed over the railway line by means of a steep road bridge, with footpaths on either side. There were also separate entrances to the explosive site; one was known as the Leyland Gate. After privatisation the road over the railway line was little used and separate entrances, i.e. the Leyland gate and the Euxton gatehouse, were used for the two sites. World War II production The new factory employed over 1,000 production workers by the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939. By June 1940, the numbers employed there had risen to nearly 15,000. At its wartime peak, ROF Chorley had over 28,000 employees – a staggering figure at a time when there were only around a dozen factories in the whole of Britain with a workforce each of more than 19,000 people (four of these being the Royal Arsenal, ROF Bishopton, ROF Chorley and ROF Bridgend). ROF Chorley was the site where the bouncing bombs, designed by Barnes Wallis and famed for the Dambusters raid, were filled, the main site for the filling of large-capacity aircraft bombs being ROF Glascoed. The overall cost of the plant was £13,140,000. Post-war production During the slack period between 1945 and the Korean War ROF Chorley, like ROF Bridgwater and ROF Glascoed, manufactured the concrete components for Airey two-storey pre-fabricated concrete houses. Post War concrete post and beam, factory-built Airey semi-detached house. ROF Chorley also manufactured concrete railway sleepers and manufactured clothing. Until the mid-1990s, in the interests of security, British Ordnance Survey maps omitted the ROF sites and showed the location as it existed before the ROF's construction. There was a persistent tale from the 1970s that the town centre of the Central Lancashire new town was pencilled in to be built on this \\"empty\\" site until it was discovered by the planners that the site was owned by the Ministry of Defence and was a licensed high explosive site. More recent editions of the maps show the detail of the buildings, road and rail links, labelled simply as \\"Works\\". Privatisation After privatisation, the headquarters of Royal Ordnance plc was moved to ROF Chorley and was accommodated in a new office block on the \\"administration site\\" created out of a former warehouse. The registered office of Royal Ordnance plc, however, remained in London. The site continued to be known as Royal Ordnance Chorley, or RO Defence, Chorley for some twenty years after privatisation; but then lost its name, eventually, becoming a BAE Systems Land Systems site and then a BAE Systems Land and Armaments site. The headquarters function was moved from Chorley to BAE Systems' Filton site. Run down and closure In the early 1990s a Long Term strategy was drawn up for the whole site; which involved the decommissioning and decontamination of a significant proportion of the explosives area of the site and its disposal for other uses: mostly housing. About were declared surplus, and the buildings were cleaned of explosives by burning them. Some explosives work was carried out on part of the retained site, but this too closed in 2007. In 2000 the Royal Ordnance headquarters function was transferred to BAE System's Filton, Bristol site and more recently to Glascoed in Monmouthshire. Much of this residual site was totally cleared of buildings and a major part was used to build the new Buckshaw Village. Some of the land was also developed for light industrial use. The former main administration office building was converted into an adult college and now forms part of Runshaw College's, Euxton Lane site. Central Road still exists although the bridge deck has been replaced and the road has been upgraded; it is now known as Central Avenue. In 2009 the former ROF Heapey was decommissioned after BAE Systems stated that a contract with the MOD had finished. The site was sold to Redcliffe International, a specialist in explosives shipping and storage and is currently licensed for the storage of 192 tonnes of explosive across the Heapey site.

A house built for funds received as donations was converted into a mosque in Narva.

It was passed in the winter session of Parliament in 1999, replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). This act makes offences related to foreign exchange civil offenses. It extends to the whole of India, replacing FERA, which had become incompatible with the pro-liberalization policies of the Government of India. It enabled a new foreign exchange management regime consistent with the emerging framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also paved the way for the introduction of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, which came into effect from 1 July 2005. Description Unlike other laws where everything is permitted unless specifically prohibited, under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1973 (predecessor to FEMA) everything was prohibited unless specifically permitted. Hence the tenor and tone of the Act was very drastic. It required imprisonment even for minor offences. Under FERA, a person was presumed guilty unless he proved himself innocent, whereas under other laws a person is presumed innocent unless he is proven guilty. FEMA is a regulatory mechanism that enables the Reserve Bank of India to pass regulations and the Central Government to pass rules relating to foreign exchange in tune with the Foreign Trade policy of India. History =Foreign Exchange Regulation Act= The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) was legislation passed in India in 1973 that imposed strict regulations on certain kinds of payments, the dealings in foreign exchange (forex) and securities and the transactions which had an indirect impact on the foreign exchange and the import and export of currency.http://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=377 The bill was formulated with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange. FERA came into force with effect from January 1, 1974. FERA was introduced at a time when foreign exchange (Forex) reserves of the country were low, Forex being a scarce commodity. FERA therefore proceeded on the presumption that all foreign exchange earned by Indian residents rightfully belonged to the Government of India and had to be collected and surrendered to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). FERA primarily prohibited all transactions not permitted by RBI. Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977 when it left India after a new government ordered the company to dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). In 1993, the company (along with PepsiCo) returned after the introduction of India's Liberalization policy. =Switch from FERA= FERA did not succeed in restricting activities such as the expansion of Multinational Corporations. The concessions made to FERA in 1991-1993 showed that FERA was on the verge of becoming redundant. After the amendment of FERA in 1993, it was decided that the act would become the FEMA. This was done in order to relax the controls on foreign exchange in India. FERA was repealed in 1998 by the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and replaced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, which liberalised foreign exchange controls and restrictions on foreign investment. The buying and selling of foreign currency and other debt instruments by businesses, individuals and governments happens in the foreign exchange market. Apart from being very competitive, this market is also the largest and most liquid market in the world as well as in India. It constantly undergoes changes and innovations, which can either be beneficial to a country or expose them to greater risks. The management of foreign exchange market becomes necessary in order to mitigate and avoid the risks. Central banks would work towards an orderly functioning of the transactions which can also develop their foreign exchange market. Foreign Exchange Market Whether under FERA or FEMA’s control, the need for the management of foreign exchange is important. It is necessary to keep adequate amount of foreign exchange. FEMA served to make transactions for external trade and easier – transactions involving current account for external trade no longer required RBI’s permission. The deals in Foreign Exchange were to be ‘managed’ instead of ‘regulated’. The switch to FEMA shows the change on the part of the government in terms of for the capital. Main Features * Activities such as payments made to any person outside India or receipts from them, along with the deals in foreign exchange and foreign security is restricted. It is FEMA that gives the central government the power to impose the restrictions. * Free transactions on current account subject to a reasonable restrictions that may be imposed. * Without general or specific permission of FEMA, MA restricts the transactions involving foreign exchange or foreign security and payments from outside the country to India – the transactions should be made only through an authorised person. * Deals in foreign exchange under the current account by an authorised person can be restricted by the Central Government, based on public interest generally. * Although selling or drawing of foreign exchange is done through an authorized person, the RBI is empowered by this Act to subject the capital account transactions to a number of restrictions. * Residents of India will be permitted to carry out transactions in foreign exchange, foreign security or to own or hold immovable property abroad if the currency, security or property was owned or acquired when he/she was living outside India, or when it was inherited by him/her from someone living outside India.

The Casentino is the valley in which the first tract of the river Arno flows to Subbiano, Italy. It is one of the four valleys in which the Province of Arezzo is divided. Mount Falterona, from which the Arno starts, represents the northern boundary between the Casentino and Romagna. On the east of the valley are the Alpe di Serra and the Alpe di Catenaia, which separate the Casentino from the highest tract of the Val Tiberina. On the west there is the Pratomagno, which separates the valley from the Valdarno Superiore. Part of the valley is included in the Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park. It can be said that the valley has an oval form, with an extension across the river that varies from a maximum of 60 km to a minimum of 30. The topography of the Casentino is especially various, including both plains and mountains rich in large forests. These mountains have often attracted great saints: it was here that St. Romuald built his hermitages at Camaldoli, and that less than two centuries later St. Francis of Assisi established the Sanctuary of La Verna, the headquarters of the Franciscan order. The valley's biggest comuni are all located in the Arno valley: among these the biggest are Bibbiena and Poppi, while Capolona, Castel Focognano, Castel San Niccolò, Pratovecchio, Stia, Subbiano are more or less smaller. The villages located on the neighbouring hills and mountains are much smaller. These are Chitignano, Chiusi della Verna, Montemignaio, Ortignano-Raggiolo and Talla.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, as a Reformer. He was later a member of the Legislative Council, serving as the Speaker of the Legislative Council. He was also a member of the Executive Council of the province.  Family and early life  Morris was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland in 1798. The family emigrated to British North America, eventually settling with his family at Elizabethtown (later Brockville) in Upper Canada in 1808. He was educated at Sorel in Lower Canada, at a school operated by the father of Wolfred Nelson, who was later one of the leaders of the Lower Canada Rebellion.Paul G. Cornell, \\"Morris, James\\", in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. IX (1861–1870). Morris married Emily Rosamond Murney of Kingston, sister of Edmund Murney, who was later elected to the Legislative Assembly for Hastings.  Business career  By 1820, Morris was involved in various business activities with his older brothers, including William Morris, who would also be involved in politics. He was active in banking throughout his career. By 1836, he was the cashier at the Commercial Bank of the Midland District in Brockville.Queen's Encyclopedia: \\"Commercial Bank of the Midland District\\". He also formed working relationships with William Hamilton Merritt and Isaac Buchanan, two successful businessmen who would also serve in the Legislative Assembly. At that time, communications were mainly by boats plying the Saint Lawrence River from Quebec City and Montreal to York on Lake Ontario. However, there were stretches of the Saint Lawrence that had dangerous rapids. Morris became involved in projects to build canals and locks north of the Saint Lawrence, allowing shipping to bypass the dangerous stretches. In 1838, he was appointed to a commission which administered funds raised for canal building. After he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, he was involved in measures to fund canals. The town of West Williamsburg, which benefited from the canals, changed its name to Morrisburg to recognise his role in the town's development.\\"A Glimpse of Morrisburg’s History\\". Morris was involved in the founding of Queen's College, later Queen's University, at Kingston. He was one of the four original trustees of the university funds.  Political career  Morris was appointed justice of the peace in 1825. He was elected in a by- election to represent Leeds County in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1837 to 1840. He stated that he was a conservative, wishing to maintain the British connection. Following the merger of Upper Canada and Lower Canada in 1841, he again represented Leeds in the first Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1844.\\"Return of the names of the Members chosen to serve in the Legislative Assembly of Canada\\", Office of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, Kingston, 14th.

Morris was a consistent vote for Reform. In the first session of the first Parliament, he joined most of the moderate Reformers in voting in support of the union of the Canadas, but also voted with the more radical Reformers under Robert Baldwin in opposing the government of the Governor General, Lord Sydenham. In subsequent sessions of the first Parliament, he generally voted with Baldwin's group, opposing the positions of the Governors General. Paul G.

Looney Tunes theatrical animated short directed by Robert McKimson and written by Warren Foster. The short was released on January 3, 1948, and stars Bugs Bunny. The story is a parody of the many jungle films that were prominent in the 1930s and 1940s which often featured gorillas extensively (though not always behaviorally accurately), most notably the Tarzan films. The title is a play on the expression \\"Girl o' My Dreams\\". The short featured Gruesome Gorilla, who reappeared in Hurdy-Gurdy Hare and as a boss in Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters. The cartoon was remade in 1959 as Apes of Wrath. Plot \\"Sweet Dreams, Sweetheart\\" plays briefly under the title card, and the cartoon opens with a trail of carrot tops floating on the seas. Bugs is stranded in a barrel in the middle of the ocean, but he does not seem to mind - he is reading Esquire magazine (considered an \\"adults only\\" magazine at that time) and singing the song \\"Down Where the Trade Winds Play\\" (a song made popular by Bing Crosby). On the island of 'Bingzi-Bangzi - Land of the Ferocious Apes', the population is made up of gorillas that act like humans - they read the newspaper and books such as \\"The Apes of Wrath\\", have families, live in huts and speak American English (in the underscore, one of Stalling's orchestrations of Raymond Scott's jungle themes is heard, its official title being \\"Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals\\"). One of the apes, Mrs. Gruesome Gorilla, is sad that she does not have any children, whereas her husband (voiced by Mel Blanc) could not care less. Mrs. Gruesome (also voiced by Blanc, using a falsetto) walks toward the water and starts to say, \\"I'm going to...\\" (suggesting despondency), but then spots Bugs floating in his barrel. Her mood instantly changes and she takes him back to her treetop (at one point, yielding the right-of-way to a man wearing just a leopard skin loincloth that looks strikingly like Tarzan). Bugs finishes \\"Trade Winds\\" just as Mrs. Gruesome picks up the barrel and segués into a full verse of \\"Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat\\", which he finishes just as he discovers himself in the clutches of the ape. Mrs. Gruesome wants Bugs to be her 'baby'. At first, Bugs does not want to, but when she starts crying, he gives in (\\"That's my soft spot - dames crying.\\"). Mrs. Gruesome then presents Bugs to Mr. Gruesome - who is none too happy about having a baby in the house. Bugs tries to fit in, playing like a 'monkey'. Mr. Gruesome takes Bugs out for 'a walk', but Bugs soon realizes that he is in for a beating if he sticks around. A long chase ensues (including a frenetic version of Stalling's jungle theme) and Bugs finds himself trapped against the edge of a cliff. Bugs gives up and allows Gruesome to catch him. However, Gruesome quickly tires out and drops from exhaustion, with Bugs knocking him over with a mere puff of breath. Emerging as the 'victor', Bugs jumps up and catches a hanging branch, again playing 'monkey' (another short clip of the jungle theme is heard in the underscore, along with the time-honored \\"jungle\\" sound of a kookaburra) at iris-out.

In 2014, it contracted to a few brain and head injuries services. It is managed by the North Bristol NHS Trust. From April to December 2014, most of Frenchay Hospital was progressively closed, with the majority of services moving to a new building at Southmead Hospital. Accident and Emergency was transferred on 19 May 2014. Child services moved to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. A few services relating to brain and head injuries remained at the site after December 2014. History =Early history= The hospital, situated in the grounds of a Georgian mansion, Frenchay Park, started life as a tuberculosis hospital (Frenchay Park Sanatorium) in 1921, when Bristol Corporation acquired the land. In 1931, five purpose-built buildings were constructed to extend the hospital beyond the original house. Modernised World War II wards in 2014 Concerns about the possibility of heavy bombing casualties led to the hospital being greatly expanded between 1938 and early 1942. Although Bristol was severely bombed, the new facilities remained unused. When US forces arrived in 1942, the city handed the new hospital facilities over to the Americans, as a sort of reverse Lend-Lease. The initial units of the Medical Corps were the 2nd and 77th Evacuation Hospitals and the 152nd Station Hospital. Further expansion to the facilities including 27 wards, occurred in late 1942 and it was occupied by the 298th General Hospital. Initially, the Americans used the hospital mainly as training facility for their medical staff. After D-Day, however, the hospital was used in earnest, under the control of the 100th and then 117th General Hospitals. Casualties were flown into Filton or arrived by train from the channel ports. Between 5 August and 31 December 1944 a total of 4,954 patients were discharged from Frenchay. After the Second World War, the Americans handed the hospital back to the Corporation. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. In 1953, patients and the staff were visited by Frank Sinatra when he was appearing at the local Bristol Hippodrome. =Redevelopment= Over the second half of the 20th century, the hospital facilities were slowly modernised, but some wartime buildings were retained. In 2000, a new children's ward, The Barbara Russell Children's Unit, was opened after public fundraising toward the £4million cost. Frenchay Hospital was downsized after many services were transferred to Southmead Hospital in spring 2014. The hospital had extensive grounds some of which were marketed for sale. A Save Frenchay Hospital campaign was fronted by Steve Webb, the local Member of Parliament. The campaign's main arguments were that Frenchay Hospital afforded greater possibility for expansion than the Southmead site and that emergency access was easier due to its proximity to the motorway. An extension was built at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children to accommodate child services which moved from Frenchay in March 2014, including neuroscience, scoliosis surgery, burns and plastic surgery, bringing all inpatient child services in Bristol to one location. The accident and emergency department was transferred to the new Southmead Hospital on 19 May 2014, following local advertising of the change. The Save Frenchay Hospital pressed for a community hospital to be opened on the site. In 2015, the site which had extended to , was reduced to with the construction of 490 homes, a school and a clinic.

This bridge was replaced in 2019. Shared pedestrian/cycle way over the Yass River in Yass (person for scale) A low-water crossing (also known as an Irish bridge, causeway in Australia, low-level crossing or low-water bridge) provides a bridge when water flow is low. Under high-flow conditions, water runs over the roadway and precludes vehicular traffic. This approach is cheaper than building a bridge to raise the level of the road above the highest flood stage of a river, particularly in developing countries or in semi-arid areas with rare high-volume rain. Low-water crossings can be dangerous when flooded. Construction The low-water crossing was developed from the traditional ford. A ford permits vehicular traffic to cross a waterway with wet wheels. In some countries the term “low-water crossing” implies that the crossing is usually dry, while “ford” implies that the crossing is usually wet. The simplest type of low water crossing is called an unvented ford or drift. This type of low water crossing is used mainly for shallow waterways or dry streambeds. It consists of an improved surface of gravel, gravel-filled geotextile grid, paving blocks, or concrete slabs positioned to match the slope and elevation of the adjacent waterway and floodplain. To cross somewhat deeper waterways, a type of low water crossing called a vented ford can be constructed with culverts. The size of the culverts (often concrete pipes) is usually selected to allow the water to flow below the roadway and provide a dry crossing surface for most of the year. During periods of high water flow (e.g. spring runoff or flash floods), water will flow over the top of the crossing, as the culverts are not large enough to carry these flood-type runoff events. A more elaborate low-water bridge will usually be an engineered concrete structure. There are thousands of such structures in the arid climates of the western United States; some of them accommodate four-lane city streets or highways. Typically, a low-water bridge that accommodates a high daily volume of vehicular traffic will be underwater only a few days per decade. Navigation A low-water bridge renders the waterway non-navigable. In almost all cases this is not a practical concern, since the waterway would be non-navigable except during flood conditions anyway. A low-water bridge is sometimes called a submersible bridge, but this is a misnomer. A true submersible bridge is used on navigable waterways and is actively lowered into the water.  Safety  The concept behind low-water crossings is that they are convenient and safe to use in normal conditions. Once the water level rises to the point where it crosses the bridge surface the bridge is generally unsafe to use due to high current. The force of the moving water may be strong enough to physically push the vehicle off the bridge: the higher the percentage of the vehicle in the water, the more likely the water's force will take the vehicle off the bridge and send it downriver with substantial damage. An additional risk for trying to cross a bridge under water, especially when more than a couple of feet deep, is the possibility of the vehicle's engine stalling. As people will typically try to then get out of the vehicle, they may step into water currents that cause them to fall or be pulled down into the water. As the current during floods is often quite strong, it may sweep them downriver and carry them into debris, possibly causing injury or death. In developed countries this will usually be indicated by warning signs. An additional hazard is that the bridge surface may become completely obscured by the water, making it relatively easy to fall off the bridge surface into the deeper and more hazardous water on either side. As a consequence, the line of the submerged bridge is often marked with poles or other structures to indicate its course to unwary travelers and emergency users even when submerged. Despite the obvious dangers and warnings given there are still a significant number of emergencies and even deaths attributable to the unwary use of low-water bridges during flood conditions. One attempted solution/deterrent is the Stupid Motorist Law in the American state of Arizona. Drivers who become stranded on flooded low-water bridges are charged with the cost incurred by emergency services to come to their rescue. File:Flood buried bridge, Ashida River 20180706.jpgFlooded Low-water crossing File:Flood_buried_bridge.jpgBridge after the flood (No Entry) Fish passage at low-water crossings Since 1980, the ecological impact of road crossings on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. Baffles may be installed along the culvert to provide some fish-friendly alternative. But baffles can reduce drastically the culvert discharge capacity for a given afflux, thus increasing substantially the total cost of the culvert structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux, or increasing the risk of road flooding in an existing structure.

History In 1931, this settlement was raised to the category of district of Silvânia with the name of Leopoldo de Bulhões. This name was given in tribute to José Leopoldo de Bulhões Jardim, a state politician who was important at the time. The town saw enormous progress between 1928 and 1939, with the arrival of the tracks of the Estrada de Ferro Goyaz. For a certain time the station of Leopoldo de Bulhões was the last station on the railroad line, making it a strong motive for migration to the area. The railway line no longer operates.

Yavuz Tatış (born 1947) is a businessman from İzmir, Turkey, who has accumulated over the years one of the richest private collections in Turkey of historical artifacts dating from the Anatolian, Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine periods. Tatış was born in 1947 in İzmir. The family company, the Tatış Group, is among the most prominent names in the city's business world, and his father, Bahattin Tatış, was also the founder of the Turkish College of İzmir, considered among the best high schools in Turkey. Yavuz Tatış himself has graduated from this school founded by his father and he did his university studies in the West Virginia University in business management. On his return to Turkey, he started his own company, and at the same time, he displayed a keen interest for the historical riches of the country, confirmed at first by his acting on his own to acquire a tourist guide's licence and then serving as guide for dignitaries visiting Turkey. Later, as of 1993, he started to accumulate diverse artifacts of antiquity. What started as a hobby has in time become a full-time occupation and he is better known in Turkey today in his quality of an expert private collector, rather than through his business porte-feuille. In 2004, some pieces of his collection has been presented in the form of a book (in Turkish) \\"Anadolu Medeniyetlerinden Kültür Yansımaları\\" (Reflections of the Culture from Anatolian Civilizations). The international team of experts brought together by him for the book and the intentionally luxurious edition is meant to encourage other Turkish private collectors to take similar initiatives for their collection to be brought to the knowledge of the public. Since then, Tatış has completed an edition of his book in English and in a more extensive scope, which proves difficult to put the finishing touches since new gems arrive all the time. In the meantime, he is taking steps with a view to establishing a Yavuş Tatış Museum in İzmir, whose works have started, and is also deepening research in the specialist's field of Byzantine seals, having put together a unique collection in these. In 2006, he also published a second book in which he collected various observation drawn from business and everyday life, titled \\"Experiences\\" (Deneyimler).

Originally written by Damien Sandras it grew to being maintained by a team of nine regular contributors by 2011. Sandras wanted to create a Netmeeting clone for Linux as his graduating project at UCLouvain. Ekiga was referred to as GnomeMeeting until 2004 when a name change was thought necessary by the developers. Concerns were cited that the original name was associated with a dead Microsoft product called NetMeeting, and not always recognized as VoIP software. It was also proposed that some people assumed they needed to run GNOME to run GnomeMeeting, which was no longer the case. Eventually on January 18, 2006 the name Ekiga was chosen based on an old way of communicating between villages in Cameroon. Around that the time the direction of the software project was changed and it turned into a SIP client.

It stretches from the northeastern Negev to the east of Beit El, and is marked by natural terraces with escarpments. It ends in a steep escarpment dropping to the Dead Sea and the Jordan Valley. The Judaean Desert is crossed by numerous wadis from northeast to southeast and has many ravines, most of them deep, from in the west to in the east. The Judaean Desert is an area with a special morphological structure along the east of the Judaean Mountains. It is sometimes known as Yeshimon, meaning desert or wildland, or yet Wilderness of Judah or Wilderness of Judaea, among others.

Major urban areas in the region include Jerusalem, Bethlehem, the Gush Etzion, Jericho and Hebron.Picturesque Israel I: Jerusalem, Judah, Ephraim Rainfall in the Judaea region varies from in the western hills, rising to around western Jerusalem (in central Judaea), falling back to in eastern Jerusalem and dropping to around 100 mm in the eastern parts, due to a rainshadow effect. The climate ranges from Mediterranean in the west and desert climate in the east, with a strip of steppe climate in the middle. Judaea Group Aquifer A study by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of an underground water reservoir beneath the Judaean Desert known as the Judaea Group Aquifer, found that the aquifer begins in the Judaean Mountains and flows in a northeasterly direction towards the Dead Sea with outflows at the Tsukim, Kane, Samar and Ein-Gedi springs.

Due to the length of some ropewalks, workers may use bicycles to get from one end to the other. Many ropewalks were in the open air, while others were covered only by roofs. Ropewalks historically were harsh sweatshops, and frequently caught fire, as hemp dust ignites easily and burns fiercely. Rope was essential in sailing ships and the standard length for a British Naval Rope was . A sailing ship such as required of rope. The technology of making a rope Natural fibres are short in length, and so have to be twisted together so different fibres, starting at different points along the construction, hold each other together. From a single strand, much like wool, which can easily be torn apart, putting several together forms a line, which is far stronger. That can similarly be repeated time and again, producing a very strong rope, at the cost of weight and size. More modern fibres are likewise spun together for the same reasons, but because they are inherently stronger, similar strength is often achieved at much lower weight and size. The essence of a ropewalk, where this spinning is achieved, is a drive mechanism at one end of the walk, a \\"donkey\\" guide in the middle, which helps the ropemaker bring the strands together, and a fixing point at the far end. One end or the other is mobile, because the twisting shortens the constituent parts of the rope, and the runner in the middle is always mobile, because the rope, when sufficiently twisted, starts to form at one end and the guide then has to run back towards the drive end, guiding the twist into place: this can be a very fast action, once sufficient twist is in place. The runner is in general somewhat melon-shaped, with grooves in it designed to guide the strands of the rope into place as they form, and sometimes a hollow centre to allow the feed of a central core into the rope: the central core is not normally twisted. When a twisted rope or cord is used as a strand, it is spun in the opposite direction to the \\"handedness\\" of the strand (i.e. a strand which has been spun together anti-clockwise is twisted in a clockwise direction when it is spun into a larger rope, and vice versa). Because of the very great weight of such lengths of natural fibre, other support trestles are also sometimes used to keep the weight off the ground, where the friction might overcome the strength of the equipment. Other lubrication has sometimes been used to assist the process. Very long cables, such as those used for long-distance undersea communications, have more complex structures, but nonetheless start with similar elements. Because the distances involved are far greater, a more continuous flow process replaces the standard ropewalk, shortening the length of the walk as the runner becomes static, and the feed end becomes far more complex as it has to spin in one direction whilst laying the rope in the other. Although further waterproofing and armoured coatings are normal, the core of the rope is similar to the description. Examples Downtown Liverpool's bohemian RopeWalks district takes its name from this practice and consists of the lanes where this work once took place. Laying the rope in the ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard The ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard (as part of the Ropery or Ropehouse) is still producing rope commercially and has an internal length of . When it was constructed in 1790, it was the longest brick building in Europe. Before steam power was introduced in 1836, it took over 200 men to form and close a (circumference) cable laid rope.\\"The Historic Dockyard Chatham, where legends were created.\\" Guide Book. 2005. Jarrold Publishing. The rope walk is used to form and close the rope, these being the final stages in rope making. Before this the raw hemp, manila hemp or sisal has to be hatchelled, spun into yarn, and tarred. In the early 17th century, Peter Appleby constructed a ropewalk (for the dockyard) in the Christianshavn neighbourhood of Copenhagen, Denmark. From the late 17th century, the ropewalk on the Swedish island of Lindholmen was a key component of the Karlskrona naval base producing rope up to 300 metres in length for the cordage of warships. Although production ceased in 1960, the elaborately designed facility is now open to the public with exhibitions and demonstrations of ropemaking.\\"The Rope Walk on the Island of Lindholmen\\", Upplev Karlsrona. Retrieved 24 June 2012. A similarly scaled facility in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France, called the Corderie Royale, is also maintained as a museum within the Centre International de la Mer.La Corderie Royale (in French) In the 18th Century, Malta and Port Mahon, on the island of Menorca, both had open-air ropewalks. In Boston in the Massachusetts Colony, some early rope making businesses were called 'ropewalks'. Jalan Pintal Tali which is in one of the older, central parts of George Town, Penang, Malaysia, literally means \\"rope-twisting street\\". In Toronto, a ropewalk appears on municipal maps from as early as the 1860s and operated for at least 40 years. The ropewalk ran to the east of Lansdowne Avenue (formerly Jameson Avenue, then North Lansdowne Avenue).The Goad's Fire Insurance Plan of 1884 1884 Insurance Plan shows the factory going from lot 42 at the south end to lot 35 at the north.1890 City of Toronto Municipal assessment rolls 1890 Assessment rolls show the owner to be an Alice McGregor and Archibald McGregor as a tenant rope maker aged 66 and list the ropewalk sheds. The municipal assessment rolls show many residents in the neighbourhood employed by the ropewalk factory. Examples: Michael Curran age 35 rope maker; Michael Griffin rope maker, Barthlamew Sullivan age 62 rope maker; Peter Griffin age 27 rope maker, James Lochrie age 32 rope maker, John Baylor (or Taylor) age 46 rope maker, Bat Sullivan Sheridan age 62 rope maker, Egbert Barwell and Patrick Dillon. In Quebec, Evan Rees (originally of Bristol, England) had a rope walk constructed in 1823. After his death in 1824, his son by the same name continued its operation until it burned down in the great Quebec fire of 1867.

She said that the reason why there is such a big difference between the two manga's art is because Ayashi no Ceres is more \\"Dark and serious,\\" so she gave it a more realistic art style. Appare is drawn with a more typical wide-eyed shōjo look. This manga had an unusual publishing schedule. In a shōjo manga magazine, there is a restricted number of pages that manga artist can only draw in (16 for weekly shōnen manga and 32–34 for typical monthly shōjo manga). Appare was licensed by Flower Comics, but never ran in the magazine. Instead it was independent and immediately went out to the public in volumes. Watase stated that she did not want to go with the deadlines for the magazine because it was such a light-hearted story that she wanted to go at her own pace. As a result, there were huge gaps between volume publications. The series was published in Spain by Glénat España as ¡Viva Japón!.

The area is an attractive area in Midtown Toronto between St Clair and Eglinton. Davisville Village is represented at Toronto City Council by Councillor Josh Matlow. History Davisville was founded by John Davis in 1840. Davis opened the first post office in the neighbourhood and served as the post-master. The building that housed the original post office is currently a Starbucks at the North-East corner of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue. John Davis also started Davisville Pottery Company, which was the largest employer in the neighbourhood for several years. In 1911 Davis sold a large portion of the land to Dovercourt Development Company to be developed. Many single family homes were built between the 1920s and 1930s, and still exist today. Demographics The population of Davisville Village as of 2006 was 23,690. The population of Davisville grew approximately 6.5% between 1996 and 2001, and another 8.5% between 2001 and 2006. Davisville is a densely populated neighbourhood. Given an area of approximately 2.23 km2, it has a density of approximately 10,623 people per km2. Davisville is a fairly wealthy neighbourhood.

By 1981 the immigrant population in Davisville increased rapidly and has continued to do so for the past three decades. The immigrants in Davisville come from many different countries. The country where most of Davisville's immigrants come from is the United Kingdom. In 2006 there were 955 people living in Davisville from the United Kingdom. There are also 480 immigrants living in Davisville from the United States of America and 470 immigrants from Iran. Other countries of origin for Davisville immigrants are China, India, Philippines, Germany, Poland, Jamaica, South Korea, Romania and Russia. Davisville is serviced by two TTC subway stations, Davisville and Eglinton station on the Yonge-University line. It also has regular bus service on Eglinton Ave. E. and Bayview Ave. The easy access to public transportation and the proximity to the Downtown core, results in a higher percentage of residents using public transit and self-propulsion (walking/biking). Davisville's transportation mode shows that 46.5% of residents use public transit and 11.9% walked or biked to their destination, compared to the City of Toronto's transportation mode which shows that only 34.4% of residents use public transit and 8.8% walk or bike. The 2006 census data also shows that Davisville neighbourhood has a lower percentage of vehicle users than the city of Toronto. 40.1% of residents in Davisville use car, trucks, vans, and/or motorcycles to get to their destination compared to Toronto's 55.8%. Real Estate Like many of Toronto's neighbourhoods, the real estate market in Davisville has undergone incredible growth over the past several years. Davisville has actually outperformed the Toronto real estate market in general in 2015 and thus far in 2016. The average price of a detached home is now $1,365,749, an increase of 16% over 2015. This is attributed to the neighbourhood's schools, proximity to transportation and the amount shopping and restaurants available. Divisions The city of Toronto assigns the Davisville Village into two official neighbourhoods: Apartments surround Balliol Parkette in West Mount Pleasant. The majority of the people living in the area live in high/low-rise apartments. =Mount Pleasant West= Mount Pleasant West is situated West of Mount Pleasant Road, North of Merton Street, East of Yonge Street and South of Keewatin Ave. 91% of people in this neighbourhood live in low/high rise apartment and condo buildings, which makes it one of the most building-dominated neighbourhoods in Toronto (comparable to the high-rise dense downtown core).Statistics Canada There are a number of affordable housing units in the area which factors into the lower income levels in this neighbourhood compared to the surrounding ones. Over 80% of residents are renters, which is approximately 30% over Toronto's average. In 2003 Minto proposed a plan for two high-rise condominium buildings on Yonge street, south of Eglinton avenue. A majority of Davisville residents were strongly opposed to the development. The case was taken to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB), which agreed that in order for Minto's plans to be approved, they needed to comply with the following conditions: * Reduce building height by several stories * Contribute $1 million towards affordable rental housing for seniors * Contribute $200,000 towards a new pedestrian walkwayMoore, 2009 The Minto Quantum towers were built and completed in 2007.Coorsh, 2010 =Mount Pleasant East= Mount Pleasant East is bordered to the east by Bayview Avenue, Moore Avenue to the south, Yonge Street to the west and Blythwood to the north. The people in this neighbourhood are predominantly in their working years and enjoy house value well above the norm for the city. It is comparable to The Beaches in demographics and income.

Biography  Feldman, was born in 1944, the son of Rabbi and Rebbetzin Menachem Mendel Feldman, the longtime rabbi of Congregation Shearis Yisroel, Baltimore. In 1964, he was sent as a shliach by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson to New South Wales, Australia, where he married Pnina Gutnick, the daughter of Rabbi Chaim Gutnick. He is the brother- in-law of commodities magnate Joseph Gutnick and rabbis Mordechai and Moshe Gutnick. In 1968, Rabbi Schneerson encouraged him to accept the leadership of Yeshiva Centre. According to academic Avrum Erlich, Feldman established a minor dynasty in Australia as Schneerson's original emissary to Sydney, Australia. In 1995, Feldman received the Community service award from Premier John Fahey, for outstanding community services. In 2002, he received the Medal of the Order of Australia, for service to the Jewish community of New South Wales, particularly through the development of spiritual, educational and welfare facilities. Queen's Birthday honours list In 2008, Feldman was honoured by the Organisation of Rabbis of Australia (ORA), as the longest serving communal rabbi in Australia. He was given the title 'Patron of ORA'.  Royal Commission  In February 2015, Feldman gave testimony before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The hearing was focused on Chabad Institutions in Australia, which had been widely accused of tolerating and covering up child sexual abuse. In his testimony, Yeshiva spiritual leader Feldman said he did not tell police he knew an alleged child sexual abuser was planning to leave the country because Rabbi Feldman “did not know there was any such obligation\\".Royal Commission Our darkest week Feldman told the commission the Jewish rules regarding of mesirah, which prohibit Jews from informing on other Jews to civil authorities did not apply in Australia, a democratic country,Child abuse royal commission: Jewish leader 'did not act' when alleged abuser left Australia ABC News, Feb. 5, 2015 however there are other sources where Feldman defends mesirah. Feldman and the Yeshiva centre reviewed their child protection policies in 2011, but when quizzed about it at the Royal Commission, he was completely unaware of the details of the policy and could not answer any of the questions put to him. The centre includes a school and a mikveh, where children and adults were often naked in the same room. In the review of the child protection policy it was claimed that no one had come forward with any allegations against the Yeshiva Centre, although it later emerged in the Royal Commission that there had been a number of instances where children had come forward to report abuse and were ignored. One such instance, a girl was sent to live with an alleged abuser by the rabbinic leadership shortly after it had been revealed that he abused several young boys. The girl involved alleged that the abuser, Daniel Hayman, would walk around the house naked and behave inappropriately around her. When the boys in that case reported the incidents to the leadership of the centre he was told \\"I do not believe you, you made it all up\\". In another instance it was alleged that Feldman told an abuse victim \\"it shouldn’t happen, and [you the victim] should take steps to avoid it\\". In spite of the many failures of leadership, Feldman refused to step down from any of his positions since he claimed that \\"Rabbi Pinchus Feldman has not been the subject of even the slightest negative finding by the Royal Commission of impropriety or misbehaviour in personal, official or public office\\" and that finding is a \\"badge of honour\\". Many including survivor advocate Manny Waks disagreed and called on Feldman to resign immediately. Feldman's wife was later required to appologise to Waks for an email that called him \\"vile\\" and called on him to \\"just get over it [the abuse]\\".  Other legal issues  Feldman has faced significant legal trouble, some to do with his financial mismanagement of the Yeshiva Centre. In 2003, the centre faced closure with massive debts, when several donors and parents stepped in to save the Yeshiva School, which was renamed Keser Torah College (KTC). The school was sold to the new group and Feldman no longer had an interest in it. In 2011 the Feldman returned to court to fight a $500,000 tax bill from the sale of the school in 2003. The dispute between Yeshiva and KTC was finally resolved and a settlement reached whereby Feldman would not open a rival educational facility for 18 months to allow the school to establish itself, however Feldman was later taken to court for breaching the terms of the settlement. Eventually the Yeshiva Centre itself was purchased by businessman Harry Triguboff, in order to save it from closure, and to cover the centres debts. Later Triguboff demanded that Feldman vacate the premises in order to install Dovid Slavin as the head rabbi of the centre. Feldman took Triguboff to court to prevent this, but judge decided in Triguboff's favour, and Feldman was forced to leave the premises. Following the notice to vacate, Feldman's son, Yossi sent a letter to Triguboff calling him \\"the first Jew to close a shul since the Nazis\\" and other slurs, and threatened to remove all the Sefer Torahs, and books so they would be unable to function as a synagogue. Feldman eventually distanced himself from his son's letter almost four weeks later. Feldman and his wife fought an AVO that was granted to Dovid Slavin, the new director of the Yeshiva centre, after Feldman's wife, Pnina allegedly spat Coca-Cola at Slavin at a wedding. The AVO prevented the members of the Feldman family from setting foot onto the Yeshiva property. Feldman was also sued by Shabsi Tayar, who claimed that Feldman had not repaid a $1 million loan, and failed to pay him over a considerable time. The courts decided against Feldman and ordered him to pay $1.6 million to Tayar.

It is part of the North Bristol NHS Trust. The 800-bed Brunel Building opened in May 2014, to provide services (including Accident and Emergency), which transferred from Frenchay Hospital in advance of its closure. The hospital now covers . History The original workhouse building now used as a training centre Dr Gibson-Hill examines a patient at Southmead Hospital in 1942 =Early history= The hospital originated in 1902, when the Barton Regis Poor Law Union opened a new workhouse. The Barton Regis Union had been obliged to open a new workhouse when it lost its urban areas, and with them its workhouse at Eastville, to Bristol in 1897. An innovation in the new workhouse at Southmead was that in a separate building it included an infirmary, with 28 beds for the sick and provision for three nurses. By 1911, there were 520 beds. During the First World War, the Memorial Wing at Bristol Royal Infirmary together with Southmead Hospital were requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. The facilities reverted to a workhouse in the early 1920s and were then greatly extended to accommodate all the sick. In 1924, the Southmead Infirmary was built and was later renamed Southmead Hospital. Notable former medical staff include Geoffrey Tovey, serologist and founder of the UK Transplant Service, which was formed in 1972 and was initially based at the hospital. =Brunel building= In 2005, a major expansion was planned which included moving most services from Frenchay Hospital to the Southmead site, with Frenchay being downgraded to a Community Hospital. Full approval for the project was given by the NHS South West board in January 2009. A new building, which was designed by the Building Design Partnership and built by Carillion at a cost of £430 million, was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2010. The scheme brought all departments and services together under one roof. Called the Brunel building, after Bristol engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it would have 800 beds, 24 operating theatres, patient gardens, a public square, a helipad and visitors' multi-storey car park. The accident and emergency department at Frenchay closed on 19 May 2014 and reopened at Southmead the next day. In early 2014, the second phase of the hospital redevelopment began with the demolition of the old main building to enable construction work to begin on a Brunel Building extension, together with enlarging the area in front of the hospital. The extension includes a new multi-storey car park for patients and visitors, a cycle centre with storage for 300 bikes, more shops, changing and shower facilities for staff and a community arts space. Following the 2014 opening of the Brunel building, there was a shortage of parking spaces owing to high demands from visitors, patients, and staff. In 2014 and 2015, patients and visitors parked at the nearby Beaufort Way multi-storey car park. Improvements were made in 2016, including the construction of a 400-space multi-storey car park next to the Brunel building.

She was a former member of parliament in Samoa and the founder of the Samoa All People's Party (SAPP), becoming the first woman to lead a political party in the country. SAPP allowed people as young as 16, regardless of gender or whether they were matai to be officers in the organisation which included village branches. She was a founding member of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP), which has dominated Samoan politics in the last two decades. Matatumua was a former Superintendent of Nursing who was instrumental in the founding and development of the Samoa School of Nursing. She was an active member of the Samoa Public Service Association (PSA) during the 1981 PSA General Strike which brought down the government of Tupuola Efi.

Her older sister Laulu Fetauimalemau Mata'afa was also a chief and a politician who was the wife of paramount chief Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu’u II, the first Prime Minister of Samoa. Another sister Eni was also a founding member of HRPP and the wife of politician Aiono Nonumalo Sofara who left HRPP in 1993 and subsequently formed the Samoa Democratic Party. Politics Matatumua founded the Samoa All People's Party (SAPP) on 24 March 1996. Prior to leading the new political party, she had been a founding member of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP), first entering parliament as one of the members for the constituency of Aana Number 1 (comprising the villages of Faleasiu and Fasito'o) after the 1982 election. However, later she became known for being a critic of the HRPP government under Tofilau Eti Alesana, often voting against her party and opposing its leader in caucus. Among her criticisms was the extension of the parliamentary term from 3 years to 5 years and the fact that the extension took effect during that sitting of parliament rather than after the subsequent general election. Another major area of contention was the expansion of Cabinet from eight to thirteen members, and the inclusion of under secretaries (deputy ministers), which was seen as depleting the backbench. In 1990 she introduced a motion for the introduction of universal suffrage while in parliament but was not supported by her own party. After the defeat of the motion, both the HRPP and the coalition under Tupuola Efi and Vaai Kolone promised to introduce universal suffrage if they gained power in the following election. When the HRPP retained power following that election, in which Matatumua lost her seat, the HRPP introduced the bill and Tofilau Eti Alesana claimed credit for the introduction of universal suffrage. As Deputy Chairperson of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, she often questioned and criticized the government's fiscal policies and practices as well what she saw as its deliberate lack of accountability to parliament. Eventually she resigned from the HRPP and founded SAPP. which has never attained any seats in parliament. She served as Member of Parliament of the electoral constituency of Aana No.1 from 1982 to 1984, during which she was a member of the Bills Committee, and from 1991 to 1995, during which she was deputy chair of the Public Accounts Committee.Hansard, Parliamentary session of Monday 23 January 2012, p. 149 http://www.parliament.gov.ws/new/wp- content/uploads//04.Journals/2011-2012_Samoan_Journal.pdf retrieved 13 August 2015 See also *Fa'amatai, chiefly system of Samoa *Le Mamea Matatumua Ata, father *Walter Vermeulen, husband *Laulu Fetauimalemau Mata'afa, sister *Fiame Naomi Mata'afa, niece *Hinauri Petana, niece (High Commissioner to Australia) *Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II, brother-in-law *Nonumalo Sofara, brother-in-law References Category:Samoan chiefs Maimoaga, Matatumua Category:1935 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Samoan women in politics Category:Human Rights Protection Party politicians Category:20th-century women politicians ","title":"Matatumua Maimoana"},{"id":"3895098","text":"Discovery Day is the name of several holidays commemorating the discovery of land, gold, and other significant national discoveries.

History There are two homonymous forms of Miller, one that began as an occupational surname for a miller and another that began as a toponymic surname for people from a locale in Glasgow. Miller of the occupational origin may also be translated from many cognate surnames from other European languages, such as Mueller, Müller, Mühler, Moller, Möller, Møller, Myller, and others. There is also a form in the early English lingusitics as Milleiir. The standard modern word represents the northern Middle English term, an agent derivative of mille 'mill', reinforced by Old Norse mylnari (see Milner). In southern, western, and central England, Millward (literally, 'mill keeper') was the usual term. The origin of the Scottish surname is from a burn (rivulet) in Glasgow, namely the molindinar (Mo-lynn-dine-are), and the name has evolved over the years to molindar/Mo-lynn-dar and to molinar/mo-lynn-ar and to Millar and finally to Miller. The first record of the name was in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.Sample History: Miller - Knowledge Base, House of Names If the surname has Highland Scottish origins, the bearers are associated with Clan MacFarlane.Clan Miller: Electric Scotland In 1995, Miller was the 22nd most common surname on the birth, death and marriage registers in Scotland; Millar was 77th.

History The club was founded in 1898 and re-formed in 1956, supported by the Banford family. Their Sunday league team, started in 1973, won numerous trophies before moving into Saturday football, and by the 1986–87 season had progressed to Hampshire League Division One. In 1992, they won the Hampshire League championship, a feat repeated in 1996, and won the Southampton Senior Cup in 1994. When the Hampshire League was reorganised in 1999, the club was placed in the Premier Division, at what was then level 9 of the English football league system, but was administratively relegated two years later because the ground failed to meet Premier Division standards. In 2004, they won the \\"double\\" of the Division One title, thus earning promotion to the Wessex League, and Hampshire Intermediate Cup. Unable to apply for admission to Wessex League Division Two because of the requirement for floodlights, Colden Common were placed in Division Three, and went on to win the division title. Having finished their programme, it was still possible for Hayling United to overtake them by winning their last four games with a 19-goal swing, but they were unable to do so. In 2007, they withdrew from the Wessex League, because their inability to develop their home ground made it impossible for them to progress up the leagues, and joined the Hampshire Premier League.

Rolland owns several properties in Bordeaux, including Château Bertineau Saint-Vincent in Lalande de Pomerol, Château Rolland-Maillet in Saint-Émilion, Château Fontenil in Fronsac, and Château La Grande Clotte in Lussac-Saint-Émilion as well as joint venture partnerships with Bonne Nouvelle in South Africa, Val de Flores in Argentina, Rolland Galarreta in Spain and Yacochuya (Salta) and Clos de los Siete in Argentina. Education and early career Vineyards at the Rolland family estate of Château Le Bon Pasteur in Pomerol. Born into a wine making family, Rolland grew up on the family's estate Château Le Bon Pasteur in Pomerol. After high school, Rolland enrolled at Tour Blanche Viticultural and Oenology school in Bordeaux with his father's encouragement. Excelling in his studies, he was one of five student chosen by director Jean-Pierre Navarre to evaluate the program's quality against that of the prestigious Bordeaux Oenology Institute. Rolland later enrolled in the institute, where he met his wife and fellow oenologist, Dany Rolland, and graduated as part of the class of 1972. At the institute, Michel Rolland studied under the tutelage of renowned oenologists Pierre Sudraud, Pascal Ribéreau-Gayon, Jean Ribéreau-Gayon, and Émile Peynaud. Rolland has said these men were a great influence upon him and considers them the \\"Fathers of Modern Oenology.\\" In 1973, Rolland and his wife bought into an oenology lab on the Right Bank of Bordeaux in the town of Libourne. They took over full control of the lab in 1976 and expanded it to include tasting rooms. By 2006 the Rolland's lab employed 8 full-time technicians, analyzing samples from nearly 800 wine estates in France each year.Suckling, James, Wine Spectator \\"Top Gun\\", June 30, 2006 Rolland's two daughters, Stéphanie & Marie, also work at the lab. Michel Rolland's first clients included the Bordeaux Châteaux Troplong Mondot, Angélus, and Beau-Séjour Bécot. An early setback was the loss of two Saint-Émilion first growths, Château Canon and Château La Gaffelière, due to conflict in style with the owners and Rolland. According to Rolland, the loss \\"calmed him down\\" and brought him out of an awkward stage in his early career. Twenty years later, the two chateaux returned to be part of the more than 100 wineries who employ Michel Rolland as their consultant. In his book Noble Rot: A Bordeaux Wine Revolution, William Echikson writes that before Michel Rolland became consultant to Château Lascombes, it \\"produced about 500,000 bottles of mediocre wine, about half of which was sold not as Lascombes itself, but as the inferior Chevalier de Lascombes.\\" Today, Echikson contends, that even the Chevalier (the second wine of the estate) is better than the old full-fledged Lascombes. Media exposure Michel Rolland's signature on a bottle of the Argentine wine Yacochuya which Rolland owns as part of a joint venture in Cafayate. Rolland features prominently in the critical 2004 documentary Mondovino by Jonathan Nossiter as an agent of wine globalization. In Mondovino, Rolland is seen on several occasions advising his clients to microoxygenate their wines, including a scene at Château Le Gay in Bordeaux. Since the film, Rolland has said that he is \\"not a fan of microoxygenation. The film suggests I am. Some of my clients inquire about it. It can help in special conditions -- if the tannins are fierce or hard, micro- oxygenation can make them softer and rounder. In certain countries with certain terroir, like Chile or Argentina, I may use it.\\" James Suckling, formerly of Wine Spectator, notes in an article about Rolland that \\"He is not a proponent of micro-oxidation in wine-making as some suggest, and never has been\\". Michel Rolland is also a wine making consultant for the Amphorae Winery in Israel (marketed as Makura in the United States) and has started signing his name to their premium Makura series. He visits Amphorae and their vineyards once a year and has his assistants throughout the year help implement his practices adopted by Amphorae's wine making team at the winery and in their vineyards.

He was an army employee until he was past 30, and later a metalworker and active union member. Health problems forced him to stop working in the factory, and he started writing full-time.  Writer  He is a popular novelist, publishing close to 80 titles published 1989 and 2015. He is a member of the Norwegian Authors' Union. The Union has a literary council. Members must have at least two works judged to have literary value. Of several series, his most popular is Fire søsken (Four Brothers and Sisters) (42 books). Others are Opprør (Uprising) (about 1960s type radicalism, 7 books) and Vokterne (The Guardians), an X-files-like Science Fiction series of 6 for young adults.  Style  = Settings = His books depend heavily on his background, as well as extensive research. They are often placed in Trøndelag, both in the largest city Trondheim, in smaller industrial cities, the countryside and unpopulated forests and mountain landscapes. They may continue into the large forests of Sweden across the border, or occasionally further, including the Soviet Union, Japan and the United States. = Characters = Military and security personnel, industrial workers and working women - often unwed mothers - as well as small farmers and city criminals are among those who populate his books. Most of them have female heroes.  Themes  His tales mix historical and social realism with the fantastic in the form of ghost stories, local legends and science fiction. Many have spy themes come from the Cold War. Some are realistic crime stories, some fantasies, several are airplane thrillers (among them a book about the U-2 Crisis of 1960), some are documentary novels about historical themes, while one or two are erotic novels.  Linkages  Most of his books link with each other through common characters, settings and themes. A novel about the Norwegian prewar detective hero Knut Gribb describes the building of a factory that is important later in Fire Søsken. Characters from that series participate in the series Vokterne. A priest described in a historical novel about the Black Death makes an appearance as a ghost several hundred years later in a Fire søsken novel. In one sense, they might be regarded as parts of a still expanding mega-novel.  Legends  One of his early non-series books, Ulvetid (A Time of Wolves) describes the flight of a slave girl during the late Viking age, into a forest where she joins a group of wolves. This is based on a local legend. On her way she passes through a large battle, and she meets the hulder, a supernatural woman that belongs to the subteranians still feared in remote parts of Norway. The novel was sold in the museum shop at Stiklestad in Trøndelag, that commemorates the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030, where Olaf II of Norway fell. He was later sainted as St. Olav, Norway's patron saint, with a wide cult around the North Sea in catholic times. Ustad has written a couple of non- fiction books about flying saucers.  Social issues  Social issues have been the driving force behind many of Ustad's books. Tyskertøs The Fire Søsken series started with the novel Tyskertøs (a derogatory word about girls who went with Germans during the Nazi occupation), about a girl who has an out-of-wedlock baby with a German soldier on the day the war ends in 1945. It tells the story about the persecution of these women during the liberation days, which has been a taboo theme in Norway. The book set a record as the up to then best-selling first novel in a series, and was made into a radio play for the official Norwegian channel NRK. The main protagonist in Tyskertøs, Lena Karlsbu and her very diverse brothers and sisters become the heroes (and sometimes antiheroes) of the rest of the series. They became a vehicle that allowed Ustad to excavate several taboo real-life stories in later books. As he continued exploring this in the series, he received death threats from people who thought he was writing about abuse they had been involved in during the 1940s.

As a boy, Csatari had painstakingly recreated Saturday Evening Post covers that Rockwell had painted. In 1977, shortly before Rockwell died, Csatari was commissioned as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)'s official artist. Early life and career Csatari studied art at the Academy of Arts, Newark, New Jersey and also at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In 1953, he became an artist in the layout division in BSA Supply Division's advertising department. In 1958, he became the art director; designing advertising and sales promotional pieces, cover illustrations, and posters. Like his mentor Rockwell, he also served as art director of Boys' Life magazine at the beginning of his career, being named to that position in 1973. This was the time he worked closely with Rockwell. Csatari's job was to come up with possible themes for the paintings and make rough sketches for Rockwell. Once Rockwell decided on a concept, Csatari would gather models and shuttle them up for a photo shoot in the artist's studio in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Csatari often assisted Rockwell on his work at this time as by then Rockwell was aging. In 1976 when Rockwell retired from the calendar commission, the BSA asked Csatari to continue in the Rockwell tradition. Csatari says that while he paints in Rockwell's style, he is no Rockwell, whom he considers in another league. Since the 1977 BSA calendar, Csatari has made 24 paintings for the Boy Scouts of America, including a painting commemorating the endowment program's 1910 Society. In 1997 an exhibit of these paintings toured the United States at fund-raising events in local councils throughout the country. Though it's not well known, Csatari also painted more than 10 official portraits of BSA presidents and Chief Scout Executives during his career. But it is his paintings of \\"Boy Scouts being Boy Scouts, having fun in the outdoors, and doing community service projects\\" that he finds most rewarding. Csatari became a freelance artist in 1977 and has painted for many magazines and companies, as well as having painted designs for two U.S. postage stamps and several book covers. He lives in South River, New Jersey, where he maintains an art studio at his home, and has a wife and three children.Granieri, Laurie. \\"PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST\\", Asbury Park Press, January 6, 2002. Accessed February 5, 2011. \\"Joe Csatari is in a reflective mood today. He relaxes in his home art studio in South River, a sunlit perch set among bare tree branches...\\" He has received several awards of excellence in Editorial Art Directing from the Society of Illustrators, New York. In early June 2005, Csatari was awarded the BSA's highest honor, the Silver Buffalo Award. In 2008, a twelve-city U.S. tour of Norman Rockwell's and Csatari's artworks was scheduled. Critique of his work Being an eager and willing disciple of Rockwell, Csatari is often viewed in the same manner, an illustrator, not an artist, who paints in overly sentimental tones when depicting people and Americana. Csatari does not mind these comparisons and critiques, nor did Rockwell. Csatari's paintings of nature are quite accurate and detailed.

Mahaperiyava's discourses have been written as magnum opus based on Hindu philosophy in a Tamil book titled \\"Deivathin Kural\\" (Voice of God).  Early life  Mahaperiyava was born on 20 May 1894. He was brought up in the central part of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Villupuram, South Arcot District. His father was Subrahmanya Sastri, who was from a Kannada speaking Smartha Brahmin family that had migrated to Tamil Nadu generations earlier. Subrahmanya Sastri worked as a teacher having entered the educational service. His mother Mahalakshmi, was also a Kannada Brahmin who belonged to the village of Icchangudi near Tiruvaiyaru. Swaminathan was the second child of his parents. Sadasiva Sastri was born on 3 October 1903 in Viluppuram, South Arcot District, Tamil Nadu. Swaminathan's upanayanam was performed in Tindivanam in 1905 and during his upbringing, he was well versed with the Vedas and start doing poojas at the early stage of his life. In 1906, the Sixty-sixth Acharya of Kamakoti Pitha, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati was camping in Perumukkal, a small village near Tindivanam in observance of the Chaturmasya vrata. Subrahmanya Sastri went to take the blessings of the Acharya at that time. The Sixty-sixth Acharya attained Siddhi at Kalavai and Swaminathan's maternal cousin was installed as the sixty-seventh Acharya. The sixty-seventh Acharya had a fever and due to the unexpected turn of events, Swaminathan was installed as the Acharya. Swaminathan ascended the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham on 13 February 1907 as the sixty-eighth Acharya with the Sannyasa name Chandrasekhara Saraswati. As per the usual training given to the seers, he was well trained with the Vedas, puranas, various Hindu texts and ancient Indian literature. The Acharya was fifteen years old in 1909. For two years, he studied under the pandits of the Matha at Kumbakonam. Then from 1911 to 1914 he studied in Mahendramangalam, in a tiny village on the Northern bank of Akhanda Kaveri. The Acharya showed interest in subjects such as photography, mathematics and astronomy as well. He returned to Kumbakonam in 1914. The Matha was managed by the Court of Wards from 1911–1915 until he turned twenty-one in May 1915.  Contributions  He started spreading his knowledge through spiritual journeys across the Indian spiritual hinterland. Through his intense devotional practices like the daily rituals such as Sandhyavandhanam, Shri Chandramouleeshwara Pooja, Shri Panchadhanya Pooja, Shri Kamakshi Amman Pooja & recital of the vedas, made him popular across countries & continents. Iyengars (who were not part of the mutt), various sub castes and Muslims & Christians became his devotees. Devotees realized he was not a normal person and found out him as a 'Jagadguru', through his practices and rectifying their issues. Mahaperiyava dedicated his life to the primary deity in the premises of Shri Kamakshi Amman temple, where goddess herself came there for her devotion to Lord Shiva. He carried the responsibility and made it a simple practice to increase devotion by chanting & writing the holy name \\"Rama Rama\\" which became a religious movement. Devotees came across different origin to give salutations for his holy feet. Populous speeches made Presidents & heads of different states/organisations/associations to be in his path of spirituality. Throughout his life he practiced Advaitha philosophy of his guru, Adi Shankara, the great Hindu philosopher and reformist. Within the course of his lifeboat, Mahaperiyava renovated multiple temples across India, increased recitals of Shri Vishnu Saharsanamam which was not allowed by women by then & various mantras towards gods, increased devotion towards Sabarimala Ayyappan Temple & Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, implemented Agama Sastra rules heavily to fructify the devotion in religious places & made social changes on allowing devotees inside the temple premises and also helped Vedic priests immensely on their pronunciation of the vedic language. His 99th birthday celebrations were celebrated by Shri Jayendrar and Shri Vijayendrar as a huge event. He passed away without celebrating his centenary on 8 January 1994. His death proved devotees to go beyond numerology and believe only the name of god in their lifespan. Shri Jayendrar & Shri Vijayendrar continued his holy work even after his death unlike other Shishyas to gurus. His devotional practices were followed by his devotees. Lifespan became one of the foremost to experience a divine sojourn.  Discourses  As a religious head like his founder of the mutt, the great Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara, he travelled across the country on a palanquin and started giving discourses. On several occasions, he addressed the common masses on diverse aspects of our Dharma, ancient culture, and a variety of subjects. He delivered the discourses on simple verandahs, river beds and sabhas (smaller halls) unlike the 21st century. The discourses delivered decades ago in Tamil & other multiple languages by him and are compiled and published in English and Tamil as \\"Deivathin Kural\\" (The Voice of God) by his disciple R.Ganapathi, published by Vanathi Pathippagam (Publishers). It has been translated to English as well as several Indian languages. Discourses were related to various subjects across different topics which are well researched and well advised. His discourses were the difference for his devotees when the whole nation was suffering from a distress from ancient culture & devotion. He brought back the practices of Sanatana dharma effectively through nook and corners of the country which reflected in starting various Veda paatashalas (schools).  Dignitaries who have met the Acharya  As a Jagadguru, he was popular with dignitaries including the King and Queen of Nepal, the Queen Mother of Greece, the Dalai Lama, Sathya Sai Baba, Mahatma Gandhi, C. Rajagopalachari, M. S. Subbulakshmi, Indira Gandhi, R. Venkataraman, Subramanian Swamy, Shankar Dayal Sharma, MGR, Jayalalitha, Karunanidhi, Kalki Krishnamurthy, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth, Kamalhassan, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Prannoy Roy, Amitabh Bachchan, R. P. Goenka, Birla Family, JRD Tata and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  Sri Sivan SAR, also called Sri Siva Periyava  His younger brother is Sri Sadasivan, popularly known as Sivan SAR. Sri Sivan SAR was born on 3 October 1903 in Viluppuram, South Arcot District, Tamil Nadu. Sri Mahaperiyava while speaking to one of his devotees has mentioned that Sri Sivan SAR at birth itself was a Gynani. He has written a book titled Yenippadigalil Maanthargal. Yenippadigalil Maanthargal is ~650 pages with very intricate details that Sri Sivan SAR has elucidated on various topics. Sri Sivan SAR mentions in the introduction that he desires the world to have good people. Throughout the book, Sri Sivan SAR has showered his guidance that awakens us to details in our way of life to lead a more righteous one. The organization of the initial topics is profound. The book outlines the characteristics of 11 gradations in human life: Paavi, Pamaran, Viveki, Sadhu, Sirandha Viveki, Muttrina Viveki, Deiva Viveki, Devia Sadhu, Mahaan, Thuravi, Gynani. The first part of the book has contents such as Culture, Universal religion - \\"Devia Madham\\", Vedas, the importance of cows, thoughtless use of science, the impurity in gluten and alternate choice such as Spelt and details of Roman Mythology, Egyptian Civilization, Persian war, etc. The second part of the book covers key incidents from the lives of many evolved souls who lived their lives as humans, and were tested but persevered the twists and turns of their fate. Stories of Karaikal Ammaiyar, Theertha Narayanar, Narayana Theerthar, Nandhanar, Badrachala Ramadas, ChinnanSamiyar, Sadasiva Brahamam are just a few to name from the book. In all the chapters Sri Sivan SAR calls out attention to specifics that act as a guiding light to refine our behavior. The book's content was written by Sri Sivan SAR without any physical references. Sri Sivan SAR's handwriting is impeccable. Sri Sivan SAR's drawings and maps of many regions of the world is amazing. He has mentioned to many of his devotees that HE is in the book.  Influence on Indian Freedom Movement  Saraswati reconverted Indian National Congress leader F. G. Natesa Iyer from Christianity to Hinduism. Iyer, as a boy of ten, \\"took shelter with Englishmen who brought him up and converted him to Christianity. Twenty years later, dissatisfied with the ability of the priests to clarify his doubts, he met the Kanchi Sankaracharya and, getting satisfactory answers from him, reconverted to Hinduism.\\" The Indian National Congress, in the decade of the 1920s, started organising the Non-Cooperation Movement, which involved getting many people to protest on the streets. F.G.Natesa Iyer, the leading Congress activist of Tiruchirappalli then, as also the elected Mayor, took this opportunity to convert the movement to also show support for the Periyava. He described the occasion, thus: \\"I was nominated by the public as the chairman of the Reception Committee for arranging a reception for the Acharya of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. As the municipal chairman, it was my duty to provide a proper welcome and respect to Swamigal who was visiting after a long time. The opportunity to welcome His Holiness in a manner that was exponentially greater than receptions given to kings and viceroys, was accorded to me, along with my supporters: Sri M.Kandaswamy Servai, Sri. R.Srinivasa Iyengar, the lawyer and the larger public. The procession that was seven miles long, was preceded by seven groups of nadaswaram players, three band groups, four elephants, many horses and camels, instrumental players, Bhajan singers, Seva Samitis. I had the blessing to hold the front side of the ivory palanquin where our guru for the whole world, Sri Sankaracharya Swamigal was seated. He gave darshan to numerous people lined on both sides of the roads, in every floor, irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. There was no count of arathis, Poorna kumbams, garlands, asthika goshams. The procession that started at 6 pm ended at 10 pm in front of the mutt at Thiruvanaikkaval. I was enthralled in my service to Swamigal as service to Lord Shiva himself\\". The day India became independent, he gave a speech on the significance of the flag and the Dharma chakra in it on that day.From a Calendar Published on Behalf of the Mutt in 1997 – 50th Year of India Independence. In his own words “I had a bath at the Kumara Koshta Thirtha. A carriage of the Mutt had come there from Kalavai with the people to buy articles for the Maha Puja on the tenth day of the passing of the previous 66th Acharya. One of them, a hereditary maistry (mason) of the Mutt, asked me to accompany him. A separate cart was engaged for the rest of the family to follow me. During the journey the maistry hinted to me that I might not return home and that the rest of my life might be spent in the Mutt itself. At first I thought that my elder cousin having become the Head of the Mutt, it was his wish that I should live with him. But the maistry gradually clarified matters as the cart rolled on. The Acharya had fever which developed into delirium and that was why I was being separated from the family to be taken to Kalavai… I was stunned by this unexpected turn of events. I lay in a kneeling posture in the cart, shocked as I was, repeating “Rama… Rama,” the only prayer I knew. My mother and other children came some time later only to find that instead of her mission of consoling her sister, she herself was placed in the state of having to be consoled”. —T.M.P.

Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and Sun and the rotation of Earth. Tidal range is not constant but changes depending on the locations of the Moon and Sun. The most extreme tidal range occurs during spring tides, when the gravitational forces of both the Moon and Sun are aligned (syzygy), reinforcing each other in the same direction (new moon) or in opposite directions (full moon). During neap tides, when the Moon and Sun's gravitational force vectors act in quadrature (making a right angle to the Earth's orbit), the difference between high and low tides is smaller. Neap tides occur during the first and last quarters of the Moon's phases. The largest annual tidal range can be expected around the time of the equinox if it coincides with a spring tide. Tidal data for coastal areas is published by national hydrographic services.Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agencies The data is based on astronomical phenomena and is predictable. Sustained storm-force winds blowing from one direction combined with low barometric pressure can increase the tidal range, particularly in narrow bays. Such weather-related effects on the tide, which can cause ranges in excess of predicted values and can cause localized flooding, are not calculable in advance. Mean tidal range is calculated as the difference between Mean High Water (i.e., the average high tide level) and Mean Low Water (the average low tide level).  Geography  The typical tidal range in the open ocean is about (blue and green on the map on the right). Closer to the coast, this range is much greater. Coastal tidal ranges vary globally and can differ anywhere from near zero to over 16 metres. The exact range depends on the volume of water adjacent to the coast, and the geography of the basin the water sits in. Larger bodies of water have higher ranges, and the geography can act as a funnel amplifying or dispersing the tide. The world's largest tidal range of occurs in Bay of Fundy, Canada, and the United Kingdom regularly experiences tidal ranges up to between England and Wales in the Severn Estuary. The fifty coastal locations with the largest tidal ranges worldwide are listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States. Some of the smallest tidal ranges occur in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Caribbean Seas. A point within a tidal system where the tidal range is almost zero is called an amphidromic point. cotidal lines spaced at phase intervals of 30° (a bit over 1 hr).Picture credit: R.

Not all towns have one student apply, usually one or more seek admission to the Monmouth County Full-Time Vocational Schools. All other students are chosen based on rank and test admission score. There is also a waiting list. It is used not only when students decline their admission, but also when students drop out to return to their home high schools. Schedule The school uses a block schedule. There are four classes in a day, and periods are an hour and twenty-five minutes long. School begins at 7:35 am and ends at 2:25 pm. The first four to five classes are taken in the first half of the school year, and the next four to five are taken in the second. Some classes, including electives, alternate with Fitness. The first two periods take place from 7:35 am – 10:27 am (with a two-minute break in between periods). From 10:27 am – 11:27 am there is a one-hour activity period, where students eat lunch, participate in clubs, or overall relax. From 11:27 am – 2:25 pm the final two periods take place.  Curriculum  = Freshman year = The following classes are required during freshman year: Dynamics of Healthcare, Computer Applications, Math (Algebra I or Geometry), Foreign Language (Latin I or Spanish I or II), Biology, Intro to Anatomy and Physiology (Allied Health Clinical Skills), World History, Fitness I and English I.Academics, Academy of Allied Health & Science. Accessed September 4, 2014. There are nine required classes total: Algebra I or Geometry, English I, World History, Allied Health Clinical Skills, Dynamics of Healthcare, Latin I or Spanish I/II, Computer Applications, Biology I, and Fitness I. There are no electives in freshman year. The \\"Dynamics of Healthcare\\" course incorporates learning about health insurance, legal terms, healthcare facilities, professional behavior, and medical history. It is administered by the Rutgers School of Health Related Professions. The \\"Financial Literacy\\" course has been replaced with \\"Allied Health Clinical Skills,\\" which addresses (as indicated by its name) the clinical side of the healthcare profession. This switch took place in 2013 and Financial Literacy has been moved to Junior Year. Note: Since the 2012–2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. Rahul Yerrabelli did this and took an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. There is now a Statistics class taught by a new teacher for the 2018–2019 school year. Instead of taking an art class, students must complete a \\"Visual & Performing Arts\\" assignment before November of their sophomore year. = Sophomore year = The following classes are required during sophomore year: Anatomy and Physiology I, Math: Algebra II or Geometry, Foreign Language: Latin II or Spanish II or III, Chemistry, English II, Fitness II, Principles of Computer Technology, Healthy Relations (a guidance/sex ed course) and US History I. There are no electives in sophomore year. In Anatomy and Physiology I course, students volunteer two hours on Fridays for six weeks at Jersey Shore University Medical Center at a different department each week. Departments that can be assigned include NICU, occupational therapy, laboratory, patient transport, and various nursing floors. At the end of the Anatomy course, students take a Rutgers-issued exam for college credits in Anatomy I and Dynamics of Healthcare. Note: Since the 2012–2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. It has not been decided if this will be standard for later years for students in the program. = Junior year = Students have no electives in this year. During junior year, students continue their learning in Anatomy and Physiology II. Students will again take a similar college-level test for college credits for the Anatomy II course and for Medical Terminology. Students also participate in the Grant Writing/Service Learning class, which teaches students the various aspects of helping their communities. Much volunteer work is involved as the class sponsors activities such as coat or book drives. Note: Since the 2012–2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. There is only 1 junior who is in this case. He is taking an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. In 2018, a new Statistics teacher was hired to teach the class of about 20 juniors. The class uses an AP textbook but is not an AP class, however, students can take the AP tests by themselves with not much preparation after the course. Other required courses are: Financial Literacy, Nutrition (Dual-Enrollment), Algebra II or Pre- calculus, English III, U.S. History II, Physics, Fitness III, and Latin II or Spanish III/IV. = Senior year = Students take a \\"mentorship\\" course. Students choose a \\"mentor,\\" and must relate their mentorship to the medical field. There are exceptions to the rule of medical involvement, as long as students can prove they are gaining valuable experience in a professional field. Seniors go to their mentorship site three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) for three hours a day during the second half of the school day. Students have worked with local medical centers, specialized private clinics (ranging from sports medicine to urology), and miscellaneous sites such as a college radio station. Notably, students can fail mentorship if they are kicked out of the hospital, so it is a very formal and strict relationship. The following medical courses are available: EMT, Physical Therapy, Sign Language, and Alternative Medicine. Other required courses include: Biology, English IV, Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and Chemistry. Foreign Language is not required, and can be replaced by an elective. The Fitness program is also no longer an in- school class for seniors, and instead involves filling out an online set of forms.  Clubs and activities The academy has many different clubs in many different areas. Clubs usually meet during lunch, but sometimes meet after school. Anyone can join most clubs, but some have requirements. Most notably, HOSA requires members to be juniors or seniors and officers to be seniors, NHS requires members to be juniors or seniors with a 92 (A) GPA and to do volunteer work, and Character Committee has a selection process including interviews. Every club runs year long, except Mock Trial (first semester only) and Model UN (second semester only). =Team Allied= One main goal of Team Allied (formerly known as Character Committee) is to help new students at the academy feel welcome. Team Allied is unique in that it is the only club that is a four-year commitment, requiring members to sign up in the early spring of their freshmen year. Still, many apply to the club. To keep the club small, there is a highly selective process to determine which applicants are admitted which includes an interview. =Math Club= Math Club emphasizes a love of math. The club meets every second and fourth Tuesday. Math League tests are given 6 times a year and are open to all students. The tests occur during lunch and the time limit is 30 minutes for 6 questions of increasing difficulty (many finish earlier). The highest monthly and cumulative scores are recorded and compared with other schools within the MCVSD district. There is also the AMC test which only occurs once a year. This test has only started to be implemented in 2019–2020 school year. =Global Forum (Discontinued)= Global Forum is a club that focuses on free discussion. Global Forum meets every Friday at the second half of lunch. Most of meetings are debates among its members on a specific topic. These debates do not have an informal atmosphere with calling out as the main form of communication. Topics depend on current events, but frequently include gun control, military action, criticism/defense of the president's actions, etc. There also occasional fundraisers for charitable organizations like UNICEF and Red Cross. Finally, Global Forum provides a \\"This Day in History...\\" fact every Wednesday and Friday on the morning video announcements. Global Forum was discontinued before 2016. =Mock Trial= Mock Trial meets in the first semester only. Mock Trial participates, often successfully, in a tournament with other schools. The members pretend to be lawyers, witnesses, etc. and perform a trial hearing. Many members in Mock Trial are also in Model UN. =Model UN= Model UN only occurs on the second half the year. It starts just when Mock Trial ends and is run by the same teacher. Its meetings times are usually Wednesday on the second half of lunch. As the name implies, the club is about imitating a UN meeting. Each member has a country and the members debate an issue. Usually, Model UN competes in one tournament with other schools every year. =Science League= Science League was started in the 2013–2014 school year. Most of its meetings are after school. The club has a large number of competitions, including NJSL, US Biology Olympiad, US Chemistry Olympiad, Merck Test, etc. All of the tests are one day events, except for NJSL. There are four NJSL tests (January, February, March, April) every year. There are many subjects with each subject having 1-3 levels of difficulty. There are plaque for individuals who score in the highest 10% in the state in their respective subject and level. Team plaques are also given to the top 10 teams in the state for each subject and level. In the 2013–2014 school year, Science League chose to participate in four teams: Biology I, Biology II, Chemistry I, and Chemistry II. In the 2014 Biology Olympiad, 4 students, a remarkably high number, of students qualified as semifinalists. Approximately 600 high school students qualify nationwide for this. All four semifinalists were juniors. In 2018, four seniors got 7th place in the New Jersey Science League Biology I Competition. In 2019, the same four seniors and one additional one got 6th place in the New Jersey Science League Chemistry I Competition. =Academic Team= Academic Team was started in the 2018–2019 school year, and it takes place year-round. The team consists of an \\"A\\" team and a \\"B\\" team. These teams were determined by performance on multiple tryout examinations. The \\"A\\" team have received several accolades, including 3rd Place at the High Technology High School Quiz Bowl Competition, and 2nd place at the Biotechnology Quiz Bowl. =Red Cross= A branch of the Health Occupations Students of America, this club serves to primarily organize fundraisers and food drives for people in need. In the past, they have hosted successful Can Drives, Letters for Veterans, and blood drives. The club was founded by Ashlesha Thorat (Class of 2021), and the current President is Amol Shirodkar (Class of 2020). =Other clubs= Other clubs include HOSA, art club, tech club, yearbook, 4-H, pulse (started in 2013–2014 school year), and NHS.

Accessed September 4, 2015.  History  The school opened in 1996. The school's early development, including construction and curriculum creation, was overseen by Timothy M. McCorkell, who was the school's first principal until the end of the 2001–02 school year, when he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent at Monmouth County Vocational School District. He was later Superintendent in 2009. Following McCorkell was Scott Taylor. Taylor resigned after the 2004–05 school year to take a position at the Little Silver School District. Robert V. Cancro took the position after Scott Taylor left. In 1997, the first \\"Color Wars\\" took place. Originally, two teams were made by splitting the student body into two groups by homerooms. Students were pitted against students in their own grade. It is a battle of the classes event, with the freshman and senior classes (taking the school color blue) pitted against the sophomore and junior classes (taking the school color gray) in a week-long series of competitive events, which include ultimate frisbee, pudding eating, tug of war, a medical challenge, student and faculty volleyball, an original skit, and one or more \\"mystery events\\". It takes place in late May. Beforehand, the teams must choose a team name incorporating the color. As of the 2011–12 school year, the blue team has won four times, and the gray team has won four times. In the 2011–2012 school year, the gray team won. Then the blue team won in the 2012–2013 school year against the gray team (called the Gray Avengers). Finally, in the 2013–2014 school year, the gray team (called the Holy Grayl) won against the blue team (Bluminati). Furthermore, no class has won all four years, but the classes of 2010 and 2011 came very close (each with 3-1). As of early 2017, the class of 2018 has 3 wins, and they hope to have their fourth win in spring 2018. However, the class of 2012 lost all four years. Teacher Chris Benson and the Student Council are in charge of planning and managing the events. Starting in the 2004–05 school year, the school began phasing out its French Language program, due to core curriculum conflicts. The final French students graduated in 2008. Following Robert Cancro's retirement at the end of the 2010–11 school year, Paul Mucciarone became principal. He is the principal. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1981, and is a retired Lt. Commander of the US Navy. He served, primarily as an engineer, on several ships. He became teacher of Naval Science at the Marine Academy of Science and Technology in Sandy Hook in August 2001. In late 2011, the principal authorized the removal of the school's web filter of Facebook. This followed one of the sister schools removing their own filter.

The ferry was built in 1992 with funds from Chongryon, the pro-North Korean General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, and was used to transport passengers and cargo between North Korea and Japan. These voyages continued until 2006 when Japan banned North Korean ships from its waters. In 2011 the ship trialed a route between Rason and Mount Kumgang. In 2018, the ship carried a 140 person delegation, as well as an art troupe, for the 2018 Winter Olympics and docked in Mukho port. Background School children pass Man Gyong Bong 92 in North Korea. The first Man Gyong Bong ship had its maiden voyage in September 1971, amidst Japan’s easing restrictions on visits to North Korea by Zainichi Koreans. It was used to transport people between North Korea and Japan until it was replaced by the Man Gyong Bong 92 in 1992. The Man Gyong Bong 92 was constructed using a donation of 4 billion yen (approximately US $32 million) from the Japanese-based Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan). The organisation gave the money to North Korea as a gift for Kim Il-sung’s 80th birthday in 1992. The ferry could carry 200 passengers and 1,000 tons of cargo. Before Japan banned all North Korean vessels from its waters in 2006, it made about one to two round trips per month between the Port of Niigata, Japan and Wonsan, North Korea, with a one-way trip lasting about 28 hours. Most of the passengers were North Korean zainichi visiting relatives or students of a Chongryon school on a study trip. Cargo shipped from Japan was typically electronics, medical devices, and foreign-made manufactured goods. In August 1993, a first-class ticket on the Man Gyong Bong 92 would cost about US $1,500 each.\\"Food Riotsspreading,Travellersreport: FINAL Edition.\\" The Vancouver Sun: A.8. 1993. Controversy with Japan In September 2002, the North Korean government admitted to abducting several Japanese citizens throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. This admission caused people to believe the first Man Gyong Bong, operating since 1971, was used to transport these abductees to North Korea.\\"Sailing Across A Sea Of Trouble.\\" J@Pan Inc 48 (2003): 6-7. Business Source Complete. Web. 16 Apr. 2015. This assumption sparked further suspicion surrounding the ferry’s successor, the Man Gyong Bong 92, that was still in operation. The main allegation against the Man Gyong Bong 92 was that it allowed the smuggling of illegal items to and from Japan. Specifically, it was believed that drugs and weapons were being smuggled into Japan, and cash, missile parts, and other potentially dangerous technology were secretly being taken to North Korea. These suspicions were supported by several confessions made in 2003 by former North Korean citizens and allies. In late January 2003, Kim Sang-gyu, a former senior official of Chongryon, admitted to running an espionage network in Japan for North Korea until 2000. He confessed to receiving his orders from Pyongyang through various high-ranking crew members aboard the Man Gyong Bong 92. On May 20, 2003, a former North Korean missile scientist testified at a U.S. Senate hearing that the Man Gyong Bong 92 transported 90% of the missile parts used by North Korea. These components were suspected of having been obtained from typical Japanese electronics such as game consoles and digital cameras, which would also make them easier to smuggle out of the country. In August 2003, the Yomiuri Shinbun reported that a North Korean defector confessed to smuggling drugs for North Korea into Japan through the Man Gyong Bong 92. He would deliver these drugs to a member of Chongryon, who would then deliver the drugs to the Japanese yakuza. This confession supported the U.S. State Department testimonies made in May of that year, that North Korea’s methamphetamine market in Japan provided the government with a profit of up to US $7 billion. These allegations were denied by both the North Korean government and the head of Chongryon's foreign affairs bureau, So Chung-on. While there was not enough evidence to support these allegations, that didn’t stop Japanese suspicions. Since the abduction admission, Japan began a stricter enforcement of regulations on North Korean vessels, especially the Man Gyong Bong 92. In one instance, the threat of a thorough inspection supposedly caused the Man Gyong Bong 92 to remain in North Korea and to cancel its voyage, one that was to be the first to Japan in five months.\\"Mangyongbong Issue Not to Affect Multilateral Talks: Fukuda.\\" Jiji Press English News Service: 1. 2003. Japanese ban On July 5, 2006, North Korea launched seven missiles, one of which was a long-range Taepodong-2 missile capable of reaching Alaska. While all missiles landed in the Sea of Japan, Japan responded by banning the Man Gyong Bong 92 from Japanese waters for six months. In early October 2006, this ban became permanent and was imposed on all North Korean vessels, following North Korea’s nuclear tests. Implementation for tourism With the Man Gyong Bong 92 no longer able to make its intended trip to Japan, North Korea refurbished the ferry to serve as a cruise ship. The Man Gyong Bong 92's new route traveled along the east coast of North Korea between Rason, in the northeast, and Mount Kumgang, near the South Korean border. The purpose of this cruise was to boost North Korea’s tourism, the one industry that is exempt from United Nations economic sanctions. The tourists would meet in Yanji, China and drive three hours to Rason, North Korea. The Man Gyong Bong 92 would take them to Mount Kumgang, a scenic tourist destination complete with beaches and a golf resort. This area was jointly operated by North and South Korea until the fatal shooting of a South Korean tourist by a North Korean soldier in 2008, upon which all South Korean property was seized by the North. The trial run of the cruise took place in late August 2011. Many of the approximately 200 passengers were travel agents, media, and North Korean officials, with some paying about US $470 for the 5-day trip on both land and sea. The trip south to Mount Kumgang took about 21 hours while the trip back took about 22 hours. In contrast to the lavish send-off the ship received in Rason, the passengers were cramped into bedrooms and were assigned either a wooden bunk bed or a mattress on the floor. Meals were also simple and served “cafeteria-style”. In February 2013, North Korea reported replacing the Man Gyon Bong 92 with a Singaporean cruise ship called the Royale Star. Satellite images subsequently placed the Man Gyong Bong 92 in Wonsan Harbor. Current status In September 2014, North Korea was expected to send a report to Japan that addressed the fate of the 1970s-1980s abductees. In August, though, the country made further requests for Japan to ease sanctions and provide further humanitarian aid in return for the report. These requests were suspected to be aimed at the allowance of the Man Gyong Bong 92 into Japanese waters. In March 2015, Japan continued to apply sanctions against North Korea when no further reports were made regarding the abductees, leaving the Man Gyong Bong 92 anchored in Wonsan. In 2017, the ferry performed a trial run between Rason and Vladivostok, Russia. In February 2018, the ship docked at Mukho, South Korea, carrying a 140-person orchestra for the 2018 Winter Olympics. The ship also carried an art troupe and was the first North Korean ship to arrive in South Korea since 2002. 2018 Winter Olympics This ship carried, among other people, a 150 person North Korean delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics to the port of Mukho, under a special exemption from a 16 year ban on North Korean vessels. It was subsequently greeted by protesters opposing North Korea and Kim Jong-un, and protesters singing \\"Aegukga\\", the National Anthem of South Korea. Significance As the primary connection between North Korea and Japan, the Man Gyong Bong 92 was extremely important to North Koreans living in Japan. For many, it offered the only contact with family members residing in North Korea. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a mass repatriation of Zainichi from Japan to the seemingly rich and prosperous North Korea. While this movement began to die down soon afterwards, over 93,000 Koreans and about 6,000 Japanese moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, each of them forced to remain there due to North Korea’s strict laws. As a result, this separation became a convenient way for North Korea to maintain the loyalty from repatriated citizens’ family members in Japan. Nevertheless, both the first Man Gyong Bong and the Man Gyong Bong 92 offered a connection between families that were commonly separated from this movement. The Man Gyong Bong 92 was also extremely important to Chongryon as it brought them money and gifts from the North Korean government. The presence of Chongryon and the Man Gyong Bong 92, though, was perceived as a threat towards the Japanese by having the \\"enemy\\" in their own backyard. In response, political moves, such as the creation of the NARKN, have taken place. Social changes have occurred as well where Koreans, particular students at Chongryon schools, are harassed. And suspicions of North Korean ploys, like those regarding the Man Gyong Bong 92 smugglings, would only increase the intensity of this behavior.

They stop in the town of Alcalá de Henares to stay for the night. While there, Diego tells Simón that he is engaged to Francisca. He has never met the girl before, but her mother, Irene, has assured him, mostly through letters, that the girl is delighted to be marrying him. Diego has been looking for a wife with whom he can share friendship and mutual respect; he says that impassioned love is too emotional to be well thought out. But, he is attracted to Francisca's youth and innocence, and plans to marry her as soon as they arrive in Madrid the next morning. This certainly heats up the affair situation. He doesn't want anyone to know about it until the marriage is finalized, because he isn't sure how his friends and relatives will view his marrying such a young girl. Simón is dubious, but Diego pays him no mind. However, he expresses concern over the fact that Francisca never says she loves him and has never explicitly consented to the marriage. Irene assures him that it would be improper for a girl to express such feelings in front of a man, and that Francisca tells Irene all the time about how wonderful Diego is. A servant named Calamocha arrives at the house (which also rents rooms to travelers) to tell Rita, Francisca's servant, that he and his master have ridden all the way from Zaragoza to stop the wedding. He exits as Rita goes to tell Francisca the good news. Later, Francisca, almost in sobs, expresses to Rita her displeasure at the prospect of marrying Don Diego. It is revealed that Francisca has fallen in love over the summer with a young man named Félix, in spite of living in a convent with her aunt. However, Francisca fears that, in her absence, Félix is already involved with other lovers and will ignore the letter that she sent him. Finally, Rita tells her that Félix has already come to Alcalá to help her, and Francisca immediately feels better. =Act 2= While they wait for Félix, Irene has a talk with Francisca about why she should be happy to get married: Diego is very rich, and Irene doesn't have anyone to take care of her except for Francisca. Also, Irene herself has married older men three different times and it has always worked out, so Francisca shouldn't have anything to worry about. She even goes so far as to threaten Francisca, who starts to feel that she cannot disobey her mother. Félix then arrives and tells Paquita (a diminutive of Francisca) that she has nothing to worry about, because he has a rich uncle in Madrid that will use his money and influence to stop the marriage and allow Paquita to marry Félix. She starts to cry because she feels so torn between her filial duties and her great love for Félix. Francisca and Rita must go to Irene's room, and Simón and Calamocha enter separately. They recognize each other and ask why each has come to Alcalá. However, Calamocha cannot reveal that Félix has come for personal reasons, and Simón has been charged to keep the wedding a secret, so each man pretends not to understand the other's questions. They stall until Diego shows up. It is then revealed that \\"Félix\\" is actually don Carlos, the nephew of don Diego who has been stationed with his regiment in Zaragoza. Carlos says that he was on his way to Madrid so that he could visit his uncle. Diego is suspicious of this reason and orders Carlos to go back to Zaragoza immediately. Carlos protests that the horses are too tired, so Diego, still trying to hide the fact that he is engaged, sends Carlos somewhere else to spend the night. As Diego is like a father to him, Carlos cannot disobey, so he and Calamocha leave without an opportunity to explain to Francisca what is going on. =Act 3= In the middle of the night, Carlos plays music in the street so that Francisca will hear him, and he throws a letter for her through the window. However, Diego finds it, having already witnessed the entire episode. He sends Simón to get Carlos while he finally talks to Francisca about the marriage. Francisca, heartbroken, says that she'll do as her mother orders, even though she will be unhappy. When Carlos arrives, Diego deliberately provokes him to see how much he cares for Francisca. Carlos proves that theirs is not an illicit love, but rather they have spent 90 days just talking to one another and have thus fallen in love. However, Carlos offers to abandon Francisca if that is what his uncle would command. Diego realizes that he has been as commandeering to Carlos as Irene has been to Francisca, for which Diego has already criticized her. Finally, Diego decides that it would be better for Francisca to have free choice of what she wants to do, and she decides to marry Carlos. Interpretation =Social criticism= Diego's behavior is an example of poder ilustrado, (\\"enlightened power\\"), a kind of powerful man who factors reason and logic into his decision-making process. All of the characters demonstrate a high sense of decorum, as befits a neoclassical work. On many occasions a character seems about to get angry but always calms him/herself down so as not to be ruled by chaotic emotions. The play is occasionally criticized as being somewhat misogynistic in that the women of the story sometimes trick the male characters, and are examples of old regime, non-enlightened characters. However, the male characters trick others also, such as when Calamocha and Simón are attempting to conceal their own purposes for having come to Alcalá, or when Diego pretends that he doesn't know about the relationship between Francisca and Carlos in order to find out how she really feels. By contemporary standards, this would never be considered a feminist work. However, Moratín was commenting on the social institutions of his own day in Spain, compared to which his ideas are positively enlightened. Commonly, a girl's parents would either find a husband for her or make her become a nun. Females were taught to obey and always be silent, which is exactly what Francisca does. Moratín criticizes this through Diego, who becomes frustrated by the elliptical conversations he has to have with Francisca because she cannot say what she truly feels. Also, by having the happy ending be that Francisca gets to choose her husband, Moratín advocates free choice for women, which was a fairly radical viewpoint for his time. =Symbolism= Light and darkness have a strong presence in the play. Light is often associated with Carlos/Félix, representing the passionate love that he has for Paquita. Rita is often the bearer of lights, both because that is the realistic job of a servant and also because she usually knows the true nature of different situations. All of the servants are the voices of reason throughout the play. They calm their masters down and help them to decipher the truth through all the mistaken situations and identities. Although everyone (except Irene) maintains their decorum at all times, the servants help them maintain inner stability as well. Moratín criticizes some women of the upper classes through Irene. She is irritatingly needy and selfish and complains constantly. She tries to manipulate both Francisca and Diego in order to make her own life more comfortable.

The band was formed in early 2003 by Martin Tomlinson and Patrick Constable, and was noted for provocative lyrics, aggressive stage shows, and electronic-influenced rock. Their mix of electric guitar and electronic drum machines was typically accompanied by politically charged and often sexually graphic lyrics. Later becoming a four-piece band through the addition of drums, bass guitar and ceasing to use a drum machine, they developed a sound which incorporated elements of punk and post hardcore. Reaction from critics was mixed. In 2004 The Guardian placed Selfish Cunt at #40 on its list of \\"top 40 bands in Britain today\\". History Selfish Cunt was formed in 2003 at the start of a post-punk revival. Blackburn-born frontman Tomlinson was working in theatre, while guitarist Patrick Constable was playing in the art rock band Dirty Snow. Tomlinson stated: \\"We decided to do Selfish Cunt because although we're from really different practices, the connection is music.\\" After touring small clubs, mainly in London, the duo released the single \\"Britain Is Shit\\" / \\"Fuck The Poor\\"; a second single, \\"Authority Confrontation\\", briefly entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 66. Selfish Cunt were banned from the Institute of Contemporary Arts, The Rocks, and The Egg after a series of destructive acts, including the sabotage of the band Snow Patrol's equipment. A brawl outside of Buckingham Palace involving Tomlinson, Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty, Dominic Masters of The Others, and photographer Andrew Kendall during an NME photoshoot was reported in the press in 2004.

History The original Denbigh School opened September 1964 where half of Wilton high's students were part of the initial intake for the school, which was located on land at the northern end of Cornwall Grove in Bletchley. In the 1980s, the Local Education Authority resolved to relocate either Denbigh or (nearby) Lord Grey School (Formerly Wilton) to Shenley Church End, a few miles to the north. Eventually Denbigh was chosen to move. In 1991-1992 term years 8 and 9 were located at the new school and other years located at the old one, the school was still in the process of being built at the time. All years moved into the new school in July 1992. When the Shenley site opened in 1991, the site had the following areas completed, Humanities Block, Maths block 50% (Upstairs) Science Block, Technology Block, IT Room, Music Rooms, Sports hall (shared with Shenley Leisure Centre), the dining room and \\"the street\\" (an indoor communal area). Throughout that year, the English block was completed by Christmas and the playing fields by summer (prior to this the pupils in the school did outdoor PE at Loughton Middle school (Loughton County Combined School at the time) playing fields or were bussed to the Bletchley site). In 1992 the school was completed at its next phase with art rooms, an extended maths block, Modern Language block, 6th Form Block, Meeting Hall and gymnasium all opening. Later extensions of the school involved a further extension to the art design and technology area and more recently an extended 6th form block. With the increasing popularity of IT part of the Maths block has become an ICT suite. , the school plans to turn its original meeting hall (opened in 1992) into a sixth form area soon after a new extension (then underway) is completed, in which there will be a new meeting hall and a new art, drama, and music department. The new extension is planned to be opened on Monday 13 April 2015.School web site =Old site= Shortly after the move from Bletchley, the old school was demolished. However the site remained unused for some years before it was built on as an extension to the \\"Counties\\" estate in Bletchley. Present day , the school has 1763 students with 419 being in Sixth form. The school gained specialist Technology College in 1997 under the management of Roger Connibear which entitled it to money from the Government to fund its DT facilities, computer rooms, and its further activities - such as Further Maths at A level. The Current Head of School is Dr A Frame, who in charge of Denbigh, however Andy Squires remains as Executive Headteacher- who became deputy head teacher in 1997. His predecessor was Sarah Parker in 2014, who took over from Roger Connibear in 2005, who took over from Gillian Parkinson in 1993 - The latter being involved in overseeing the move to Shenley from Cornwall Grove Bletchley. In 2007 students from the school won the BBC's national Schools Question Time Competition. Students from Denbigh, and from three other winning schools, helped to produce an episode of the show, which was broadcast on 5 July 2007.

At the time of filming, McCarthy and Asher were married; they divorced the month the film was released. Playing heavily off McCarthy's reputation for toilet humor, the film was critically panned and was a box-office bomb; it also received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, as well as Worst Screenplay, Worst Director, and Worst Actress for McCarthy. Plot Struggling photographer Rebecca Sommers finds her model boyfriend Richard in bed with another woman. Her life falls apart, and she alternates between desire for revenge upon him, sexual promiscuity, and abandonment of all hope of love. Her best friends, Michelle and Carrie, try to set her up on dates. These include one with a freakish magician and another with a man who gives her ecstasy and has a fetish for fish. She attempts to make Richard jealous by taking a director, who is reminiscent of Woody Allen, to a runway show, but he ends up vomiting on her breasts in front of everyone. Ultimately, Rebecca realizes she should focus her energy on being with someone who truly loves her, and that turns out to be John, her nerdy but caring best male friend who has been supportive of her through the entire ordeal.

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 7% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 2.2/10.

Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a rare zero star rating and said it was the third-worst film of 2005. In his written review, he stated, \\"Here is a film so pitiful, it doesn't rise to the level of badness. It is hopelessly incompetent.\\" Not all reviews were negative. Oz of eFilmCritic gave the film 3/5 and said \\"Dirty Love is a surprisingly good effort that will fall short only because of poor direction, poor editing, and the stigma of the lead having only previously been involved in crap.\\" Jeremy C. Fox of Pajiba said that although the film is not for everyone, \\"Dirty Love is in the worst possible taste. It has crossed the Himalayas of bad taste and come out the other side.

After retiring from the army in 1993, he became a social critic and the founder of Movement for Unity and Progress, a political party. Birth and education Umar was born on 21 September 1949 in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State. His father was a school teacher and administrator with the traditional title of Wazirin Gwandu who became a member of the House of Representatives in Lagos (1954 - 1964) and Commissioner for Works in the North-Western State (1968 - 1975). He was educated at Government College, Sokoto (1964 - 1968), Nigeria Defence Academy, Kaduna, (1967 - 1972), Nigeria Army Armored School, Ibadan, (1972), US Army Administration School, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, USA (1976), Royal Armour School, Kentucky, USA (1977 - 1978), Command and Staff College, Jaji (1978 - 1979 and 1982 - 1983), Bayero University, Kano (1979 - 1981), Harvard University, USA (1988 - 1989). Military career Umar joined the Nigerian Army in 1967 and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in March 1972. He held various positions, including ADC to Major General Hassan Usman Katsina, Deputy Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters. Umar was appointed General Staff Officer in the Department of Armour, Army Headquarters. At the time of the coup of 27 August 1985 in which General Ibrahim Babangida assumed power he was a Major and Chairman of the Federal Housing Authority (1984 - 1985). He supported the coup, and after it succeeded he was appointed Governor of Kaduna State. Later he was promoted to Lt. Colonel. Umar was Military Governor of Kaduna State from September 1985 to June 1988, during a period when funding was scarce. He had to deal with a serious religious crisis within the state in 1987, becoming unpopular with all sides of the dispute. He said \\"If you win a religious war, you cannot win a religious peace [...] Since the killing started how many Christians have been converted to Islam? How many Muslims have been converted to Christianity? It is an exercise in futility\\". In 1993, he was Colonel and Commander of the Armoured Corps Center and School. He was opposed to the annulment of the 12 June 1993 presidential election, and started looking for support within the army for installing the elected president M.K.O. Abiola. In October, he was detained on suspicion of conspiracy, but was not charged. After being released he resigned his commission. Later career After retirement, Umar became Chairman and Chief Executive, Work and Worship (Gas Company) Nigeria Limited, Kaduna. Umar was a vocal critic of the General Sani Abacha regime, and joined the G-18 group of politicians that publicly opposed Abacha's plan to become president. During the Nigerian Fourth Republic he was outspoken on many issues. In June 2000, he said the concept of a monolithic Northern region was obsolete and unnecessary. He warned defeated candidates in the 2003 elections to exercise restraint and follow the law in appealing the results. In March 2004, he wrote a letter to President Olusegun Obasanjo in which he accused him of being an accomplice in the annulment of the 12 June 1993 Presidential election. In June 2004, he said that the government's unpopular economic policies were creating social unrest. In May 2005, he spoke out against the forced retirement of a deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria and accused the government of insincerity in its fight against corruption. He strongly opposed proposals to let Obasanjo run for a third term. In January 2008, he supported the controversial removal of Nuhu Ribadu as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on the basis that Ribadu was insufficiently experienced, and had carried out the directives of President Olusegun Obasanjo without question. In August 2009, he accused President Umaru Yar'Adua of nepotism in his appointments. In December 2009, he called on the ailing President to resign. In a June 2014 interview, he stressed the importance of dialogue to resolve the Boko Haram insurgency, saying: > \\"I don't think there is connivance between military people and Boko Haram > ...

Plot The story is set in Vetusta (Spanish stands for \\"antiquated\\", \\"extremely old\\", a provincial capital city, very identifiable with Oviedo, capital of Asturias – especially since it is said that two monks, Nolan and John, founded the city, this being Oviedo's mythical genesis), where the main character of the work, Ana Ozores \\"La Regenta\\", marries the former prime magistrate of the city, Víctor Quintanar, a kind but fussy man much older than she. Feeling sentimentally abandoned, Ana lets herself be courted by the province casanova, Álvaro Mesía. To complete the circle, Don Fermín de Pas (Ana's confessor and canon in the cathedral of Vetusta) also falls in love with her and becomes Mesía's unmentionable rival. A great panorama of secondary characters, portrayed by Clarín with merciless irony, completes the human landscape of the novel. Interpretation The author uses the city of Vetusta as a symbol of vulgarity, lack of culture and hypocrisy. On the other hand, Ana incarnates the tortured ideal that perishes progressively before a hypocritical society. With these forces in tension, the Asturian writer narrates a cruel story of Spanish provincial life in the days of the Restoration. Adaptations This novel has been adapted to Film and TV, written and directed by Fernando Méndez-Leite and premiered in 1995.

He discovered the Pergamon Altar.  Biography  =Early Years= Humann was born in Steele, part of today's Essen - Germany. An educated railroad engineer and aspiring architecture student, he worked initially on the construction of the Bergisch- Märkische Railway in North Rhine-Westphalia—position he got through help from his older brother Franz, who had been working there—and later attended the Building-Academy in Berlin. Due to him falling ill to tuberculosis, he looked for warmer climates and moved to the then Ottoman Empire and settled down in Istanbul. He participated in excavations on the island of Samos—joining his brother Franz, who had been working on the Heraion sanctuary—, building palaces and travelling in 1864 through Palestine, under order of the Ottoman Empire, drawing up accurate maps of the area. His work as a surveyor for the railway and road construction departments helped him gain a personal familiarity with classical-era ruins, as well as develop an extensive network of contacts and acquaintances. He never studied archaeology or took an advanced degree of any kind, exemplifying the nineteenth-century self-made archaeologist, akin to Heinrich Schliemann and Wilhelm Dörpfeld. He was representative of a generation of rough and ready pioneers, who had developed an antipathy for philologists and got easily aggravated by their slow and careful approach to excavations (Schuchhardt, 1931). On the other hand, Humann established extensive connections throughout the whole of the Ottoman Empire, with local officials as well as workmen, which earned him the nickname “Viceroy of Asia Minor” and the very important esteem of the director of the Turkish Museums, Osman Hamdi Bey (Schulte, 1974). = Pergamon = From 1867 until 1873 he supervised the construction of roads in Anatolia. As part of his preparation, he visited in the winter of 1864/65 the site of the antique Pergamon. In this historical site, he used his influence to stop the destruction of the partly unearthed marble ruins. Although he already showed a high interest in starting excavations in this area, he still needed the official support from Berlin. Finally, in 1878, he received the backing from the director of the Berlin Sculpture Museum and financial support from Alexander Conze, as well as the official permits from the Ottoman government, to start excavations in September of the same year. During this initial work, large parts of the artistically extremely valuable frieze of the altar and numerous sculptures were found. Following this success, a second and third excavation missions were carried out, from 1880-1881 and 1883-1886 (assisted by Wilhelm Dörpfeld) respectively. The findings, which by agreement with the Ottoman government became property of the German archaeologists, were transported in carriages to the coast and then loaded onto German Navy ships and taken to Berlin. Back in the German Empire, the finding of the great altar, recognised to be one of the finest examples of Hellenistic sculpture, garnered significant attention and made Humann instantly famous. Against the nationalistic backdrop of the time the findings awoke a strong feeling of pride, especially as something to boast against the Parthenon frieze in London's British Museum. = Later Expeditions = On behalf of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, Humann later made recordings of the ancient archaeological sites of Angora, in both the upper Euphrates as well as northern Syria. In 1882 he carried out excavations for the German Oriental Society in Sam'al (modern Zincirli). Later, in 1884 he became department director of the Royal Museum in Berlin responsible for all Prussian archaeological expeditions in the Near East, but he retained his residence in Smyrna (modern İzmir), in order to protect the interests of the royal museums in area. He continued to work and expanded his research during his time in Smyrna, and became a world-renowned host of foreign guests to the area. He worked in June and July 1887 on the site of Hierapolis. In 1888 he directed further excavations in Sam'al and a trial-excavation in Tralles (modern Aydin). Between 1891 and 1893 he conducted the excavations that lead to the discovery of the Magnesia on the Maeander, as well as the later expeditions of Priene (1895), and with Otto Benndorf of Ephesus (1895).  Personal life and death  Carl Humann married Louise Werner in 1874 and together they had two children. Maria Humann (1875-1971), who married the archaeologist Friedrich Sarre in 1901, and Hans Humann (1878-1933), who became an officer of the Navy, military attaché, diplomat as well as businessman. Carl Humann died on 12 April 1896 in Smyrna (today İzmir), in Turkey, and was buried in the Catholic cemetery in İzmir. His remains were reinterred at Pergamon in 1967, just south of the altar. A bust of Carl Humann was created by Adolf Brütt in 1901, to coincide with the completion of the Siegesallee and the opening of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. A replica of this bust can be found in the Kaiser- Otto-Platz in Steele, while the Carl-Humann-Gymnasium in Essen and the Carl- Humann-School in Berlin were named after the archaeologist. Despite all the praise that Humann received during his lifetime and posthumously, the Institute for Archaeological Correspondence never made him a ‘Fellow’ but accepted his membership merely as ‘Architect’ (Marchard, 2003).

Foster and starring Dorothy Lamour, Sterling Hayden and Dan Duryea. It is based on the 1945 novel The Man Who Stole a Dream by L. S. Goldsmith. Plot Struggling writer Alton Bennet explains to psychiatrist Dr. Redman how he has nightmares about murdering his wealthy wife, Ruth, who owns very valuable jewels. Redman's private secretary, Merl Kramer, casually mentions Bennet's problems to her boyfriend, a private eye, Karl Benson. Merl also mentions that Ruth Bennet is scheduled to drop into Dr. Redman's office that evening for a special session concerning her husband. Benson gets ideas about the jewels, steals Merl's keys and gets duplicates made. Later, he waits outside Redman's office until Ruth arrives, then writes down the Bennets' address from information posted in the car. Benson is next seen showing his pawnbroker acquaintance, Charlie, jewels and asking him to value them. Charlie mentions there is a \\"murder rap hanging over this junk\\" and pays out only for a couple of small pieces, advising Benson to get rid of the rest. Benson runs into Merl and asks her to deposit the money into her bank account, suggesting he has earned it from a recent job and does not want to be tempted to spend it all. He hides the jewels in the water cooler in his office/apartment. Ruth Bennet is found murdered, precisely in the manner her husband has been dreaming. Along with Detective Dawson, Insurance Investigator Joe Cooper is on the case. While interviewing Redman, it is revealed that the transcripts concerning Bennet's conversations about his nightmare are missing. Redman is seen to have a bandaged bump on his head, which he claims happened when he slipped the previous evening while walking in the park. It comes to light that Merl's references for her job with Redman were forged, which raises Dawson's suspicions about whether the woman is an upstanding person. He and Cooper question her and she tells them that she got the references and the job with Redman through a friend, Karl Benson. Benson plays down his relationship with Merl and suggests he can help Dawson and Cooper with the Bennet case, for a share of the eventual insurance payout. He then goes to talk with Merl, and secretly plants one of the dead woman's rings under her sofa cushion. When Merl finds it, she pawns it for the few dollars she needs to finish paying for a new coat. She tells Cooper, when he asks her about it - the pawnbroker had immediately recognized the ring and had phoned police - that she had no idea that it could be Ruth Bennet's property. Benson works to frame Merl for the murder and the theft; he shows Dawson and Cooper her bankbook and insinuates the recent large deposit has to do with the stolen loot. In his office/apartment, Benson is then confronted by Redman who has realized it is Benson who has the jewels. Benson had stolen the transcript describing the murder scenario nightmare, and had gone to take the gems; when he arrived, he saw Redman leaving the Bennet apartment after killing Ruth. Benson knocked the man out, thereby giving him the bump on his head, and took the pieces from him. Benson and Redman make an uneasy deal wherein Benson will ensure he 'finds' the jewels in Merl's apartment, turn them in to Dawson and Cooper, and he and Redman can share the insurance payout. Benson then goes to the station where Merl is being interrogated. He denies any knowledge of the money in her bank account, then tells Dawson he would be glad to go check her apartment for him again, to see where she may have hidden things. While there, attempting to hide the stash to make it look like Merl did it, Redman shows up, demanding the items. Benson hands them over but, after the man leaves by the fire escape, Benson runs down to the street and, using Redman's own car, kills him. After stowing the jewels inside Merl's chair, he phones Dawson to tell him he has found them. When Merl returns to her apartment, he tells her she is going down for the crime. They struggle and he knocks her out; he takes her to the roof, intending to throw her off and make it appear like suicide. The police, having arrived as per Benson's call, hear her screams; Cooper and Dawson rescue her. Back in her apartment, Benson learns that Charlie has been taken in for possession of the stolen property; the private eye is further caught in his web of lies and is arrested.

It was Bioy Casares' breakthrough effort, for which he won the 1941 First Municipal Prize for Literature of the City of Buenos Aires. He considered it the true beginning of his literary career, despite being his seventh book. The first edition cover artist was Norah Borges, sister of Bioy Casares' lifelong friend, Jorge Luis Borges. Plot introduction A fugitive hides on a deserted island somewhere in Polynesia. Tourists arrive, and his fear of being discovered becomes a mixed emotion when he falls in love with one of them. He wants to tell her his feelings, but an anomalous phenomenon keeps them apart. Plot summary First edition cover with an illustration of Faustine. The fugitive starts a diary after tourists arrive on the desert island where he is hiding. Although he considers their presence a miracle, he is afraid they will turn him in to the authorities. He retreats to the swamps while they take over the museum on top of the hill where he used to live. The diary described the fugitive as a writer from Venezuela sentenced to life in prison. He believes he is on the (fictional) island of Villings, a part of the Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu), but is not sure. All he knows is that the island is the focus of a strange disease whose symptoms are similar to radiation poisoning. Among the tourists is a woman who watches the sunset every day from the cliff on the west side of the island. He spies on her and while doing so falls in love. She and another man, a bearded tennis player called Morel who visits her frequently, speak French among themselves. Morel calls her Faustine. The fugitive decides to approach her, but she does not react to him. He assumes she is ignoring him; however, his encounters with the other tourists have the same result. Nobody on the island notices him. He points out that the conversations between Faustine and Morel repeat every week and fears he is going crazy. As suddenly as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive returns to the museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They have come out of nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky. He comes up with all sorts of theories about what is happening on the island, but finds out the truth when Morel tells the tourists he has been recording their actions of the past week with a machine of his invention, which is capable of reproducing reality. He claims the recording will capture their souls, and through looping they will relive that week forever and he will spend eternity with the woman he loves. Although Morel does not mention her by name, the fugitive is sure he is talking about Faustine. After hearing that the people recorded on previous experiments are dead, one of the tourists guesses correctly they will die, too. The meeting ends abruptly as Morel leaves in anger. The fugitive picks up Morel's cue cards and learns the machine keeps running because the wind and tide feed it with an endless supply of kinetic energy. He understands that the phenomena of the two suns and two moons are a consequence of what happens when the recording overlaps reality -- one is the real sun and the other one represents the sun's position at recording time. The other strange things that happen on the island have a similar explanation. He imagines all the possible uses for Morel's invention, including the creation of a second model to resurrect people. Despite this he feels repulsion for the \\"new kind of photographs\\" that inhabit the island, but as time goes by he accepts their existence as something better than his own. He learns how to operate the machine and inserts himself into the recording so it looks like he and Faustine are in love, even though she might have slept with Alec and Haynes. This bothers him, but he is confident it will not matter in the eternity they will spend together. At least he is sure she is not Morel's lover. On the diary's final entry the fugitive describes how he is waiting for his soul to pass onto the recording while dying. He asks a favor of the man who will invent a machine capable of merging souls based on Morel's invention. He wants the inventor to search for them and let him enter Faustine's consciousness as an act of mercy. Characters The novel was written, at least partially, as a reaction to the demise of Louise Brooks' movie career. * The Fugitive: He is the only real person on the island as everybody else is part of the recording. The state of paranoia he reflects on the diary opens the possibility that he is hallucinating. He seems to be educated, yet he does not recall well Tsutomu Sakuma's final message (see \\"Allusions/references to actual history\\" below). He also ignores that Villings could not be part of Tuvalu because the islands of this archipelago are atolls. They are flat, barely above sea level, with no hills or cliffs, unlike Villings. His final speech indicates he went to prison for political reasons. * Faustine: One could say she is the most ambiguous character in the novel or that the fugitive misjudged her the most. She looks like a Gypsy, speaks French like a South American and likes to talk about Canada. She is inspired by silent film star Louise Brooks. * Morel: He is the scientific genius who willingly leads a group of snobs to their death. The fugitive dislikes him out of jealousy, but in the end justifies his actions. His name is a salute to the analogous character of The Island of Doctor Moreau. * Dalmacio Ombrellieri: He is an Italian rug merchant living in Calcutta (now Kolkata.) He tells the fugitive about the island and helps him get there. * Alec: He is a shy oriental wool dealer with green eyes. He could be the lover of either Faustine or Dora, or just their confidant. As with the rest of the people from the group, he sees Morel as a messianic figure.\\"Péle\\", Pelegrina Pastorino, Lady's Fashion Catalogue, Spring Season Harrods editorial, March 1925 * Dora: She is a blonde woman with a big head, she looks German but speaks Italian and walks like she is at the Folies Bergère, she is a close friend of Alec and Faustine. The fugitive hopes that she, and not Faustine, is Alec's lover. He later considers her as Morel's love interest when he suspects Morel might not be in love with Faustine after all. Dora's character is inspired on one of the writers' good friend, \\"Péle\\", a high-fashion model of Harrods. * Irene: She is a tall woman with long arms and an expression of disgust that does not believe their exposure to the machine will kill them. The fugitive thinks that if Morel is neither in love with Faustine nor Dora, then he is in love with her. * Old Lady: She is probably related to Dora, because they are always together. She is drunk the night of the speech, but the fugitive still considers she could be Morel's love interest in case he is not in love with any of the other women. * Haynes: He is asleep at the time Morel is about to give his speech. Dora says he is in Faustine's bedroom and that no one will get him out of there because he is heavy. It is unknown why he is there, but the fugitive is not jealous of him. Morel gives the speech anyway. * Stoever: He is the one who guesses they are all going to die. The other members of the group prevent him from following Morel when he leaves the aquarium. He calms down and the group's fanaticism towards Morel prevails over his own survival instinct. Allusions/references * Throughout the novel the fugitive cites the views of Thomas Robert Malthus on population control as the only way to prevent chaos if humanity uses Morel's invention to achieve immortality. He also wants to write a book entitled Praise to Malthus. * Before he finds out the truth about the island, the fugitive cites Cicero's book De Natura Deorum as an explanation of the appearance of two suns in the sky. * The tourists like to dance to the song \\"Tea for Two\\" from the Broadway musical No, No, Nanette. This foreshadows the fugitive's love for Faustine. * While trapped in the machine's room the fugitive promises himself he will not die like the Japanese folk hero Tsutomu Sakuma, one of the victims of Japan's first submarine accident. * About 19 minutes into Eliseo (Ernesto) Subiela's film Man Facing Southeast, the psychiatrist Dr. Denis reads aloud from La invención de Morel as he struggles to identify his patient. Literary significance and criticism Jorge Luis Borges wrote in the introduction: \\"To classify it [the novel's plot] as perfect is neither an imprecision nor a hyperbole.\\" Mexican Nobel Prize winner in Literature Octavio Paz echoed Borges when he said: \\"The Invention of Morel may be described, without exaggeration, as a perfect novel.\\" Other Latin American writers such as Julio Cortázar, Juan Carlos Onetti, Alejo Carpentier and Gabriel García Márquez have also expressed their admiration for the novel.

It incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1983, around which time the regional clothing and houseware retailer had stores in every state in New England with a primary focus on Massachusetts. Its stock once traded for close to $30 a share. History Through the 1980s and 1990s the store went through a variety of major changes. First the chain tried to shed its image as a reseller of leftover department store merchandise by investing in their own label. They also invested a major amount of capital into a cosmetic overhaul of their real estate that introduced a more \\"Bradlees\\"-like color scheme. They rapidly expanded to 26 outlets, including the purchase of Harry's of Barre, Vermont. A major distribution and office complex was also built in Franklin, Massachusetts. During all of this change there was instability in corporate management. The chaos this caused resulted in a missed opportunity for this small retailer. They never modernized their sales/inventory tracking systems at the store level. While other chains like Rich's were already using barcode scanners, computerized shipping manifests, and automated sales result reports, Stuarts was still doing it by hand. By the early 1990s shares struggled to maintain $1 per share. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 1990, emerged from the Chapter 11 case in October 1992 and re-filed for protection under Chapter 11 in May 1995, shortly thereafter it went out of business.

Sir Edmund was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Antrobus, 2nd Baronet, and Anne Lindsay of Antrobus Hall, Cheshire and Amesbury Abbey, also a stately home in Wiltshire, and educated at St John's College, Cambridge. The elder Sir Edmund owned and ran a number of sugar plantations in Jamaica, British Guiana and St Kitts. At the time of emancipation in the 1830s, the British government compensated him for the ownership of over 500 slaves across eight estates in the West Indies.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/23866 The younger Edmund married Marianne Georgiana Dashwood on 11 February 1847, and with her had six children: Louisa Emma, Edmund (4th Baronet), Robert Lindsay, Cosmo (5th Baronet), and two other daughters. His land included the ancient monument Stonehenge. During his lifetime he refused to let the government agency for the preservation of ancient monuments even look at the property. It was rumored that an anonymous buyer wanted to buy the stones and take them to the United States; if Antrobus had accepted the offer, no one could have stopped him. He was painted while hunting with the long-defunct Old Surrey Fox Hounds at Addington, Surrey during his time as MP for the same area, by animal painter William Barraud. He was first elected as one of two MPs for East Surrey in 1841, won a re-election and both MPs were then defeated in 1847 by Liberal candidates. He was subsequently elected as a Whig/Liberal MP for Wilton in 1855, the same party as the incumbent who had resigned to serve as a Special Commissioner in Ireland. He succeeded to the Baronetcy upon the death of his father on 4 May 1870. He served until 1877 when he resigned. He was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1880. On his death the Baronetcy passed to his eldest son and namesake, Sir Edmund Antrobus, 4th Baronet.

The film, part fiction, part rockumentary, tells the story of Ray Gange, a young Clash fan who leaves his dead-end job in a sleazy Soho sex shop to become a roadie for the band. The film also includes extensive footage of the Clash at a Rock Against Racism concert at Victoria Park, on their \\"On Parole\\" and \\"Sort It Out\\" tours, and in the studio recording the album Give 'Em Enough Rope.

Release and reception  It was publicly released in the UK in March 1980 with limited screenings, primarily at independent art cinemas. Although meeting with a generally unfavourable critical response, the film won the Honorable Mention, and was nominated for the Golden Bear, at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival in 1980. It was re-released on DVD the UK in 2003 by Fremantle Media with a number of special features including interviews with 'Rude Boy' lead actor Ray Gange, the Clash's road manager Johnny Green and film makers Jack Hazan and David Mingay. There was a Blu-ray release of the film in 2015.  Clash reaction  Although initially interested in the film, after having seen the rough print the members of The Clash became so disenchanted with it that, for its official cinema release, they had Better Badges make badges stating 'I don't want Rude Boy Clash Film'. Joe Strummer told Melody Maker in 1980: \\"It wasn't any good. We didn't like what they were doing with the black people, because they were showing them dipping into pockets and then they were shown being done for something and that was their only role in the film ... Who wants to propagate that? That's what the right wing use, 'all blacks are muggers' which is a load of rubbish. After that rough showing I've never seen it since and nor have any of the Clash.\\" Strummer added that the band had no further contact with directors Dave Mingay and Jack Hazan after the film was shot, and never received any payments from them.

He subsequently studied at Loyola University, New Orleans. He was called to the bar in 1951. Career and writings After practising at the Irish Bar in Dublin, O'Connor spent time as a critic before turning to writing. His work spanned areas such as biography, poetry, Irish history, drama, diary, and literary criticism. He was a sports correspondent for The Observer from 1955 to 1961. He was a well-known intellectual figure in contemporary Irish affairs and expressed strong opinions against censorship and the war on drugs. He contributed a regular poetry column to Irish daily the Evening Herald, also wrote a column for the Sunday Mirror and a sporting column for the Sunday Times, as well as broadcasting on RTÉ. His best known writing was his biographies of Oliver St. John Gogarty, Brendan Behan, his studies of the early 20th-century Irish troubles and the Irish Literary Revival. He was also known for the autobiographical The Ulick O’Connor Diaries 1970-1981: A Cavalier Irishman (2001), which details his encounters with well- known Irish and international figures, ranging from political (Jack Lynch and Paddy Devlin) to the artistic (Christy Brown and Peter Sellers). It also documents the progress of the Peace Process during the same time, and the progress of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Although he travelled extensively, O'Connor lived in his parental home in Dublin's Rathgar. He was a member of Aosdána. O'Connor's great-grandfather was Matt Harris, Land Leaguer, Fenian, and Irish Parliamentary Party Member of Parliament. He was related to American actor Carroll O'Connor. He died on 7 October 2019, five days short of his 91st birthday.https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/1007/1081602-ulick-oconnor/ Published works =Plays= * The Dream Box (1972) * The Dark Lovers (1975) * The Emperor’s Envoy (1976) * The Grand Inquisitor; Submarine; and Deirdre (Dublin 1977, New York 1980) * Execution (1985) * The Oval Machine (1986) * A Trinity of Two (1988) * Joycity (1989) * Deux de la Trinite (translated by Ramond Gerome, 1990). =Poetry collections= * Lifestyles (1973) * Three Noh Plays (1980) * All Things Counter (1986) * One is Animate (1990) * Poems of the Damned (translations from Baudelaire's Fleur du Mal, 1991). =Non-fiction and autobiography= * Irish Tales and Sagas (1981) * A Critic at Large (1984) * Biographers and the Art of Biography (1990) * The Ulick O'Connor Diaries, 1970-1981: A Cavalier Irishman (2003) =Biographical writings= * The Times I've Seen:Oliver St. John Gogarty:A Biography (1963) * Brendan Behan (1970) * Celtic Dawn: Biography (1984) * All the Olympians: A Biographical Portrait of the Irish Literary Renaissance (1987) * Executions (1992) * The Troubles: Michael Collins and the Volunteers in the Fight for Irish Freedom 1912-22 (2001) References External links * Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Aosdána members Category:Irish dramatists and playwrights Category:Irish male dramatists and playwrights Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Loyola University New Orleans alumni Category:People educated at Garbally College Category:People educated at St Mary's College, Dublin Category:University College Dublin R.F.C. players Category:People from Rathgar ","title":"Ulick O'Connor"},{"id":"3895560","text":"BT Fusion was a telecommunications product available from BT Group in the United Kingdom\\"BT 'BluePhone' Fusion is better than Skype because...?\\", The Register, 15 June 2005 until 1 April 2009 when it was withdrawn.

In fact, the fixed portion of the link was provided by a Voice over IP implementation using the domestic ADSL service. The BT Fusion service was compatible with the BT Smart Hub. The premise of the service was that it could reduce mobile phone costs by not using the mobile network when the user is at home. The same phone was used (a modified version of the Motorola RAZR or Motorola V560), but if the phone was within range of a special base station installed in the user's home or office then incoming and outgoing calls will be routed through that base station instead of the mobile network. This link between the phone and base station was carried over Bluetooth (BT Fusion was latterly available using Wifi technology, thus allowing discounts not only at home but over BT Openzone WiFi hotspots). BT Fusion was an example of one type of telecommunication convergence. From the base station, at-home calls were connected to the phone network using an ADSL broadband connection; only those with BT Broadband connections were eligible for the service. Voice over IP protocols were used to transmit the call, but this was intended to remain largely unnoticed from the user's point of view.

The airport is located at Elvebakken, northeast of Bossekop in Alta. It has a single, runway numbered 11/29, which lies on the southern shore of the Altafjord. Alta Airport is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, and served 368,393 passengers in 2014, making it the busiest airport in Finnmark. The airport is served by Norwegian Air Shuttle and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) with Boeing 737 aircraft on flights to Tromsø and Oslo. Widerøe operates services to Tromsø and several regional airports in Finnmark, feeding to the larger airlines'routes. There are a limited number of international charter flights. The first airport in the area was a military airfield built by the Luftwaffe in 1943, but was damaged beyond repair during World War II. The civilian airport opened on 4 May 1963. At first services were provided by SAS to other primary airports in the north and to Oslo, but in the 1970s, several regional airports opened in Finnmark, with Widerøe flying connecting flights to them. Alta Airport's regional importance increased in 1990, when it became a hub for the newly created SAS Commuter. Norwegian started flying to Alta in 2003 and a new terminal building was opened in 2009. History =Construction= The first airport in Alta was built by the Wehrmacht during the German occupation of Norway. Alta was a central part of the German military activity during World War II, resulting in an airstrip being constructed at Elvebakken in 1943.Eikeset (1998): 230 The airport was damaged beyond repair under Operation Nordlicht—the German withdrawal from Finnmark in 1944. During 1945 the Royal Norwegian Air Force operated a seaplane route along the coast of Northern Norway, which included a stop at Alta. However, the route was not resumed the following summer.Eikeset (1998): 374 The municipality started lobbying the air force and the civilian aviation authorities to establish an airline route to Alta. Specifically, they argued that both the water aerodrome at Bukta and an airfield at Altagård/Elvebakken be included in the national plans for future airports. The area at Altagårdsletta was freed up by the military in 1946 and zoned for use as an airport.Eikeset (1998): 375 Aerial view of the airport from 2005, before the new terminal was built. Bukta in the foreground, the mouth of the Altaelva in the background. However, no progress was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, but after a few years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo.Arnesen, 1984: 61–67 Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957,Eikeset (1998): 377 and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960. Local politicians started discussing the airfield plans again in the mid-1950s, and an airport for Alta was included in the national airport plan launched in 1956. The municipality started preparatory work, which included expropriation of the necessary area. At that time the plans called for two runways, long, respectively. By 1958, the municipality had also built water and sewer pipes to the airport site and had spent 60,000 Norwegian krone on the preparatory work and purchase of land. Central authorities were at the same time looking for the most suited site for an airport for western Finnmark, and were considering Lakselv Airport, Banak in Porsanger, a by-then-closed military air base.Eikeset (1998): 376 The old terminal building and tower The location in Elvebakken was somewhat controversial in Alta, especially as the airport would be located so close to the town center, potentially causing noise pollution. An alternative at Sokkelma was considered, but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions. The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961, followed by additional expropriation of land. Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of Banak and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports. Construction started in February 1962 and cost NOK 3.2 million. The runway was completed by the fall of that year, but other parts of the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day,Eikeset (1998): 377 while Tromsø Airport opened the following year.Malmø (1997): 65 Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used as terminal. Dash-8 311 at noontime during polar night =Operational history= Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). At the beginning the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo and westward to Lakselv and Kirkenes—and also to Tromsø starting in 1964. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark remained until 1990. On 7 April 1969, SAS introduced the 85-passenger Douglas DC-9-21 jetliner on the Alta service; the last Metropolitan flew on 1 April 1970. Five regional airports opened on 1 August 1974, Sørkjosen, Hammerfest, Mehamn, Berlevåg and Vadsø, all which were connected to Alta and other primary airports by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. Honningsvåg Airport opened on 1 July 1977.Arnesen, 1984: 124–130 SAS' traffic increased throughout the 1970s, resulting in SAS gradually increasing the frequency of its services, and later also using larger DC-9s. The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 was first flown on the Alta route on 11 July 1986. SAS Commuter was established in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Alta to Oslo were flown non-stop. Conversely, all services to airports in Northern Norway were flown using the smaller Fokker 50. Thus SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead increased the number of flights. The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo. From 1989 to 1990, the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7,711 to 10,035. Boeing 737-400 that visited in 2000 Activity at Alta Airport peaked in the following years. SAS served Alta with up to ten daily services; at peak hours six aircraft were at the airport simultaneously, including two from Widerøe. From 1992, SAS reintroduced direct services from Kirkenes to Oslo, and aircraft in eastern Finnmark again started feeding into Kirkenes. The hub paradigm was thus gradually abandoned by SAS. Flights at Alta gradually decreased, hitting a low of 4,935 movements (landings and take- offs) in 2000. The North Cape Tunnel opened in 1999, connecting Honningsvåg and Nordkapp to the mainland. This reduced travel time to Alta and people from Nordkapp started using Alta more for long-haul flights at the expense of Honningsvåg Airport. SAS bought Braathens in 2001, resulting in the latter taking over the service to Oslo starting on 1 April 2002. All SAS Commuter services in Northern Norway were taken over by Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle started its services from Oslo to Alta on 19 August 2003, initially with three services daily. SAS and Braathens merged in 2004 to form SAS Braathens; the airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. Plans for expanding the terminal facilities were first articulated by the Civil Airport Administration in the 1990s. The upgrade was given priority in a 2000 plan, but was shortly after placed on hold in favor of upgrades of Kirkenes Airport and Svalbard Airport, Longyear. By 2005 the Civil Aviation Authority announced that the aircraft parking areas at Alta were too close to the runway and that the airport would lose its certification in 2008 unless it was upgraded. Another concern was the lack of capacity, as the airport could only handle 150 passengers simultaneously at two gates. Avinor decided in February 2007 to build a new passenger terminal and tower for NOK 300 million. The new terminal was and was located between the old terminal and the port facilities. It included improved facilities for security control and allowed international services. The new terminal was put into use on 23 October 2009 and was officially opened on 25 September. Facilities Airside waiting hall The airport is located at Elvebakken and Altagård, on the southern shore of the Altafjord and at the mouth of the river of Altaelva, which is about east of Bossekop in the town of Alta. Operated by the state-owned Avinor, it has a single runway aligned 11–29 (roughly east–west), without a taxiway. Both directions are equipped with instrument landing system category I. The terminal building is and can handle international flights. In 2013, the airport had 368,393 passengers, 11,707 aircraft movements (landings and take- offs) and 330 tonnes of cargo, making it the busiest airport in Finnmark. The airbus bus is operated by Boreal Transport and takes ten minutes to the town center. Taxis and car rental is also available at the airport. There are 520 long-term parking spaces at the airport. From Alta to Hammerfest there are both coach and fast ferry services;Lian (2008): 9 travel time to Hammerfest is two hours.Lian (2008): 2 Airlines and destinations Boeing 737-600 of Scandinavian Airlines Arrival area with baggage conveyor Alta Airport is served by three scheduled airlines and two charter airlines, providing services to eleven destinations, including two abroad. Both Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle serve the airport using Boeing 737 aircraft,Lian (2008): 25 each providing two daily services to Oslo and one daily service to Tromsø. Widerøe operates regional services in Finnmark on a public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. However, its seven (three direct) daily services to Tromsø are not subsidized. Widerøe operates de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft on their services, using both the 39- and the 50-passenger Dash 8 aircraft to Tromsø, and the 39-passenger Dash 8 aircraft only on services to regional airports in Finnmark.Draagen (2011): 11 Alta Airport's catchment area includes Kautokeino ( by road), which has no airport. The catchment area partially includes Hammerfest ( by road) and Kvalsund (). Both of these areas have Hammerfest Airport as their local airport, but the regional airport does not provide direct flights to Oslo and the prices to Tromsø are higher. In 2007, an estimated 81,000 passenger-flights at Alta Airport were generated by people living in Hammerfest and Kvalsund. Also journeys to and from other parts of western Finnmark to Alta Airport are often made via Alta, for example from the area around Honningsvåg Airport, Valan. The pass at Sennalandet is sometimes closed during snow storms. If this happens, the alternative route takes five to six hours (363 km), so the weather forecast should be checked 6–8 hours before. Future A proposal by a consultant company, ordered by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 2011, suggested that starting in 2013 the subsidized routes in Finnmark should follow a coastal route, leaving those to Kirkenes and the county capital of Vadsø as the only subsidized routes remaining at Alta.Draagen (2011): 28 There are proposals to build a new airport for Hammerfest at Grøtnes, either with a runway. If the former is selected, Hammerfest could serve direct flights to Oslo. This would severely reduce Alta's catchment area as a primary airport and could result in a reduction in Oslo flights.Lian (2008): II The Norwegian government has decided not to build the Hammerfest-Grøtnes airport, and instead improve the Alta- Hammerfest road which started 2015.Rv. 94 Skaidi–Hammerfest (Norwegian) Also the roads towards Kautokeino and Tromsø are being improved during the period 2010–2019.

Rise to prominence Günzburg received his education at home in Zvenigorodka. After the Crimean war his father, Joseph Günzburg, then a wealthy merchant and army contractor, settled with his family in St. Petersburg. Günzburg first came before the public in 1863 as one of the founders of the Society for the Spread of Enlightenment among the Jews of Russia, the only society of the kind in Russia. He was one of the charter members of the society, and after the death of his father in 1878 succeeded him in the presidency. He was the largest contributor to its support and one of its most energetic workers. The work which made him so widely popular among the Jews was his unremitting effort, in which frequent appeals to the Russian government were involved, toward the improvement of the legal status of his coreligionists, and for the securing by legislation, as well as by other means, of their economic and moral welfare. In 1870 he was summoned as an expert before the commission on the \\"Jewish Question,\\" which met under the auspices of the Ministry of the Interior. Positions Gunzburg wearing ushanka hat. He was chairman of the Jewish congress which, by permission of the government, assembled in St. Petersburg in 1882. In 1887 he was invited to participate in the discussions of the high commission on the Jewish question, under the presidency of Count Pahlen. In 1880 he became a member of the board of governors of the temporary commission for the organization of a society for the purpose of encouraging Russian Jews to engage in agriculture and trades. He employed the lawyer, Emmanuel Levin, an auto-didact working within the system zakonmost of reformed juridical institutions. The rise of the \\"diploma intelligentsia\\" was critical to the challenges that Jews were able to make.Nathans, Benjamin (2004). Beyond the Pale: The Jewish Encounter with Late Imperial Russia. Oakland, CA: University of California Press. . p. 321. From 1893 he was chairman of the central committee of the Jewish Agricultural Society. One of the colonies in Argentina is named in honor of Baron Günzburg. In 1890 he was elected president of the Hygienic and Low-House-Rent Society of St. Petersburg. In 1901 he became president of the board of directors of the Jewish Agricultural Farms in Minsk, and director of the Jewish Agricultural School in Novo-Poltavka. The Jewish community of St. Petersburg was also under obligation to Baron Günzburg for its synagogue, of which he was president. He was also the head of a new, non- sectarian school erected in honour of the wedding of Tsar Nicholas II. In 1880, together with Samuel Polyakov and Nikolai Bakst, Baron Gunzburg petitioned Tsar Alexander II for permission to start an assistance fund which would provide vocational education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agriculture for thousands of Russian Jews then living in poverty in the Pale of Settlement and would help them to help themselves. The initiative would eventually evolve into the World ORT educational network. Horace Günzburg is also closely identified with other institutions of a non- sectarian character. He was an honorary member of the committee of the Prince Oldenburg Infant Asylum from 1863, and honorary member of the Society for Improving the Condition of Poor Children of St. Petersburg since 1876. Between 1868 and 1872 he was consul-general of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1871 the title \\"Baron\\" was bestowed upon him by the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, permission being given by the Tsar to accept that title of nobility. In 1880, 1884, and 1888 he received successively the titles of \\"counsel of commerce,\\" \\"secretary of state,\\" and \\"member of the council of commerce of the Treasury Department.\\" For many years he was an alderman of St. Petersburg, but, upon the passage of a statute prohibiting the election of Jewish aldermen, vacated that office. Baron Günzburg was repeatedly elected trustee of the charitable affairs of the Stock Exchange of St. Petersburg and member of the council of the Stock Exchange Hospital. He contributed heavily to the erection of the latter institution. In 1898 he was elected member of the committee of the Society for the Dissemination of Commercial Knowledge, and in the same year became chairman of the house committee of the Women's Sewing-School of the Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna. In 1899 he was made trustee of the School of Commerce of Tsar Nicholas II. In 1900 he was chosen a member of the committee of the Russian Society for the Protection of Women. He was a member of the board of the Treasury Department of the Stock Exchange, and a member of the executive board of the St. Petersburg Archeological Institute. Even at his advanced age he was often invited by the government to sit on commissions for the revision of general legislation. In 1895 and 1900-01 he was associated with such imperial commissions for the amendment of the laws governing the Stock Exchange, stock companies, corporations, and mining companies. The seventieth birthday of Baron Günzburg, which was also the fortieth anniversary of his entry into public affairs, was celebrated all over Europe and the United States. On this occasion the Russian government conferred on the baron the medal of St. Anne (1st class). In New York a Baron de Günzburg Fund was started, the interest of which was given periodically as a premium for the best work on Jewish history and literature. He was the father of David Günzburg.

Campbell was a British naval officer, navigational expert and colonial governor. Campbell joined the Royal Navy at an early age and sailed around the world in 1740 on Centurion. He later became known as a navigational expert, and was from 1782 to his death Governor and Commander-in-Chief in Newfoundland. Life =Early life= John Campbell was born in the parish of Kirkbean, Scotland. His father, John Campbell (d. 1733), was minister of Kirkbean and John was at an early age apprenticed to the master of a coasting vessel. That vessel's mate was pressed into the navy, and John is said to have entered the navy by offering himself in exchange for him. He served for three years in Blenheim, Torbay, and Russell before being appointed in 1740 as a midshipman to Centurion. On Centurion's ensuing circumnavigation of the world as the flagship of Commodore George Anson, he was promoted master's mate when a vacancy came up soon after sailing, and was promoted to master after the 1743 engagement against the Manila galleon Nuestra Señora de Covadonga. One of his fellow midshipmen was Augustus Keppel, who from then on became a lifelong friend. He was married, but his wife's name does not survive. Returning home in early January 1745, Campbell passed the examination for lieutenant on 16 January 1745Navy Records Society, David Syrett, R. L. DiNardo (ed), The Commissioned Sea Officers of the Royal Navy 1660-1815, Scholar Press, Aldershot, Hants., 1994, and, with Anson's influence behind him, he was promoted to commander on 27 May 1747 and given command of a sloop. Promoted to post captain on 23 November 1747, he was given command of the new frigate Bellona, a command he held until the peace in 1748. Praised for his successes on Bellona, in 1749 he was given command of the expedition to the Pacific by the sloop Porcupine and Raven, then of one to the north-west and north-east passages in the Atlantic, both of which were proposed but then called off for political reasons. =Astronomy and Brest= Meanwhile, in about 1747, Campbell had his first direct involvement in the development of astronomical navigation, as the first person to use a Hadley quadrant to measure the angular distance between the moon and fixed stars.W. Wales, ed., The original astronomical observations, made in the course of a voyage towards the south pole, and round the world, in his majesty's ships the Resolution and Adventure, in the years MDCCLXXII, MDCCLXXIII, MDCCLXXIV, and MDCCLXXV, by William Wales … and Mr. William Bayly, etc. (1777), xxxiv The astronomer royal, James Bradley, was shown Campbell's results and found them to correspond exactly with the actual distances in the sky, and Bradley and Campbell together made frequent observations at Greenwich of the moon's distance from the sun and stars, and of the stars' distances from one another. His next commands after Bellona were Mermaid, Prince (90 guns) and – in 1757 – Essex (64 guns) under Edward Hawke in the Bay of Biscay and the blockade of Brest (barring an interlude in 1758/59, as flag captain to Anson in Royal George when he temporarily took over command of the Brest fleet). During Campbell's command of Essex, in 1756, James Bradley suggested to the Board of Longitude (chaired by Anson) that Campbell should give a sea trial to Tobias Mayer's new lunar tables and reflecting circle, and Campbell did so successfully within sight of the French coast, 'though they [the observations] were not taken with all the advantages that might have attended them, had I been alone; for I was all the cruise in company with an admiral whose motions I was obliged to follow',Miscellaneous works and correspondence of the Rev. James Bradley, ed. [S. P. Rigaud], 1832, p493 in trials which would profoundly influence marine navigation for the next 250 years. He compared Mayer's new reflecting circle instrument with the common wooden Hadley octant as means of observing lunar distances, and in doing so found Mayer's was much too heavy whereas Hadley's – though it could not measure angles beyond 90° and was often unstable in its wooden frame – was far more useful. From this, he suggested modifications to the Hadley octant, extending its arc from 45° to 60° (to allow the measurement of arcs up to 120°) and making it of brass not wood. In 1759 John Bird, commissioned by the Board of Longitude, produced an instrument taking up both suggestions, a sextant of 20 inches radius with a brass frameMay, William Edward, A History of Marine Navigation, G. T. Foulis & Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, and 1/3 the weight of the reflecting circle, which served as a prototype of the marine sextant still used today. =Seven Years War= Campbell, meanwhile, returned to Royal George as flag captain in November 1759, this time under Hawke (when Hawke moved his flag to that ship), serving as such during the decisive battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. It was Campbell whom Hawke sent to England on 24 November in the frigate Vengeance with news of the victory, and after a six-day voyage Campbell, accompanied by Lord Anson (now First Lord of the Admiralty), personally gave the king the news. Next, Campbell was captain of Dorsetshire (70 guns), on the home station and in the Mediterranean, from 1760 to the peace in 1763. He was admitted as a fellow of the Royal Society on 24 May 1764 (and was one of its Visitors to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from March 1765), before being one of those the Board of Longitude asked to 'number-crunch' the results of the 1764 second sea-trial to Barbados of John Harrison's longitude watch. From about 1764 he commanded the yacht Mary, later moving to HMY Royal Charlotte, a command he retained until promotion to rear- admiral of the blue on 23 January 1778. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the white on 29 January 1778. Then, in March 1778, he was chosen by his old friend Admiral Keppel (now in command of the Channel Fleet), to be \\"captain of the fleet\\" and effectively chief of staff in HMS Victory, which commissioned in May 1778 as Keppel's flagship. (Campbell was Victory's \\"1st captain\\", whilst Captain Jonathan Faulknor was her \\"2nd Captain\\".) As such, he took an important part in the battle of Ushant on 27 July, was warmly recommended to the king by the first sea lord Lord Sandwich, and remained in the role until the end of 1778. He was promoted to vice-admiral of the blue on 19 March 1779 and to vice-admiral of the white on 26 September 1780. =Governorship= However, Campbell was offered no further commands until April 1782, when Keppel became Sandwich's successor as first sea lord, and appointed Campbell, governor and commander-in-chief of Newfoundland; Campbell sailed there in (50 guns) on 17 June 1782. On 25 June, the Franco-Spanish combined fleet commanded by Luis de Cordova intercepted Portland, which was escorting another 27 ships. Although the Franco-Spanish fleet captured 19 vessels, Portland and eight merchants managed to slip away. Campbell held the governorship from 1782 to his death in London in 1790. During this time he returned to Britain periodically, allowing him in 1784 and 1785 – at Hans Moritz von Brühl's request – to arrange trials of Thomas Mudge's first chronometer on his passage to and from Britain and in Newfoundland (borrowing an achromatic telescope from the Board of Longitude to ascertain Newfoundland's longitude). Also, as a result of Campbell's proclamation of religious freedom for all inhabitants of Newfoundland, Bishop James Louis O'Donel authorised the construction of a Catholic church. Campbell was promoted to vice-admiral of the white on 24 September 1787.

This expression is the base of the Islamic institution of hisbah. It forms a central part of the Islamic doctrine for all Muslims. It is also explicitly referred to in two Ancillaries of the Faith in Shia Islam, commanding what is just and forbidding what is evil. Some Quranic examples *Sura 3.104 translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali ::Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity. alternative translation: ::Let there arise out of you a nation who invites to goodness and enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil: They are the one's to attain felicity. *Sura 3.110 translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali ::Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are transgressors. alternative translation: ::You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind: You enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil, and You believe in Allah; if the people of the scripture deary it, it had been better for them, some of them believers, but most of them are evil-livers. Other examples include: *Sura 9, v.71 *Sura 9, v.112 *Sura 31, v.17 Hadith examples Abu Sa‘id al- Khudri reported that the prophet Muhammad said, \\"Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand. If he is not able to do so, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest form of faith\\". A standard medieval interpretation of this Hadith is, as Al-Nawawi had explained, that such passages of scripture had to be interpreted in accordance with established Shariah principles, such as the state's sole prerogative in declaring jihad. 'Changing the reprehensible by hand,' or by compulsion, was the purview of the state alone. 'Changing with the tongue' was the right of the ulama. Ordinary, individual Muslims should only reject the reprehensible with their hearts.Fatawa Hindiyya / Fatawa Alamgiri, Dar el-Fekr, Beirut, 1310 A.H. vol.5 p.353.

He was the son of Gabriel Günzburg and the father of Horace Günzburg. Having acquired great wealth during the Crimean war, Günzburg established a banking firm at St. Petersburg. There he began to labor on behalf of the welfare of the Jewish community. In November 1861, he was appointed by the Russian government member of the rabbinical commission, the meetings of which lasted five months. He exerted himself to raise the standard of the education of the Jews, and to this effect he founded in 1863 with the permission of the Russian government the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews, of which he filled the office of president till his death. Owing to Günzburg's efforts, the regulations concerning the military service of the Jews were in 1874 made identical with those of the peoples of other creeds. He also instituted a fund for the Talmud Torah of Vilna, his father's native town. The Günzburgs were ennobled by the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt on 1871, and Joseph received the title of baron on 2 August 1874.

Tel Katifa was founded in May 1992 on the Mediterranean coast by second generation Gush Katif single farmers. The residents understood that they would need to attract families in order for the settlement to develop properly and in 1998, several from Ganei Tal, Katif, and Neve Dekalim answered the call. Until that, living conditions had been rudimentary. The singles had been living in trailers, electricity was provided by a generator that did not work all day because of the high cost of operation. Water pressure was low and when the greenhouses were being irrigated, there was no water for personal use. Permanent homes were built, along with a nursery and a mikveh. Geography The Palestinian village of Deir el-Balah lied on the northern edge of the settlement. A natural pond was located in the heart of the settlement, water from which was used to irrigate a small greenhouse farm. A small army outpost with a few dozen Israeli soldiers guarded the location by manning the main gate, a watchtower that stood above the settlement, and a tank that stood watch during the night. Culture The 20 or so families lived in either houses or trailers and were composed of a mix of secular and orthodox Jews who lived together in tight community with activities for all ages. The expression 'living together in harmony' was used often. Unilateral disengagement Residents Tel Katifa were evicted on August 17, 2005 by the Israeli Army and Israeli Police who reported that 156 people were removed from the site.

Itron OpenWay electricity Smart meter with two-way communications for remote reading in use by DTE Energy A smart meter is an electronic device that records information such as consumption of electric energy, voltage levels, current, and power factor. Smart meters communicate the information to the consumer for greater clarity of consumption behavior, and electricity suppliers for system monitoring and customer billing. Smart meters typically record energy near real-time, and report regularly, short intervals throughout the day. Smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system. Such an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) differs from automatic meter reading (AMR) in that it enables two-way communication between the meter and the supplier. Communications from the meter to the network may be wireless, or via fixed wired connections such as power line carrier (PLC). Wireless communication options in common use include cellular communications, Wi-Fi (readily available), wireless ad hoc networks over Wi-Fi, wireless mesh networks, low power long-range wireless (LoRa), ZigBee (low power, low data rate wireless), and Wi-SUN (Smart Utility Networks). Overview The term Smart Meter often refers to an electricity meter, but it also may mean a device measuring natural gas, water or district heating consumption. Similar meters, usually referred to as interval or time-of-use meters, have existed for years, but \\"Smart Meters\\" usually involve real-time or near real-time sensors, power outage notification, and power quality monitoring. These additional features are more than simple automated meter reading (AMR). They are similar in many respects to Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meters. Interval and time- of-use meters historically have been installed to measure commercial and industrial customers, but may not have automatic reading. Research by the UK consumer group, showed that as many as one in three confuse smart meters with energy monitors, also known as in-home display monitors.\\"Energy monitors: Smart meters and energy monitors explained\\", Which? (n.d.) The roll-out of smart meters is claimed to be one strategy for saving energy. While energy suppliers in the UK could save around £300 million a year from their introduction, benefits to users of electricity depends on their using the information to change their pattern of energy use. For example, smart meters may facilitate taking advantage of lower off-peak time tariffs, and selling electricity back to the grid with net metering. The installed base of smart meters in Europe at the end of 2008 was about 39 million units, according to analyst firm Berg Insight. Globally, Pike Research found that smart meter shipments were 17.4 million units for the first quarter of 2011. Visiongain determined that the value of the global smart meter market would reach US$7 billion in 2012. As of January 2018, over 99 million electricity meters were deployed across the European Union, with an estimated 24 million more to be installed by the end of 2020. The European Commission DG Energy estimates the 2020 installed base to have required €18.8 billion in investment, growing to €40.7 billion by 2030, with a total deployment of 266 million smart meters. By the end of 2018, the U.S. had over 86 million smart meters installed. In 2017, there were 665 million smart meters installed globally. Revenue generation is expected to grow from $12.8 billion in 2017 to $20 billion by 2022. Smart meters may be part of a smart grid, but do not themselves constitute a smart grid. Brief history In 1972, Theodore Paraskevakos, while working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, developed a sensor monitoring system that used digital transmission for security, fire, and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities. This technology was a spin-off from the automatic telephone line identification system, now known as Caller ID. In 1974, Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology. (Sensor Monitoring Device) In 1977, he launched Metretek, Inc., which developed and produced the first smart meters. Since this system was developed pre-Internet, Metretek utilized the IBM series 1 mini-computer. For this approach, Paraskevakos and Metretek were awarded multiple patents. and and Canadian Patent # 1,155,243 (Apparatus and Method for Remote Sensor Monitoring, Metering and Control) Purpose = Benefits = Since the inception of electricity deregulation and market-driven pricing throughout the world, utilities have been looking for a means to match consumption with generation. Non-smart electrical and gas meters only measure total consumption, providing no information of when the energy was consumed. Smart meters provide a way of measuring electricity consumption in near real-time. This allows utility companies to charge different prices for consumption according to the time of day and the season.James Sinopoli (ed), Smart Building Systems for Architects, Owners, and Builders Elsevier 2010 PP. 65-65 It also facilitates more accurate cash-flow models for utilities. Since smart meters can be read remotely, labor costs are reduced for utilities. Smart metering offers potential benefits to customers. These include, a) an end to estimated bills, which are a major source of complaints about many customers b) a tool to help consumers better manage their energy purchases—smart meters with a display outside their homes could provide up-to-date information on gas and electricity consumption and in doing so help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills. Smart meters for water consumption can also provide detailed and timely information about customer water use and early notification of possible water leaks in their premisesSalomons, E., Sela, L., Housh, M. Hedging for privacy in smart water meters. Water Resources Research; 2020;56(9)doi:10.1029/2020WR027917. Electricity pricing usually peaks at certain predictable times of the day and the season. In particular, if generation is constrained, prices can rise if power from other jurisdictions or more costly generation is brought online. Proponents assert that billing customers at a higher rate for peak times encourages consumers to adjust their consumption habits to be more responsive to market prices and assert further, that regulatory and market design agencies hope these \\"price signals\\" could delay the construction of additional generation or at least the purchase of energy from higher-priced sources, thereby controlling the steady and rapid increase of electricity prices. An academic study based on existing trials showed that homeowners' electricity consumption on average is reduced by approximately 3-5% when provided with real-time feedback.McKerracher, C. and Torriti, J. (2013) Energy consumption feedback in perspective: integrating Australian data to meta-analyses on in-home displays. Energy Efficiency, Volume 6 (2). pp 387-405 Another advantage of smart meters that benefits both customers and the utility is the monitoring capability they provide for the whole electrical system. As part of an AMI, utilities can use the real-time data from smart meters measurements related to current, voltage,and power factor to detect system disruptions more quickly, allowing immediate corrective action to minimize customer impact such as blackouts. Smart meters also help utilities understand the power grid needs with more granularity than legacy meters. This greater understanding facilitates system planning to meet customer energy needs while reducing the likelihood of additional infrastructure investments, which eliminates unnecessary spending or energy cost increases. =Criticism of Smart Meter Roll-out in the UK= Citizens Advice said in August 2018 that 80% of people with a smart meter were happy with them. Still, it had 1,000 calls in 2017 about problems. These related to first-generation smart meters losing their functionality, aggressive sales practices, and still having to send smart meter readings. Ross Anderson of the Foundation for Information Policy Research has criticized the UK's program on the grounds that it is unlikely to lower energy consumption, is rushed and expensive, and does not promote metering competition. Anderson writes, \\"the proposed architecture ensures continued dominance of metering by energy industry incumbents whose financial interests are in selling more energy rather than less,\\" and urged ministers \\"to kill the project and instead promote competition in domestic energy metering, as the Germans do – and as the UK already has in industrial metering. Every consumer should have the right to appoint the meter operator of their choice.\\" In a 2011 submission to the Public Accounts Committee, Anderson wrote that Ofgem was \\"making all the classic mistakes which have been known for years to lead to public-sector IT project failures\\" and that the \\"most critical part of the project—how smart meters will talk to domestic appliances to facilitate demand response—is essentially ignored.\\" The high number of SMETS1 meters installed has been criticized by Peter Earl, head of energy at the price comparison website comparethemarket.com. He said, \\"The Government expected there would only be a small number of the first-generation of smart meters before Smets II came in, but the reality is there are now at least five million and perhaps as many as 10 million Smets I meters.\\" UK smart meters use the mobile phone network to communicate, so they do not work correctly when phone coverage is weak. A solution has been proposed, but was not operational as of March 2017. In March 2018 the National Audit Office (NAO), which watches over public spending, opened an investigation into the smart meter program, which had cost £11bn by then, paid for by electricity users through higher bills. The National Audit Office published the findings of its investigation in a report titled \\"Rolling out smart meters\\" published in November 2018. The report, amongst other findings, indicated that the number of smart meters installed in the UK would fall materially short of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) original ambitions of all UK consumers having a smart meter installed by 2020. In September 2019, smart meter rollout in the UK was delayed for four years. Ross Anderson and Alex Henney wrote that \\"Ed Miliband cooked the books\\" to make a case for smart meters appear economically viable. They say that the first three cost-benefit analyses of residential smart meters found that it would cost more than it would save, but \\"ministers kept on trying until they got a positive result... To achieve 'profitability' the previous government stretched the assumptions shamelessly\\". An economist at Ofgem with oversight of the roll-out of the smart meter program who raised concerns with his manager was threatened with imprisonment under a law intended to protect national security. The Employment Appeal Tribunal found that the law was in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. Technology = Connectivity = Communication is a critical technological requirement for smart meters. Each meter must be able to reliably and securely communicate the information collected to a central location. Considering the varying environments and places where meters are found, that problem can be daunting. Among the solutions proposed are: the use of cell and pager networks, satellite, licensed radio, combination licensed and unlicensed radio, and power line communication. Not only the medium used for communication purposes, but also the type of network used, is critical. As such, one would find: fixed wireless, wireless mesh network and wireless ad hoc networks, or a combination of the two. There are several other potential network configurations possible, including the use of Wi-Fi and other internet related networks. To date no one solution seems to be optimal for all applications. Rural utilities have very different communication problems from urban utilities or utilities located in difficult locations such as mountainous regions or areas ill-served by wireless and internet companies. In addition to communication with the head-end network, smart meters may need to be part of a home area network, which can include an in-premises display and a hub to interface one or more meters with the head end. Technologies for this network vary from country to country, but include power line communication, wireless ad hoc network, and ZigBee. =Protocols= ANSI C12.18 is an ANSI Standard that describes a protocol used for two-way communications with a meter, mostly used in North American markets. The C12.18 Standard is written specifically for meter communications via an ANSI Type 2 Optical Port, and specifies lower-level protocol details. ANSI C12.19 specifies the data tables that are used. ANSI C12.21 is an extension of C12.18 written for modem instead of optical communications, so it is better suited to automatic meter reading. ANSI C12.22 is the communication protocol for remote communications. IEC 61107 is a communication protocol for smart meters published by the IEC that is widely used for utility meters in the European Union. It is superseded by IEC 62056, but remains in wide use because it is simple and well-accepted. It sends ASCII data using a serial port. The physical media are either modulated light, sent with an LED and received with a photodiode, or a pair of wires, usually modulated by EIA-485. The protocol is half-duplex. IEC 61107 is related to, and sometimes wrongly confused with, the FLAG protocol. Ferranti and Landis+Gyr were early proponents of an interface standard that eventually became a sub-set of IEC1107. The Open Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP) is a family of specifications published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 14908 control networking standard for smart metering and smart grid applications. Millions of smart meters based on OSGP are deployed worldwide. On July 15, 2015, the OSGP Alliance announced the release of a new security protocol (OSGP-AES-128-PSK) and its availability from OSGP vendors. This deprecated the original OSGP- RC4-PSK security protocol which had been identified to be vulnerable. There is a growing trend toward the use of TCP/IP technology as a common communication platform for Smart Meter applications, so that utilities can deploy multiple communication systems, while using IP technology as a common management platform. A universal metering interface would allow for development and mass production of smart meters and smart grid devices prior to the communication standards being set, and then for the relevant communication modules to be easily added or switched when they are. This would lower the risk of investing in the wrong standard as well as permit a single product to be used globally even if regional communication standards vary.Elster suggests the benefits of a Universal Metering Interface (UMI) Some smart meters may use a test IR LED to transmit non-encrypted usage data that bypasses meter security by transmitting lower level data in real-time.See youtube video \\"Why is my smart meter blinking\\" =Data Management= The other critical technology for smart meter systems is the information technology at the utility that integrates the Smart Meter networks with utility applications, such as billing and CIS. This includes the Meter Data Management system. It also is essential for smart grid implementations that power line communication (PLC) technologies used within the home over a Home Area Network (HAN), are standardized and compatible. The HAN allows HVAC systems and other household appliances to communicate with the smart meter, and from there to the utility. Currently there are several broadband or narrowband standards in place, or being developed, that are not yet compatible. To address this issue, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) established the PAP15 group, which studies and recommends coexistence mechanisms with a focus on the harmonization of PLC Standards for the HAN. The objective of the group is to ensure that all PLC technologies selected for the HAN coexist as a minimum. The two leading broadband PLC technologies selected are the HomePlug AV / IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn technologies. Technical working groups within these organizations are working to develop appropriate coexistence mechanisms. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance has developed a new standard for smart grid HAN communications called the HomePlug Green PHY specification. It is interoperable and coexistent with the widely deployed HomePlug AV technology and with the latest IEEE 1901 global Standard and is based on Broadband OFDM technology. ITU-T commissioned in 2010 a new project called G.hnem, to address the home networking aspects of energy management, built upon existing Low Frequency Narrowband OFDM technologies. The Google.org's PowerMeter, until its demise in 2011, was able to use a smart meter for tracking electricity usage, as can eMeter' Energy Engage as in, for example, the PowerCentsDC(TM) demand response program. Advanced Metering Infrastructure Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) refers to systems that measure, collect, and analyze energy usage, and communicate with metering devices such as electricity meters, gas meters, heat meters, and water meters, either on request or on a schedule. These systems include hardware, software, communications, consumer energy displays and controllers, customer associated systems, meter data management software, and supplier business systems. Government agencies and utilities are turning toward advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems as part of larger \\"smart grid\\" initiatives. AMI extends automatic meter reading (AMR) technology by providing two-way meter communications, allowing commands to be sent toward the home for multiple purposes, including time-based pricing information, demand-response actions, or remote service disconnects. Wireless technologies are critical elements of the neighborhood network, aggregating a mesh configuration of up to thousands of meters for back haul to the utility’s IT headquarters. The network between the measurement devices and business systems allows the collection and distribution of information to customers, suppliers, utility companies, and service providers. This enables these businesses to participate in demand response services. Consumers can use the information provided by the system to change their normal consumption patterns to take advantage of lower prices. Pricing can be used to curb the growth of peak demand consumption. AMI differs from traditional automatic meter reading (AMR) in that it enables two-way communications with the meter. Systems only capable of meter readings do not qualify as AMI systems.Glossary provided by U.S. Department of Energy Opposition and Concerns Some groups have expressed concerns regarding the cost, health, fire risk,BC Hydro offers free fix if meter installers find hazard. 2012-08-09. CBC. Retrieved 2012-08-09. security and privacy effects of smart meters and the remote controllable \\"kill switch\\" that is included with most of them. Many of these concerns regard wireless- only smart meters with no home energy monitoring or control or safety features. Metering-only solutions, while popular with utilities because they fit existing business models and have cheap up-front capital costs, often result in such \\"backlash\\". Often the entire smart grid and smart building concept is discredited in part by confusion about the difference between home control and home area network technology and AMI. The (now former) attorney general of Connecticut has stated that he does not believe smart meters provide any financial benefit to consumers, however, the cost of the installation of the new system is absorbed by those customers. =Security= Smart meters expose the power grid to cyberattacks that could lead to power outages, both by cutting off people's electricity and by overloading the grid. However many cyber security experts state that smart meters of UK and Germany have a relatively high cybersecurity and that any such attack there would thus require extraordinarily high efforts or financial resources. The EU Cyber security Act took effect in June 2019, which includes Directive on Security Network and Information Systems establishing notification and security requirements for operators of essential services. Through the Smartgrid Cybersecurity Committee, the U.S. Department of Energy published cybersecurity guidelines for grid operators in 2010 and updated them in 2014. The guidelines “…present an analytical framework that organizations can use to develop effective cybersecurity strategies…” Implementing security protocols that protect these devices from malicious attacks has been problematic, due to their limited computational resources and long operational life. The current version of IEC 62056 includes the possibility to encrypt, authenticate, or sign the meter data. One proposed smart meter data verification method involves analyzing the network traffic in real-time to detect anomalies using an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) By identifying exploits as they are being leveraged by attackers, an IDS mitigates the suppliers' risks of energy theft by consumers and denial-of-service attacks by hackers. Energy utilities must choose between a centralized IDS, embedded IDS, or dedicated IDS depending on the individual needs of the utility. Researchers have found that for a typical advanced metering infrastructure, the centralized IDS architecture is superior in terms of cost efficiency and security gains. In the United Kingdom, the Data Communication Company, which transports the commands from the supplier to the smart meter, performs an additional anomaly check on commands issued (and signed) by the energy supplier. As Smart Meter devices are Intelligent Measurement Devices which periodically record the measured values and send the data encrypted to the Service Provider, therefore in Switzerland these devices need to be evaluated by an evaluation Laboratory, and need to be certified by METAS from 01.01.2020 according to Prüfmethodologie (Test Methodology for Execution of Data Security Evaluation of Swiss Smart Metering Components). According to a report published by Brian Krebs, in 2009 a Puerto Rico electricity supplier asked the FBI to investigate large-scale thefts of electricity related to its smart meters. The FBI found that former employees of the power company and the company that made the meters were being paid by consumers to reprogram the devices to show incorrect results, as well as teaching people how to do it themselves. = Health and Safety= Most health concerns about the meters arise from the pulsed radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by wireless smart meters.Hess, David J., and Jonathan Coley. 2013. “Wireless Smart Meters and Public Acceptance: The Environment, Limited Choices, and Precautionary Politics” , Public Understanding of Science Forthcoming. Members of the California State Assembly asked the California Council on Science and Technology (CCST) to study the issue of potential health impacts from smart meters, in particular whether current FCC standards are protective of public health. The CCST report in April 2011 found no health impacts, based both on lack of scientific evidence of harmful effects from radio frequency (RF) waves and that the RF exposure of people in their homes to smart meters is likely to be minuscule compared to RF exposure to cell phones and microwave ovens. Daniel Hirsch, retired director of the Program on Environmental and Nuclear Policy at UC Santa Cruz, criticized the CCST report on the grounds that it did not consider studies that suggest the potential for non-thermal health effects such as latent cancers from RF exposure. Hirsch also stated that the CCST report failed to correct errors in its comparison to cell phones and microwave ovens and that, when these errors are corrected, smart meters \\"may produce cumulative whole-body exposures far higher than that of cell phones or microwave ovens.\\" The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted recommended Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for all RF transmitters (including smart meters) operating at frequencies of 300 kHz to 100 GHz. These limits, based on field strength and power density, are below the levels of RF radiation that are hazardous to human health. Other studies substantiate the finding of the California Council on Science and Technoloy (CCST). In 2011, the Electric Power Research Institute performed a study to gauge human exposure to smart meters as compared to the FCC PEL. The report found that most smart meters only transmit RF signals 1% of the time or less. At this rate, and at a distance of 1 foot from the meter, RF exposure would be at a rate of 0.14% of the FCC PEL. \\"Characterization of Radio Frequency Emissions from Two Models of Wireless Smart Meters.\\" December 2011. Issues surrounding smart meters causing fires have also been reported, particularly involving the manufacturer's Sensus. In 2012. PECO Energy Company replaced the Sensus meters it had deployed in the Philadelphia region after reports that a number of the units had overheated and caused fires. In July 2014, SaskPower, the province-run utility company of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, halted its roll-out of Sensus meters after similar, isolated incidents were discovered. Shortly afterward, Portland General Electric announced that it would replace 70,000 smart meters that had been deployed in the state of Oregon after similar reports. The company noted that it had been aware of the issues since at least 2013, and they were limited to specific models it had installed between 2010 and 2012. On July 30, 2014, after a total of eight recent fire incidents involving the meters, SaskPower was ordered by the Government of Saskatchewan to immediately end its smart meter program, and remove the 105,000 smart meters it had installed. = Privacy Concerns= One technical reason for privacy concerns is that these meters send detailed information about how much electricity is being used each time. More frequent reports provide more detailed information. Infrequent reports may be of little benefit for the provider, as it doesn't allow as good demand management in the response of changing needs for electricity. On the other hand, widespread reports would allow the utility company to infer behavioral patterns for the occupants of a house, such as when the members of the household are probably asleep or absent. Furthermore, the fine-grained information collected by smart meters raises growing concerns of privacy invasion due to personal behavior exposure (private activity, daily routine, etc.)Salomons, E., Sela, L., Housh, M. Hedging for privacy in smart water meters. Water Resources Research; 2020;56(9)doi:10.1029/2020WR027917. Current trends are to increase the frequency of reports. A solution that benefits both provider and user privacy would be to adapt the interval dynamically. Another solution involves energy storage installed at the household used to reshape the energy consumption profile.Z. Li, T. J. Oechtering, and M. Skoglund, ”Privacy-preserving energy flow control in smart grids”, Proc. 41st IEEE ICASSP 2016, Shanghai, China, March 2016. (poster) In British Columbia the electric utility is government- owned and as such must comply with privacy laws that prevent the sale of data collected by smart meters; many parts of the world are serviced by private companies that are able to sell their data. In Australia debt collectors can make use of the data to know when people are at home. Used as evidence in a court case in Austin, Texas, police agencies secretly collected smart meter power usage data from thousands of residences to determine which used more power than \\"typical\\" to identify marijuana growing operations. Smart meter power data usage patterns can reveal much more than how much power is being used. Research has demonstrated that smart meters sampling power levels at two-second intervals can reliably identify when different electrical devices are in use. Ross Anderson has written about privacy concerns. He writes \\"It is not necessary for my meter to tell the power company, let alone the government, how much I used in every half-hour period last month\\"; that meters can provide \\"targeting information for burglars\\"; that detailed energy usage history can help energy companies to sell users exploitative contracts; and that there may be \\"a temptation for policymakers to use smart metering data to target any needed power cuts.\\" = Opt-out Options= Reviews of smart meter programs, moratoriums, delays, and \\"opt-out\\" programs are some responses to the concerns of customers and government officials. In response to residents who did not want a smart meter, in June 2012 a utility in Hawaii changed its smart meter program to \\"opt out\\". The utility said that once the smart grid installation project is nearing completion, KIUC may convert the deferral policy to an opt-out policy or program and may charge a fee to those members to cover the costs of servicing the traditional meters. Any fee would require approval from the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. After receiving numerous complaints about health, hacking, and privacy concerns with the wireless digital devices, the Public Utility Commission of the US state of Maine voted to allow customers to opt-out of the meter change at the cost of $12 a month.State regulators to vote on PG&E; smart meter \\"opt-out\\", San Jose Mercury News, 2012-02-01. In Connecticut, another US state to consider smart metering, regulators declined a request by the state's largest utility, Connecticut Light & Power, to install 1.2 million of the devices, arguing that the potential savings in electric bills do not justify the cost. CL&P; already offers its customers time-based rates. The state's Attorney General George Jepsen was quoted as saying the proposal would cause customers to spend upwards of $500 million on meters and get few benefits in return, a claim that Connecticut Light & Power disputed. =Lack of Savings in Results= There are questions about whether electricity is or should be primarily a \\"when you need it\\" service where the inconvenience/cost-benefit ratio of time-shifting of loads is poor. In the Chicago area, Commonwealth Edison ran a test installing smart meters on 8,000 randomly selected households together with variable rates and rebates to encourage cutting back during peak usage. In Crain's Chicago Business article \\"Smart grid test underwhelms. In the pilot, few power down to save money.\\", it was reported that fewer than 9% exhibited any amount of peak usage reduction and that the overall amount of reduction was \\"statistically insignificant\\". This was from a report by the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility industry think tank who conducted the study and prepared the report. Susan Satter, senior assistant Illinois attorney general for public utilities said \\"It's devastating to their plan......The report shows zero statistically different result compared to business as usual.\\" Smart grid test underwhelms. In pilot, few power down to save money by Paul Merrion Crain's Chicago Business May 30, 2011 Retrieved September 3, 2012 By 2016, the 7 million smart meters in Texas had not persuaded many people to check their energy data as the process was too complicated. A report from a parliamentary group in the UK suggests people who have smart meters installed are expected to save an average of £11 annually on their energy bills, much less than originally hoped. The 2016 cost-benefit analysis was updated in 2019 and estimated a similar average saving. =Erratic Demand= Smart meters can allow real-time pricing, and in theory this could help smooth power consumption as consumers adjust their demand in response to price changes. However, modelling by researchers at the University of Bremen suggests that in certain circumstances, \\"power demand fluctuations are not dampened but amplified instead.\\" =In the Media= In 2013, Take Back Your Power, an independent Canadian documentary directed by Josh del Sol was released describing \\"dirty electricity\\" and the aforementioned issues with smart meters. The film explores the various contexts of the health, legal, and economic concerns. It features narration from the mayor of Peterborough, Ontario, Daryl Bennett, as well as American researcher De-Kun Li, journalist Blake Levitt, and Dr. Sam Milham. It won a Leo Award for best feature-length documentary and the Annual Humanitarian Award from Indie Fest the following year.

He was the son of Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde and Honora Burke. Knighted in 1602 for his exploits as leader of the English cavalry during the Battle of Kinsale, he would later serve as Governor of Connaught from 1604 to 1616, and as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Having established himself as the largest and most influential landowner in Connacht, his later life was characterized by animosity between him and an increasingly hostile and acquisitive Dublin government. He actively served Queen Elizabeth I against the rebel Irish lordships and their Spanish allies during the Nine Years' War. He was appointed governor of Connaught, member of the privy council in Ireland, and, in 1624, created Viscount Tunbridge and Baron of Somerhill, a manor which he owned in Kent. The titles of Viscount Galway and Earl of St. Albans were conferred on him in 1628. Portumna Castle was commissioned by Richard Burke and completed in 1617. By 1633 he was not only one of the principal landowners in Ireland, but virtually all powerful in County Galway. This aroused the resentment of the Dublin Government, which decided to use the method of empanelling juries to \\"find\\" defective titles, in order to recover the lands in question for the English Crown. The treatment which Lord Clanricarde experienced from the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, was said to have accelerated his death in November 1635: Wentworth however pointed to the Earl's advancing years and asked sarcastically if he was to blame for a man being over sixty. The feud, which was continued by Clanricarde's son and heir, was in the long run very damaging to Strafford, who apparently did not reflect on the close connections Clanricarde, through his wife, had with just that faction of the English nobility, the Rich-Devereux clan, who were most hostile to Strafford. In 1603, he married Frances Walsingham, the widow of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. They had one son, Ulick, and two daughters, Honora, who married John Paulet, 5th Marquis of Winchester, and Mary, wife of Hon. Edward Butler of Ballinahinch. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Ulick, as 5th Earl of Clanricarde, who in 1622 had married Lady Anne Compton, only daughter of William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton.

The earliest use of the word \\"tartanry\\" itself is said to have been in 1976.Sunday Times (Colour Suppl.) 31 Oct 73 Tartanry has spread into radio, television, cabaret and clubs Definition Tartanry is the perceived reduction of Scottish culture to kitsch, twee, distorted imagery based on ethnic stereotypes. Often the image presented is that of the Highlander as noble savage. While there are strong, legitimate cultural traditions behind Scottish clan societies and the older textile designs that preceded the modern tartans and kilts, and instruments like bagpipes are a part of the living musical traditions, Tartanry is when these things are tokenized, caricatured, or attached to fabricated histories. While Scottish Gaelic is a living language, that has developed and grown with modern culture, tartanry presents it as a dead relic and curiosity, and those acting from this perspective may simply redefine words, or change their spellings to gibberish, for no other reason than to appear quaint or exotic. Tartanry is defined by literary scholar Cairns Craig as, \\"the false glamour that Scott had foisted on Scotland and which had turned it into Brigadoon.\\" History David Wilkie's flattering portrait of the kilted King George IV Modern historians suggest that due to economic and social change, the clan system in the Highlands was already declining by the time of the failed 1745 rising.R. C. Ray, Highland Heritage: Scottish Americans in the American South (UNC Press Books, 2001), , p. 41. In its aftermath the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process, including a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan (in the Dress Act 1746) and limitations on the activities of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the legislation was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a process of the rehabilitation of Highland culture. The Dress Act was repealed in 1782, and tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. However, by the nineteenth century tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people. In the 1820s, as part of the Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.J. L.

Sievers, The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland (GRIN Verlag, 2007), , pp. 22-5. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycle published by Scottish poet James Macpherson's in 1761-2.P. Morère, Scotland and France in the Enlightenment (Bucknell University Press, 2004), , pp. 75-6.William Ferguson, The identity of the Scottish Nation: an Historic Quest (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 227. Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels further helped popularise select aspects of Scottish life and history and he founded the Celtic Society of Edinburgh in 1820. He staged the royal Visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan. George IV was the first reigning monarch to visit Scotland in 171 years.I. Moncreiffe of that Ilk, The Highland Clans (London: Barrie & Rocklif, 1967), p. 24. Scott and the Celtic Society urged Scots to attend festivities \\"all plaided and plumed in their tartan array\\".M. Magnusson, Scotland: The Story of a Nation (Grove Press, 2003), , pp. 653-4.

Nevertheless, the result was a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. Lord Macaulay, son of an Argyll family, wrote of the Romantic reinvention of Highland customs: The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity.N.

The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by Queen Victoria who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort and the popularity of the tartan fashion. Her Highland enthusiasm led to the design of two new tartan patterns, “Victoria” and “Balmoral”, the latter named after her castle Balmoral in Aberdeen, which from 1852 became a major royal residence.

Credit derivative indexes form a large sector of the overall credit derivative market. The indices are constructed on a set of rules with the overriding criterion being that of liquidity of the underlying credit default swaps (CDS). The group of indices was formed by the merger in 2004 of the Trac-X indices created by J.P. Morgan & Co. and Morgan Stanley and the iBoxx CDS indices created by Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro and IBoxx. History Credit default swap indices originated in 2001, as did synthetic credit indices, when J.P. Morgan launched the JECI and Hydi indices. Then Morgan Stanley's Credit desk (under Annabel Littlewood) launched Synthetic TRACERS. \\"The two banks subsequently merged their indices under the Trac-X name in 2003. In parallel, ABN AMRO and Deutsche Bank teamed with iBoxx to launch the iBoxx CDS indices in February 2003. These indices were the first to have an independent calculation agent in an index provider (and not an investment bank trading the underlying). In 2004, Trac-X and iBoxx merged to form CDX in North America and iTraxx in Europe and Asia.\\" The iTraxx suite of indices are owned, managed, compiled and published by Markit, who also license market makers. Markit administered the CDX family of indices and acting as the calculation agent for the iTraxx indices. In November 2007 Markit acquired CDX and iTraxx. By 2011 Markit owned and managed \\"the Markit iTraxx, Markit CDX, Markit iTraxx SovX, Markit iTraxx LevX, and Markit LCDX families of CDS indices as well as the Markit iBoxx cash bond indices.\\" By 2011 Markit iTraxx and Markit CDX index trade volumes exceeded US$70 billion a day. They had a \\"net notional outstanding over US$1.2 trillion.\\" In 2011 Markit iTraxx and Markit CDX index traded almost 50% of the market in single name credit derivatives. On 25 February 2013 ICC launched iTraxx instruments for dealer-dealer and client clearing. Market Credit default swap indices allow an investor to transfer credit risk in a more efficient manner than using groups of single credit default swaps. They are standardised contracts and reference a fixed number of obligors with shared characteristics. Investors can be long or short the index which is equivalent to being protection buyers or sellers. In 1996 the outstanding notional value of credit derivatives (credit default swaps (CDSs)) was $40 billion. By the end of 2001 it was approximately $1.2 trillion. By 2004 it was expected to be $4.8 trillion. Credit default swaps (CDSs) accounted for roughly 45% of the overall credit derivatives market in 2002. In 1997 there were three kinds of CDSs: corporate, bank and sovereign. CreditTrade was one of the major trading platforms for credit derivatives in 2003. Creditex was the first inter-dealer broker to offer electronic CDS trading in 2004. Sovereign CDSs, which benefited from the standardisation of contract form and definitions in 1998 and 1999 as well as successful execution in the case of recent defaults, were considered the most liquid credit derivative instruments in emerging markets. Particularly as their liquidity increases, sovereign CDSs had the potential to supplement and increase efficiency in underlying sovereign bond markets. Between 2004 and the first half of 2007, the creation of credit derivatives indexes, credit default swap indexes, which essentially involve investors selling credit protection on a group of companies, was one of the factors that helped to drive spreads tighter. Since 5 February 2008 the index spread widened by 25 basis points to a record high just above 110 basis, 60 basis points wider than 1 January 2008 and 90 basis points higher than they were prior to the credit crisis, when basis points were at all-time lows. At 110 basis points it would cost \\"110,000 euros a year to insure 10 million euros of debt against default.\\" By mid-February 2008, as complex credit instruments unravelled, credit derivatives indexes in Europe set repeated new record highs. The Markit iTraxx Europe index ITRAC5EA=GFI had displaced the iTraxx Crossover index ITCRS5EA=GFI, which was made up of 50 mostly \\"junk\\"-rated companies. The Europe index sharply underperformed the iTraxx Crossover index ITCRS5EA=GFI. Trading The most widely traded of the indices is the iTraxx Europe index, also known simply as 'The Main', composed of the most liquid 125 CDS referencing European investment grade credits, subject to certain sector rules as determined by the IIC and also as determined by the SEC. There is also significant volume, in nominal values, of trading in the HiVol and Crossover (also referred to as Xover) indices. HiVol is a subset of the main Europe index consisting of what are seen as the most risky 30 constituents at the time the index is constructed. Crossover is constructed in a similar way but is composed of a min of 40 and a max of 50 sub-investment grade credits. Also traded are iTraxx Sector indices: NonFin (non-financials), SenFin (senior-financials) and SubFin (sub-financials). The constituents of the indices are changed every six months, a process known as \\"rolling\\" the index. The roll dates are March 20 and September 20 each year. For example, Series 13 was launched on March 20, 2010, with a maturity of June 20, 2015 for the 5-year contract. Other maturities for Europe and Crossover are 3 year, 7 year and the 10 year, whilst the NonFin, SenFin and SubFin only trade at maturities of 5 and 10 years. Trading in iTraxx CDS contracts predominantly occurs in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. However, as of February 25, 2013, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) began offering central clearing of iTraxx products. Furthermore, as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has mandated central clearing of most iTraxx products for entities subject to its jurisdiction beginning April 25, 2013, though the relevant compliance date depends on the size of the entity trading iTraxx products.

A National Historic Landmark, it is located in Cross Creek, Florida, between Ocala and Gainesville at 18700 South County Road 325. Setting Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Historic State Park is located on the eastern shore of Orange Lake, a short way south of the village of Cross Creek. The park is about in size, but is adjacent to public lands totalling about historically part of the Rawlings property. A public parking area and boat ramp are located south of the house, gardens, and outbuildings of the Rawlings home. The home is a rambling single-story wood frame structure, whose central core is a dogtrot house dating to the 19th century. Other buildings include a pump house, barn, and a small tenant house. Of these, only the pump house is also of 19th-century origin. History Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, a native of Washington, DC, and her husband Charles purchased a orange grove in 1929, including the old dogtrot house. They set about enlarging and adapting the house to their use, and both developed their careers as writers. Marjorie first achieved significant notice with stories published in Scribner's Magazine, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1939 for The Yearling. Her writing was infused with details from the central Florida region where she made her home. Upon her death in 1953, the property was bequeathed to a foundation of the University of Florida. It has been managed by the state ever since, the house opening to the public in 1970. Park activities Activities include hiking and hourly tours Thursday through Sunday, at 10 a.m. 11 a.m. and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., except in August and September. Amenities include two short hiking trails and park employees that bring 1930s rural Florida to life with period clothing and stories. In addition, guests are invited to pick and sample oranges from the many trees within the property. Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

Ecological debt refers to the accumulated debt of wealthier countries (from a defined date in the past until present) for having plundered poorer countries by the exploitation of their resources, the degradation of their natural habitat, the beggaring of local people and/or the free occupation of environmental space for waste discharge. The definition in itself has varied over the years and several scholars have attempted a greater specification of the concept. Within the ecological debt definition, two types of aspects are understood: the ecological damage caused over time by a country in one or other countries or to ecosystems beyond national jurisdiction through its production and consumption patterns; and the exploitation or use of ecosystems over time by a country at the expense of the equitable rights to these ecosystems by other countries.  History  The term 'ecological debt' first appeared on paper in 1985, in a yellow booklet with the title “Women in movement\\" made by the German ecofeminist Eva Quistorp and edited by the Green Party in Germany in 1985. The work was intended to be used for a workshop she gave on 'women, peace and ecology' in Nairobi during the United Nation Women’s Conference (the first workshop of this kind). In 1992, the term appeared again in two reports published in different places around the world: “Deuda ecológica” by Robleto and Marcelo in Chile and “Miljöskulden” by Jernelöv in Sweden. Robleto and Marcelo's report, published by the critical NGO Instituto de Ecologia Politica (IEP), was a political and activist response to the global environmental negotiations happening during the Rio Summit. It shed light on the debate occurring in Latin America since the 1980s about the crucial nature's heritage that had been consumed and not returned (i.e. ecological debt). On the other hand, Jernelöv's report goal was to calculate the Swedish debt for future generation and was intended to serve nationally for the Swedish Environmental Advisory. Although the last one had less world- wide influence in the concept's debate, it is important to note that both reports have opposite approach in considering the ecological debt: Robleto and Marcelo's report expresses it in symbolic terms, focusing on the moral and political aspects, whereas Jernelöv's report tries to quantify and monetize it in economic terms. In 1994, the Colombian lawyer Borrero, wrote a book on ecological debt. It referred to the environmental liabilities of Northern countries for the excessive per capita production of greenhouse gases, historically and at present. The concept has then been reused by some environmental organizations from the Global South. Campaigns on the ecological debt were launched since 1997 by Accion Ecologica of Ecuador and Friends of the Earth. Overall, the ecological debt 'movement' was born of the convergence of three main factors during the 80s-90s: 1) the consequences of the debt crisis in the 70s due to the Volcker shocks or the drastic increase of interest rates (followed by structural adjustments made by the US to solve the stagflation in 1981, and thus putting heavily indebted third world countries in an impossible situation in regards to debt repayment); 2) the rising of environmental awareness as seen previously (activists and NGOs attending the Rio Summit in 1992); 3) an increase in recognition of the violence caused by colonialism over the years (the demand of recognition is over 500 years, since Columbus arrived in North America). In 2009, ecofeminist scholar Ariel Salleh explained how the capitalist processes at work in the global North exploit nature and people simultaneously, ultimately sustaining a large ecological debt in her article, \\"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt\\". At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, politicians and corporate leaders from the global North introduced the supposed solution for the foreign debt crisis in the global South. They proposed 'debt for nature swaps', which essentially means that those countries that possess abundant biodiversity and environmental resources would give them up to the global North in return for the World Bank reducing their debt. Feminist environmentalists, Indigenous activists, and peasants from the Global South, exposed how the Global North is much more indebted to the Global South. Salleh justified this by explaining how the 500-year-long colonization process involving the extraction of resources has caused immense damage and destruction to the ecosystem of the Global South. In fact, scientists at the US National Academy for Sciences state that in the time period of 1961–2000, by analyzing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions created by the rich (the Global North) alone, it has become apparent that the rich have imposed climate changes on the poor that greatly outweigh the poor's foreign debt. All of this environmental degradation amounts to ecological debt, seizing the people's livelihood resources in the Global South. In 2009 as well, Andrew Simms used the ecological debt in a more bio-physical way and defined it as the consumption of resources from within an ecosystem that exceeds the system's regenerative capacity.Andrew Simms. Ecological Debt: The Health of the Planet & the Wealth of Nations. (London: Pluto Press, 2009) p.200. This is seen in particular in non-renewable resources wherein consumption outstrips production. In a general sense in his work, it refers to the depletion of global resources beyond the Earth's ability to regenerate them. The concept in this sense is based on the bio-physical carrying capacity of an ecosystem; through measuring ecological footprints human society can determine the rate at which it is depleting natural resources. Ultimately, the imperative of sustainability requires human society to live within the means of the ecological system to support life over the long term. Ecological debt is a feature of unsustainable economic systems.  Political dimension  = Historical context = There have been several debates around the notion of ecological debt, and this is mostly because the concept arises from various social movements in response to the distributional injustice of climate change's consequences on the environment and people's livelihood. Salleh, in particular, showed how the ecological debt manifested in the destruction of the environment and associated climate change the North has created is made possible through the process of modernization and capitalism.Salleh, A. (2009). Ecological debt: embodied debt. Eco-Sufficiency and Global Justice. London: Pluto Press. The rise of the nature-culture divide that emerged due to rapid industrialisation is a perfect illustration of a human-nature dualism in which human being has the central role above everything else. The notion of humans being embedded in the ecosystem that they live in is crucial to the discipline of political ecology. In political ecology, which reconnects nature and the economy, ecological debt is crucial because it recognizes that colonization has not only resulted in a loss of culture, way of life, and language for Indigenous peoples, but it has shaped the world economy into one that monetizes and commodifies the environment. For example, when the colonization of South America occurred over 500 years ago, European settlers brought with them their Eurocentric values, seeing themselves as better than and therefore entitled to the Indigenous people's knowledge and the land they lived on. In a perceived postcolonial world, large corporations and Western governments tend to present solutions to global warming by commodifying nature and hoping to make a profit out of it. This better-than-thou attitude has created the conditions for global warming to occur, making the North’s ecological footprint soar,Seager, J. (2009). The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World (4th ed.). New York, NY: Penguin. while also constructing an ecological debt so large as to completely rid the entire Global South of their financial debt. During the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, attending NGOs created the Debt Treaty, a document gathering all information to better define the ecological debt concept. They demanded compensation for damages over 500 years (1992 is exactly 500 years after the arrival of Columbus in North America). It was the first push back, reversing the stream, but it stayed as a draft paper not recognized by international institutions or lead countries at that time. Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 - Action Aid demonstration = Today = In the 2000s, two networks were created and still exist today: the Southern Peoples Ecological Debt Creditors Alliance (SPEDCA) which is a network of creditors that launched a campaign for the recognition of ecological debt, and the European Network for the Recognition of Ecological Debt (ENRED) which is a network of debtors. During the COP in Copenhagen in December 2009, some governments from developing countries or countries most vulnerable to climate change consequences (such as Bolivia, Mauritania, Chad, or island countries as Maldives or Haiti) have argued that the principle of shared responsibility demands that rich nations or developed economies (such as the United States, some European countries, China) go beyond donations or adaptation credits and make reparations that recognize an ecological debt for excessive emissions over several decades. The top United States ambassador, Todd Stern, flatly rejected arguments by diplomats from these countries that the United States owed such a debt. The COP 21 in Paris brought minor progress with an increase in financial aid for developing countries. Although the goal was to prepare future action to be undertaken for adapting to climate change and consider loss and damages (especially displaced people) of some countries, no real action was adopted. There were no recognition of responsibilities but recommendations only.  Calculations  = Climate debt = When discussing ecological debt, climate debt appears to be the only example of a scientific attempt to quantify the debt. It incorporates two different elements: the adaptation debt which is the cost to communities of adapting to climate damages they are not responsible for, and the consumption debt or emission's debt which is compensation due for emitting carbon in the present time. Emission debts should hypothetically be paid for by those countries that have over-emitted their fair-share of emissions. To determine this debt, an emissions or carbon budget can and is calculated, and distributed among countries. = Calculations = Academic work on calculations of the ecological debt came later. An article published in 2008 looked at the distribution of ecological impacts for various human activities. Studies were also produced at regional level within countries, for instance for Orissa in India.S. Khatua and W. Stanley, \\"Ecological Debt: a case study from Orissa, India\\" (2006) As seen previously, calculation of the ecological debt implies various aspects related to political ecology. While calculating the amount of emissions, some scholars have disregard inequalities of emissions from the past whereas others have considered historical accountability. In 2000, Neumayer calculated what he named the 'historical emissions debt', consisting on the difference in emissions of actual historical emissions (from a specific date in the past) and equal per-capita emissions (current emissions). Theoretically, it may be possible to put a money value on ecological debt by calculating the value of the environmental and social externalities associated with historic resource extraction and adding an estimated value for the share of global pollution problems borne by poor countries as the result of higher consumption levels in rich ones. This includes efforts to value the external costs associated with climate change. In 2015, Matthews proposed a method to calculate the ecological debt, by looking at the accumulated \`carbon debts' for each country. The model uses historical estimates of national fossil fuel CO2 emissions and population and this since 1960. Furthermore, it runs a comparison between temperature changes each year by each country's emissions compared to a proportional temperature change of each country's share of the world population (this same year). This gives the accumulated credits and debts related to a larger range of emissions and the 'climate debts' obtained would be the difference between the actual temperature change (caused by each country) and their per-capita share of global temperature change. Other scholars have proposed a different approach, a \`modified equal shares' approach, that would consider each country's basic needs and would weight each ones' share of emissions. However, this approach brings potential ethical and political difficulties to quantitatively defining what would thus be the equal shares.  Key debates  Although some recent emerging countries have participated in the increase of carbon emissions, the situation tend to stay uneven in-between developing and developed countries regarding who is affected the most versus who pollutes the most. Recent studies on ecological debt focus more on sub-topics as the notion of historical responsibility (whether or not a country is considered ethically responsible or accountable for carbon emissions prior 1990, i.e. when global warming was universally recognized), the components of climate debt (see above sections), the difficulties in deciding when to start counting past emissions and if this debate is slowing the implementation of programs or the legal and political consecration of the debt through treaties. Present key debates focus on how is the debt going to be paid back. First, some academia have pushed for financial debt cancellation rather than being paid for ecological damages and then paying back the country's national financial debt. However, financial debts were not even agree by people (in developing countries especially) in the first place, calling it the unfair \\"Volcker debt\\". Accepting this option could hold the risk of giving legitimize credits to these financial debts. A second solution proposed is the Basic Income Guarantee (BIG) or the universal basic income. It consists on regular cash payments to everyone in a community (or country) and has proven a certain efficacy in some places around the world (like Namibia). Another debate addresses the fact that the ecological debt risks “commodifying nature”, exhausting ecosystem services. Researchers have tackled this risk by showing how it will expand the inclination of objectifying, monetizing and ultimately commodifying nature. Moreover, the language of debt, repayments, credits and so forth is understood in Northern countries mostly, and is mostly focused on recognition of wrongdoing but not payment for loss of services for instance.

Lesa v Attorney- General of New Zealand Her case Lesa v Attorney-General of New Zealand, in which she pressed her claim to be a New Zealand citizen, is a key legal case and had considerable impact on Samoans and New Zealand Law. The Privy Council ruled in July 1982 that all Western Samoans born between 1924 and 1948 were British subjects, and that under the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 from 1 January 1949 they and their descendants had become New Zealand citizens. One of the results of this ruling was the controversial decision by the Muldoon National government to pass the New Zealand Citizenship and Western Samoa Act 1982 which effectively rescinded and annulled any citizenship claims by Samoans living in Samoa in retrospect. Lesa herself (who is named in the Act) was granted New Zealand citizenship. Her barristers were George Rosenberg and Dr. George Paterson Barton, Q.C., from Wellington, who both acted in a number of prominent cases affecting Samoans. The case continues to generate controversy and spur efforts to amend the immigration and nationality laws in New Zealand.

The traditional group of 'symmetrodonts' ranges in age from the latest Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. Most research during the 21st century has concluded that they do not represent a discrete phylogenetic category. However, the name is still used informally by some researchers for convenience, or restricted to the spalacotheriids and zhangheotheriids. Symmetrodonts with acutely-triangulated molar cusps (“acute- angled symmetrodonts”) seem to form a true monophyletic group, and lasted from the Early Cretaceous to the Campanian, although Zhangheotheriidae might be paraphyletic in relation to other forms. Chronoperates has been suggested to be a late surviving representative of this clade, offering a ghost lineage extending to the late Paleocene; however, no recent phylogenetic studies have incorporated it. Particular sub−groups of Symmetrodonta are better studied, e.g. Spalacotheriidae, which has acute−angled molariform teeth, strongly reduced talonids, and conspicuous anterior and posterior cingulids. Biology Though some forms like Zhangheotherium retain a Meckelian groove, at least Spalacotheriidae lost it, acquiring modern ear anatomy. Their deciduous canines and premolars as well as long lower jaw indicate a carnivorous/insectivorous diet. Zhangheotherium was specialised to a scansorial lifestyle. It shows evidence of tarsal spurs, indicating that, like most non-therian Mammaliaformes, at least some symmetrodonts were venomous like the modern platypus. One species, Spalacotheridium noblei, is notable for its small size. It is one of the smallest known mammals. Each individual molar is little more than 0.25 mm across.

Early life Cahill graduated from the Boston University College of Arts and Sciences in 1981. Early political career Cahill's first attempt to be elected to political office came in 1981, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Quincy City Council. He ran again in 1987, at the age of 29, and was elected, where he served until 2003. He was reelected seven times and served as the chair of the finance committee. In 1996, Cahill was elected as Norfolk County treasurer and served until 2002, when he began his campaign for state treasurer. In the 2002 Democratic primary, Cahill won a four-way race that included another candidate with the same surname, Michael P. Cahill,Democratic Primary Results 2002 and was elected state Tteasurer in the general election. During Cahill's tenure as treasurer, the Massachusetts Lottery raised $7.2 billion. Much of the money went to cities and towns in the form of local aid.http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=trepressrelease&L;=1&L0;=Home&sid;=Ctre&b;=pressrelease&f;=2010_080510LOTTERY903&csid;=Ctre On July 7, 2009, The Boston Globe reported that Cahill was planning to leave the Democratic Party. On September 9, 2009, Cahill announced that he would run in the 2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial election as an independent. State Treasurer =Massachusetts School Building Authority= During his tenure as state Treasurer, Cahill was Chairman of the seven-member Board of Directors. He filed the legislation to reform the School Building Assistance Program (SBA) in 2004. He worked with Governor Mitt Romney and the legislature to pass that legislation. Prior to the reform, Governor Romney said the SBA could be \\"the next Big Dig.\\" As chair of the newly authorized Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) that received the prior SBA's responsibilities and debts, Cahill lead the initial years of the entity's activities. The MSBA has received praise from members of both parties for its fiscal management and effectiveness. =Pension Reserves Investment Management Board= As Treasurer, Cahill served as Chairman of the nine-member Pension Reserves Investment Management (PRIM) Board, which is charged with the general supervision of the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund. =The Massachusetts Lottery= Cahill was Chairman of the five-member Lottery Commission, which was established by the Legislature in 1971 to provide local aid to Massachusetts cities and towns, as well as the state Arts Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council. As of April 24, 2010, Massachusetts Lottery FY10 sales are about $3.636 billion while FY09 sales during same period were $3.645 billion, a dropoff of 0.25 percent from year to year. The state's lottery will post record profits that year - $903 million - while lottery sales stayed even. Cities and towns expect to receive an extra $44 million from lottery revenue. Cahill has argued that the increased revenues are the product of spending cuts and new games. Since taking office in 2003, the Lottery has returned $7.3 billion in Local Aid to cities and towns.http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1285661 =Massachusetts health care reform= Cahill is a vocal critic of the state's health care reform bill, often called \\"Romneycare\\" for Governor Mitt Romney, who signed the legislation into law, and which Cahill has called \\"a fiscal train wreck\\" that has \\"blown a hole in the Commonwealth's budget.\\" While projected to cost the taxpayers only $88 million in 2006, the actual cost of the Bay State's healthcare system was over $4 billion. 2010 campaign for governor Cahill ran as an independent for the office of governor of Massachusetts, with former State Representative Paul Loscocco (R) as his running mate. He ran against incumbent Governor Deval Patrick (D) and the former Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare CEO Charles D. Baker, Jr. (R). Some pre- election polls showed that Cahill would draw votes from both Patrick and Baker equally, which showed his moderate and centrist position in the race. A Boston Globe poll, published on September 26, 2010, showed Cahill to be drawing more votes from Patrick than from Baker. On October 1, 2010, Loscocco announced he was withdrawing from the race for lieutenant governor and was endorsing Baker although it was too late to remove his name from the ballot as Cahill's running mate. Speculation immediately began over Loscocco's motives and the role of the Baker camp in the decision in which Baker joined Loscocco for the announcement. Cahill filed a lawsuit that alleged that Loscocco had colluded with former Cahill Republican staffers to orchestrate his abandonment and e-mails exchanged between Loscocco's top advisor. The lawsuit sought to prevent the staffers from sharing proprietary information with the Baker campaign. Cahill received 8% of the vote at the November 2, 2010 general election. Post-political career After leaving the office of treasurer, Cahill became a securities broker in November 2011 with Compass Securities Corporation of Braintree, Massachusetts.http://www.compasssecurities.com/Cahillbio.html Cahill ended his employment with Compass on March 7, 2017, shortly after he had paid off his $100,000 civil fine and completed his probationary period from a 2013 settlement with Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley (see next section). In July, 2017, Cahill began as the president and executive director of the Quincy Chamber of Commerce. At the time, he stated that he had no interest in running for public office again. Corruption trial Adam Meldrum, Cahill's campaign manager during his 2010 campaign for governor, alleged that Cahill colluded with the Massachusetts Lottery, which is overseen by the state treasurer's office, to run an ad favorable to him during the campaign. The ad, paid for by the Commonwealth, described the Massachusetts Lottery \\"the most successful state lottery America\\" and \\"consistently well- managed,\\" which echoed themes from Cahill's gubernatorial campaign. Both Cahill and Massachusetts Lottery Director Mark Cavanagh denied the allegations. On October 18, e-mails released in conjunction with Cahill's lawsuit appeared to reveal that the campaign attempted to have the Lottery air a series of ads that praised the lottery's management. In the e-mails, Cahill's campaign media strategist Dane Strother told Meldrum to \\"Get the Lottery immediately cutting a spot and get it up...Needs to focus on the Lottery being the best in the country and above reproach.\\" Two days later, Cahill's senior adviser Scott Campbell wrote, \\"I think the first thing is to figure out what/where/how we want to do this .. with Lottery people.\\" On April 2, 2012, Cahill was indicted by a grand jury on charges that he used $1.65 million in Massachusetts State Lottery advertising to aid his campaign for governor in 2010. On December 12, 2012, a mistrial was declared in the corruption case after the jury failed to reach a verdict on two counts of conspiracy. Attorney General Martha Coakley said that she would review her options before she decided whether to pursue another trial. On March 1, 2013, Cahill agreed to pay a $100,000 civil fine in exchange for the prosecution dropping its criminal corruption case against him. In February 2017, Cahill posted to his FINRA Broker Check record that the \\"monetary fine (sic) paid in full as of 1/27/2017 and on 2/1/2017 the court dismissed the case; all four charges were dismissed after the completion of the probation period.\\" Notes External links *Follow the Money - Timothy P.

Davis started his first-class cricket career at the age of 17, playing for Trinidad. After a good Shell Shield season in 1968 Davis was selected for the West Indies. The highlight of his career was a home series against India, in which he scored 529 runs in four Tests at the average of 132.25. He was also a useful bowler, taking 63 wickets at first-class level. His Test career ended while the West Indies were in transition, and the arrival of newer players accounted for any place for Davis in the side. Career Born 1 January 1944, Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Davis was part of the West Indies squad that toured Australia between November 1968 and February 1969. The West Indies had dominated Test cricket for most of the decade, but at this stage the team contained many ageing stars and encountered an Australian team on the rise. Davis was one of the younger players in the touring party, and made his Test debut at the age of 22. Australia won the five-match series 3–1. After they lost the first Test, the West Indies made three changes to their team by bringing in three debutants: Davis, Roy Fredericks, and Prof Edwards. Davis batted down the order (after the sixth wicket in the first innings, and one place lower in the second, coming in after the fall of the seventh wicket) and made scores of 18 and 10. By inflicting an innings defeat on the West Indies, Australia batted just once in the match. Davis bowled 24 overs, conceding 94 runs while taking the wicket of opening batsman Bill Lawry. It was the only Test Davis played on the tour. Davis' next taste of Test cricket was during the West Indies tour of England in 1969. In the meantime the West Indies had drawn a series with New Zealand and the team had undergone significant changes in personnel. Only five of the sixteen touring West Indians had played in England before. On his return to the team in the opening Test, Davis batted much higher than he had on debut and in both innings came in after the fall of the second wicket, scoring 34 and 24. Davis registered his maiden Test century in the second Test and was the only one scored by a West Indian during the tour.

It was the Israel Defense Forces' first armoured brigade which possessed tanks, jeeps and armored personnel carriers (APCs), whereas all other IDF units at the time were entirely infantry-based. The brigade was called 'armored' for morale reasons, although in reality it only had a single tank company (later in the war, two companies), and a single APC company (these companies became the brigade's armored battalion), and an assault battalion composed of jeeps. The Brigade's first commander was Yitzhak Sadeh. 8th Armoured Brigade, 1948 History 8th Armoured Brigade captures Lydda airport (1948) Palmach M4 Sherman tank leading a convoy =Founding and organization= The brigade was founded and subordinated to Yitzhak Sadeh on May 24, 1948. Two battalions were created—the 82nd Tank Battalion under Felix Biatus, and the 89th Commando Battalion under Moshe Dayan. Another battalion, the 88th, was founded later. According to Dayan, the 89th consisted of four companies each made up from different groups: from kibbutz and moshav members, from Tel Aviv, from Lehi, and veterans from South Africa. The battalion consisted entirely of volunteers: \\"A\\" company consisted of men from the disbanded Lehi underground organisation; \\"B\\" company was taken from the 43rd Battalion, Kiryati Brigade; \\"C\\" company from the Golani Brigade. Many of the men joined after personal approaches from Dayan, to the annoyance of their commanding officers. They were stationed at Tel Litvinsky. Their first action was against Irgun members landing arms from the Altalena at Kfar Vitkin, 23 miles north of Tel Aviv. The Alexandroni Brigade was \\"reluctant\\" to intervene, and Dayan was unable to deploy ex-members of Irgun from his battalion. =1948 Arab–Israeli War= On 11 July 1948 the 89th Battalion was involved in the attack on Lydda. Later that month, Dayan became the commander of the Jerusalem front and was replaced by Dov Chesis. On 28 October the 89th Battalion, now under Chesis, captured the town of al-Dawayima. Among others, the brigade participated in Operation Danny, Operation Yoav, Operation Assaf and Operation Horev. =After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War= Following the 1948 war, the brigade served as the backbone of the IDF's armored forces. In the Six-Day War, the brigade fought on two fronts, including in the Sinai and the Golan Heights. In the Yom Kippur War, the brigade fought in the Sinai. In the 1982 Lebanon War, the brigade was mobilized but did not take part in the fighting. A memorial to the 8th Brigade is located adjacent to the Ben Gurion International Airport.

It links Babbacombe Downs with Oddicombe Beach. The line runs every day, with a closure period in winter for maintenance. The first car runs at 09:30, and the last at 17:30. A bell is rung 30 and 15 minutes before closing. History In February 1923, the Torquay Tramway Company commissioned Waygood-Otis Ltd with the engineering and construction of the railway. Construction started in 1924, and the line was first opened on 1 April 1926. The line cost £15,648 to construct. The tramway company continued to work the line until 13 March 1935, when it was taken over by Torquay Borough Council. The line was closed in 1941, due to World War II security restrictions, and reopened in 1951 after modernisation by Messrs J & E Hall of Dartford. The railway underwent further refurbishment in 1993 and a three-year programme of renovation commenced in November 2005. In July 2009, the ownership of the line was transferred from Torbay Council, who had inherited ownership from Torquay Borough Council as a result of local government reorganisation, to a specially created community interest company.

Its first product, the ORCA/M assembler (Object Relocatable Code Assembler for Microcomputers, and also MACRO spelled backwards), developed jointly by Westerfield and Phil Montoya, was a powerful assembly language development environment, complete with a Unix-style shell, which ran on 8-bit Apple II computers. However, The Byte Works came into its own when Apple Computer was developing the Apple IIgs computer. In need of developer tools, they contacted The Byte Works and came to an agreement by which The Byte Works would develop the official developer tool suite for the Apple IIgs -- the Apple Programmer's Workshop (APW). This tool suite eventually would include an assembler as well as a C compiler. The Byte Works was also able to distribute its own developer tool suite, based on the same code as APW. The ORCA/M assembler came first, followed by ORCA/Pascal, ORCA/C, and several other languages, including ORCA/Modula-2 and ORCA/Integer BASIC. The Byte Works did produce software other than developer tools, although tools were their mainstay. The Quick Click Calc spreadsheet was an excellent spreadsheet for the Apple IIgs, although it arrived on the scene too late to have any major impact on the market. An easy-to-use and very powerful BASIC interpreter called GSoft BASIC was also eventually released in the mid-1990s. With the ability to communicate with the Apple IIgs Toolbox, it could be used to produce powerful software with a minimum of effort. The Byte Works ceased development of Apple II software in 2000 and licensed its entire product line to Syndicomm, which continues to publish its extensive library to this day.

It is located about 3 km east of Ben Nevis on the north side of Glen Nevis, near the town of Fort William. Apart from Ben Nevis, Aonach Beag is the highest peak in the British Isles outwith the Cairngorm mountains of eastern Scotland. Aonach Beag is linked to its close neighbour to the north, Aonach Mòr, by a high saddle or bealach. The name Aonach Beag (small ridge) might imply that this mountain is smaller than Aonach Mòr (big ridge). However, Aonach Beag is higher; the names refer to the relative bulk of the two mountains rather than their altitude. The easiest way up is to take the gondola lift serving the Nevis Range ski area on Aonach Mòr (a height of 650 m above sea level), and follow the ridge joining the two peaks. More traditionally, the hill is often climbed from the south from Glen Nevis. This way the walker avoids the paraphernalia associated with the ski development. Aonach Beag is almost invariably climbed in conjunction with Aonach Mòr. Aonach Beag's north face holds one of Scotland's longest-lying snow patches (grid reference NN196718), which sits at the bottom of the climb known as 'Queen's View' at an altitude of about 950m. This patch has been known to last through to the first lasting snows of the new winter, and was present continuously from late 2006 to late November 2011.

The act allowed and regulated the use of some Controlled Drugs (designated CD) by various classes of persons (e.g. doctors) acting in their professional capacity. In clinical practice, this mostly applies to the use of strong opiates for pain management and some amphetamine-like stimulants used for Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; both of which are regulated under Schedule 2. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society maintains a live database of the legal classification of medicines. Schedules Special responsibilities are placed upon pharmaceutical wholesalers, pharmacies and doctors in the stocking, distribution, issuing of prescriptions, supply and disposal of items listed under the first three of the schedules. The regulations have been further tightened since Dr Harold Shipman used diamorphine to murder hundreds of his patients during the late 20th century. =Schedule 1 - CD Lic= Drugs which are not used medically, and thus their possession and supply is prohibited; e.g. DMT and LSD except when licensed by the Home Office to carry out research. =Schedule 2 - CD= Substances subject to the full controlled drug requirements; e.g. Cannabis, diamorphine (heroin), pethidine, cocaine, methadone, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, fentanyl and oxycodone. Under the Act, a prescription for these drugs need to show full details including the form and strength of the preparation, with the total quantity written out in both words and figures. It is an offence for a doctor to issue an incomplete prescription or for a pharmacist to dispense a controlled drug unless all the required details are given. It is the prescriber's responsibility to minimize the risk of dependence or misuse by ensuring that such drugs are not started for a particular patient without good cause, that the dose is not increased to the point where dependency is more likely, and to avoid being an unwitting source of supply for addicts. The quantities of controlled drugs prescribed should match the likely needs of the patients until the next clinical review and prescription forms should be secured against theft. Requirements for safe custody in pharmacies apply to all Sch 2 Controlled Drugs except quinalbarbitone. The safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of controlled drugs must store them in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for each drug and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid. Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a police officer or a suitably qualified official). Until 2005 prescriptions for most schedule 2 & 3 drugs required certain details to be handwritten by the prescriber, unless he or she held a handwriting exemption certificate. The Shipman Inquiry however, found that this was one of the weaknesses in the audit system. Whereas computer generated prescriptions automatically left an audit trail which was easy to follow, handwritten prescriptions did not, even though all filed prescriptions are eventually sent to a central UK depositary. Therefore, good practice now calls for these prescriptions to be computer generated.Home Office (2005). Explanatory memorandum to the misuse of drugs and the misuse of drugs (supply to addicts) (amendment) regulations 2005.No.2864. Accessed 20-10-03 =Schedule 3 - CD No Reg= Include drugs subject to the same prescription requirements as Schedule 2 drugs, but without the requirement to maintain registers. With the exception of phenobarbitone or related drugs for treatment of epilepsy, no Sch 3 drug can be given as an emergency supply. Safe custody is currently only required for Tenuate Dospan (diethylpropion), buprenorphine products, temazepam and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol). Neither phenobarbitone nor midazolam require safe custody. Other Sch 3 drugs can be stored in the general dispensary. =Schedule 4= Controlled drug prescription requirements and safe custody requirements do not apply. Included drugs are Benzodiazepines (Subclass CD Benz), other than temazepam, flunitrazepam or midazolam, and androgenic and anabolic steroids (Subclass CD Anab). However CD Benz products- which also include mild stimulants such as mesocarb and femcamfamine, formerly prescribed as anorectics- are illegal to supply or possess without prescription and all Sch 4 drugs cannot be legally supplied without medical authority. As of April 2014 \\"Sativex\\", the Cannabis derived medicine prescribed for spasticity due to Multiple Sclerosis, is listed as a Schedule 4 Part 1 drug, whereas before that date it was a Schedule 1 drug requiring reporting and recording protocols (as earlier indicated on this page). =Schedule 5 - CD Inv P & CD Inv POM= Includes items which, because of their strength, are exempt from all requirements other than the need to retain invoices for two years.

Ta'isi Olaf Frederick Nelson (24 February 1883 – 28 February 1944) was a Samoan businessman and politician. He was one of the founding leaders of the anti-colonial Mau movement. Biography Nelson was born on 24 February 1883 in Safune on the island of Savai'i to Swedish trader August Nelson and his Samoan wife, Sina Tugaga, whose family had links to the Sa Tupua, a prominent chiefly family. His name Ta'isi is a matai chief title from his mother's family from the Savai'i village of Asau. Nelson grew up in the family's home village of Faleolo until the age of eight, when he was sent to the Marist Brothers School in Apia. He left the school at the age of thirteen and became an apprentice at the DH & PG firm.Samoan Patriot Pacific Islands Monthly, June 1944, p42 He worked at DH & PH for four years, during which time he founded Samoa's first brass band. After leaving DH & PG, Nelson returned to Savai'i and took over his father's business. He expanded his father's copra trading business throughout the islands, and by the time he was thirty-five, Nelson was one of the wealthiest members of the Apia community. He was influential in both the Samoan and European communities. Under German rule, the colonial administrators treated Nelson as an equal, but after New Zealand seized control in 1914, Nelson was excluded and alienated by the new government. Despite being elected to the Legislative Council in 1924, he could do little as he and the other elected members were constantly overruled by the more numerous government appointees. This treatment turned Nelson into one of the major forces in the Samoan independence movement, known as the Mau. In May 1927 Nelson founded a newspaper, the Samoa Guardian, to support its claims. In response to his growing public dissent, the New Zealand administration tried to brand Nelson as unscrupulous and a trouble maker. The colonial administration's desperation to silence Nelson led them to exile him in January 1928, along with two other part-European members of the Mau. During his five years of exile, Nelson took his protests as far as the League of Nations in Geneva. Six months after his return to Samoa, Nelson was sentenced to ten additional years in exile as well as eight months imprisonment in New Zealand. This was cut short in 1936, after Labour won the New Zealand general election in 1935. He returned to Samoa, and helped in the signing of the co-operation agreement between Samoan leaders and the New Zealand administration. He was subsequently elected to the Legislative Council in 1938 and re-elected in 1941. Nelson died in 1944, and it was not until 1962 that his dream of Samoan independence was realised. Legacy Ta'isi had six daughters. Viopapa Lucy, Irene Gustave Noue, Olive Virginia Malienafau, Joyce Rosabel Piliopo, Sina Hope and Calmar Josephine Taufau and one son, Ta'isi who died as a result of the influenza epidemic in 1919 aged 4.See O'Brien, Tautai Malienafau was the first Pacific Island graduate of the University of Auckland, graduating with a law degree in 1936. Ta'isi's daughter Noue went on to marry Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole, who became Joint Head of State when Samoa attained Independence in 1962. They sired Olf \\"Efi\\" Nelson who went on to become Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Tupuola Ta'isi Efi, the third Prime Minister of Samoa and from 2007 to 2017, the Head of State of Samoa.

There are many different types of menstrual disorders that vary with signs and symptoms, including pain during menstruation, heavy bleeding, or absence of menstruation. Normal variations can occur in menstrual patterns but generally menstrual disorders can also include periods that come sooner than 21 days apart, more than 3 months apart, or last more than 10 days in duration. Variations of the menstrual cycle are mainly caused by the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, and early detection and management is required in order to minimize the possibility of complications regarding future reproductive ability. Though menstrual disorders were once considered more of a nuisance problem, they are now widely recognized as having a serious impact on society in the form of days lost from work brought about by the pain and suffering experienced by women. These disorders can arise from physiologic sources (pregnancy etc.), pathologic sources (stress, excessive exercise, weight loss, endocrine or structural abnormalities etc.), or iatrogenic sources (secondary to contraceptive use etc.).  Types of menstrual disorders  = Premenstrual Disorders = * Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual tension refers to the emotional and physical symptoms that routinely occur in the two weeks leading up to menstruation. Symptoms are usually mild, but 5-8% of women suffer from moderate to severe symptoms that significantly affect daily activities. Symptoms may include anxiety, irritability, mood swings, depression, headache, food cravings, increased appetite, and bloating. * Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe mood disorder that affects cognitive and physical functions in the week leading up to menstruation. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is diagnosed with at least one affective, or mood, symptom and at least five physical, mood, and/or behavioral symptoms. =Disorders of cycle length= Normal menstrual cycle length is 22-45 days. * Amenorrhea is the absence of a menstrual period in a woman of reproductive age. Physiologic states of amenorrhoea are seen during pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding). Outside of the reproductive years there is absence of menses during childhood and after menopause. * Irregular menstruation is where there is variation in menstrual cycle length of more than approximately 8 days for a woman. The term metrorrhagia is often used for irregular menstruation that occurs between the expected menstrual periods. * Oligomenorrhea is the medical term for infrequent, often light menstrual periods (intervals exceeding 35 days). * Polymenorrhea is the medical term for cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer. =Disorders of flow= Normal menstrual flow length is 3-7 days. * Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a broad term used to describe any disruption in bleeding that involves the volume, duration, and/or regularity of flow. Bleeding may occur frequently or infrequently, and can occur between periods, after sexual intercourse, and after menopause. Bleeding during pregnancy is excluded. *Hypomenorrhea is abnormally light menstrual bleeding. * Menorrhagia (meno = prolonged, rrhagia = excessive flow/discharge) is an abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual period. * Metrorrhagia is bleeding at irregular times, especially outside the expected intervals of the menstrual cycle. If there is excessive menstrual and uterine bleeding other than that caused by menstruation, menometrorrhagia (meno = prolonged, metro = time, rrhagia = excessive flow/discharge) may be diagnosed. Causes may be due to abnormal blood clotting, disruption of normal hormonal regulation of periods or disorders of the endometrial lining of the uterus. Depending upon the cause, it may be associated with abnormally painful periods. = Disorders of ovulation = Disorders of ovulation include oligoovulation and anovulation: *Anovulation is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal woman). Anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding). *Oligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation (usually defined as cycles of >35 days or <8 cycles a year). =Other menstrual disorders= * Dysmenorrhea (or dysmenorrhoea), cramps or painful menstruation, involves menstrual periods that are accompanied by either sharp, intermittent pain or dull, aching pain, usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen.  Signs and symptoms of menstrual disorders  Diagram of a uterus The signs and symptoms of menstrual disorders can cause significant stress. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) has the potential to be one of the most urgent gynecological problems during menstruation. Dysmenorrhea is the most common. = Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) = Symptoms may include irritability, bloating, depression, food cravings, aggressiveness, and mood swings. Fluid retention and fluctuating weight gain are also reported. Precipitating risk factors include: stress, alcohol consumption, exercise, smoking, and some medications. = Amenorrhea = Lack of a menses by the age of 16 where secondary sexual characteristics have developed or by the age of 14 where no secondary sexual characteristics have developed (primary amenorrhea), or lack of a menses for more than 3-6 months after first menstruation cycle. Although missing a period is the main sign, other symptoms can include: excess facial, hair loss, headache, changes to vision, milky discharge from the breasts, or absence of breast development. = Abnormal Uterine Bleeding = One-third of women will experience abnormal uterine bleeding in their life. Normal menstrual cycle has a frequency of 24 to 38 days, lasts 7 to 9 days, so bleeding that lasts longer could be considered abnormal. Very heavy bleeding (for example, needing to use 1 or more tampons or sanitary pads every hour) is another symptom. = Dysmenorrhea = Especially painful or persistent menstrual cramping that occurs in the absence of any underlying pelvic disease. Pain radiating to the low back or upper thighs with onset of menstruation and lasting anywhere from 12–72 hours. Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue may also accompany the pain. Pain may begin gradually, with the first several years of menses, and then intensified as menstruation becomes regular. Patients who also have secondary amenorrhea report symptoms beginning after age 20 and lasting 5–7 days with progressive worsening of pain over time. Pelvic pain is also reported.  Causes of menstrual disorders  There are many causes of menstrual disorders, including uterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances, clotting disorders, cancer, sexually- transmitted infections, polycystic ovary syndrome, and genetics. Uterine fibroids are benign, non-cancerous growths in the uterus that affect most women at some point in their lives and usually does not require treatment unless they cause intolerable symptoms. Stress and lifestyle factors commonly impact menstruation, which includes weight changes, dieting, changes in exercise, travel, and illness. Hyperprolactinaemia can also cause menstrual disorders. = Amenorrhea = There are different causes depending on the type of menstrual order. Amenorrhea, or the absence of menstruation, is subdivided into primary and secondary amenorrhea. In primary amenorrhea, in which there is a failure to menstruate by the age of 16 with normal sexual development or by 14 without normal sexual development, causes can be from developmental abnormalities of the uterus, ovaries, or genital tract, or endocrine disorders. In secondary amenorrhea, or the absence of menstruation for greater than 6 months, can be caused by the same reasons as primary amenorrhea, as well as polycystic ovary syndrome, pregnancy, chronic illness, and certain drugs like cocaine and opioids. = Hypomenorrhea = Causes of hypomenorrhea, or irregular light periods, include periods around menopause, eating disorders, excessive exercise, thyroid dysfunction, uncontrolled diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hormonal birth control, and certain medications to treat epilepsy or mental health conditions. = Menorrhagia = Causes of menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding, include polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, bleeding disorders, and miscarriage. = Dysmenorrhea = Causes of dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, include endometriosis, pelvic scarring due to chlamydia or gonorrhea, and intrauterine devices or IUDs. Primary dysmenorrhea is when there is no underlying cause that is identified, and secondary dysmenorrhea is when the menstrual pain is caused by other conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, or infection.  Diagnosis of menstrual disorders  Pelvic exam Diagnosis begins with an in- depth medical history and physical exam, including a pelvic exam and sometimes a Pap smear. Additional testing may include but are not limited to blood tests, hormonal tests, ultrasound, gynecologic ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, and dilation and curettage (D&C;).  Treatment of menstrual disorders  = Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder = Due to the unclear etiology of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, symptom relief is the primary goal of treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and spironolactone decrease physical and psychological symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome. Oral contraceptives may ameliorate physical symptoms of breast tenderness and bloating. Ovarian suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist as an off-label use may reduce symptoms but have adverse side effects including decreased bone density. Other less commonly use medications such as alprazolam may reduce anxiety symptoms but has potential for dependence, tolerance, and abuse. Pyridoxine, a form of vitamin B6, may be used as a dietary supplement to relieve overall symptoms. = Amenorrhea = Successful treatment varies depending on the diagnosis of amenorrhea. In patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to physical or psychological stress, non-pharmacological options include weight gain, resolution of emotional issues, or decreased intensity of exercise. Patients experiencing amenorrhea due to hypothyroidism may be started with thyroid replacement therapy. Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine are used in patients with pituitary adenomas. Amenorrhea associated with gonadal dysgenesis or a hypoestrogenic state may be treated with oral contraceptives, patches, or vaginal rings. Amenorrhea associated with structural anomalies can be addressed with surgical treatment such as gonadectomy. = Menorrhagia = Acute management of menstrual bleeding includes hormonal therapy with estrogen or oral contraceptives until bleeding has stopped followed by a oral contraceptive tapering regimen. Adjunctive therapy may include iron supplements and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients who do not respond to hormonal therapy may use antifibrinolytics. Procedural therapy such as a suction curettage and intrauterine balloon tamponade are reserved for patients who do not respond to medication therapy and do not put fertility at risk. Life-threatening situations may consider more invasive procedures such as endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, and hysterectomy. Long- term management include estrogen-containing therapy and progestin therapy. = Dysmenorrhea = Primary dysmenorrhea is commonly treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to reduce moderate to severe pain. Other simple analgesics such as aspirin or acetaminophen are less commonly used but may also reduce short-term pain. Supplements including thiamine and vitamin E may reduce pain in younger women. Non-pharmacological interventions such as the use of external heat are also effective at reducing pain.

The collective was formed in 2000 by its primary songwriter, producer and recording engineer Jesse Poe.  Background  Poe and Phil Murphy were then working as apprentices under John Morand at Sound of Music Studios to improve their recording skills. The two musicians would take turn recording each other after hours at the studio, using whatever instruments happened to be left around. This included many international instruments that Joan Osborne had recently left in studio. They would layer track upon track taking turns recording while the other played, and vice versa; some recordings from this time appeared on the bonus CD with the band's 2002 debut album Villa Claustrophobia. They also composed and recorded the score for Andrew Carnwath's silent film Greater Than Half which won The Audience Choice Award at Bare Bones International and the Rosebud Film Festival in Washington, D.C. The duo began to perform live using analogue loops created live on stage with old tape machines and half broken equipment they salvaged from the Sound of Music equipment graveyards and thrift stores. Frustrated with limitations of analogue looping, they enlisted the help of Jeff 'Sanford' Krones, who lived with Poe at the Pyramid Institute, an abandoned Shriners Temple atop the collapsed Church Hill Tunnel, and Pat Best of Pelt. This quartet formed the core of the original Tanakh collective, playing live shows and recording improvisations at the Pyramid Institute and Sound of Music Studios along with many guests who joined performances as they were available. Inspired in part by John Zorn's Tzadik label, Poe and Murphy's original idea was to provide a name that they could perform under and that anyone who they liked to play could perform or record under, with their dream being that there might be two or three Tanakh shows at the same time in different geographic locations. The band's self-titled 2004 EP on Alien8 Recordings came from a Pyramid Institute performance recorded by Bryan Hoffa who would later start a band Broken Hips with Murphy on guitar, and various instruments. This instrumental double disc was later mixed and mastered by King Crimson engineer Ronan Chris Murphy. After initial plans to record a studio effort fell through due to other commitments, Poe worked as an engineer in Berlin at the Schaubu:hne am Halleschen Ufer before returning to record Villa Claustrophobia with Brian Paulson as engineer and with previous Tanakh guest performers such as the Dirty Three's Mick Turner, Anomoanon/Palace member Ned Oldham and Ravi Shankar associate Nirmal Bajekal. Via Turner and Oldham's brother Will Oldham, members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor heard the album, leading Montreal label Alien8 to contact Poe and sign Tanakh. Villa Claustrophobia was released in April 2002 to a variety of positive reviews, including Mark Richardson in Pitchfork Media and Ian Penman in The Wire. Various line-ups of Tanakh performed and toured from this point forward, with a new key member being bassist/singer Michele Poulos, who Poe met around the time of Villa Claustrophobia's release. Poe, Poulos and a further core group of performers, including Agents of Good Roots drummer Brian Jones and guests Jim White and Sparklehorse associate/producer Alan Weatherhead, recorded the band's third full album Dieu Deuil, released in early 2004 on Alien8. Poe relocated to Italy prior to the release of Dieu Deuil after the offer of an ESL teaching job in Florence; further Tanakh performances and tours were based out that city for the next few years. Most of Tanakh's fourth album, 2006's Ardent Fevers, was written in Italy but recorded in Richmond by Hoffa during a return visit to the city in the summer of 2004. Guest performers on Ardent Fevers included Isobel Campbell and Alex Neilson, who had been introduced to Poe by Alasdair Roberts after the two had played shows together in Scotland. Taken from the same recording period as the Ardent Fevers sessions, Tanakh's fifth album, the 2007 release Saunders Hollow, was distinctly different from the collective's previous work in that Poulos was the lead vocalist throughout, with Poe concentrating on producing and performing and Hoffa once again recording an expanded lineup of the band, again featuring Campbell and Neilson as guest performers. Saunders Hollow was also unique in being released on Australian label Camera Obscura rather than Alien8, home to all the band's previous releases. Other than singles on compilations, no further Tanakh releases have appeared since Saunders Hollow but the collective has continued to perform irregularly, including the opening set at the sixth Terrastock festival in Providence, Rhode Island in April 2006 and a one-off performance at the seventh Terrastock festival in Louisville, Kentucky in June 2008. This latter performance featured a unique lineup of Poe, Acid Mothers Temple lead figure Kawabata Makoto and members of Abunai! and United Bible Studies. As of summer 2010 Poe is reported to be working on a series of collaborative singles; it is not certain if they will appear under the Tanakh name.

The main gym and facilities were built in 1994. The main function of this facility is for recreational sports and other various team activities.  Location and operation time  Patriots Park is located in Grovetown, Georgia, which is a suburb about 20 minutes outside of Augusta. This Park is at 5445 Columbia Road in Columbia County; having an entrance on William Few Parkway and Columbia Road. The park is opened 7 days a week, from 7:30am–9:00pm Mon-Thur,7:30am–6:00pm Fri,9:00am–4:00pm Sat, and 1:00pm–6:00pm on Sundays.  History  Patriots Park was opened in 1992, but construction of the gym and its main facilities was completed in 1994. In 1999, the county passed a draft to increase the size of the gym by about 10,000 square feet. This expansion added two full-size basketball courts (which can also be viewed as four volleyball courts) and new dressing rooms outside the courts. It was completed in October 1999, with visions of a bigger renovation for the next year. The third phase of the gymnasium project will include even more additions to the gymnasium with the likes of racquetball courts and office space. Throughout many times, there have been complaints with the number of parking spots available for the sports and other activities taking place. In 2003, there were 80 soccer teams playing in the same season which led to many overflows of parking and led to parents parking in the grass. There was never an increase in parking spots, but the help came in the form of Columbia County building a new park a few miles down the road to help alleviate the congestion. The addition of Blanchard Woods Park helped minimally with parking, as to this day, people still park illegally on grass and on the side of the road. Recreational uses Patriots Park supports many different sports including basketball, football, soccer, baseball, softball, tennis, disc golf, volleyball, and racquet ball. It is the home to the Columbia County Recreational Department and has recreational teams in soccer, baseball, softball and football. There is an 18 hole disc golf course that circles around the park and goes through the woods. It was created in 1999, and is free to play along with many of the other facilities. To use the gym, there is a $5 charge at entrance unless you are a member. The soccer, football, baseball, and softball fields are used for youth recreational sports Patriots Park has been home to five Dixie World Series in youth baseball and softball, and the World Series for the Dixie Fast Pitch Ponytails and Bells. Annually, the park is used to host a firework show on the Fourth of July, or around the Fourth of July for Independence Day. It is the largest firework show in Columbia County.

The society puts on an annual Amherst Railway Society Railroad Hobby Show at the Eastern States Exposition Fairgrounds in West Springfield, Massachusetts, in late January of every year. The attendance at the two-day show, which has over 7 acres of displays, usually averages twenty five thousand people, making it one of the largest two-day train shows in North America. The Amherst Railway Society has about 446 members who share some aspect of railroading as a common interest. Monthly meetings cover current topics in railroad news and offer slide shows, movies or a prominent speaker on a railroading topic. Dates for the 2021 show are January 30 and 31st. History According to written minutes, the Amherst Railway Society came into existence on October 15, 1963, in Goessman Laboratory, Room 151 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The first program on October 15, 1963, was \\"Mexican Steam\\" by Everett Turner, \\"American Diesels\\" by Al Wynne, and some steam shots from around Amherst by Harvey Allen. Many of the people attending the first meeting had been active in a previous UMass railroad group that was organized by students. That group ceased to exist by 1963. The Amherst Railway Society quickly grew and five years later, the organization put on its own train show that is now held every year in West Springfield. Railroad Hobby Show The annual Amherst Railway Society Railroad Hobby Show has become the biggest railroad show in the country. In 1993 and 1994 the Amherst Railway Society received the Walthers Showmanship Award for sponsoring the event. Proceeds from the show are used to promote interest in railroads. Donations have been made to various railroad museums, historical societies, restoration projects and scholarship funds. Organizations that have received donations include: the Fall River and Old Colony Museum, the 470 Club's Boston and Maine diesel locomotive restoration project, the Boston and Maine Historical Society, the Chester Foundation Station Project, the Wiscasset Waterville and Farmington Building and Car Fund as well as trolley museums in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, Warehouse Point, Connecticut, and Kennebunk, Maine.

The literal meaning of the name is \\"fire chicken\\", where bul means \\"fire\\" and dak translates to \\"chicken.\\"  History  Buldak became popular in South Korea during 2004, primarily for its extreme pungency, as the country's long-term recession and economic downturn caused the local population to seek out spicy food to relieve stress. The rise in popularity of buldak set the trend for extremely hot dishes in South Korea, which led to the rise of buldak franchise restaurants. However, the name buldak was registered at a patent office in April 2001 by Buwon Food, who claimed copyright to the name. This led to strong opposition from Hongcho Buldak and other leading buldak restaurants, who claimed that the term had been used as a common noun. On the 30th of April, 2008, the Patent Court of Korea agreed that term was generalized and buldak became free for public use. Although the popularity of buldak has declined in recent years in South Korea, the dish has led to the development of other successful dishes inspired by it, such as buldak-flavored instant noodles by Samyang Food.  Preparation and serving  Buldak can be grilled or deep-fried using bite-sized chicken pieces, and is served with a spicy sauce usually including gochutgaru (chili powder), gochujang (chili paste), soy sauce, jocheong (starch syrup), garlic, and ginger. Chili powder, made from Cheongyang chili pepper, is preferred as it is spicier than regular chili powder used in Korean recipes. Sliced garae-tteok (rice cakes) and melted cheese are common additions to the dish. Mild side dishes such as gyeran-jjim (steamed eggs) or boiled nuringji (scorched rice) are often served with buldak to help counteract the spiciness. The dish is usually accompanied with an alcoholic beverage such as beer.

The House of Dun is a National Trust for Scotland property in the parish of Dun, lying close to the edge of Montrose Basin and situated approximately half way between the towns of Montrose and Brechin, in Angus, Scotland. The Dun Estate was home to the Erskine (later Kennedy-Erskine) family from 1375 until 1980. John Erskine of Dun was a key figure in the Scottish Reformation. The current house was designed by William Adam and was finished in 1743. (Work had commenced in 1732.) There is elaborate plaster-work by Joseph Enzer, principally and most elaborately in the saloon. The house replaced the original 14th Century Tower House to the west when David Erskine, Lord Dun, the 13th Laird of Dun, an Edinburgh lawyer appointed Lord of Justiciary in 1710, wanted a more comfortable and prestigious home. He opposed the union. It continued as the home to the Erskines for a further 250 years, undergoing some internal re-modeling when Lady Augusta Fitzclarence, natural daughter to William IV (previously the Duke of Clarence) and his long term mistress, Dora Jordan, married the Honourable John Kennedy Erskine, heir to the property through his mother Margaret Erskine of Dun. When they married they moved to the property and Augusta set about making several alterations, modernizing the property. The writer and poet Violet Jacob (1863 - 1946), author of \\"Flemington\\" and \\"Tales of Angus\\", was a member of the Kennedy-Erskine family and was born in the house. The last Laird of Dun was Mrs. Millicent Lovett. She moved out of the house to an estate house \\"temporarily\\" in 1948, moving all the furnishings and artifacts up into the attic. The rest of the house was leased to a local farming family who ran it as a bed and breakfast establishment for many years. Millicent never returned to the house and on her death in 1980 it was bequeathed by her to the National Trust for Scotland. The Trust discovered all the original furnishings in the attic and spent 9 years returning the house to the state it had been in at the time of Augusta. In 1989 the house opened to the public, the Queen Mother presiding to mark the tercentenary of William Adam's death. The adjacent Montrose Basin nature reserve, part of the estuary of the South Esk, is also a National Trust for Scotland property. Archaeology The proximate area evinces archaeological evidence of early man dating back 9,000 years. Besides finds at the House of Dun property itself, there is a large standing stone a few miles to the north known as the Stone of Morphie.

Services are currently provided by Northern, who also manage the station. It is located on the former Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, around west of Newcastle, on the route to Carlisle. The station was formerly one of two at Wylam, the other being North Wylam on the Scotswood, Newburn & Wylam Railway, which was closed along with most of the line in 1968. This was situated at the opposite end of Wylam Bridge, and is now the site of a car park. Constructed in 1835, the Stationmaster's House is a Grade II* Listed Building, whilst the footbridge and signalbox are both Grade II Listed. The station is one of the earliest still in use in the world. Station Road crosses the line by a level crossing, with the station layout being unusual, in that the platforms are not opposite each other. The westbound (trains towards Hexham & Carlisle) platform is to the east of the level crossing alongside the stationmaster's house, whilst the eastbound (trains towards Newcastle) platform is to the west of the level crossing. The overline, elevated signal box, once a popular design for the line is now almost unique, with the only other surviving signal box of this design located at . The station has direct access, from the westbound platform via a footbridge and stairs, to the former (now redeveloped as housing) RVI Convalescent Home. This was once serviced by a direct 'hospital train', which ran from Newcastle to Wylam only. Facilities The station is unstaffed, with self-service ticketing machines installed in 2019, meaning that tickets must be bought before boarding. There are shelters on both platforms, and a help point on the westbound platform, providing train running information, in addition to the timetable posters on each side. Step-free access is available to both platforms via the level crossing and ramps.Wylam station facilitiesNational Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 2 February 2017 Services As of the December 2019 timetable change, Northern operate an hourly service (Monday to Saturday) between Hexham and Nunthorpe, with additional trains also calling at the station during the morning and evening peak. On a Sunday, an hourly service operates between Carlisle and Nunthorpe, with some trains continuing as far as Whitby.GB eNRT December 2019 Edition, Table 48 (Network Rail) References  External links  Category:Grade II* listed railway stations Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Northumberland Category:Railway stations in Northumberland Category:Former North Eastern Railway (UK) stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1835 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1967 Category:Northern franchise railway stations ","title":"Wylam railway station"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function L(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your bitcoin🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",L]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/8.md","filePath":"sponsor/8.md"}'),D={name:"sponsor/8.md"},H=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{x as __pageData,H as default};
