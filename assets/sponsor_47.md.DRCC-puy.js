During its long history it has been conquered by numerous peoples: Thracians, Macedon, Romans, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Ottoman Turks which contributed to the city's various historical heritage.  Antiquity  The ancient theatre of Plovidiv. Plovdiv is one of the oldest cities in Europe. Archaeologists have discovered potteryPre-historic Art Archaeological Museum Plovdiv and other objects of everyday life from as early as the Neolithic Age, showing that in the end of the 7th millennium B.C there already was an established settlement there. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Plovdiv's post-Bronze Age history places it as a Thracian fortified settlement named Eumolpias. In 342 BC, Plovdiv was conquered by Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, who renamed it \\"Œ¶ŒπŒªŒπœÄœÄœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ\\", Philippopolis or \\"the city of Philip\\" in his own honour. Later, it was reconquered by the Thracians who called it Pulpudeva (from Philipopolis).–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ü–ª–æ–≤–¥–∏–≤ In 72 BC, Plovdiv was seized by the Roman general Terentius Varo Luculus. The city was incorporated into the Roman Empire, where it was called Trimontium (City of Three Hills) and served as capital of the province of Thrace. Thrimontium was an important crossroad for the Roman Empire and was called \\"The largest and most beautiful of all cities\\" by Lucian. In those times, the Via Militaris (or Via Diagonalis), the main military road in the Balkans, passed through the city. Roman times were a period of growth and culture in the city. The surviving ruins show a city with numerous public buildings, shrines, baths, and theatres, though only a small part of the ancient city has been excavated. The city had a water system and sewerage. It was defended with a double wall.PlovdivCity.net , –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ 10 –Ω–æ–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 2007 –≥. Middle Ages The Slavs had settled in the area by the middle of the 6th century, changing the ethnic proportions of the region. With the establishment of Bulgaria in 681, Philipopolis became a border fortress of the Byzantine Empire. It was captured by Khan Krum in 812, but the region was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire in 834 during the reign of Khan Malamir. It remained in Bulgarian hands until it was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 970 or 971. The city again came to be known as Philippopolis and became Byzantine in character. Aime de Varennes in 1180 encountered the singing of Byzantine songs in the city that recounted the deeds of Alexander the great and his predecessors, over 1,300 years before.Vacalopoulos, Apostolos E. Origins of the Greek Nation. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1970) p. 22 Khan Krum was the first Bulgarian ruler to capture Plovdiv. Byzantine rule was succeeded by the Latin Empire in 1204, and there were two short interregnum periods as the city was twice occupied by Kaloyan of Bulgaria before his death in 1207.–ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –§–æ–∫—É—Å ‚Äì –¶–∞—Ä –ö–∞–ª–æ—è–Ω –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–≤–∞ –∫–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞, —Å–∫–∏–ø—Ç—ä—Ä –∏ –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ –æ—Ç –∫–∞—Ä–¥–∏–Ω–∞–ª –õ—ä–≤, –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ 17 –Ω–æ–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 2007 –≥. In 1208 Kaloyan's successor Boril was defeated by the Latins in the Battle of Philippopolis. Under Latin rule, Plovdiv was the capital of the Duchy of Philippopolis governed by Renier de Trit, and later on by Gerard de Strem. Bulgarian rule was reestablished during the reign of Ivan Asen II between 1225 and 1229. In 1263 Plovdiv was conquered by the restored Byzantine Empire and remained in Byzantine hands until it was re-conquered by George Terter II of Bulgaria in 1322. Byzantine rule was restored once again in 1323, but in 1344 the city was surrendered to Bulgaria by the regency for John V Palaiologos as the price for Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's support in the Byzantine civil war. In 1364 the Ottoman Turks under Lala Shakhin Pasha seized Plovdiv. The Turks called the city Filibe. It was the capital of Rumelia until 1382 when the Ottomans captured Sofia, which became the main city of the province. Plovdiv survived as one of the major cultural centers for Bulgarian culture and tradition. The name Plovdiv first appeared around that time and is derived from the city's Thracian name Pulpudeva (assumed to be a translation of Philippopolis, from Pulpu = Philippou and deva = city), which was rendered by the Slavs first as P…ôldin (–ü—ä–ª–¥–∏–Ω) or Pl…ôvdin. National revival Virgin Mary Church. Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Plovdiv was a focal point for the Bulgarian national movement. During that period Plovdiv was an economic center along with Constantinople, Odrin and Thessaloniki. Due to trade, the emerging Bulgarian bourgeoisie became significant in the society. Trading with Russia and Europe these people experienced political and cultural influences. In that period the richer citizens constructed houses, many of which can still be seen in the Architectural reserve Old Plovdiv. The city was the capital of Rumelia Province between 1364 and 1864, and of Edirne province between 1864 and 1878 under Ottoman Rule. Plovdiv played a role in the struggle for Church independence. Plovdiv became the center of that struggle with leaders such as Nayden Gerov, Dr Valkovich, and Joakim Gruev. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated and in 1850 modern secular education began with the St Cyril and Methodius school. On 11 May 1858 the city celebrated the saints' day of Cyril and Methodius, which later became a National holiday. In 1858 in the Church of the Virgin Mary the Christmas liturgy was spoken for the first time in the Bulgarian language. In 1868 the First Grammar School was founded. In 1880, a total of eight Greek educational institutions were active in the city: one for boys, two for girls, three mixed schools and two teachers seminary. Among them, the High School Zariphios, established at 1875, became one of the most well known Greek educational institutions of the region. The most important Greek newspaper was Pilippoupolis (bilingual until 1882, Greek since 1886), supported by the Greek state and nationalistic organizations, was also the forum of the Greek communities of the wider region. The city was captured from the Ottomans during the Battle of Philippopolis in 1878. Eastern Rumelia According to the Treaty of San Stefano on 3 March 1878 the Principality of Bulgaria included the lands with predominantly Bulgarian population. Plovdiv was selected as a capital of the restored country and as a seat of the Temporary Russian Government.–û—á–µ—Ä—Ü–∏ –∏–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ü–ª–æ–≤–¥–∏–≤ (—Å—Ç—Ä. 80 ‚Äì –ö–æ—Å–º–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–Ω –≥—Ä–∞–¥. –ú–∞—Ö–∞–ª–∏ –∏ –∫–≤–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –≤ –Ω–æ–≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ) Great Britain and Austria-Hungary, however, did not approve that treaty and the final result of the war was concluded in the Congress of Berlin which divided the newly liberated country into several parts. It separated the autonomous region of Eastern Rumelia from Bulgaria and Plovdiv became its capital. In three-month the Ottoman Empire created an Organization Chart (Constitution) of the province and appointed a governor.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è, —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–í–ù–† At the time, it had a population of about 33,500, of which 45% were Bulgarians, 25% Greeks, 21% Turks, 6% Jews and 3% Armenians, a situation that changed rapidly in the following decades. In the spring of 1885 Zahari Stoyanov formed the Secret Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in the city which actively conducted propaganda for the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On 5 September several hundred armed rebels from Golyamo Konare (now Saedinenie) marched to Plovdiv. In the night of 5‚Äì6 September these men led by Danail Nikolaev took control of the city and removed from office the General-Governor Gavril Krastevich. A provisional government was formed led by Georgi Stranski and universal mobilization was announced. After the Serbs were defeated in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, Bulgaria and Turkey reached an agreement according to which the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia had common government, Parliament, administration and army. Today 6 September is celebrated as the Unification Day and the Day of Plovdiv. Modern history After Unification Plovdiv remained the second city in population and significance after the capital Sofia. The first railway in the city was built in 1874 and after 1888 it was linked with Sofia. In 1892 Plovdiv became host of the First Bulgarian Fair with international participation which was succeeded by the International Fair Plovdiv. After the liberation the first brewery was inaugurated in the city. In the beginning of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. German, French and Belgian capital was invested in the city in development of modern trade, banking and industry. In 1939 there were 16,000 craftsmen and 17,000 workers in manufacturing factories, mainly for food and tobacco processing. During the Second World War the tobacco industry expanded as well as the export of fruit and vegetables. In 1943 1,500 Jews were saved from deportation in concentration camps by the archbishop of Plovdiv Cyril who later became Bulgarian Patriarch. During the period of communist governance that followed the end of World War II many large factories were built in and nearby Plovdiv, for example a plant for non-ferrous metals, textile works, plant for electrical apparata, tobacco plant, canning factory, motor-truck factory and many others. On 6 April 1956 the first trolleybus line was opened and in the 50s the emblematic Trimontsium Hotel was constructed. In the 60s and 70s there was construction boom and many of the modern neighborhoods took shape. In the 70s and 80s many antique remains were excavated and the Old Town was fully restored. In 1990 the Sports complex \\"Plovdiv\\" was finished. It included the largest stadium and rowing canal in the country. In that period Plovdiv became the birthplace of Bulgaria's movement for democratic reform, which by 1989 had garnered enough support to enter government. Plovdiv has hosted specialized exhibitions of the World's Fair three times, in 1981, 1985, and 1991.

Etymology The name Salt probably comes from the Latin word saltus which means valley of trees or thick forest as there are many trees in the area. It could have also come from the Saranac salta meaning hard stone. History Salt's first municipality was established in 1887. Fayad Afandi Al-Suboh was the appointed the head of the municipality in the same year. At the time, the municipality was responsible for organizing roads and lighting, collecting taxes and tuition, water sanitation and facilities for both men and women, charging fines, etc. Many of these duties are still carried out today. In 1933 Salt became the first town in Jordan to open a school to all denominations of people. In 1938, the area suffered an earthquake, causing the destruction of many homes and buildings. But the Municipality soon took the lead on reconstruction initiatives. But population of Salt declined 30% between 1922 and 1938. Expansions over time have caused the Municipality to reconsider its defined territory, and the list of cities and towns has come to include Al Salt, Rai, Um Juzah, Wadi al Hura, Bazbadiya, Yaraqa, Ibra, Alan, and Rmemeen, many of which were already included, and many of which were new additions dated beck to 2001.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1922 to 1926 for the Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators. Early life and education Ogden was born in Ogden, Pennsylvania on January 24, 1901. The town is named after Ogden's family who lived on the land now known as Upper Chichester, Southwest of Philadelphia for generations. Ogden's ancestor had come to America from England on the same ship as William Penn. Ogden was a three sport athlete at Chester High School. Ogeden attended Swarthmore College, pitched for the baseball team, was a member of the Student Army Training Corps and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1922. Career Before the 1922 baseball season, Ogden was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics as an amateur free agent. He was brought straight to the majors and made his debut against Cleveland in Philadelphia on July 18, 1922. On May 23, 1924, Ogden was selected off waivers by the Washington Senators from the Philadelphia Athletics. Ogden was the starting pitcher for the Washington Senators in the final game of the 1924 World Series, which they won in 12 innings. The right-hander was something of a decoy in that Game 7, given his first start of the Series as a ploy by Senators manager Bucky Harris to get the opposition to load its lineup with left-handed hitters. Harris then removed Ogden after two batters and replaced him with the left-handed pitcher George Mogridge, making Ogden one of the earliest known examples of an \\"opener\\". Ogden spent three seasons with the Senators from 1924 to 1926, making 29 starts. On March 27, 1927, Ogden was purchased by the International League Baltimore Orioles from the Washington Senators. Ogden continued playing minor league baseball for the Toledo Mud Hens in the American Association and Toronto, Jersey City and Montreal in the International League into the 1934 season before retiring. After his professional baseball career, Ogden taught and coached for 18 years at Penns Grove High School in Penns Grove, New Jersey. Personal life Ogden's older brother, Jack Ogden, also attended Swarthmore College, pitched in the major leagues for the New York Giants, St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds and is a member of the International League Hall of Fame. In November 1932, Ogden married Alice Marker of Chester, Pennsylvania. Together they had a daughter, Helen, born in 1934. Ogden died on August 6, 1964, and is interred at the Lawn Croft Cemetery in Linwood, Pennsylvania.

The area is situated in North Leeds, near to King Lane and the Leeds Outer Ring Road. Description The majority of Moor Allerton is situated in the Alwoodley ward of Leeds City Council and the southern part (below the Outer Ring Road) is in the Moortown ward. Both wards make up the Leeds North East parliamentary constituency. The area is mainly made up of 1950s/60s housing as well as a proportion of modern housing. In the 1990s much of the area's Shopping Centre was rebuilt. It now has a large Sainsbury's, a Homebase, several other retailers, a library and a public house called The Penny Fun. The centre has previously had a Jones of Oakwood (electronic retailers) and a Burger King. The earlier part of the centre was opened by Mr Arthur Craven (director of library services) on 5 March 1982. By 1985 the library had become the busiest branch library in Leeds. Moor Allerton is situated along King Lane, on the outside of the Outer Ring Road. To the West of King Lane is the Black Moor Estate and to the East is the Lingfield Estate, Lingfield Towers, however lies within the Outer Ring Road. The Black Moor Estate has its own amenities. There is a parade of shops with a post office, a Happy Shopper, charity shops, a Chinese and an Indian takeaway. Moortown Social Club is situated on Cranmer Gardens. Etymology The name Allerton is first attested in the period 1147-82, in the forms Alretuna, Alreton and Alretona. It comes from the Old English word alor ('alder tree'), in its genitive plural form alra, and the word t≈´n ('farmstead, estate'). Thus it originally meant 'farmstead of the alder trees'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 73. Since Allerton is a common place-name in Yorkshire, the word 'moor' was added to distinguish it from places such as Chapel Allerton, the now lost Allerton Gledhow in Potter Newton, and Allerton Bywater. This appellation is first in the early thirteenth century as Mor Allteron and More Allteron. The name is occasionally attested partly in Latin form, as 'Allerton super mora' ('Allerton on the moor'), first found in 1622. Moor Allerton Golf Club After the First World War there was a substantial Jewish population in North Leeds including some very successful businessmen. However, there was also a lot of prejudice which meant that many institutions would not admit Jews to membership. This was the case for Moortown Golf Club along with others nearby. A consortium purchased farm land North of Nursery Lane and West of Primley Park Road. Despite the objections of Moortown Golf Club and the Residents' Association, planning permission was granted and the club opened on 27 March 1923, though initially with only 12 holes playable. It was sometimes referred to as a Jewish Golf Course but from the outset it was open to all as members and visitors. Its presence made it attractive as a social venue, and many houses were constructed nearby on what had been a sparsely populated area. In the late 1960s land was purchased on Blackmoor Farm and the Nursery Lane site was sold for housing. The club opened on its present site off Coal Road, Wike, LS17, on 2 May 1971 with Eldon Griffiths, the Minister for Sport officiating. The former clubhouse on Nursery Lane was converted into a pub, The Allerton.

In 1944, he defeated the New York Yankees, 5 to 2, in the final game of the regular season to clinch the American League pennant, the first and only AL title for its St. Louis franchise. He lost his only start in the 1944 World Series against the rival St. Louis Cardinals of the National League. Jakucki was a native of Camden, New Jersey. The right-hander was listed as tall and . In 1935, Jakucki went 15‚Äì14 for the Galveston Buccaneers of the Texas League. The Browns purchased him the following year, but he pitched poorly for them, going 0‚Äì3 with an 8.71 earned run average in 20 innings pitched. He quit the minor leagues in 1938, and moved on to various semi-pro teams in Texas while also working as a paperhanger.Camden People ‚Äì Sig Jakucki During World War II, however, the Browns ran short of players and re-signed him. In 1944, he returned to the majors and went 13‚Äì9 with a 3.55 ERA. His triumph over the Yankees on Sunday, October 1, was a six-hit, complete game in which he allowed only one earned run. In the 1944 World Series, Jakucki started Game 4 on October 7, with his underdog Browns leading, two games to one. But he allowed a first-inning, two- run home run to the Cardinals' Stan Musial, permitted four runs (three earned), and lasted only three full innings. The Cardinals won the game, 5‚Äì1, and went on to take the next two contests to deny the Browns a world championship. In 1945, Jakucki went 12‚Äì10. However, he was also very temperamental and an alcoholic. He apparently derived pleasure in tormenting teammate Pete Gray, who had only one arm. One day, the two got into an argument and settled it with a fight, with Jakucki holding one arm behind his back. Jakucki was kicked off the team by manager Luke Sewell late in the season and never returned to the majors.Neyer, Rob. Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Legends. In his brief MLB career, Jakucki put up a 25‚Äì22 won‚Äìlost record, with 27 complete games (in 50 total starts), five shutouts and four saves. In 411 total innings pitched, he surrendered 431 hits; he issued 131 bases on balls and recorded the same number of strikeouts. His career earned run average was 3.79. He died in Galveston, Texas, at the age of 69, reportedly destitute. Jakucki's name, misspelled \\"Jackucki\\", appears in the sheet music for Dave Frishberg's song \\"Van Lingle Mungo\\".

In November 2000, the play premiered at the Royal National Theatre, in London, under the direction of Trevis, (Includes full texts of contemporaneous reviews by Nicholas de Jongh and Michael Billington.) who also produced and directed it with a student cast at the Victorian College of the Arts Drama School, in Melbourne, Australia, in October 2002. There also were foreign-language productions of the play in Denmark and Slovenia in 2004. The Proust Screenplay In writing The Proust Screenplay, Pinter adapted the seven volumes of Marcel Proust's magnum opus √Ä la recherche du temps perdu for a film commissioned by the late director Joseph Losey to be directed by Losey (Billington, Harold Pinter 224‚Äì330). According to Pinter in conversation with Jonathan Croall and with Michael Billington, his official biographer, Losey and Pinter were not able to find the financing for the film and there were unsurmountable casting difficulties;\\"Although the main problem was raising the money, there were also difficulties over casting. While Pinter wanted to use only English actors, potential backers from several European countries wanted their own actors to appear in the film. 'You could have ended up with a terrible pudding of actors speaking three thousand different dialects, in broken English,' Pinter suggests. 'I didn't like the sound of that at all' \\" (Pinter and Croall). yet, after a year's work and other cultural complications pertaining to negotiations about permission to adapt Proust's great work from principals in France, Pinter finished his first draft of the screenplay in November 1972 (Billington, Harold Pinter 224‚Äì330). The Proust Screenplay, in Billington's view \\"a masterpiece ... [which] captures Proust's merciless social comedy\\" (Harold Pinter 230), was eventually published by Grove Press in both hardback and paperback in 1977 and by Faber and Faber in hardback in 1978 (Baker and Ross 115‚Äì18).

The analysis of Early Church Fathers continues to be reflected in modern encyclicals. Irenaeus vigorously defended the title of \\"Theotokos\\" or Mother of God. The views of Anthony of Padua, Robert Bellarmine and others supported the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, which was declared a dogma in 1850. Writings of the saints have contributed to both popular piety and a greater understanding of Mary's role in salvation history. Early saints = Irenaeus of Lyons = One of the earliest images of Mary in Christian tradition is that of the \\"New Eve\\". Irenaeus of Lyons (circa 140‚Äì202) is perhaps the earliest of the Church Fathers to develop a thorough Mariology. In his youth he had met Polycarp and other Christians who had been in direct contact with the Apostles. Following Romans 5, his analysis is both scriptural and Christological. presenting Christ as the \\"New Adam\\". Irenaeus expands upon the thought of Justin Martyr (100‚Äì165), and illustrates the distinction between Eve and Mary in both Adversus haereses (Against Heresies) and in Demonstratio Apostolicae Praedicationis (Proof of the Apostolic Preaching).Jelly, Frederic M., Madonna: Mary in the Catholic Tradition, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1998 According to Irenaeus, Christ, being born out of the Virgin Mary, created a totally new historical situation.Irenaeus, Book V, 19,3 This view influenced Ambrose of Milan and Tertullian, who wrote about the virginal conception of the Mother of God. Pope Pius IX made reference to this theme of Irenaeus in the 1854 apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus, which defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.Ineffabilis Deus Papal Encyclicals Online. Retrieved December 7, 2012 =Ambrose of Milan= Saint Ambrose of Milan (339‚Äì397), Bishop of Milan and Doctor of the Church, was one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the Fourth Century. A student of Simplician, the virginity of Mary and her role as Mother of God were central to his views on Mary. He portrayed the Mother of God \\"as devoid off any defect or imperfection, radiant with exceptional greatness and holiness.\\"Gambero, Luigi. Mary and the Fathers of the Church: The Blessed Virgin Mary in Patristic Thought, Ignatius Press, 1999 In 390 he defended the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, rejected by Jovinian. He also disputed the teaching of Bonosus of Sardica that Mary had other children after Jesus, citing John 19: 25-26 and arguing that if that were so, Jesus would not have entrusted his mother to John. He addressed this further in De Institutione Virginis. =Augustine of Hippo= The cultus of Mary was not as strong in North Africa during the time of Augustine (354‚Äì430) as compared with that of recent martyrs. Augustine died the year before the Council of Ephesus in 431 declared Mary to be the Mother of God, which prompted a more indepth consideration of Mary's role. He did not develop an independent Mariology, but his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers.Stegm√ºller, O., Marienkunde, Regensburg, 1967, p.455 His main themes are discussed in De santa virginitate (‚ÄúOn holy virginity‚Äù), where he explains that, like the church, Mary is both virgin and mother, both physically and spiritually.\\"Mary\\", Augnet Augustine said that Mary was more blessed in accepting faith in Christ than in conceiving the flesh of Christ.De santa virginitate 3.3 Augustine‚Äôs interest in Mary‚Äôs maternity was Christ-centred and underscored both the full humanity and full divinity of Christ. =Cyril of Alexandria= Cyril of Alexandria (412‚Äì444) presided over the Third Ecumenical Council held in 431 at Ephesus which defined it as an article of faith that Mary was truly the Mother of God. This arose from an apparent Christological dispute pitting Cyril against Nestorius of Constantinople. Veneration of Mary as ‚ÄúTheotokos‚Äù (God bearer) supported the doctrine of the incarnation, and Christ's status as equal to the God the Father. Cyril believed that Nestorius' preference for the term ‚ÄúChristotokos‚Äù (Christ- bearer) undermined this and suggested that Christ was distinct persons: one fully human and born of Mary, the other fully divine and not subject to birth or death. The Council endorsed the name \\"Theotokos\\", which in the West is translated as Mother of God. Saints of the Middle Ages =Bernard of Clairvaux= The Vision of St Bernard, by Fra Bartolommeo, c. 1504 (Uffizi). Bernard of Clairvaux was one of the influential churchmen of his time. In the \\"Sermon on the Sunday in the Octave of the Assumption\\" he described Mary's participation in redemption. Bernard's Praises on the Virgin Mother\\" was a small but complete treatise on Mariology.Duignan, Brian. Medieval Philosophy, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2011 Bernard wrote of Mary under the title \\"Our Lady, Star of the Sea\\". > When the storms of temptation burst upon you, when you see yourself driven > upon the rocks of tribulation, look at the star, call upon Mary. When > swallowed by pride or ambition, or hatred, or jealousy, look at the star, > call upon Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail > the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary. If troubled > on account of the heinousness of your sins, distressed at the filthy state > of your conscience, and terrified at the thought of the awful judgment to > come, you are beginning to sink into the bottomless gulf of sadness and to > be swallowed in the abyss of despair, then think of Mary. In dangers, in > doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name > leave thy lips, never suffer it to leave your heart.Hom. II super \\"Missus > est,\\" 17; Migne, P. L., CLXXXIII, 70-b, c, d, 71-a. Quoted in Doctor > Mellifluus 31 In 1953, on the eighth centenary of Bernard's death, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Doctor Mellifluus on St. Bernard of Clairvaux. =Hildegard of Bingen= Hildegard of Bingen \\"presents the most complex Mariology of Medieval German women writers.\\"Garber, Rebecca L. R., \\"Where is the Body?\\", McInerney, Maud Burnett Hildegard of Bingen, Routledge, 2013 While following the traditional juxtaposition of Eve and Mary, Adam is depicted in the illustrated Scivias as listening to the tempter, and thus bears equal blame. Of the sixty- three songs in Hildegard's Symphonia, sixteen focus on the role of Mary in salvation history, the most dedicated to any one figure. In Hildegard‚Äôs Mariology, Mary assumes the status of an essential, active partner in the plan of redemption. A second characteristic Marian theme is that of the Virgin Mother healing the brokenness brought into the world by the first mother, Eve. Hildegard belongs more to the Romanesque than the Gothic Age. Untouched by a new affective style of piety that friars will popularize across Europe, Hildegard‚Äôs Mary, like her overall spirituality, is monastic. =Saint Dominic= A popular legend holds that Dominic received the Rosary from Mary. Although widely believed to have made use of the Rosary in working for the conversion of the Albigensians, the canonization Acts of Saint Dominic emphasize his frequent praying of the plainsong hymn Ave Maris Stella. The Rosary remains a unique part of the charism of the Order of Preachers. =Anthony of Padua= The many sermons of Anthony of Padua (1195‚Äì1231) on the Virgin Mary reflect his belief in various Marian doctrines that were declared as dogmas centuries after his death. He reflected on the Assumption of Mary and referring to Psalm 132 argued that, just as Jesus had risen up to Heaven, so did Mary.Haffner, Paul. The Mystery of Mary, 2004 page He also supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception.Huber, Raphael Mary, St. Anthony of Padua: Doctor of the Church Universal, 1948 p. 31Huber, Raphael M. ‚ÄúThe Mariology of St. Anthony of Padua,‚Äù in Studia Mariana 7, Proceedings of the First Franciscan National Marian Congress in Acclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption, October 8‚Äì11, 1950 Burlington, Wisconsin Given that Anthony was one of the best educated and articulate of the early Franciscans, he was treated as a Doctor of the Church by his order, even before the title was granted to him in 1946. As a Doctor of the Church the views of Anthony of Padua shaped the Mariological approach of a large number of Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death.Kleinhenz, Christopher. Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Vol. 1, 2003 p. 40 =Catherine of Siena= Catherine of Siena, a third order Dominican, began almost all of her more than 300 letters with, \\"In the name of Jesus Christ crucified and of gentle Mary‚Äù. For Catherine, the Incarnation is the beginning of the redemption.Wiseman, Denis Vincent O.P., Chapter 3:\\"Mary in the Life and Thought of Catherine of Siena\\",\\"Jesus Crucified and Gentle Mary\\" Marian Library Studies, n.s.27, 2005, article 5, Pages 199-284 The city of Siena was dedicated to Mary in 1260, and Catherine absorbed its ambient spirituality. She adopted the custom of dedicating Saturday to Mary and recommended praying the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Her writings influenced theologian Charles Journet.Buffer,Thomas. \\"The Mariology of Cardinal Journet (1891-1975) and its influence on some Marian Magisterial Statements,\\", Marian studies: Vol.54 (2003),article 5 Reformation =Petrus Canisius= Saint Petrus Canisius contributed to the Hail Mary prayer. Saint Petrus Canisius (1521‚Äì1597), of the Society of Jesus, taught that while there are many roads leading to Jesus Christ, Marian veneration is the best. Canisius tried to show a practical rationale for Marian devotion and defended it against opposing Protestant arguments. His lasting contribution to this \\"applied mariology\\" are his three catechisms, which he published in Latin and German, and which became widespread and popular in Catholic regions. Under the heading \\"prayer\\" he explains the Ave Maria, (Hail Mary), as the basis for Catholic Marian piety.Streicher, 95,245,267 Less known are his Marian books, in which he published prayers and contemplative texts. He is credited with adding to the Hail Mary the sentence Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. This sentence appeared for the first time in his catechism of 1555.Streicher Catechismi, I, 12 It was eleven years later included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566. \\"Petrus Canisius provided a classical defence of the whole Catholic mariology against Protestantism\\", as judged three hundred years later by a leading Catholic theologian.Scheeben, Handbuch der kath. Dogmatic, 1882, 478 =Robert Bellarmine= While the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine daily prayed the Rosary and the Little Office, he also had a particular devotion to the Immaculate Conception. Pope Pius XII quotes Bellarmine in the 1950 apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus promulgating the dogma of the Assumption. =Francis de Sales= Francis de Sales was about twelve years old when he was to Paris to be educated at the Jesuit Coll√®ge de Clermont, where he joined the Sodality of Mary. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, although still at that time debated, was an important element of Jesuit Marian devotion. In 1584 a personal religious crisis led him to the chapel of Notre Dame de Bonne Deliverance at the Dominican church of St. Etienne des Gres, where he dedicated himself to the Blessed Virgin. As provost to the Bishop of Geneva, de Sales undertook missionary work in the Calvinist Chablais, recently annexed to Catholic Savoy. Promoting the cult of Mary was part of his evangelizing efforts. As bishop, he erected churches and chapels dedicated to Notre Dame. Many of these were consecrated in honor of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, thus giving prominence to these doctrines.Carney, Edward, John. The Mariology of St. Francis de Sales, 1963 In Introduction to the Devout Life, de Sales' recommended devotion to Mary, especially entrusting oneself to her maternal heart. In The Treatise on the Love of God, he follows Duns Scotus in maintaining that being preordained to be the Mother of God, Mary was, by a singular privilege, preserved from original sin at the moment of her conception. This was done through the prevenient application of Christ's merits to her and thus a preservative redemption. \\"For him, the reciprocal love of God and humankind is paradigmatically discovered in the union of the hearts of Mary and Jesus.\\" Modern era =Jean Eudes= Jean Eudes (1601‚Äì1680) was influenced in part by the writings of Saint Francis de Sales on the perfections of the Heart of Mary as the model of love for God.by Murphy, John F., Mary's Immaculate Heart, 2007 page 24 He introduced the devotion to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary and established the Society of the Heart of the Mother Most Admirable. Eudes began his devotional teachings with the Heart of Mary, and then extended it to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.by De Montzey, Charles. Life Of The Venerable John Eudes, Cousens Press 2008, p. 215 The feast of the Holy Heart of Mary was celebrated for the first time in 1648, and that of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1670. The Mass and Office proper to these feasts were composed by Saint Jean Eudes in 1668. =Louis de Montfort= Louis de Montfort (1673‚Äì1716) was defender of Mariology against Jansenism; his True Devotion to Mary synthesized many of the writings of earlier saints. Montfort's approach of \\"total consecration to Jesus Christ through Mary\\" had a strong impact on Marian devotion both in popular piety and in the spirituality of religious institutes. Pope John Paul II quoted Montfort in his Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae: Since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary, his Holy Mother, and that the more a soul is consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus Christ.\\" Montfort's The Secret of the Rosary is also widely read. =Alphonsus Liguori= Madonna painted by St. Alphonsus Liguori, c. 1718 Mainly pastoral in nature, the Mariology of Alphonsus Liguori rediscovers, integrates and defends the Mariology of Augustine and Ambrose and other fathers and represents an intellectual defence of Mariology in the eighteenth century.P Hitz, Alfons v. Liguori, in Marienkunde, 1967 130 Liguori promoted the doctrine of the bodily Assumption of Mary into Heaven, arguing that Jesus would not have wanted his mother's body corrupted in flesh, for that would have been a dishonour, given that he had himself been born of the Virgin, and hence Mary must have been assumed into Heaven. In The Glories of Mary, Liguori based his analysis of Mary as the \\"Gate to Heaven\\" on Saint Bernard's statement: ‚ÄúNo one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.‚Äù He also wrote Hail Holy Queen: An Explanation of the Salve Regina. =Th√©r√®se of Lisieux= It is said that for Th√©r√®se of Lisieux \\"...it was more important for people to imitate Mary than to admire her. She was outspokenly impatient with sermons that exaggerated the Blessed Virgin's privileges ‚Äì as though Mary did not walk in the darkness that shrouds all true faith.\\" Speaking of Mary, Th√©r√®se said,\\"She is more Mother than Queen.\\" =Maximillian Kolbe= Saint Maximilian Kolbe In 1915, while still in the seminary, Saint Maximillian Kolbe (1894‚Äì1941) and six other students started the movement Militia Immaculatae to promote devotion to the Immaculate Conception, partly relying on the 1858 messages of Our Lady of Lourdes. Kolbe emphasized the renewal of the baptismal promises by making a total consecration to the Immaculata, which he considered the most perfect means of achieving unity with Jesus.Rasmussen, Martha. The Catholic Church: the first 2,000 years, 2003 page 261Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Flinn, Frank K. and Melton, J. Gordon 2007 pp. 409-410 Kolbe later founded the monastery of Immaculate City and founded the publication Militia Immaculatae (Knight of the Immaculate). Kolbe's efforts in promoting consecration to the Immaculata made him known as the \\"Apostle of Consecration to Mary\\".by Armstrong, Regis J. et al.

Dehqani-Tafti was the first ethnic Persian to become a bishop of Iran since the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century. Dehqani-Tafti spent the last ten years of his episcopate in exile after the Iranian Revolution and an assassination attempt in October 1979, in which his wife, Margaret, was wounded. In May 1980, his 25-year-old son, Bahram, was murdered by Iranian government agents; Bahram is commemorated in the chapel at Monkton Combe School where he was a pupil from 1968 to 1973. His daughter Guli Francis-Dehqani was appointed the first Bishop of Loughborough in the Diocese of Leicester in 2017.\\"The Bridge\\" (newspaper of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark); Vol. 22, No. 10, p. 3, December 2017  Early life  Hassan Barnaba Dehqani-Tafti was born in the small village of Taft, near the city of Yazd, in central Iran. His parents, who were Muslims, were poor. Dehqani-Tafti attended Stuart Memorial College in Isfahan, before moving on to Tehran University, where he trained to become a teacher. He converted to Christianity and was baptised in Isfahan in 1938 and was soon seen a leader of the growing Christian youth group in the city. He served as an officer in the Iranian Imperial Army from 1943 until 1945. His knowledge of English led him to become an interpreter for British officials in the Middle East. Following the end of World War II, Dehqani-Tafti worked under Anglican bishop William Thompson as a layman in the Diocese of Iran for two years.  Bishop of Iran  Dehqani-Tafti decided to become an Anglican priest and left Iran in 1947 to attend Ridley Hall, Cambridge, a theological college, to prepare for his ordination. After his ordination he returned to Iran and became pastor of St Luke's Anglican Church in Isfahan. He spent ten years at the Isfahan parish and also did some missionary work within Iran. He briefly became pastor of St Paul's Anglican Church in the capital city, Tehran. He was appointed the Anglican Bishop in Iran to succeed William Thompson. (Dehqani-Tafti had married Thompson's daughter Margaret in an English-Iranian wedding nine years before his ascension as bishop). Dehqani-Tafti became the first ethnic Iranian Christian bishop in Iran since the 7th century. (There had been ethnic Armenian and Assyrian bishops in Iran, but no ethnic Persian bishops until the 20th century.) As bishop, he concentrated on the growth of the Anglican education system and schools in Iran. He established Iranian secondary schools for girls and boarding schools for boys. In 1977 he became president bishop of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East, until 1985. In exile After the murder of their son the family settled in the Diocese of Winchester, where Hassan Dehqani-Tafti became an assistant bishop and continued to lead the Anglican diocese of Iran from exile. Margaret died in 2016. They are buried together at Winchester Cathedral.

Ayamonte was assigned to Victoria, the nao that rounded the world, receiving the monthly pay of eight hundred (800) maravedis, as revealed in the study of Jos√© Toribio Medina, the Chilean historian, who consulted the records of the Casa de Contratac√≠on de las Indias, operating arm of Spain's Supreme Council of the Indies with headquarters at Seville. He was a Portuguese registered as a Castilian in the official records of the Magallanes expedition. Deserted the Victoria Ayamonte together with a cabin boy, Bartolom√© de Salda√±a, deserted the Victoria one night on February 5, 1521 as the ship was laid off at the port of Batatara, at the north shore of Timor. They abandoned the Victoria by swimming to the shore. This incident seems to have given rise to stories of either a mutiny or a brawl among Victoria's crew. Medina cites Gon√ßalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y V√°ldez as source for the story a number of the men were executed at Timor for participating in a mutiny. On the other hand, Fernando L√≥pez de Gƒámara, according to Medina, reported that \\"many\\" were killed during a brawl. But Visconde de Lag√¥a (Jo√£o A. de Mascarenhas Judice) points to Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas as source of the brawl story which talks of only a few being killed. Tim Joyner speculates the reason the two deserted may be because the two were \\"simply afraid they would not survive another transoceanic voyage.\\" Caught and interrogated by the Portuguese Eventually the two were caught by the Portuguese who were the dominant power in those parts of Maritime Southeast Asia. They were both brought to Portuguese Malacca where they were subjected to formal questioning. The interrogation is recorded in a document of four folios found at the National Archives of Portugal. It is attested to by two Portuguese officials who must have done the questioning, Jorge de Albuquerque and Lopo Cabra Bernardes. Account credited as eyewitness record of Ayamonte The document is officially credited as an account by Martinho de Aiamonte which probably meant he was the only one doing the talking during the interrogation. The eyewitness account was published only in 1933 in Arquivo Hist√≥rico de Portugal, vol. I, fasc. 5, 6 under editor Ant√≥nio Bai√£o. It was recently republished in modern Portuguese in a book, Fern√£o de Magalh√£es, A primeira viagem √† volta do mundo contada pelos que nela participaram, edited with notes by Neves √Åguas: Portugal, 1986. Insights into Mazaua island-port Ayamonte's is considered by most Magellan scholars and navigation historians as the least significant of the ten known eyewitness relations. It is in fact largely because it has some references to the port where the Armada anchored from March 28-April 4, 1521 that the account is still worth consideration. The other eyewitness accounts in this category is by Antonio Pigafetta, Gin√©s de Mafra, Francisco Albo, and The Genoese Pilot. The most important of these is the one by de Mafra principally because he was able to go back to Mazaua with probably some 90+ companions in March 1543 staying in the port for about six months. De Mafra's observations were precise and measurable. Furthermore, there is the added probability, these were shared by Andr√©s de San Mart√≠n, the chief pilot-astrologer of the fleet, who was some kind of genius in the determination of longitude through mathematical calculation of using conjunctions of the moon with the planets. Mazaua is the object of a geographical controversy. It is widely believed today as the southern isle of Limasawa. But whereas Mazaua had an excellent harbor, Limasawa has no anchorage. The name \\"Limasawa\\" was coined by a Spanish friar, Fr. Francisco Comb√©s, S.J., who had not read a single eyewitness account. What he read was the garbled Italian translation of Pigafetta by Giovanni Battista Ramusio where Mazaua is replaced by Butuan. Comb√©s's other source, the secondary account by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, states the name of the port was \\"Mazagua\\" the Hispanicized spelling of \\"Mazaua\\"‚Äîthe gu has the value of w which is absent in the Spanish alphabet. Ayamonte's name for the port is \\"Ma√ßava\\" which is just a different way of spelling \\"masawa\\", a word found only in the Butuanon language and its derivative, Tausug, which is a foreign language introduced to Sulu. Cedilla √ß in Ayamonte's \\"Ma√ßava\\" is an archaic form of s while v is the exact equivalent of w. It is a small help in solving the problem of finding out the true identity of Mazaua, an issue which in the Philippines is framed as the site where the First mass in the Philippines was held. Here are the exact words of Ayamonte on Mazaua: ‚Äú...e daly a duzemtas legoas vieram ter a hum arcepeligo de muytas ylhas em que viram muytos paraos e gemte com ouro myto e ysto s√µr segundo eu tenho sabydo he a par de Maluco em direito de bamda e nestas ylhas ffizeram sua agoada e dahy vieram ter a huua ylha per nome ma√ßava que era camynho de cimquoenta legoas de huua aa outra e com o Rey da dita ylha ffez o dito Fernam de Magalhaes pazes e daquella jlha o dito Rey della os levou a Cebu outro Rey cujo vasallo elle he.‚Äù (From ‚ÄúA viagem de Fern√£o de Magalh√£es por uma testemunha precencial.‚Äù In: Arquivo Historico de Portugal by Antonio Bai√£o, Vo.l. 1, fasc. 5, 6, Page 270) This has been translated by British expoloration/navigation historian Raymond John Howgego, a.k.a. Ray Howgego, in this way: ‚Äú‚Ä¶and two hundred leagues from there they came upon an archipelago of a large number of islands, where they saw many paraus and natives with much gold, and this, sir, as I understand it, is close to Maluco, in the direction of Banda, and in these islands they take water, and from there they came to an island named Massawa, a distance of fifty leagues from one to the other, and with the king of the said island the aforementioned Fern√£o de Magalh√£es made peace, and from that island the aforesaid king took them to Cebu, another kingdom to which he is subject.‚Äù In most work on Magellan historiography more particularly on Mazaua, virtually nothing is mentioned of Ayamonte. He is first fully accounted for in the research finding of Vicente Calibo de Jesus in a paper read before the Society for the History of Discoveries held on October 13, 2000 at the U.S. Library of Congress, Washington DC, U.S.A. Heretofore, no writing ever related Ayamonte to Mazaua. His abstract is archived at http://www.sochistdisc.org/annual_meetings/annual_2000/annual_meeting_2000_abstracts.htm. Final fate unknown Beyond the fact both Ayamonte and Salda√±a were interrogated by the Portuguese at Malacca, nothing more is known. Were they ultimately brought back to Europe, to be jailed at Lisbon, as was the general practice at the time? Or did they elect to remain at Malacca? We know nothing more.  Sources  *√ÅGUAS, Neves.

His first name is often abbreviated to Hajo. One of his earliest international tournaments was the Kecskem√©t zonal qualifier of 1964, where he finished a creditable ninth equal, behind some of the finest players of the day (Georgi Tringov, Ludek Pachman, L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥, Florin Gheorghiu and Vlastimil Hort to name a few). At Bussum in 1968, he took a share of sixth place (Robert H√ºbner won). There were other promising results at Bussum 1969 and the Raach zonal the same year, but it was apparent that development was slow during this phase of his career, and he was unable to challenge for first place in strong competition. Progress was eventually forthcoming between earning his International Master title in 1969 and becoming a Grandmaster in 1973, when the quality of his play improved rapidly, and this was largely due to his decision to turn professional around 1970. As a result, he participated in a great many events and was able to register impressive victories at Bad Pyrmont 1970 (with Alexander Matanovic and Mato Damjanovic), Olot 1971, M√°laga 1972, Montilla-Moriles 1972 and Dortmund 1973 (with Boris Spassky and Ulf Andersson). Domestically too, he twice captured the German Chess Championship, in 1970 and 1973. At Wijk aan Zee in 1974, a fully bearded Hecht took a share of third place behind Walter Browne and Jan Hein Donner (ahead of Jan Timman and Andras Adorjan) and was the winner at Dublin. He was also making wedding plans in 1974 and realised that his earnings would be insufficient to raise a family. Consequently, he resumed his former amateur status and took a job in local government, based in Solingen. He married Anne Marie Zeitler, the sister of notable German blind chess player Hans Zeitler and together they had two sons, Christopher and Volkmar. Both are strong chess players. Hecht has had a long and successful association with team chess, spanning from 1962 to 1986, during which time he made ten Chess Olympiad appearances. Curiously, his highest team position (board 2) at Valletta 1980, coincided with his best score of +7, =4, -2 (69%). He also played at three European Team Chess Championships, from 1965 to 1977, but it was at the World Team Chess Championship of 1985, that he scored his biggest triumph, taking an individual gold medal for his performance on board 5. Over the years, he also gained medals at the EEC Team Chess Championship, The Clare Benedict Chess Cup, and the Nordic Chess Cup. In league chess, he enjoyed many successes with Chess Bundesliga teams Solingen SG 1868 and Bayern Munich throughout his career. By the late 1970s, he found himself playing a diminishing number of tournaments and so took up correspondence chess, earning himself the Correspondence International Master title in 1980. For many years, he was a 'second' to World Chess Championship Candidate Robert H√ºbner. Most recently, he has been involved in the promotion of German junior chess club Furstenfeldbruck, but also participated at the 2005 World Senior Chess Championship at Lignano Sabbiadoro, where he made a respectable top ten finish from a field of one hundred and forty. In 2006, he played at Queenstown, New Zealand, and took home the 'Seniors' trophy.

Mellon. It is the home of the American Enterprise Institute. The floor plan History The Andrew Mellon Building was built by Stanley McCormick, heir to the International Harvester fortune, in 1915 and completed in 1917. Washington-based Jules Henri de Sibour was architect of the building. This was one of the first Washington apartment buildings for luxury living. The structure was meant to fit in with other Beaux-Arts buildings in the Dupont Circle neighborhood. The building's composition is three principal elevations, to serve as a pivot point for a residential boulevard and two street intersections. The six units it originally contained had quarters for more than forty servants. Some of the Capital's most distinguished personalities once lived here. A partial listing of these residents, from the Historic American Buildings Survey, includes: * Thomas F. Ryan, 1920‚Äì1922 * Robert Woods Bliss, 1920‚Äì1923 * Edwin T. Meredith, 1921 * Andrew W. Mellon, 1922‚Äì1937 * Sumner Welles, 1921‚Äì1927 * Alanson B. Houghton, 1930‚Äì1934 The millionaire industrialist Andrew Mellon is perhaps most significant of these past occupants. He was Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932. This was the longest tenure since Albert Gallatin. Mellon made this his residence shortly after taking on that role, occupying the top floor from 1922 until his death in 1937. Among his accomplishments include authoring the \\"Mellon Plan\\" which stimulated the economic boom of the 1920s, and founding the National Gallery of Art.Andrew Mellon Building, 1785 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia, DC , from National Historic Landmarks Program In 1936 Mellon paid $21 million for paintings and sculptures owned by Sir Joseph Duveen, an art dealer leasing the apartment below. At the time this was the largest art transaction on record.Washington, D.C. Embassy Row Walking Tour, from National Geographic Traveler After 1941, the building was used for offices and eventually partitioned. The property was conveyed by deed from Katherine Dexter McCormick to the American Council on Education on March 31, 1950. Later the property was conveyed to The Brookings Institution on January 2, 1970. Finally, the building was sold to the National Trust for Historic Preservation on October 28, 1976. The Andrew Mellon Building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and =2013 sale= The National Trust put the building up for sale in mid-2009. The organization said it had outgrown the building, and needed about of space. Real estate experts believed the structure would sell for $1,000 a square foot, or $60 million. Potential buyers considered turning it into a museum or luxury apartments again, but there were no offers at any price. After Trust president Richard Moe stepped down in early 2010 and was replaced by Stephanie Meeks, the organization's board of directors decided to pull the building off the market so that Meeks would not have to devote all her time to finding the National Trust a new home. Instead, National Trust officials said they would rehabilitate some of the structure's windows, HVAC, and mechanical systems and possibly add a green roof. In late June 2013, the National Trust sold the Mellon Building to the American Enterprise Institute for $36.5 million. The Trust said it will lease space on the top two floors of the Watergate Office Building. The National Trust holds a permanent historic preservation easement that protects both the interior and exterior of the Mellon Building.

One important argument in this respect is the consideration of public transport as a merit good. The rationale behind it is the idea that governments should guarantee basic service in public transport to deprived customer groups despite the fact that it is economically irrational. While the subsidization of public transport is basically not contested, the important question in the public vs. private debate refers to the optimal level of subsidy.International Transport Forum (2008), pp. 15-16 Today there are no real answers to this issue, but Japanese policy to have a relatively free transportation market is considered to function well in providing transport to Japan's three major metropolitan areas. The country's flagship high-speed line, the Tokaido Shinkansen, has operated for almost half a century without a single derailment or collision, and in 2007, its average departure delay was a mere 18 seconds along its 320-mile route.http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/10/why-tokyos-privately-owned-rail- systems-work-so-well/389/ Impact =Price= The 1970s were an era of deregulation within the U.S. Back then public transport (i.e. railroads in 1976 and airlines in 1978) were deregulated.Cooper / Mundy / Nelson (2010), p. 19 Ticket prices increase or decrease based on the service provided and the amount of public subsidies. Different approaches to privatize railways in U.S. and Europe were taken. In Europe, rail operations were separated from rail infrastructure, while the U.S. railroad system is widely deregulated and vertically integrated.Clifford (2010), p. 142 Another example were public owned bus companies in the U.K. Those companies were reorganized in 1985 into private companies (with the exception of London). Cost savings mainly resulted from reduced employment costs and increased productivity.Klein / Moore / Reja (1997), pp. 63-66 =Service quality= A number of innovations were adopted by private bus companies in the pursuit of profits with the most important being the launch of minibuses that increased service levels.Klein / Moore / Reja (1997), p. 67 However, separating rail operations from rail infrastructure turned out to make coordination of rail operations and infrastructure maintenance more difficult.Clifford (2010), p. 142 =Safety= The changes to the U.K. bus industry as a result of privatization had in contrast to the changes to the U.K. railway industry no effects on its safety.Klein / Moore / Reja (1997), p. 66 In the U.K. privatising railways entailed cost overruns, accidents and, finally, the bankruptcy of the rail infrastructure company. For the rest of Europe the separation of rail operations from rail infrastructure did not cause substantial problems.Clifford (2010), p. 142 The McNulty review of the UK railway industry in 2011 found that the fragmentation of the industry in the course of privatisation had caused a permanent increase in costs of between 20% and 30%.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d2c5cbc-80b4-11e0-85a4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1MgnehMUQ By the same token, airline market reformation in Europe has been successful. Today, a single European airline market exists leading to improved productivity and decreased ticket prices. As in the U.S., low-cost carriers have affected the market and, thus, improved resource allocation.European Conference of Ministers of Transport (2005), p. 238 Notes References International Transport Forum, (2008), Privatisation and Regulation of Urban Transit Systems, OECD Publishing.

He saw active service in the Second World War, with his most important contribution being the planning of communications for the invasion of Normandy. He continued his army career after the war, ultimately holding the post of director of telecommunications at the War Office. He was also a cricketerCricinfo profile of county-standard, who played for Kent during the 1938 English cricket season. A right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler, he played ten first-class matches in all,CricketArchive profile and also represented the Egypt national cricket team.Teams played for by Eric Cole at CricketArchive Personal life and army career Born in Malta in 1906, where his father was then stationed as bandmaster of the Royal Sussex Regiment, Cole was educated at Dover Grammar School for Boys and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. On graduation from Sandhurst in 1925, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Signal Corps on 3 September, and posted to Egypt, his early career also included time in Palestine, before being promoted to lieutenant on 3 September 1927. During these first postings he joined a group exploring the deserts of the Middle East. In 1934 he designed a transceiver that enabled an expedition consisting of two cars taking a 1500-mile trip across the Western Desert and Libyan Sand Sea to remain in daily contact with their base at Abbassia. The techniques developed during this and similar expeditions would later be taken up by British Forces in the North African Campaign, particularly by the Long Range Desert Group and helped to give them an edge over their Axis counterparts. He took and passed the examinations for promotion to captain in October 1934, but was not actually promoted until 3 September 1936. In 1938 he was Montgomery's chief signal officer in 88th Division Signals, operating against Arab terrorists in northern Palestine. On 1 March 1939 he was appointed adjutant of 1st Division's Signals. The unit was part of the British Expeditionary Force sent to France on the outbreak of the Second World War. Shortly before the main German offensive he became acting deputy chief signal officer to I Corps (and an acting major). During the evacuation from Dunkirk he commanded the signals party which remained with the Corps HQ until it was finally evacuated, managing to keep communications open most of the time, despite only having one wireless detachment, five despatch riders and two linemen; he was wounded on the evacuation beach. The Corps chief signal officer recommended him for a decoration, initially the Military Cross, which was then downgraded to an MBE, but in the end Cole only received a Mention in Despatches. On Cole's return to the United Kingdom he was soon involved in planning the communications for various amphibious operations proposed by Churchill, mostly cancelled before they got off the drawing board. In July 1941 he was appointed chief signal officer for Force 110, an amphibious force intended to carry out raids and landings across an area from the Azores to Sicily, and designed some of the special comms equipment used by the amphibious and airborne forces. He married an artist, Doris Hartley, in 1941. Given this experience of amphibious operations, he was an obvious choice for the new Combined Operations department when it was set up in January 1942. He was promoted major on 3 September 1942. In this capacity he was involved in planning the communications for the proposed invasion of Normandy. He took part in the invasion as chief signals officer of I Corps, and was sent forward on D+7 to take over signals in 6th Airborne Division, and stayed with that division during the remainder of the Battle of Normandy. On 28 September 1944, he moved to the role of deputy chief signals officer (British) at Allied Forces Headquarters, initially under the command of Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, and from December 1944, Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1945 for services during the Italian Campaign. By this time he held the war substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel, a temporary colonelcy and was an acting brigadier. In April 1945 he was posted to Athens as part of the British Land Forces Greece, supporting Greek Government forces during the Greek Civil War. In 1946 Cole was appointed chairman of the Joint Communications Board, and his wartime substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel was confirmed. He was promoted substantive colonel in 1948 (with seniority backdated to 1947), and spent two years in Washington, D.C.. Further important positions followed, along with promotion to substantive brigadier in 1954. By January 1958 he was at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe as deputy chief signal officer, and became director of telecommunications at the War Office (with the temporary rank of major-general) on 15 April 1958, receiving substantive promotion on 24 August 1958, and relinquished the role on 27 April 1961, retiring from active duty shortly after. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Corps of Signals on 22 December 1962, in succession to Mervyn Wheatley, and held that appointment until 22 December 1967. On his retirement in 1961 he joined Ultra Electronics managing their telecommunications business, he was also appointed president of the Radio Society of Great Britain. In 1964 he moved to manage Granger Associates, a radio aerial manufacturer, and later become a director of the company. Cricket career Cole's early cricket career was split between Egypt and England. He first played for the Egyptian national side in April 1930, playing twice against HM Martineau's XI. Indeed, all his matches for Egypt were against Martineau's team, and he also played twice against them for Gezira Sporting Club.Other matches played by Eric Cole at CricketArchive In 1931, after playing twice for Egypt in April, he made his first-class debut, playing for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University.First-class matches played by Eric Cole at CricketArchive Back in Egypt, he played for the national side once in 1932 and twice in 1933. The 1933 English cricket season was when he first became involved with Kent County Cricket Club, playing five times for their second XI in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship that year.Minor Counties Championship Matches played by Eric Cole at CricketArchive He also played his second first-class match that year, playing for the British Army cricket team against the West Indies. He again played twice for Egypt in 1934, and played his final match for them in April 1935. The rest of his cricket career was in England, and in 1935 he played a first-class match for the Army against Cambridge University, and a Minor Counties Championship match for Kent Second XI against Staffordshire. He played first-class matches for the Army against Cambridge University in the 1936 season and against Oxford University in the 1937 season. He also played for the Combined Services against New Zealand in 1937. In 1938, after playing for the Army against Cambridge University, he made his debut for the Kent first team, playing County Championship matches against Lancashire, Derbyshire and Worcestershire. These were his only games for Kent. He played a non-first-class match for the Army against the West Indies in 1939, his last recorded match. =Statistics= In his ten first-class matches, Eric Cole scored 147 runs at an average of 9.80, with a top-score of 36 for the ArmyFirst-class batting and fielding for each team by Eric Cole at CricketArchive against the West IndiesFirst-class batting and fielding against each opponent by Eric Cole at CricketArchive in 1933.

He also represented Aldershot Command in at least one football match in 1928. He later took up golf to a reasonable standard and was president of the Army Golfing Society in the 1970s. He was a keen photographer, and an associate of the Royal Photographic Society. He collected English bronze coinage, and was known as a numismatist. He frequently competed in amateur radio competitions.

In 776, after Charlemagne's conquest of the Lombard Kingdom, Peter was summoned to the Carolingian court along with Paul the Deacon and Alcuin. Peter had originally taught at Pavia, in Italy. Peter of Pisa was asked to be Charlemagne‚Äôs primary Latin teacher. Peter‚Äôs poetry provides a personal look at the workings of the innermost sanctum surrounding Charlemagne. Peter‚Äôs grammar texts provide insight into the transformation Latin education underwent in this period. As Christianity spread through Europe, so did Latin. Native speakers of Celtic or Germanic languages were rapidly becoming exposed to Latin: the language of the Church and international communication. In West Europe, from 400 until the late middle ages, the Bible and its commentaries were only available in Latin. Although some regions in West Europe were introduced to Latin centuries earlier by the Romans, these spoken languages evolved differently from the Latin of the written Bible. To properly understand the Bible, and its commentaries, and the works of figures such as St. Augustine, knowledge of written Latin was a must. East of the Rhine, the people spoke an ancestor to today's German language because the Roman empire did not stretch that far. Learning Latin was challenging to peoples who were often not literate in their own native language. Another problem was posed by the inadequacy of the (outdated) teaching material that was available to instructors and missionaries. The materials were often designed for more advanced, native Latin speakers, or possibly Roman students. An example of this could be the Ars Maior by Donatus. Younger clergy in, for instance, Frankia or Germania, could see the study of Latin as a better way to understand the Bible, its commentaries, and prayers. The Late Imperial teaching manuals are broken down into three categories: ‚Ä¢ Schulgrammatik was a systemic work that introduced pupils to basic concepts of the language such as parts of speech.Law, Vivien. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 89. ‚Ä¢ Commentary: a type of work whose focus was originally written texts. Donatus‚Äô efforts widened this genre to the study of grammar. ‚Ä¢ Regulae works displayed variety in structure, with the main focus on form and proper Latin inflection. A common theme of these works is that they were not written for education of inexperienced Latin learners. In the 600s, three new types of teaching manuals began to emerge that shaped the way Latin was taught during the time of the Carolingians: ‚Ä¢ Commentaries. These manuals were intended for advanced students with one of the goals being to see grammatical texts as literary commentaries.Law, Vivien. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 90. ‚Ä¢ Declinationes Nominum. Generally speaking, the goal in these texts was to construct the answer text by choosing from a vocabulary ‚Äúbank‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Insular Elementary Grammars.Law, Vivien. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 91. Christian culture was not introduced by the Carolingians; this movement was already evident in Visigothic Spain and Anglo-Saxon England at the time of conversion in the 7th century. Annexation of the Lombard kingdom (774) is also possibly linked with encouraging Charlemagne to embrace late Roman tradition. Classical studies began to be encouraged by him. Education was revived and Latinity began to rise. ‚ÄúThe greatest contribution made by the Carolingian rulers to the revival of learning in their territories was thus less in legislating for it than in guaranteeing the Church‚Äôs enjoyment of requisite material resources in the face of various conflicting interests and pressures.‚Äù Brown, Giles. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 34. ‚ÄúThe Carolingian renaissance may be seen as an exercise in patronage on a grand scale by the Carolingian rulers.‚ÄùBrown, Giles. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 44. \\"Carolingian Military successes against groups like the Saxons and the Avars allowed the territory to gain wealth which was donated to the Church.\\" Trompf, G. W. The Concept of the Carolingian Renaissance, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1973), 3-26. Therefore, strengthening the presence of standardized written Latin language knowledge in Francia. Around the year 800, Charlemagne (768-814) invited many great poets, grammarians, and other intellectuals to his court to feed his interest in the liberal arts. His influence and the ability to attract scholars to him created an influx. The Carolingian Renaissance spurred interest in classical study, and a revolution in teaching grammar and rhetoric. Classical and late-antique literature was being copied at an increased pace, and rare classical works were sought by Charlemagne. Paul the Deacon, Theodulf, Alcuin, Waldo of Reichenau, amongst others, joined Peter of Pisa at the emperor's side. Peter was formerly at the court of Desiderius. However, the famous names did not stay at Charlemagne's court for a long period of time, and their relatively brief cohesiveness was the result of shared scholarly culture. Paulinus and Paul the Deacon were the first to leave no later than 790.Godman, Peter. Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance, Introduction, 7. According to the emperor's biographer, Einhard, Peter of Pisa was Charlemagne's Latin grammar instructor. Peter's grammars largely incorporate the Insular Elementary style, while at the same time including distinct Carolingian aspects. One method which would become known by historians as distinctly the product of Peter is using series of questioning statements about the nature of a particular word. This type of method would remain in use for centuries for education purposes: What is it? What word class does it belong to? Brown, Giles. Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, Cambridge University Press, 1994, 94. Priscian is also known for including statements such as these in his manuals. However, the earliest datable specimen occurs in Peter of Pisa's grammar. Some words encourage very straightforward ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù, while others are more flexible in the answers which are provided to the statements. Peter is also unique in his application of logic to elementary grammars. By the end of the 8th century, Charlemagne's travel group has grown in number, and had become increasingly immobile. Poetry and poetic epistles provided entertainment on prolonged stoppages, as well as a way of competition between intellectuals. In addition, Latin poetry would become very popular in the 9th century. Almost all of those drawn to Charlemagne's court were poets in a way. In this environment, they were motivated by their new ‚Äúelite‚Äù group and trying to overcome each other with wordplay and sly humor. The surviving record indicates that some rivalries were preserved as dramatized poetry. Peter was the emperor's amanuensis and wrote some mocking poems in his name. The following is an excerpt from a poem written by Peter, in the voice of Charlemagne, in ironical exaggeration of Paul's ability, and one of the first written manifestations of their rivalry: He sent you, Paul, most learned of poets and bards, to our back-water, as shining light with the various languages you know, to quicken the sluggish to life by sowing fine seeds. Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance, 85 Paul replies in a way that downplays his ability and comically exalts Peter: But lest it be said that I am an ignoramus in languages, I shall repeat a few of the lines which were taught to me as a boy; the rest have slipped my mind as old age weighs upon me. Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance, 89 One unique feature of Charlemagne court's writing, and Peter's, is ‚Äúcoterie poetry‚Äù. Poems of this genre would make use of inside jokes, secret nicknames, and other aspects that indicate the readers be in a certain close-knit social group. Peter wrote to Paul the Deacon again: You, hold off from gnawing the good brother with your teeth, Who never is seen to be angry by the king's court.Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance, 90 An additional example of this kind of poetry could be found in the messages sent between Paul the Deacon, Peter of Pisa, and Charlemagne between 782 and 786. The three exchange riddles and sly remarks poking fun at one-another. Some epitaphs and acrostic poems would even draw in other court goers that were not part of the original dialogue, increasing the attractiveness of poetry for all court participants. In addition, Peter wrote epistolary poems to Charlemagne, paying homage to him for building churches and acting as \\"father of his people\\". Peter returned to Italy around 790, where he died no later than 799.  References  * Vauchez, Dobson, Lapidge, Walford (eds) Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages Routledge 2001. * F.

It is an enhanced version of Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl and is part of the fourth generation of the Pok√©mon video game series. It was released on September 13, 2008 in Japan, March 22, 2009 in North America, May 14, 2009 in Australia and May 22, 2009 in Europe. The developers made Platinum with the intent of making it a stronger version of Diamond and Pearl, which they described as the \\"ultimate\\" Pok√©mon titles. In Platinum, players control either a male or female character and start with one of three Pok√©mon given to them from Professor Rowan. The mascot Pok√©mon is Giratina, who plays a central role in the game's plot. While it only had one form in Diamond and Pearl, it is given a new alternate form alongside a new area called the Distortion World, which features altered physics from the normal land of Sinnoh, where the game takes place. The gameplay stays true to traditional Pok√©mon mechanics. Players explore a large area, which ranges from mountains to bodies of water, grasslands, populated areas, and snowy expanses. Similar to previous titles, players have their Pok√©mon fight turn-based battles against other Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon Platinum has been met with generally positive reception, holding aggregate scores of 84 and 83.14% on Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. It was praised for being the best Pok√©mon game ever made and also praised for the additions and changes made to Diamond and Pearl by publications such as IGN, Nintendo Power, and GamePro, although it has also been criticized for being too similar to them. IGN ranked it as the ninth-best Nintendo DS game ever made, as well as nominating it as one of the best DS role-playing games of 2009. It was the fastest-selling game in Japan at the time, and had sold 7.06 million copies worldwide by March 31, 2010. Gameplay A battle in Pok√©mon Platinum; players may have either one-on-one battles or two-on-two Pok√©mon Platinum is a role-playing video game with adventure elements. Its basic mechanics are the same as those found in Diamond and Pearl. As with all Pok√©mon games for handheld consoles up to that point, gameplay is in third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with one Pok√©mon and can capture more using Pok√© Balls. The player can also use his or her Pok√©mon to battle other Pok√©mon. When the player encounters a wild Pok√©mon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pok√©mon battle. During a battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch the active Pok√©mon, or flee. Fleeing is not an option during battles against trainers. All Pok√©mon have hit points (HP); when a Pok√©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless revived with a Pok√©mon skill or an item. If the player's Pok√©mon defeats the opposing Pok√©mon by causing it to faint, it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pok√©mon evolve into a new species of Pok√©mon when they reach a certain level. Apart from battling, capturing Pok√©mon is the most important element of Pok√©mon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pok√©mon cannot be captured, the player may use Pok√© Balls on a wild Pok√©mon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pok√©mon to the player's active party or stores it in the PC if the player already has the maximum of six Pok√©mon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pok√©mon and the strength of the Pok√© Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Pok√© Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Platinum features largely the same Pok√©mon as in Diamond and Pearl, with some added and some missing. Platinum features the Pok√©tch, a wristwatch-like device, introduced in Diamond and Pearl. It features simple applications such as a calculator, map, counter, and drawing pad. Platinum also features the Underground mode, where players can dig for spheres and Fossils. =New features= Platinum adds an area called the \\"Wi-Fi Plaza\\", which features several Pok√©mon species-themed mini-games and allows up to 20 players to be present in it. Platinum also introduces the Vs. Recorder, which allows players to record battles held in the Battle Frontier or on Wi-Fi. The Global Trade System (GTS), a service that allows players to trade anonymously over a Wi-Fi connection, returns in Platinum; one change to the GTS system allows players to be notified via email when a trade has commenced, though outside Japan, this feature has been reduced to being merely a message on the player's Wii. A variety of changes have been made to the appearance and availability of Pok√©mon; Giratina, Shaymin, and Rotom all have new forms, with Rotom having four new forms. The trios of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, along with Regice, Regirock, and Registeel, have been added to the game as well. The game also adds the Battle Frontier, a feature first introduced in Pok√©mon Emerald. Platinums Pok√©mon Contests play similarly to Diamond and Pearls; they feature three stages, awarding ribbons to Pok√©mon for having the best result. Baked goods called Poffins can be made from berries and fed to Pok√©mon to improve certain traits, depending on the kind of Poffin made. In addition to compatibility with Diamond and Pearl, Platinum is also compatible with the third generation Pok√©mon role-playing games available on the Game Boy Advance. Players can upload Pok√©mon from Platinum to the Wii games Pok√©mon Battle Revolution and My Pok√©mon Ranch, though the latter is only compatible with Platinum in Japan. A significant addition is the Distortion World, which features distorted physics versus those in the standard world. Setting and story The Sinnoh region is based on the Japanese island of Hokkaid≈ç Similar to Diamond and Pearl, Platinum is set in the fictional region of Sinnoh. In Platinum, there is snow on the ground in other locations where it was not found in Diamond and Pearl, and the player characters and the player's rival are dressed for colder weather when compared with the designs from Diamond and Pearl. Pok√©mon Platinum, while keeping to the same plot as Diamond and Pearl for the most part, introduces several new elements to it. Two new characters are introduced‚Äîthe first being Charon, a scientist in Team Galactic, and the other being a detective investigating Team Galactic under the codename \\"Looker\\". Giratina is also the focus of the plot, whereas Dialga and Palkia were the focuses of Diamond and Pearl, respectively. However, the player can still obtain both Dialga and Palkia, whereas, in Diamond and Pearl, the player could only catch Giratina and the respective game's mascot. As in Diamond and Pearl, the starter Pok√©mon are the Grass-type Turtwig, the Fire-type Chimchar, and the Water-type Piplup. Development The Distortion World took inspiration from concepts such as antimatter and the mass-energy equivalence Pok√©mon Platinum was first announced on May 15, 2008, as a follow-up to Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. It is in the same vein as games like Pok√©mon Yellow or Pok√©mon Emerald, which are enhanced versions of Pok√©mon Red and Blue and Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire respectively. When trying to determine what content to change from Diamond and Pearl, game designer Takeshi Kawachimaru felt that the designers should focus on changing only the most important things to make sure that it was not too different from the original games. Game director Junichi Masuda commented that since they designed the original two games as the \\"ultimate\\" Pok√©mon titles, they had to make Platinum even stronger than them. Giratina's design change was one of the first things revealed about Platinum. In designing the new form, they paid attention to the details; the designer redrew Giratina several times, attempting to make it look different from its form in Diamond and Pearl. They finalized its design as an \\"antimatter Pok√©mon\\". Masuda explained antimatter as well as E=MC2 to the developers. He also explained the \\"Reversed Mt. Fuji\\", which is what they call the reflection of Mt. Fuji. While Kawachimaru did not understand it at first, he later incorporated them into the game. The Distortion World was based on these ideas, described as the \\"core concept\\" of the game. They also added the Wi-Fi Plaza and Battle Frontier modes to improve players' ability to share information with other players. An idea that the developers wanted to include was to allow players to communicate with family and friends more easily; the developers felt that the Battle Frontier realized this idea. The developers chose to call the game Platinum because of their observations that diamond has a \\"meaning of love\\", while pearl has a \\"meaning of happiness\\". They explained that they wanted to choose something that seems \\"beautiful\\", describing platinum as \\"different from a diamond, different from a gem, different from a pearl, different from something that nature creates, something [that] shines, something beautiful.\\" They also created the story to be different from Diamond and Pearl, commenting that they wanted to make Giratina seem \\"more fun, more interesting, cooler.\\" They added Giratina's new area to make the story \\"more appealing\\". While Diamond and Pearl had Gym Leaders who sometimes had Pok√©mon not in keeping with the type they focus on, Platinum changes this so that all Pok√©mon belonging to Gym Leaders were the appropriate type. =Release and promotion= It was first announced for an August 2008 release in Japan, with no release date confirmed overseas at that time. It was eventually released on September 13, 2008 in Japan, March 22, 2009 in North America, May 14, 2009 in Australia, and May 22, 2009 in Europe. Its North American release was celebrated by Nintendo in New York City. As a bonus for those who pre-ordered Pok√©mon Platinum, Nintendo gave away Giratina figurines in the United States. Expanded space was given to Pok√©mon merchandise in Toys \\"R\\" Us for Pok√©mon Platinum, which included a Pok√©mon Trading Card Game card set based on the Platinum name. They also arranged for several events to obtain rare Pok√©mon. Reception =Pre-release reception= GamePros McKinley Noble commented that he anticipated the English release of Platinum. 1UP.com commented that fans will not be left \\"wanting\\", stating \\"once you venture back down the Pok√©mon rabbit hole, you won't be coming up again for a while.\\" Craig Harris of IGN commented that those looking for something particularly new in Platinum such as a new method of control would be disappointed, adding that the controls felt \\"clumsy\\". However, he noted that those who played Diamond and Pearl will enjoy it for its new features and available Pok√©mon. In another preview, Harris commented that those who have played Diamond or Pearl will have to decide whether the new features are worth buying the game for, while those who have not should buy it if interested in playing a Pok√©mon game. =Critical reception= Pok√©mon Platinum has received generally positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 84/100 and 83.14% at Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. It is the 56th highest rated Nintendo DS game on Game Rankings. The Anglo-Celt called it a solid, fun game for those who have yet to play Diamond and Pearl. GamePros McKinley Noble called it a great game, calling other third versions of mainline Pok√©mon titles \\"lightweight\\" in comparison. Famitsu gave praise to Pok√©mon Platinum. One of the reviewers commented that players are \\"getting a lot for their money\\", while another reviewer commented that those who played Diamond and Pearl would not find it to be \\"more of the same.\\" Another reviewer praised not only the features but also the improved gameplay. The fourth reviewer found fault in it being \\"Diamond and Pearl at the core\\", and as a result, \\"filling up your Pok√©dex from zero is rough.\\" Official Nintendo Magazines Chris Scullion called it the \\"ultimate Pok√©mon game\\", though noted that this was because it was an updated version of Diamond and Pearl. Nintendo Power called it \\"everything a Pokemon experience should be, and more.\\" Nintendo World Reports Zachary Miller commented that players who were burnt out on Diamond and Pearl would not find much incentive to play Platinum, but otherwise, said that Platinum is the \\"best Pok√©mon game ever made\\". Zippy of Hardcore Gamer cited its main quest, battle system, and multiplayer options for why \\"it is the best hand held RPG available right now\\". Games(TM) commented that the depth of Platinums gameplay was deeper than \\"most hardcore MMO can boast\\". Toastfarmer of PALGN called it a \\"crown jewel\\" of the Nintendo DS, saying it was a \\"deep, engrossing and virtually endless game\\". GameDailys Robert Workman commented that while the graphics and gameplay could have been changed more than they were, it \\"will score with hardcore fanatic and newbies alike.\\" RPGamers Adriaan den Ouden commented that while it was similar to Diamond and Pearl, the expanded Pok√©dex makes it \\"far more enjoyable.\\" GameZones jkdmedia commented that while Diamond and Pearl were great, Platinum was merely good. He added that it was a \\"must- own\\" to those who have not played Diamond or Pearl, but not for anyone else. Dan Pearson Eurogamer commented that those looking for a traditional role- playing game for the Nintendo DS should buy something like Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest IV or V, or the Final Fantasy remakes, though he noted that those looking for a Pok√©mon title should get Platinum. Eurogamer Portugals Ricardo Madeira called it the \\"more complete and distinct Pok√©mon third version he has seen to date.\\" IGNs Craig Harris commented that while the improvements over Diamond and Pearl were not huge, its adventure mode and online mode were more fleshed out and expanded. They also included it in their list of Nintendo DS games of the spring season, commenting that it improved on Diamond and Pearls gameplay formula, and went \\"above and beyond with new areas, characters, and, of course, Pokemon\\". In their \\"Cheers & Tears: DS RPGs\\" article, which details role-playing games of both high and low quality, IGN included Platinum as a game of high quality. They called it \\"packed to overflowing with content\\", commenting that even those who have played Diamond and Pearl several times could enjoy it. IGN ultimately named Platinum, along with Diamond and Pearl, as the ninth-best Nintendo DS game. IGN nominated it for best role-playing game for the Nintendo DS, while its readers chose it as the best multi-player game for the Nintendo DS. Games Master UK called it \\"one of the most rewarding and substantial RPGs around\\", while NGamer UKs Rich Stanton called it \\"one of the finest strategy games ever made.\\" RPG Fans John Tucker commented that players of Diamond and Pearl would only be interested in its expanded online mode. Game Informer commented that if one was looking for a role-playing game and had not played Diamond or Pearl, it is \\"absolutely the way to go\\". 1UP.coms Justin Haywald called it the best Pok√©mon game, though noted that it was not very different from Diamond and Pearl. GameTrailers commented that fans of the series and those who appreciate role-playing games would enjoy it, but blamed games like Platinum for being the reason why some have lost interest in the series. GameSpots Shiva Stella commented that while not fresh, it was the best \\"special edition yet\\". Game Revolutions Joe Dodson commented that while it was not \\"breathtaking\\", it was one of the \\"biggest and deepest phenomenons in gaming\\". CESA gave Platinum one of nine awards for excellence. =Sales= Pok√©mon Platinums launch was credited for the increased sales of the Nintendo DS in Japan in September 2008.

Mack in Motion Picture Classic, 1926 One day, Griffith invited Mack to rehearse a scene from Dream Street with him. Mack enjoyed the part he had and thought Griffith was friendly. He ended up playing the lead. While filming America in 1924, a soldier's arm was blown off. As Mack recalls, \\"Neil Hamilton and I went to neighboring towns and raised a fund for him‚ÄîI doing a song and dance and Neil collecting a coin.\\" After signing with Warner Brothers, Mack was killed in an automobile accident on his way to a racetrack to film an auto racing scene for the film The First Auto (1927).

That year, Barnhart had a batting average of .326 in 46 at bats in 12 games. In 1921, Barnhart was promoted to a starter. That year he hit .258 in 449 at bats in 124 games. The Pirates, however, were not satisfied with his statistics, so they demoted him to the bench. In 1922, Barnhart hit .330 in 209 at bats in 75 games, giving him the third highest batting average on the team. With those statistics, Barnhart was again promoted. In 1923, he hit .324 in 327 at bats in 114 games. Barnhart's success continued, especially in 1925, when he had 114 runs batted in, second on a team that went on to win the World Series that year. In 1928, Barnhart was plagued with injuries; he recorded a .296 batting average in 196 at bats in 61 games. Barnhart's last game was on August 23 of that year.

It must be able to distinguish between orthographic rules and morphological rules. For example, the word 'foxes' can be decomposed into 'fox' (the stem), and 'es' (a suffix indicating plurality). The generally accepted approach to morphological parsing is through the use of a finite state transducer (FST), which inputs words and outputs their stem and modifiers. The FST is initially created through algorithmic parsing of some word source, such as a dictionary, complete with modifier markups. Another approach is through the use of an indexed lookup method, which uses a constructed radix tree. This is not an often-taken route because it breaks down for morphologically complex languages. With the advancement of neural networks in natural language processing, it became less common to use FST for morphological analysis, especially for languages for which there is a lot of available training data. For such languages, it is possible to build character-level language models without explicit use of a morphological parser.Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. \\"Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information\\" Orthographic Orthographic rules are general rules used when breaking a word into its stem and modifiers. An example would be: singular English words ending with -y, when pluralized, end with -ies. Contrast this to morphological rules which contain corner cases to these general rules. Both of these types of rules are used to construct systems that can do morphological parsing. Morphological Morphological rules are exceptions to the orthographic rules used when breaking a word into its stem and modifiers. An example would be while one normally pluralizes a word in English by adding 's' as a suffix, the word 'fish' does not change when pluralized.

It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796. The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between and weighed up to . Females reached in shoulder heights and weighed up to . A newborn calf weighed about . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America. The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. With a genome project for the mammoth completed in 2015, it has been proposed the species could be revived through various means, but none of the methods proposed are yet feasible. Taxonomy Copy of an interpretation of the \\"Adams mammoth\\" carcass from around 1800, with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach's handwriting Remains of various extinct elephants were known by Europeans for centuries, but were generally interpreted, based on biblical accounts, as the remains of legendary creatures such as behemoths or giants. They were thought to be remains of modern elephants that had been brought to Europe during the Roman Republic, for example the war elephants of Hannibal and Pyrrhus of Epirus, or animals that had wandered north. The first woolly mammoth remains studied by European scientists were examined by Hans Sloane in 1728 and consisted of fossilised teeth and tusks from Siberia. Sloane was the first to recognise that the remains belonged to elephants. Sloane turned to another biblical explanation for the presence of elephants in the Arctic, asserting that they had been buried during the Great Flood, and that Siberia had previously been tropical before a drastic climate change. Others interpreted Sloane's conclusion slightly differently, arguing the flood had carried elephants from the tropics to the Arctic. Sloane's paper was based on travellers' descriptions and a few scattered bones collected in Siberia and Britain. He discussed the question of whether or not the remains were from elephants, but drew no conclusions. In 1738, the German zoologist Johann Philipp Breyne argued that mammoth fossils represented some kind of elephant. He could not explain why a tropical animal would be found in such a cold area as Siberia, and suggested that they might have been transported there by the Great Flood. In 1796, French anatomist Georges Cuvier was the first to identify the woolly mammoth remains not as modern elephants transported to the Arctic, but as an entirely new species. He argued this species had gone extinct and no longer existed, a concept that was not widely accepted at the time. Following Cuvier's identification, German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its scientific name, Elephas primigenius, in 1799, placing it in the same genus as the Asian elephant. This name is Latin for \\"first elephant\\". Cuvier coined the name Elephas mammonteus a few months later, but the former name was subsequently used. In 1828, the British naturalist Joshua Brookes used the name Mammuthus borealis for woolly mammoth fossils in his collection that he put up for sale, thereby coining a new genus name. Where and how the word \\"mammoth\\" originated is unclear. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it comes from an old Vogul word mƒìmo≈ãt, \\"earth- horn\\". It may be a version of mehemot, the Arabic version of the biblical word \\"behemoth\\". Another possible origin is Estonian, where maa means \\"earth\\", and mutt means \\"mole\\". The word was first used in Europe during the early 17th century, when referring to maimanto tusks discovered in Siberia.Lister, 2007. p. 49 American president Thomas Jefferson, who had a keen interest in palaeontology, was partially responsible for transforming the word \\"mammoth\\" from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size. The first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a wheel of cheese (the \\"Cheshire Mammoth Cheese\\") given to Jefferson in 1802.Simpson, J. (2009). \\"Word Stories: Mammoth .\\" Oxford English Dictionary Online, Oxford University Press. Accessed 5 June 2009. 1930s illustration of the lectotype molars by Henry Fairfield Osborn: The left one is now lost. By the early 20th century, the taxonomy of extinct elephants was complex. In 1942, American palaoentologist Henry Fairfield Osborn's posthumous monograph on the Proboscidea was published, wherein he used various taxon names that had previously been proposed for mammoth species, including replacing Mammuthus with Mammonteus, as he believed the former name to be invalidly published. Mammoth taxonomy was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards, all species were retained in the genus Mammuthus, and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as intraspecific variation. Osborn chose two molars (found in Siberia and Osterode) from Blumenbach's collection at G√∂ttingen University as the lectotype specimens for the woolly mammoth, since holotype designation was not practised in Blumenbach's time. Russian palaeontologist Vera Gromova further proposed the former should be considered the lectotype with the latter as paralectotype. Both molars were thought lost by the 1980s, and the more complete \\"Taimyr mammoth\\" found in Siberia in 1948 was therefore proposed as the neotype specimen in 1990. Resolutions to historical issues about the validity of the genus name Mammuthus and the type species designation of E. primigenius were also proposed. The paralectotype molar (specimen GZG.V.010.018) has since been located in the G√∂ttingen University collection, identified by comparing it with Osborn's illustration of a cast. =Evolution= The earliest known members of the Proboscidea, the clade which contains modern elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the Tethys Sea. The closest known relatives of the Proboscidea are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes (an order of small, herbivorous mammals). The family Elephantidae existed 6 million years ago in Africa and includes the modern elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the mastodon (Mammut) is only a distant relative of the mammoths, and part of the separate family Mammutidae, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved.Lister, 2007. pp. 18‚Äì21 The following cladogram shows the placement of the genus Mammuthus among other proboscideans, based on characteristics of the hyoid bone in the neck: Georges Cuvier's 1796 comparison between the mandible of a woolly mammoth (bottom left and top right) and an Indian elephant (top left and bottom right) Comparison between a woolly mammoth (left) and an American mastodon (right) In 2005, researchers assembled a complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth, which allowed them to trace the close evolutionary relationship between mammoths and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). A 2015 DNA review confirmed Asian elephants as the closest living relative of the woolly mammoth. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) branched away from this clade around 6 million years ago, close to the time of the similar split between chimpanzees and humans. Before the publication of the Neanderthal genome, many researchers expected the first fully sequenced nuclear genome of an extinct species would be that of the mammoth. A 2010 study confirmed these relationships, and suggested the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 5.8‚Äì7.8 million years ago, while African elephants diverged from an earlier common ancestor 6.6‚Äì8.8 million years ago. In 2008, much of the woolly mammoth's chromosomal DNA was mapped. The analysis showed that the woolly mammoth and the African elephant are 98.55% to 99.40% identical.Will findings recreate the woolly mammoth? , Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, 20 November 2008 The team mapped the woolly mammoth's nuclear genome sequence by extracting DNA from the hair follicles of both a 20,000-year-old mammoth retrieved from permafrost and another that died 60,000 years ago. In 2012, proteins were confidently identified for the first time, collected from a 43,000-year-old woolly mammoth. Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities, reconstructing the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies is possible. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars; primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight of the head. The short and tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi) were the culmination of this process. Cast of an intermediate form between M. trogontherii and M. primigenius; M. p. fraasi, Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart The first known members of the genus Mammuthus are the African species Mammuthus subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene. The former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8‚Äì10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12‚Äì14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2‚Äì1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) with 18‚Äì20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago.Lister, 2007. pp. 12‚Äì43 Asian elephants have a variable number of enamel ridges that is intermediate between those of the Columbian/steppe mammoth and the woolly mammoth. Individuals and populations showing transitional morphologies between each of the mammoth species are known, and primitive and derived species coexisted, as well, until the former disappeared. The different species and their intermediate forms have therefore been termed \\"chronospecies\\". Many taxa intermediate between M. primigenius and other mammoths have also been proposed, but their validity is uncertain; depending on author, they are either considered primitive forms of an advanced species or advanced forms of a primitive species. Distinguishing and determining these intermediate forms has been called one of the most long-lasting and complicated problems in Quaternary palaeontology. Regional and intermediate species and subspecies such as M. intermedius, M. chosaricus, M. p. primigenius, M. p. jatzkovi, M. p. sibiricus, M. p. fraasi, M. p. leith-adamsi, M. p. hydruntinus, M. p. astensis, M. p. americanus, M. p. compressus, and M. p. alaskensis have been proposed. A 2011 genetic study showed that two examined specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii in areas where their range overlapped. Description Size (red) compared to a human and other mammoths The appearance of the woolly mammoth is probably the best known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art. Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between and weighed up to . This is almost as large as extant male African elephants, which commonly reach a shoulder height of , and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species M. meridionalis and M. trogontherii, and the contemporary M. columbi. The reason for the smaller size is unknown. Female woolly mammoths reached in shoulder heights and were built more lightly than males, weighing up to . A newborn calf would have weighed about . These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size.Lister, 2007. pp. 82‚Äì83 Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals, so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton. The best indication of sex is the size of the pelvic girdle, since the opening that functions as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males.Lister, 2007. pp. 174‚Äì175 Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland, their size varied, and they were not small enough to be considered \\"island dwarfs\\". The last woolly mammoth populations are claimed to have decreased in size and increased their sexual dimorphism, but this was dismissed in a 2012 study. Cave art depicting a woolly mammoth and other animals, from the Rouffignac Cave, France Woolly mammoths had several adaptations to the cold, most noticeably the layer of fur covering all parts of their bodies. Other adaptations to cold weather include ears that are far smaller than those of modern elephants; they were about long and across, and the ear of the 6- to 12-month-old frozen calf \\"Dima\\" was under long. The small ears reduced heat loss and frostbite, and the tail was short for the same reason, only long in the \\"Berezovka mammoth\\". The tail contained 21 vertebrae, whereas the tails of modern elephants contain 28‚Äì33. Their skin was no thicker than that of present-day elephants, between . They had a layer of fat up to thick under the skin, which helped to keep them warm. Woolly mammoths had broad flaps of skin under their tails which covered the anus; this is also seen in modern elephants.Lister, 2007. pp. 82‚Äì87 Model at the Royal BC Museum Other characteristic features depicted in cave paintings include a large, high, single-domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump; this shape resulted from the spinous processes of the back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear. These features were not present in juveniles, which had convex backs like Asian elephants. Another feature shown in cave paintings was confirmed by the discovery of a frozen specimen in 1924, an adult nicknamed the \\"Middle Kolyma mammoth\\", which was preserved with a complete trunk tip. Unlike the trunk lobes of modern elephants, the upper \\"finger\\" at the tip of the trunk had a long pointed lobe and was long, while the lower \\"thumb\\" was and was broader. The trunk of \\"Dima\\" was long, whereas the trunk of the adult \\"Liakhov mammoth\\" was long. The well- preserved trunk of a juvenile specimen nicknamed \\"Yuka\\" was described in 2015, and it was shown to possess a fleshy expansion a third above the tip. Rather than oval as the rest of the trunk, this part was ellipsoidal in cross section, and double the size in diameter. The feature was also shown to be present in two other specimens, of different sexes and ages. =Coat= Fur in Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna The coat consisted of an outer layer of long, coarse \\"guard hair\\", which was on the upper part of the body, up to in length on the flanks and underside, and in diameter, and a denser inner layer of shorter, slightly curly under-wool, up to long and in diameter. The hairs on the upper leg were up to long, and those of the feet were long, reaching the toes. The hairs on the head were relatively short, but longer on the underside and the sides of the trunk. The tail was extended by coarse hairs up to long, which were thicker than the guard hairs. The woolly mammoth likely moulted seasonally, and the heaviest fur was shed during spring. Since mammoth carcasses were more likely to be preserved, possibly only the winter coat has been preserved in frozen specimens. Modern elephants have much less hair, though juveniles have a more extensive covering of hair than adults.Lister, 2007. pp. 83‚Äì84 Comparison between the over-hairs of woolly mammoths and extant elephants show that they did not differ much in overall morphology. Woolly mammoths had numerous sebaceous glands in their skin, which secreted oils into their hair; this would have improved the wool's insulation, repelled water, and given the fur a glossy sheen. Preserved woolly mammoth fur is orange-brown, but this is believed to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from nonpigmented on the overhairs, bicoloured, nonpigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and nonpigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance. =Dentition= Tusk of the adult male \\"Yukagir mammoth\\" Woolly mammoths had very long tusks (modified incisor teeth), which were more curved than those of modern elephants. The largest known male tusk is long and weighs , but and was a more typical size. Female tusks were smaller and thinner, and weighing . The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely. About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets. The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other, sometimes crossing. In this way, most of the weight would have been close to the skull, and less torque would occur than with straight tusks. The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation, with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage. Calves developed small milk tusks a few centimetres long at six months old, which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Tusk growth continued throughout life, but became slower as the animal reached adulthood. The tusks grew by each year. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks, but whether this reflected reality or was artistic license is unknown. Female Asian elephants have no tusks, but no fossil evidence indicates that any adult woolly mammoths lacked them.Lister, 2007. pp. 94‚Äì95 Molar from Font de Champdamoy, France, Mus√©e Georges-Garret Woolly mammoths had four functional molar teeth at a time, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. About of the crown was within the jaw, and was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a conveyor belt. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of enamel, which were themselves covered in \\"prisms\\" that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear-resistant and kept together by cementum and dentine. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted of only a few plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, , the third were 15 cm (6 in) long, and the sixth were about long and weighed . The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement.Lister, 2007. pp. 92‚Äì93 The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant. Distortion in the molars is the most common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes, the replacement was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had periodontal disease, with half of these containing caries. The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths.Lister, 2007. pp. 108‚Äì109 Palaeobiology Life restoration of fauna during the Pleistocene epoch in northern Spain, by Mauricio Ant√≥n, 2004 Adult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves, cave hyenas and large felines. The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over territory or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a flyswatter, similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions.Lister, 2007. pp. 95‚Äì105 The well-preserved foot of the adult male \\"Yukagir mammoth\\" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in matriarchal (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.Lister, 2007. pp. 62‚Äì63 Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300‚Äì11,000 years ago have been found in the St. Mary Reservoir in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of , and the juveniles ran to keep up. =Adaptations to cold= SEM image of a woolly mammoth overhair, 250X magnification The woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and withers, for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of \\"Yuka\\" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \\"fur mitten\\"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal. As in reindeer and musk oxen, the haemoglobin of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes. In a 2015 study, high-quality genome sequences from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer. =Diet= The frozen calf \\"Lyuba\\" which still had food in its stomach, Royal BC Museum Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolly mammoths, giving a good picture of their diet. Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grasses and sedges, which were supplemented with herbaceous plants, flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of 6 tons would need to eat daily, and may have foraged as long as 20 hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age (Quaternary glaciation, 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking buds and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present. The \\"Yukagir mammoth\\" had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus.Lister, 2007. pp. 88‚Äì91 Isotope analysis shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on C3 plants, unlike horses and rhinos. Mandibles and lower molars, Barcelona Scientists identified milk in the stomach and faecal matter in the intestines of the mammoth calf \\"Lyuba\\". The faecal matter may have been eaten by \\"Lyuba\\" to promote development of the intestinal microbes necessary for digestion of vegetation, as is the case in modern elephants. An isotope analysis of woolly mammoths from Yukon showed that the young nursed for at least 3 years, and were weaned and gradually changed to a diet of plants when they were 2‚Äì3 years old. This is later than in modern elephants and may be due to a higher risk of predator attack or difficulty in obtaining food during the long periods of winter darkness at high latitudes. The molars were adapted to their diet of coarse tundra grasses, with more enamel plates and a higher crown than their earlier, southern relatives. The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.Lister, 2007. pp. 92‚Äì95 =Life history= Cross sectioned tusk with growth rings, which can be used to determine the age of specimens The lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25‚Äì20,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf \\"Dima\\" was tall when it died at the age of 6‚Äì12 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.Lister, 2007. pp. 83‚Äì107. Head of the adult male \\"Yukagir mammoth\\"; the trunk is not preserved The best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the \\"Yukagir mammoth\\", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye. This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered \\"musth\\", a period of heightened aggressiveness. The glands are used especially by males to produce an oily substance with a strong smell called temporin. Their fur may have helped in spreading the scent further.Lister, 2007. pp. 102‚Äì103 Examination of preserved calves shows that they were all born during spring and summer, and since modern elephants have gestation periods of 21‚Äì22 months, the mating season probably was from summer to autumn.Lister, 2007. pp. 104‚Äì105 Œ¥15N isotopic analysis of the teeth of \\"Lyuba\\" has demonstrated their prenatal development, and indicates its gestation period was similar to that of a modern elephant, and that it was born in spring. Evidence of several different bone diseases has been found in woolly mammoths. The most common of these was osteoarthritis, found in 2% of specimens. One specimen from Switzerland had several fused vertebrae as a result of this condition. The \\"Yukagir mammoth\\" had suffered from spondylitis in two vertebrae, and osteomyelitis is also known from some specimens. Several specimens have healed bone fractures, showing that the animals had survived these injuries.Lister, 2007. pp. 108‚Äì111 An abnormal number of cervical vertebrae has been found in 33% of specimens from the North Sea region, probably due to inbreeding in a declining population. Parasitic flies and protozoa were identified in the gut of the calf \\"Dima\\".Lister, 2007. p. 87 Distribution and habitat Mounted \\"family group\\" from Tomsk The habitat of the woolly mammoth is known as \\"mammoth steppe\\" or \\"tundra steppe\\". This environment stretched across northern Asia, many parts of Europe, and the northern part of North America during the last ice age. It was similar to the grassy steppes of modern Russia, but the flora was more diverse, abundant, and grew faster. Grasses, sedges, shrubs, and herbaceous plants were present, and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions. This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow, as is popularly believed, since these regions are thought to have been high-pressure areas at the time. The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the woolly rhinoceros, wild horses, and bison.Lister, 2007. pp. 88‚Äì89 A 2014 study concluded that forbs (a group of herbaceous plants) were more important in the steppe-tundra than previously acknowledged, and that it was a primary food source for the ice-age megafauna. Mural depicting a herd walking near the Somme River in France, by Charles R. Knight, 1916 The southernmost woolly mammoth specimen known is from the Shandong province of China, and is 33,000 years old. The southernmost European remains are from the Depression of Granada in Spain and are of roughly the same age. DNA studies have helped determine the phylogeography of the woolly mammoth. A 2008 DNA study showed two distinct groups of woolly mammoths: one that became extinct 45,000 years ago and another one that became extinct 12,000 years ago. The two groups are speculated to be divergent enough to be characterised as subspecies. The group that became extinct earlier stayed in the middle of the high Arctic, while the group with the later extinction had a much wider range. Recent stable isotope studies of Siberian and New World mammoths have shown there were also differences in climatic conditions on either side of the Bering land bridge, with Siberia being more uniformly cold and dry throughout the Late Pleistocene. During the Younger Dryas age, woolly mammoths briefly expanded into north-east Europe, whereafter the mainland populations became extinct. A 2008 genetic study showed that some of the woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia migrated back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there. Relationship with humans Woolly mammoth engraved on ivory, discovered by √âdouard Lartet in 1864 Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths during the Upper Palaeolithic period when the humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Before this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already used mammoth bones for tool-making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, √âdouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.Lister, 2007. pp. 116‚Äì117 Replica of a roughly 26,000-year-old ivory carving depicting a mammoth, Krahuletz-Museum The woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago. Today, more than 500 depictions of woolly mammoths are known, in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia, France, and Spain to engravings and sculptures (termed \\"portable art\\") made from ivory, antler, stone and bone. Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes. The French Rouffignac Cave has the most depictions, 159, and some of the drawings are more than in length. Other notable caves with mammoth depictions are the Chauvet Cave, Les Combarelles Cave, and Font-de-Gaume.Lister, 2007. pp. 118‚Äì125 A depiction in the Cave of El Castillo may instead show Palaeoloxodon, the \\"straight-tusked elephant\\". \\"Portable art\\" can be more accurately dated than cave art since it is found in the same deposits as tools and other ice- age artefacts. The largest collection of portable mammoth art, consisting of 62 depictions on 47 plaques, was found in the 1960s at an excavated open-air camp near G√∂nnersdorf in Germany. A correlation between the number of mammoths depicted and the species that were most often hunted does not seem to exist, since reindeer bones are the most frequently found animal remains at the site. Two spear throwers shaped as woolly mammoths have also been found in France. Some portable mammoth depictions may not have been produced where they were discovered, but could have moved around by ancient trading. =Exploitation= Reconstructed bone hut based on finds in Mezhyrich, exhibited in Japan Woolly mammoth bones were used as construction material for dwellings by both Neanderthals and modern humans during the ice age. More than 70 such dwellings are known, mainly from the Russian Plain. The bases of the huts were circular, and ranged from . The arrangement of dwellings varied, and ranged from apart, depending on location. Large bones were used as foundations for the huts, tusks for the entrances, and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks. Some huts had floors that extended below ground. Some huts included fireplaces, which used bones as fuel, probably because wood was scarce. Some of the bones used for materials may have come from mammoths killed by humans, but the state of the bones, and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age, suggests that they were collected remains of long-dead animals. Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools, furniture, and musical instruments. Large bones, such as shoulder blades, were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial.Lister, 2007. pp. 128‚Äì132 The Venus of Brassempouy, made from woolly mammoth ivory, National Archaeological Museum, France Woolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, including the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiseled, and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and how this was achieved is unknown.Lister, 2007. pp. 131‚Äì137 Several woolly mammoth specimens show evidence of being butchered by humans, which is indicated by breaks, cut marks, and associated stone tools. How much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat is unknown, since many other large herbivores were available. Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans. A Siberian specimen with a spearhead embedded in its shoulder blade shows that a spear had been thrown at it with great force.Lister, 2007. pp. 151‚Äì155 A specimen from the Mousterian age of Italy shows evidence of spear hunting by Neanderthals. The juvenile specimen nicknamed \\"Yuka\\" is the first frozen mammoth with evidence of human interaction. It shows evidence of having been killed by a large predator, and of having been scavenged by humans shortly after. Some of its bones had been removed, and were found nearby. A site near the Yana River in Siberia has revealed several specimens with evidence of human hunting, but the finds were interpreted to show that the animals were not hunted intensively, but perhaps mainly when ivory was needed. Two woolly mammoths from Wisconsin, the \\"Schaefer\\" and \\"Hebior mammoths\\", show evidence of having been butchered by Palaeoamericans. Extinction Map showing climatic suitability for woolly mammoths in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene of Eurasia: red is increasing suitability, green is decreasing suitability. Black points are records of mammoths, black lines are the northern limit of humans Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years ago.Lister, 2007. pp. 146‚Äì148 A small population of woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt. DNA sequencing of remains of two mammoths, one from Siberia 44,800 years BP and one from Wrangel Island 4,300 years BP, indicates two major population crashes: one around 280,000 years ago from which the population recovered, and a second about 12,000 years ago, near the ice age's end, from which it did not. The Wrangel Island mammoths were isolated for 5000 years by rising post- ice-age sea level, and resultant inbreeding in their small population of about 300 to 1000 individuals led to a 20% to 30% loss of heterozygosity, and a 65% loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity. However, the population seems to have subsequently been stable, without suffering further significant loss of genetic diversity. Genetic evidence thus implies the extinction of this final population was sudden, rather than the culmination of a gradual decline. Skull and jaw of the calf \\"Yuka\\", which may have been extracted from the carcass by prehistoric humans Before their extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoths had accumulated numerous genetic defects due to their small population; in particular, a number of genes for olfactory receptors and urinary proteins became nonfunctional, possibly because they had lost their selective value on the island environment. It is not clear whether these genetic changes contributed to their extinction. It has been proposed that these changes are consistent with the concept of genomic meltdown; however, the sudden disappearance of an apparently stable population may be more consistent with a catastrophic event, possibly related to climate (such as icing of the snowpack) or a human hunting expedition. The disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island. The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia (modern Alaska and Yukon) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids (mammoths, gomphotheres, and mastodons), as well as most of the rest of the megafauna, of the Americas. In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out before human arrival because of habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice age sea-level rise, perhaps in large measure as a result of a consequent reduction in the freshwater supply. Changes in climate shrank suitable mammoth habitat from 42,000 years ago to 6,000 years ago. Woolly mammoths survived an even greater loss of habitat at the end of the Saale glaciation 125,000 years ago, and humans likely hunted the remaining populations to extinction at the end of the last glacial period. Studies of an 11,300‚Äì11,000-year-old trackway in south-western Canada showed that M. primigenius was in decline while coexisting with humans, since far fewer tracks of juveniles were identified than would be expected in a normal herd. The decline of the woolly mammoth could have increased temperatures by up to at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Mammoths frequently ate birch trees, creating a grassland habitat. With the disappearance of mammoths, birch forests, which absorb more sunlight than grasslands, expanded, leading to regional warming. Fossil specimens Skull discovered by fishermen in the North Sea (\\"Doggerland\\"), at Celtic and Prehistoric Museum, Ireland Woolly mammoth fossils have been found in many different types of deposits, including former rivers and lakes, and also in \\"Doggerland\\" in the North Sea, which was dry at times during the ice age. Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed \\"elephants' graveyards\\", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found; these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as kettle holes, sink holes, and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time. Apart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a petroleum seep in Starunia, Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle, in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This \\"natural mummification\\" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.Lister, 2007. pp. 50‚Äì53 The presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being swept away by floods. In one location, by the Byoryolyokh River in Yakutia in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been swept there by the current. =Frozen specimens= The \\"Adams mammoth\\" on exhibit in Vienna; skin can be seen on its head and feet. Between 1692 and 1806, only four descriptions of frozen mammoths were published in Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeletons were recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18 kg (40 lb) of hair. During his return voyage, he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed were the ones that Shumachov had sold. Adams brought all to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This was one of the first attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the 20th century. Museum of Zoology, St. Petersburg The 1901 excavation of the \\"Berezovka mammoth\\" is the best documented of the early finds. It was discovered at the Siberian Berezovka River (after a dog had noticed its smell), and the Russian authorities financed its excavation. The entire expedition took 10 months, and the specimen had to be cut to pieces before it could be transported to St. Petersburg. Most of the skin on the head as well as the trunk had been scavenged by predators, and most of the internal organs had rotted away. It was identified as a 35- to 40-year-old male, which had died 35,000 years ago. The animal still had grass between its teeth and on the tongue, showing that it had died suddenly. One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse. It may have died of asphyxiation, as indicated by its erect penis. One third of a replica of the mammoth in the Museum of Zoology of St. Petersburg is covered in skin and hair of the \\"Berezovka mammoth\\". By 1929, the remains of 34 mammoths with frozen soft tissues (skin, flesh, or organs) had been documented. Only four of them were relatively complete. Since then, about that many more have been found. In most cases, the flesh showed signs of decay before its freezing and later desiccation. Since 1860, Russian authorities have offered rewards of up to for finds of frozen woolly mammoth carcasses. Often, such finds were kept secret due to superstition. Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported, and one was fed to dogs. In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \\"Effie\\", which was found in 1948. It consists of the head, trunk, and a fore leg, and is about 25,000 years old.Lister, 2007. pp. 45‚Äì75 \\"Dima\\", a frozen calf about seven months old, during excavation In 1977, the well- preserved carcass of a seven- to eight-month-old woolly mammoth calf named \\"Dima\\" was discovered. This carcass was recovered near a tributary of the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia. This specimen weighed about at death and was high and long. Radiocarbon dating determined that \\"Dima\\" died about 40,000 years ago. Its internal organs are similar to those of modern elephants, but its ears are only one-tenth the size of those of an African elephant of similar age. A less complete juvenile, nicknamed \\"Mascha\\", was found on the Yamal Peninsula in 1988. It was 3‚Äì4 months old, and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death. It is the westernmost frozen mammoth found.Lister, 2007. pp. 57‚Äì58 In 1997, a piece of mammoth tusk was discovered protruding from the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. In 1999, this 20,380-year-old carcass and 25 tons of surrounding sediment were transported by an Mi-26 heavy lift helicopter to an ice cave in Khatanga. The specimen was nicknamed the \\"Jarkov mammoth\\". In October 2000, the careful defrosting operations in this cave began with the use of hair dryers to keep the hair and other soft tissues intact.Mol, D. et al. (2001). \\"The Jarkov Mammoth: 20,000-Year-Old carcass of a Siberian woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius (Blumenbach, 1799)\\". The World of Elephants, Proceedings of the 1st International Congress ( 16‚Äì20 October 2001, Rome): 305‚Äì309. Full text pdf In 2002, a well-preserved carcass was discovered near the Maxunuokha River in northern Yakutia, which was recovered during three excavations. This adult male specimen was called the \\"Yukagir mammoth\\", and is estimated to have lived around 18,560 years ago, and to have been 282.9 cm (9.2 ft) tall at the shoulder, and weighed between 4 and 5 tonnes. It is one of the best-preserved mammoths ever found due to the almost complete head, covered in skin, but without the trunk. Some postcranial remains were also found, some with soft tissue. Frozen calf nicknamed \\"Mascha\\" In 2007, the carcass of a female calf nicknamed \\"Lyuba\\" was discovered near the Yuribey River, where it had been buried for 41,800 years. By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines, they found that the animal had died at the age of one month. The mummified calf weighed , was high and in length. At the time of discovery, its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body. Its organs and skin are very well preserved. \\"Lyuba\\" is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing. After death, its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid, which \\"pickled\\" it, preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state. The frozen calf \\"Yuka\\" In 2012, a juvenile was found in Siberia, which had man-made cut marks. Scientists estimated its age at death to be 2.5 years, and nicknamed it \\"Yuka\\". Its skull and pelvis had been removed prior to discovery, but were found nearby. After being discovered, the skin of \\"Yuka\\" was prepared to produce a taxidermy mount. In 2019, a group of researchers managed to obtain signs of biological activity after transferring nuclei of \\"Yuka\\" into mouse oocytes. Another mammoth discovery was reported in October 2012, when it was excavated on the Taymyr Peninsula. It was dated to 30,000 years old. Formally known as the Sopkarga mammoth, it was nicknamed \\"Zhenya\\" after the boy who found it. In 2013, a well-preserved carcass was found on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 years old at the time of death. The carcass contained well- preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed antifreezing properties. =Revival of the species= Model of an adult, Naturkundemuseum Stuttgart The existence of frozen soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be revived by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue, a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. For example, Akira Iritani, at the Kyoto University in Japan, reportedly planned to do this.Scientists trying to clone, resurrect extinct mammoth . Brad Lendon. CNN News. 17 January 2011. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted in a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth. However, nobody has yet found a viable mammoth cell, and most scientists doubt that any living cell could have survived freezing in the tundra.Can scientists bring mammoths back to life by cloning? Jackson Landers. February 9, 2015. The Washington Post.Bringing them Back to Life . Carl Zimmer, National Geographic. April 2013.Cloning the Mammoth: A Complicated Task or Just a Dream? (PDF), Pasqualino Loi, Joseph Saragusty, and Grazyna Ptak. 2014Shapiro, 2015. p. 11 Because of their conditions of preservation, the DNA of frozen mammoths has deteriorated significantly.Lister, 2007. pp. 42‚Äì43 A second method involves artificially inseminating an elephant egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring would be an elephant‚Äìmammoth hybrid, and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing makes this method unfeasible. Model depicting the calf \\"Dima\\", Stuttgart Several projects are working on gradually replacing the genes in elephant cells with mammoth genes. One such project is that of geneticist George M. ChurchThe Long Now Fouldation ‚Äì Revive and Restore . is attempting to create a mammoth‚Äìelephant hybrid using DNA from frozen mammoth carcasses. According to the researchers, a mammoth cannot be recreated, but they will try to eventually grow a hybrid elephant with some woolly mammoth traits in an \\"artificial womb\\".Reviving woolly mammoth will take more than 2 years . BBC News. Helen Pilcher, 22 February 2017. The team is attempting to study the animals' characteristics in vitro by replacing or editing some specific mammoth genes into Asian elephant skin cells called fibroblasts that have the potential to become embryonic stem cells. By 2015 and using the new CRISPR DNA editing technique, Church's team had some woolly mammoth genes edited into the genome of an Asian elephant; focusing on cold- resistance initially, the target genes are for the external ear size, subcutaneous fat, hemoglobin, and hair attributes. By 2017, Church's team had made 45 substitutions to the elephant genome.

If any method is ever successful, a suggestion has been made to introduce the hybrids to a wildlife reserve in Siberia called the Pleistocene Park. Some biologists question the ethics of such recreation attempts.An Analysis of Potential Ethical Justifications for Mammoth De-extinction And a Call for Empirical Research. Yasha Rohwer and Emma Marris. Ethics, Policy & Environment; Volume 21, 2018; Issue 1; pages: 127-142. In addition to the technical problems, not much habitat is left that would be suitable for elephant-mammoth hybrids. Because both species are [were] social and gregarious, creating a few specimens would not be ideal. The time and resources required would be enormous, and the scientific benefits would be unclear, suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered. The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in hybridisation attempts has also been questioned, as most embryos would not survive, and knowing the exact needs of a hybrid elephant‚Äìmammoth calf would be impossible. Cultural significance A mammoth tusk with Inuit carvings of scenes on the Yukon River, 19th century, De Young Museum The woolly mammoth has remained culturally significant long after its extinction. Indigenous peoples of Siberia had long found what are now known to be woolly mammoth remains, collecting their tusks for the ivory trade. Native Siberians believed woolly mammoth remains to be those of giant mole-like animals that lived underground and died when burrowing to the surface.Newcomb, Raymond Lee (1888). Our lost explorers : the narrative of the Jeannette Arctic Expedition as related by the survivors, and in the records and last journals of Lieutenant De Long . p. 96. (Here the belief is attested among the Khanty people of the Irtysh River basin). Woolly mammoth tusks had been articles of trade in Asia long before Europeans became acquainted with them. G√ºy√ºk, the 13th-century Khan of the Mongols, is reputed to have sat on a throne made from mammoth ivory. Inspired by the Siberian natives' concept of the mammoth as an underground creature, it was recorded in the Chinese pharmaceutical encyclopedia, Ben Cao Gangmu, as yin shu, \\"the hidden rodent\\".. Bertholds's source for the Irtysh Ostyaks' belief is Peter III of Russia carved in mammoth ivory The indigenous peoples of North America also used woolly mammoth ivory and bone for tools and art. As in Siberia, North American natives had \\"myths of observation\\" explaining the remains of woolly mammoths and other elephants; the Bering Strait Inupiat also believed the bones came from burrowing creatures, while other peoples associated them with primordial giants or \\"great beasts\\". {subscription required} Observers have interpreted legends from several Native American peoples as containing folk memory of extinct elephants, though other scholars are sceptical that folk memory could survive such a long time. {subscription required} Siberian mammoth ivory is reported to have been exported to Russia and Europe in the 10th century. The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as \\"white gold\\". Local dealers estimate that 10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 Lausanne Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the Schreger lines are coarser in texture.Lister, 2007. pp. 137‚Äì139 In the 21st century, global warming has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it. La fuite devant le mammouth, Paul Jamin, 1885 Stories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the \\"Berezovka mammoth\\", but most of these are considered dubious. The carcasses were in most cases decayed, and the stench so unbearable that only wild scavengers and the dogs accompanying the finders showed any interest in the flesh. Such meat apparently was once recommended against illness in China, and Siberian natives have occasionally cooked the meat of frozen carcasses they discovered.Lister, 2007. p. 54 According to one of the more famous stories, members of The Explorers Club dined on meat of a frozen mammoth from Alaska in 1951. In 2016, a group of researchers genetically examined a sample of the meal, and found it to belong to a green sea turtle (it had also been claimed to belong to Megatherium). The researchers concluded that the dinner had been a publicity stunt. In 2011, the Chinese palaeontologist Lida Xing livestreamed while eating meat from a Siberian mammoth leg (thoroughly cooked and flavoured with salt), and told his audience it tasted bad and like soil. This triggered controversy and gained mixed reactions, but Xing stated he did it to promote science. =Alleged survival= There have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not extinct and that small, isolated herds might survive in the vast and sparsely inhabited tundra of the Northern Hemisphere. In the 19th century, several reports of \\"large shaggy beasts\\" were passed on to the Russian authorities by Siberian tribesmen, but no scientific proof ever surfaced. A French charg√© d'affaires working in Vladivostok, M. Gallon, said in 1946 that in 1920, he had met a Russian fur-trapper who claimed to have seen living giant, furry \\"elephants\\" deep into the taiga. Due to the large area of Siberia, that woolly mammoths survived into more recent times cannot be completely ruled out, but all evidence indicates that they became extinct thousands of years ago. These natives likely had gained their knowledge of woolly mammoths from carcasses they encountered and that this is the source for their legends of the animal.Lister, 2007. p. 55 In the late 19th century, rumours existed about surviving mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his killing of a mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The museum denied the story. The Swedish writer Bengt Sj√∂gren suggested in 1962 that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if mammoths were still living in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal. Bernard Heuvelmans included the possibility of residual populations of Siberian mammoths in his 1955 book, On The Track Of Unknown Animals; while his book was a systematic investigation into possible unknown species, it became the basis of the cryptozoology movement.

He fell under suspicion because he was a Roman Catholic, and because he had acted as legal adviser to the Jesuits at a time of acute anti-Catholic hysteria. Background and early life He was the third son of William Langhorne, a barrister, and his wife Lettice Needham, of Little Wymondley in Hertfordshire. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in May 1647 and called to the bar in November 1654. He was a Roman Catholic, and provided legal and financial advice for the Jesuits. During the wave of anti-Catholic hysteria which followed the Great Fire of London of 1666, he was briefly arrested but quickly released. His wife, Dorothy Legatt, was a Protestant from Havering in Essex. His sons Charles and Francis were both priests. When, in October 1677, Titus Oates was expelled from the English College at St Omer \\"for serious moral lapses\\", Charles Langhorne entrusted Oates with a letter to his father. Oates returned to St Omer with a letter from Richard thanking the Jesuits for all they had done for his sons. Arrest When Oates and Israel Tonge unleashed their entirely fictitious Popish Plot, a non-existent Catholic conspiracy to kill King Charles II, in September 1678, three Jesuits and a Benedictine were arrested. Following a detailed search of their papers (which failed to uncover any evidence of treason), Langhorne's role as legal adviser to the Jesuits was discovered almost at once: he was arrested a week after the four priests, although there was no evidence in the priests' papers that he had committed any crime. He was imprisoned at Newgate and charged with treason. Oates claimed, and was corroborated by the notorious informer and confidence trickster William Bedloe, that Langhorne's earlier correspondence dealt with the conspiracy to kill the King. Trial and execution He was tried on 14 June 1679.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot, Phoenix Press reissue, 2000, p.185 He was forced to defend himself, as a person charged with treason had no right then to defence counsel (this rule was not changed until the passage of the Treason Act 1695). His main defence consisted of an attack on the character of the Crown's principal witnesses, Oates and Bedloe, but since the judges were well aware of the deplorable past lives of both men, this seems to have made little impression.Kenyon pp.186-7 He also called a number of students from St Omer to prove that Oates had been at the college on the crucial dates when he claimed to be in London, but the public mood was so hostile to Catholics that the witnesses were barely able to make themselves heard over the roar of the crowd, and some of them were assaulted as they left the Court.Kenyon p.187 Ironically, some of the same witnesses appeared for the prosecution at Oates' own trial for perjury in 1685, where the crowd treated them courteously, and the jury was told to weigh their evidence with the greatest seriousness.Kenyon pp.285-6 William Scroggs, the Lord Chief Justice, although violently prejudiced against Catholic priests, was relatively tolerant of Catholic laymen; his summing up was reasonably fair by the standards of the time, and he did warn the jury that on no account should an innocent man's life be taken away.Kenyon p.188 Nonetheles, Langhorne was found guilty of High Treason. As the result of a petition by his wife, a ‚Äòtrue Protestant‚Äô, he received a month's reprieve to tidy the affairs of his clients. Kenyon suggests that the Crown was still hoping that he would confess, and it seems that he was offered a royal pardon if he did so. Langhorne was prepared, presumably with the consent of the Jesuit fathers, to give the Crown a list of all the Jesuit properties in England, (which turned out to be much less extensive than the Crown, misled by Oates's wild exaggeration of the Jesuits' wealth, had expected) but he steadily maintained his innocence.Kenyon p.191 He also wrote a lengthy religious meditation in verse, which was later published. He was executed at Tyburn, London, on 14 July 1679. Public opinion was slowly turning against the Plot, and Langhorne's courageous death made a favourable impression on the watching crowd. Beatification On 15 December 1929, he was beatified by Pope Pius XI.

An image of the Treasury Building is featured on the back of the United States ten-dollar bill. History =Early buildings= NRHP Plaque In the spring of the year 1800, the capital of the United States was preparing to move from the well-established city of Philadelphia to a parcel of tidewater land along the Potomac River. President John Adams issued an Executive Order on May 15 instructing the federal government to move to Washington and to be open for business by June 15, 1800. Arriving in Washington, relocated government employees found only one building completed and ready to be occupied: the Treasury Department building. Of the 131 federal workers who moved to Washington, over half of them (69) were housed in the new Treasury Building, a two-story Federal/Georgian styled red brick building with a basement and attic that had 16 rooms on the first floor and 15 rooms on the second floor. The building was long and wide, flanking the south-east end of the President's House (later renamed the White House), one of four similar structures for the then four executive departments flanking the east (State and Treasury) and west sides (War and Navy) of the executive mansion facing Pennsylvania Avenue. Within six months of occupying the building, a fire broke out on January 20, 1801, nearly destroying the entire structure. The fire started in one of the first floor rooms and burned through to the floor above but was extinguished before any serious structural damage occurred. The building was repaired, yet by 1805 the records of the department were beginning to overwhelm the original building and a new \\"fireproof\\" brick and masonry vault extension was planned for the west side of the Treasury building facing the next-door Presidential residence. The extension of the Treasury building was designed by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and completed in 1806. The first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, never got to see it finished. The fire-proof vault addition designed by Latrobe turned out to be a hardy structure ‚Äì it was the only part of the building that survived the 1814 attack by British troops who burned many of the significant buildings in Washington during the War of 1812. Treasury offices were temporarily relocated to seven buildings along Pennsylvania Avenue between 19th and 20th streets while the Treasury building, other executive departments and President's House (White House) were reconstructed. The reconstruction took until 1817 under President James Monroe to complete. On March 30, 1833, the Treasury Building was once again engulfed in flames. Late in the evening, Richard H. White had set fire to the building hoping to destroy incriminating pension records inside the Treasury Building. Volunteers saved records that could be retrieved (mostly from the Latrobe vault extension which once again largely survived the fire) and the Treasury offices were relocated to a row of buildings on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue, opposite the nearby Willard Hotel. After the fire, architect Robert Mills was asked to prepare a set of drawings of the former brick Federal style Treasury Building recording the design of the building before the fire. =The current building= Image of the construction, showing construction of the front steps. The East Wing When Mills submitted drawings of the destroyed Treasury building along with a report on the need for a more fire-proof building in the future, he also included drawings of what he proposed as a potential new Treasury building. Mills eventually won a design competition and was appointed Architect of Public Buildings by President Andrew Jackson to oversee the design and construction of the Treasury and Patent Office buildings. Construction on the new Treasury building began on September 7, 1836. Disagreements over the Treasury building came to a head less than two years into the construction of the east wing. In January, 1838 a proposal was introduced in Congress to demolish the partially constructed building. The Committee on Public Buildings directed Capitol building architect Thomas U. Walter to inspect and report on the Treasury building. A report on January 29, 1838 by Walter critical of the building design was rebutted by Mills a few weeks later in February. Despite Mills' arguments, a congressional bill was brought to the floor and voted on with the recommendation to demolish the Treasury building and use the stone for a replacement Post Office building. The bill was narrowly defeated 94-91 and work on the Treasury building was allowed to continue. The Mills wings of the current Treasury building (east and center sections) were finally completed in 1842. The massive, 350' long Greek inspired Ionic colonnade facing 15th street is the most striking feature of Mills design. By 1844, the tan sandstone exterior, including the colonnade, was painted white to protect the integrity of the stone (the same stone and painting thereof was used at the \\"White\\" House as well). While Mills had always envisioned additional wings added to the Treasury building beginning with a south wing extension, in 1851, he was removed from his Treasury position before any design or construction of the south wing had begun. The South Wing Extension By the early 1850s there was a growing need to increase the size of the Treasury building. Mills revised his earlier design and submitted a plan to Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin. Controversy followed Mills yet again and Thomas U. Walter was brought in to critique the Mills plan and eventually provided two design drawings of his own. Walter's drawings for the first time showed a west wing of the Treasury building on the site of former Greenhouses for the White House that would eventually create a closed rectangular shaped Classical Revival styled stone building with Mills center wing bisecting the rectangle and creating two enclosed courtyards. Ultimately Walters design was chosen and in 1851, Robert Mills was released from his architectural position at the Treasury Department. In 1853 Ammi B. Young was named the Supervising Architect in the Office of Construction at the Treasury Department. Key among his responsibilities was to merge the design approaches previously prepared for the addition of a south wing to the Treasury building extending over the site of the old State Department offices. One of the most important revisions was the acceptance of the need to expand the Treasury building with both simultaneously a south and west wings. The inclusion of the later west wing in the design and planning created an opportunity for economies of scale by reducing costs for manpower and building materials. In 1855 ground was broken to start excavating for the South Wing foundation after the razing of the old State Department. By 1857 construction of the south wing had progressed up to the second-floor level and excavations for the west wing foundations had begun. Progress on the Treasury building came to a halt in 1858 with the country falling into a recession after the financial Panic of 1857. Construction on all federal buildings was stopped due to a lack of funding appropriations from Congress. Before the stoppage, the construction of the south wing had completed setting in place over 45 monolithic stone columns and pilasters, some weighing as much as 33 tons each. But economic challenges were not the only events that disrupted the construction of the south and west wings of the Treasury building. By 1860 it appeared almost certain that the country was headed towards a military conflict between the states. Following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, new President Andrew Johnson relocated the presidential offices temporarily to the Treasury building, while the Lincoln family was vacating the White House. =Artistic elements= Sculpture Statue of Alexander Hamilton Sculptor James Earle Fraser created the statue of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, which stands in front of the southern facade facing Alexander Hamilton Place and The Ellipse beyond, and that of Albert Gallatin, the fourth and longest serving Secretary, which stands before the northern entrance facing Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.U.S. Department of the Treasury - Fact Sheets: Treasury Building accessed 26 April 2014 References Category:Government buildings completed in 1842 Category:Buildings of the United States government in Washington, D.C.

Threatened with total blindness, he interrupted a distinguished stage career and went to Hawaii to rest. In the South Seas he found a new career as an explorer and ethnologist. He secured a roving commission from the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, the leading museum in the world in Polynesian research, to make miniatures and gather artifacts of various Polynesian Islands and spent fourteen years traveling from island to island. During this time, Schenck also contributed to the National Geographic and other magazines. Returning to his homeland after twenty years of wandering, Schenck won success in still another field as a lecturer on the South Seas and, during the war, served the U.S. Navy Department in planning bases in the Southwest Pacific. For nine months, he also worked with the U.S. Maritime Commission as a government speaker in shipyards and factories to speed up production.

He was one of the most famous architects in the world during the 1970s. He was born in Madrid. He graduated as an architect from the Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid in 1959. His work is recognized worldwide as an original and interesting union of constructivist, rationalist and organic architecture. Higueras was also a musician, a painter and photographer. He died in Madrid, at the age of 77. Higueras' architecture displays a constructive adaptation to the natural and physical environment. His understanding of architecture came from popular contemporary approaches, and his spectacular but simple structural solutions, such as vaults, have been influential. His work appears at MOMA in New York. Higueras' significant works include: the Spanish Pavilion located in New York City (1963), a multi-purpose building for Montecarlo (1969), the La Macarrona Residence in Somosaguas, Madrid (1971-1976), the Fierro House in Marbella (1971), the Castellana at number 266 Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid and Sede del Instituto del Patrimonio Hist√≥rico Espa√±ol.

In the 1950s, Reverend Father Fr. Patrick Peyton, CSC came to the Philippines upon the invitation of the Dominican Fathers, or Order of Preachers, to conduct and speak on his worldwide efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary all over the world. Father Peyton was warmly welcomed in the Philippines and from thereon, his mission has grown and expanded all over the country. Father Peyton died in 1992, but his mission in the Philippines continues to date with programs airing in various radio and television networks. History =Distant collaborations= The promotion of the Family Rosary through the use of mass media was intensely pursued by Father Peyton in the United States in the late 1940s, viewed by many as an important step of healing families whose loved ones were lost in the intense fighting during the Second World War. In 1947, Father Peyton with the volunteer help from Hollywood's named stars, dramatizations of family life centered on praying the Rosary were being aired on the United States radio network, Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1947, a Jesuit priest, Rev. Father James B. Reuter, SJ who was in the United States submitted a radio drama play to Father Peyton and was used on the \\"Family Theater\\" programs that was aired on Mutual Broadcasting System. Father Reuter, a priest who was assigned to the Philippines before the Second World War and was among those severely treated while in Japanese prison camp returned to Manila in 1948. Father Reuter launched a Philippine version of the \\"Family Theater\\" on radio station KZPI (now known as DWIZ) with named Filipino actors and actresses voicing the radio drama scripts that Father Peyton used in the United States. The program would air every Sunday evening when every family member was at home. With the advent of television in the Philippines, \\"Family Theater\\" on television were among the first programs that aired on the country's first television station, DZAQ owned by the Alto Broadcasting System, co-owned by a retired American war veteran communications engineer James Lindenberg and Antonio Quirino, brother of the incumbent Philippine president of that time, Elpidio Quirino. Father Peyton first got to visit the Philippines in 1953, a few years since his mission was introduced to the Philippines by Father Reuter, his efforts to promote the praying of the Family Rosary have started to take roots in the Philippines and by the time he even started some of his famous Rosary rallies in the country, Father Peyton was already a household name in radio and television. In the 1960s, Eugenio Lopez's Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) acquired Alto Broadcasting System to establish what would be the most important television network in the Philippines all throughout the 1960s. ABS- CBN brought in \\"Family Theater\\" into its prime time programming in the 1960s. Named Filipino actors and actresses including unknown ones who would later become entertainment icons worked with Father Reuter's \\"Family Theater\\" productions for free. At first \\"Family Theater\\" was airing for free on Channel 3 (later Channel 2 in 1969) of ABS-CBN but later the group was asked to bring advertising into the network, and when the call was made, people continued to donate to keep the program airing. Filipino named celebrities Vic Diaz, Celia Diaz-Laurel, Barbara Perez, Vic Silayan, Pancho Magalona, Tita Duran, Jaime Zobel de Ayala, Zenaida Amador, Baby Barredo, Noel Trinidad, Subas Herrero, Robert Arevalo, Cristina Ponce-Enrile, Patsy Monzon were among those who appeared on Family Theater. Jaime Zobel de Ayala would later become chairman of a Filipino banking, real estate and telecommunications holding company, Ayala group. Zeneida Amador and Baby Barredo would later establish the country's highly respected theater group, Repertory Philippines. =The Blanket of Darkness= Scene from Family Theater in the Philippines with a young Filipino business industrialist Jaime Zobel de Ayala as lead actor. In 1972, Former President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law and all forms of media were silenced. ABS-CBN was shut down under the Marcos regime and all \\"Family Theater\\" programs both on television and radio ceased to broadcast. On December 8, 1985, Father Peyton led a very successful Marian Rally at Rizal Park. Amidst the political turmoil affecting the country at that time, the call to prayer and world peace brought more than a million Filipinos before the Quirino Grandstand. The rally, with the support of Cardinal Jaime Sin, consecrated the Philippines to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Filipinos were incensed with prayers and strengthened faith, later to serve as the inspiration to peacefully overthrow the Marcos dictatorship two months later. In 1985, months before the Marian Rally, Father Peyton would kindly seek permission to promote the scheduled rally on various media outlets in the Philippines who were all subject to censorship or were under the control of Marcos cronies. Father Peyton would finally appear on the government television station, Maharlika Broadcasting System Channel 4 for a series of talks on the Marian Rally and the importance of prayers. This television appearance would later result in the newer incarnation of Father Peyton's mission in Philippine broadcast history a year later. With the peaceful overthrow of Marcos in 1986, with a renewed faith spreading like wildfire in the Philippines, seeing millions of Filipinos muzzling the guns of soldiers loyal to Marcos by flowers and Rosaries and with a new president, Corazon Aquino leading a nation in praying the Rosary, the mission of Father Peyton started to bloom again in the Philippines. When ABS-CBN reopened after six months, Father Reuter revived \\"Family Theater\\" under a new title \\"Ang Pamilya Ko,\\" (My Family) but it would only run on ABS-CBN for thirteen weeks until it was canceled. =From drama to magazine talk show= With democracy restored in the Philippines and there was an intense feel of faith in the air, Father Peyton saw the possibilities of developing a different type of program for the Philippines. After the poor reception to the timely wholesome family-centered drama program \\"Ang Pamilya Ko\\" on ABS-CBN, Father Peyton started launching his one-hour once a week magazine talk show program. \\"Family Rosary Crusade,\\" was premiered on March 7, 1987 for the relaunch of ABS-CBN as The Star Network (now Kapamilya Network). Every Saturday morning, Father Peyton would be on ABS-CBN to start the program with the praying of the Rosary. He would be later joined by a long-time advertising practitioner, Rosita \\"Babs\\" Hontiveros or \\"Tita Babs\\" (Auntie Babs) as the co-host. For almost five years, the program continued to air until the death of Father Peyton in June 1992. =FRC after the death of Father Peyton= Despite the death of Father Peyton in 1992, the weekly television program \\"Family Rosary Crusade,\\" continues to air on ABS-CBN with Babs Hontiveros as main host with Father James Reuter, SJ. Behind the scenes, a group of media volunteers continue to lend a hand in continuing with the mission of Father Peyton, utilizing mass media as a handy tool for evangelization and the promotion of the praying of the Family Rosary. Family Rosary Crusade was being run by Gennie Q. Jota who served as Executive Director and ably recruited volunteers to write, contribute almost anything to keep the program running. Veteran sound engineer, Beda Orquejo who was met by Father Peyton at the old government television network under Marcos' time left his regular work with the network to serve as all-around technical person. Orquejo would serve as director, cameraman and editor of the weekly episodes of Family Rosary Crusade. Several television networks also sought programs of Family Rosary Crusade, aired for with free airtime and without advertisements. From 1992 up to 2002, Family Rosary Crusade had almost 40 hours of free airtime to fill for television networks like People's Television (PTV), Radio Philippines Network (RPN), Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), Rajah Broadcasting (RJTV). Family Rosary Crusade's locally produced programs and a library of films produced by Family Theater in the United States aired throughout this period. In 1992, the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC) resumed its broadcast operations after it was shut down by martial law in 1972. The television network became a semi-official carrier for Family Rosary Crusade. The network utilized as part of its station identification at the top of every hour a plug wherein the Blessed Virgin Mary speaking before Filipinos appealing to pray the Rosary and with the closing standard slogan, \\"The family that prays together stays together.\\" The plug ran on ABC from the reopening to the relaunching as Iba Tayo in 2004 after businessman Tonyboy Cojuangco purchased the network. With more airtime, means more original programs to produce and this called in for more volunteers. Mrs. Jota and Beda Orquejo recruited several personalities to appear on Family Rosary Crusade. Dominican priest Father Larry Faraon, OP joined Family Rosary Crusade as a younger voice for inspiration for the younger audience. Younger hosts would join Father Larry, Loudette Zaragosa Banson who appeared on Father Reuter's drama programs will be joined by radio drama personality Bernard Factor-Ca√±aberal as the two main hosts of the magazine talk show Family Rosary Crusade. Inspirational motivator Claudine Zialcita would later join the three other hosts to become the news reader for a segment called, \\"Religious Update.\\" Father James Reuter, SJ will have his own daily program on ABC called, \\"Three Minutes a Day\\" that aired at 3:00 pm for three minutes. Father Reuter would reflect on the day's Gospel reading. When ABS-CBN launched a sister station Studio 23 in 1996, the program aired in every weekday morning for 30 minutes just before the simulcast of MTV Asia and later Myx. ABS-CBN's flagship Channel 2 would continue to air it until 2003 when Studio 23 continues to air the program, airing at 7:00 am every Sunday. The program continues with its magazine type programming with talks and discussions related to themes of the Catholic Church with sole host Bernard Ca√±aberal and supported by Claudine Zialcita, Ces Datu and guest priest Gospel homilist. In March 2010, Family Rosary Crusade gets a new National Director, a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross from the South Asia province, Reverend Father Roque D'Acosta, CSC, formerly a Spiritual Director for the FRC for two years. The Family Rosary Crusade also left its 50-year office in Pope Pius XII Catholic Center in the Archdiocese of Manila and moved to a formation house/television studio in Loyola Heights, Quezon City within the recently created Diocese of Cubao. The new office serves as its studios and production facilities and formation house for future members of the mission of the Congregation of Holy Cross in the Philippines. On January 19, 2014, after Studio 23 reformatted as S+A, Family Rosary Crusade continues to air every Saturday Morning at 5:00 AM. On November 17, 2018, Family Rosary Crusade aired its last episode on National TV. Due to S+A's daily sports programs, Family Rosary Crusade was no longer to air their episodes and lost its go signal to air. But they are still premiering their episodes through social media on Facebook and YouTube. However, it can be seen on TV Maria and airs the re-runs of the show. Current programming On the 21st anniversary of the program incarnation of Family Rosary Crusade on television, long-time guest host Rev. Fr.

Etymology The name of the river is attested as latinized Sabrina in the 2nd century. The reconstructed British form is *sabrinƒÅ. The modern Welsh form is Hafren, Habren. Milton adopted the legend in his Comus (1634), using the Latin form Sabrina. Fletcher refers to the legend in The Faithful Shepherdess (1608). The name was not used in Britain, with the singular exception of Sabrina Sidney (1757‚Äì1843), an English foundling girl, named for her orphanage overlooking River Severn, prior to the 19th century, and then very rarely. Its popularity rose, at first in the United States, in the wake of the film Sabrina (1954), a romantic drama-comedy where the protagonist Sabrina Fairchild was played by Audrey Hepburn. Welsh legend According to a legend recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century, Habren was the daughter of a king named Locrinus (also known as Locrin or Locrine in English) by his mistress, the Germanic princess Estrildis. Locrinus ruled England after the death of his father, Brutus of Troy, the legendary second founder of Britain. Locrinus cast aside his wife, Guendolen, and their son Maddan and acknowledged Sabrina and her mother, but the enraged Guendolen raised an army against him and defeated Locrinus in battle. Guendolen then ordered that Sabrina and her mother be drowned in the river. The river was named after Sabrina so Locrine's betrayal of Guendolen would never be forgotten.The Legend of Sabrina According to legend, Sabrina lives in the river, which reflects her mood. She rides in a chariot and dolphins and salmon swim alongside her.Tidal Bore Research Society The later story suggests that the legend of Sabrina could have become intermingled with old stories of a river goddess or nymph.Liam Rogers (1999), Sabrina and the River Severn Popularity The name gained popularity following the release of the film Sabrina (1954), based on Samuel Taylor's Sabrina Fair (1953). It was the 789th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 1954, and rose to the 245th most popular name in 1955.United States Social Security Administration Dunkling (1983) notes that \\"[i]n the U.S. Sabrina has tended to displace Sabina since [the 1950s].\\" Its use has continued, boosted by the popularity of the comic book character Sabrina the Teenage Witch, who debuted in 1962. It had peaks in popularity in 1970 (rank 107) and 1977 (rank 63). A television series featured the character in 1996, resulting in a renewed peak in 1997 (rank 53). The name was ranked as the 427th most popular name for U.S.-born girls in 2018. The name peaked in popularity in France in 1979-1981 (rank 8) and in Italy in 2001 (rank 35).

It was divided into two commotes, Is Mynydd and Uwch Mynydd, separated by the chain of hills above Aberedw. In the late medieval period, it was a marcher lordship. However, after the Laws in Wales Act of 1535, it was one of the territorial units which went to make up the county of Radnorshire in 1536 (the others were Gwrtheyrnion, Maelienydd and Llythyfnwg, the latter being known in English as the lordship of Radnor). Ferlix =Early History= According to historic manuscripts, the region between Wye and Severn was once regarded as a unit. Manuscripts use various alternative spellings for this, such as Ferlix, Fferllys, Fferleg, and Fferreg; in his Hanes Cymru, the historian John Davies argued, based on these alternatives, that it was probably named Fferyllwg, and that the name may refer to ironworkers (Fferyll in Welsh). Welsh tradition (as reported for example by the 1844 Topographical Dictionary of Wales), claims that Ferlix was part of the realm of King Caradoc (more usually associated with Gwent), but on his death, the realm was divided between his sons; Cawdraf received Ferlix, while Meurig, received the rest of the realm, as Gwent. In any case, manuscripts give Tangwydd ap Tegid, an 8th-century ruler of Ferlix, the following pedigree: *Cawrdaf ap Caradoc *Caw ap Cawrdaf *Gloyw ap Caw *Hoyw ap Gloyw *Cynfarch ap Hoyw *Cyndegg ap Cynfarch *Teithwalch ap Cyndegg *Tegid ap Teithwalch *Tangwydd ap Tegid Welsh annals claim that during the reign of Tangwydd's father, Tegid, the Mercians seized parts of Ferlix, by constructing Offa's Dyke through it. For unclear reasons, Tangwydd also became ruler of Brycheiniog, which lay adjacent to Ferlix; Elisse ap Rhain, the previous king of Brycheiniog, only had daughters, so it is possible that Tangwydd obtained Brycheiniog by marriage. Hwgan, Tangwydd's son and successor, attempted to invade Mercia, while King Edward the Elder was distracted by the Viking invasion; Hwgan, however, hadn't reckoned with Edward's sister, √Üthelfl√¶d, who lead an army against him. √Üthelfl√¶d defeated Hwgan, in battle, then invaded his lands, captured Hwgan's castle (in Brycheiniog). and took his wife prisonerTogographical History of Wales, Brecknockshire. Hwgan decided to form an alliance with the Vikings, but died soon after. Hwgan's son, Dryffin succeeded him, but Elystan Glodrydd, god-son (and namesake) of King Athelstan, conquered Ferlix; Dryffin and his heirs would now only rule Brycheiniog. Elystan added Ferlix to his existing realm of Buellt. He was succeeded by his son, Cadwgan, who was succeeded by his eldest son, Idnerth; a younger son gave rise to the Cadogan family, who were raised to the nobility many centuries later. =Emergence of Norman magnates= Due to their allegiances to the Saxon Kings, once the Normans invaded England, many Welsh princes had assisted anti-Norman revolts like that of Eadric the Wild. Hence, in 1080, when a revolt broke out in Northern England, the Normans pre-emptively occupied Wales, to prevent any further Welsh assistance to the Saxons. In turn, this led to a Welsh revolt in 1094, but by the end of the century it was successfully suppressed by a number of Norman magnates; most Welsh princes then came (individually) to an agreement with the Normans, and were restored to their lands. Philip de Braose had conquered the region between Wye and SevernLloyd, pp. 402‚Äì405., and although most of Ferlix was returned to Idnerth, Braose kept Buellt and a small region around New Radnor for himself. Braose built Castles in these lands, ensuring that any further revolt would be difficult. This established a Marcher Lordship, outside of either English or Welsh law. Phillip held the Lordship for the rest of his life, and it was inherited by his sonLloyd, p. 436, 547. Idnerth's remaining lands were inherited by his son, Madog. In 1130, for unclear reasons, the Sheriff of Hereford, Pain fitzJohn, built an eponymous castle in southern Ferlix, not far from the Herefordshire border. In 1135, Pain's Castle was acquired by Madog; Pain was an opponent of Empress Matilda, the legitimate heir of King Henry, Henry had just died, and Pain may have been seeking an allegiance. Independence Madog died in 1140, and the realm was divided between his sons. In 1142, when the opposition to Matilda lead to the Anarchy, Hugh de Mortimer invaded northern Ferlix. killing Hywel and Cadwgan, sons of Madog, in the process. In 1146 he moved further south, and in the process of capturing Pain's Castle, killed Maredudd, another of Madog's sons. In 1155, Matilda's son, Henry became King, and was able to force Hugh to surrender his Welsh castles. The two remaining sons of Madog re-divided Ferlix between them; Einion Clud received the southern half (including Radnor), which became Elfael, while his brother Cadwallon ruled the northern half, which became Maeliennydd. Nevertheless, the brothers were hostile to one another, coveting each other's lands. In 1160 Cadwallon invaded Elfael, captured Einion Clud, and sent him as a prisoner to King Henry; Einion Clud escaped (or was released), and re-took his lands. However, when Hugh de Mortimer died, his son Roger arranged for Eilion Clud to be ambushed, and killed. In 1179 he killed Cadwallon as well. By now, New Radnor had been inherited by the patrilineal grandson of Philip de Braose, William de Braose. When William's other grandfather, Henry FitzMiles, was murdered, he undertook a notorious act of revenge - inviting the alleged murderer and other Welsh dignitaries to Abergavenny Castle for reconciliation, he had them all killed in the hall. This set off anti-Norman attacks on a number of local castles, including New Radnor, which was captured by Einion o'r Porth, the son of Einion Clud who had now succeeded him. Einion o'r Porth married a daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd, prince of Deheubarth, and evidently invited Rhys to Radnor Castle. In early March 1188, Gerald of Wales visited Ferlix with Baldwin, the Archbishop of Canterbury, seeking soldiers for the Third Crusade; they met Einion at Radnor Castle, and convinced him to take the cross (i.e. join the crusade), like his cousin Maelgwn (ruler of Maelienydd) did afterwards at his castle of Crug Eryr (described by Gerald as 'Cruker').Gerald of Wales (Geraldus Cambrensis) :- The Itinerary through Wales, Book 1, Chapter 1 - Journey through Hereford & Radnor Eineon rising up, said to Rhys, whose daughter he had married, \\"My father and lord! with your permission I hasten to revenge the injury offered to the great father of all.\\" Upon his return from the crusade, Einion o'r Porth was murdered by his own brother, Gwalter, who then seized power in Elfael. William de Braose subsequently conquered Elfael, deposing Gwalter, and recapturing New Radnor and Pain's Castle. In 1196, Prince Rhys, grandfather of Anarawd, Einion's son and heir, attempted to re-capture Pain's Castle, but failed. When Rhys died soon after, Rhys had been the most powerful Welsh prince, and now Gwenwynwyn ap Owain, the prince of Powys Wenwynwyn, sought to become the most dominant; in 1198 he attacked Pain's Castle. Pain's Castle was defended by William's wife Maud (aka. Matilda) until it was relieved by Geoffrey fitz Peter. On 12 August 1198 Anarawd became one of the thousands of Welsh soldiers killed in the fightingBrut y Tywysogyon (The Chronicle of the Princes), Peniarth MS. 20 version edited by Thomas Jones (published by the University of Wales Press, 1952) Anarawd left a son, Llywelyn ab Anarawd, who was recorded as granting some of his remaining lands in Elfael to the Abbey of Cwm Hir, which had been founded by his family. Llywelyn's daughter Annes married her cousin Adda ap Madog, a patrilineal descendant of Maelgwn (of Maelienydd), via his son MareduddPeter C. Bartrum, Welsh Genealogies AD 300-1500: page 388 'Elystan Glodrydd 35'; Adda would eventually be the last of his family to own any part of Ferlix - in his case, Ceri.D. Stephenson: The Lordship of Ceri in the Thirteenth Century, Montgomeryshire Collections 95 (2007), pages 23-31 Meanwhile, in the anti-monarchial events leading up to Magna Carta, William's and Maud's son, Reginald de Braose formed an alliance with Llywelyn Fawr, the prince of Gwynedd; consequently, in 1215, he returned Elfael to Iorwerth Clud, another of Gwalter's brothers. Iorwerth died soon after, and Gwalter seized Elfael. When Gwalter died in about 1222, he was succeeded by his nephew, Owain ap Maredudd. Marcher Lordship Following the repudiation of the Treaty of Gwerneigron by the Gwyneddian prince, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, Elfael appears to have been caught up in the conflict, as Elfael Is Mynydd came to be occupied by various Norman families soon after. In 1231, Pain's Castle was captured by Ralph Tosny, and rebuilt in stone. Althouogh this was officially settled by the Treaty of Woodstock, King Henry's authority over his barons was in the process of gradual collapse, and the settlement could not be enforced immediately. In 1264, Pain's Castle was captured by the forces of Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who now ruled Gwynedd, and in 1267 a formal complaint was sent to king Henry about the continued de Clare occupation of Elfael Is Mynydd. In 1275, Llywelyn married Eleanor de Montfort, the daughter of Henry's greatest enemy. The new King, Henry's son Edward, consequently declared Llywelyn a rebel, and in 1277 attacked Gwynedd with an enormous army. Llywelyn was forced to agree to the Treaty of Aberconwy, limiting his authority to Gwynedd alone. The Marcher Lordship of Radnor was given to Llywelyn's cousin, the maternal grandson of Llywelyn Fawr, who just happened to be William de Braose, Reginald's son. Roger Tosny's son, Ralph, was given the rest of Elfael, including Pain's Castle, as a distinct Marcher Lordship. The lordship descended in the Tosny family, until it was inherited by Alice de Tosny, in 1309R. R. Davies, The Age of Conquest: Wales 1063-1415 (Oxford University Press, 2000 edition), p. 469.. Alice married Roger Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Bletso; consequently it was eventually inherited by King Henry VII, maternal grandson of Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso. Maelienydd and Radnor had already been inherited by his wife, Elizabeth of York, due to her descent from Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. Ferlix was thus reunited when these lands were inherited by Henry VIII; following his Laws in Wales Acts, it became the main part of Radnorshire.

Haralds saga Sigur√∞arsonar is an Old Icelandic king's saga focusing on the career of King Haraldr Sigur√∞arson of Norway (popularly referred to in English as Harald Hardrada). The title Haralds saga Sigur√∞arsonar usually refers specifically to the account of Haraldr given in the collection of kings' sagas known as Heimskringla and attributed to Snorri Sturluson (1178/79‚Äì1241), though a substantially similar account is given in one of Snorri's main sources, the collection Morkinskinna, which seems to have given the title Saga Magn√∫s g√≥√∞a ok Haralds har√∞r√°√∞a to the equivalent section. In the estimation of Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 'while √ìl√°fs saga helga dominates Heimskringla as a whole, Haralds saga Sigur√∞arsonar achieves this status over the sagas of its final third, by virtue both of its length and of the compelling character of Haraldr himself'.Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15), vol 3 (p. x). Summary Although the saga contains no Common Era dates, its chronology is fairly precise, allowing putative CE dates to be assigned to the events, as here.Based on King Harald's Saga: Harald Hardradi of Norway, from Snorri Sturluson's 'Heimskringla', trans. by Magnus Magnusson and Hermann P√°lsson (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966), pp. 180-81. Although in chapter 99 of Haralds saga, Heimskringla says that there are no tales of Haraldr before he was 15, Haraldr Sigur√∞arson is first mentioned in Heimskringla during √ìl√°fs saga helga: in chapter 76, the infant Haraldr shows his fearlessness to King √ìl√°fr, pulling at his moustache; plays with floating pieces of wood, pretending they are his warfleet; and expresses his domineering enthusiasm for having many warriors. In chapter 209, the fifteen- year-old Haraldr insists on fighting at the Battle of Stiklarsta√∞ir.King Harald's Saga: Harald Hardradi of Norway, from Snorri Sturluson's 'Heimskringla', trans. by Magnus Magnusson and Hermann P√°lsson (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966), pp. 30-31. Haralds saga itself begins in medias res with Haraldr's escape from the Battle of Stiklarsta√∞ir (ch. 1; 1030). Haraldr proceeds to the court of King Jaroslav I of Kiev (ch. 2; 1031) before entering the military service of Empress Zo√´ Porphyrogenita of Byzantium (chs 3-15; c. 1035-44). The saga describes his military exploits in Sicily (chs 6-11; c. 1038-41) and North Africa, his conquest of Palestine and pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and escape from the unwanted advances of the Empress. Meanwhile, his nephew, Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson g√≥√∞i becomes king of Norway (ch 13; 1035). Having left Byzantium, Haraldr sails through the Black Sea to Novgorod (ch. 16), married Jaroslav's daughter Ellisif (ch. 17), gathers forces in Sweden (ch. 18; 1045), and, in alliance with Sveinn √ölfsson, invades Denmark and Norway (chs 19-20; 1046). Haraldr and Magn√∫s make peace and share Norway, albeit tensely, until Magn√∫s's death from sickness (chs 21-30; 1046-47), after which Haraldr is Norway's sole king. Meanwhile, Sveinn establishes himself as king of Denmark (chs 26, 31; 1047). Haraldr and Sveinn vie for the rule of Denmark until finally making peace (ch 71; 1064). During this period, Haraldr takes a second wife, √û√≥ra √ûorbergsd√≥ttir, with whom he has the sons Magn√∫s and √ìl√°fr (ch 33; 1048). After the peace treaty with Denmark, Haraldr campaigns in Upland (chs 72-74; 1065). Chapters 75-77 describe the development of the succession crisis in England following the death of Edward the Confessor and the accession of Harold Godwinson (1064-66). Harold's brother Tostig Godwinson seeks the support of the Danish king Sveinn in invading England (ch. 78), and then Haraldr (ch. 79). Haraldr agrees, campaigns in Yorkshire, but dies at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (chs 80-94; 1066). William the Bastard invades and conquers England (chs 95-97; 1066). Haraldr's son Magn√∫s becomes king of Norway, coming to share the kingdom with his brother √ìl√°fr until his death (chs 98-101; 1066-69). The closing chapters include a eulogy and evaluation of Haraldr (chs 99-100). The saga includes 92 stanzas of skaldic verse, some attributed to Haraldr himself.http://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/db.php?id=142&if;=default&table;=text. Sources The main source for Haralds saga is the relevant sections of the earlier Icelandic kings' saga Morkinskinna, but because that does not survive in an early form, it is hard to be certain how far the differences between Morkinskinna and Haralds saga are due to Snorri's revisions and how far they are due to later changes to Morkinskinna. In particular, Morkinskinna contains many more √æ√¶ttir giving anecdotes about Haraldr, among them the famous Au√∞unar √æ√°ttr vestfirzka. Twentieth-century research assumed that these had generally been added later in the transmission of Morkinskinna, but twenty-first-century research suggests rather that they may have been original, and that Snorri tended to remove such material. Chapters 39‚Äì72, however, are more similar to H√°konar saga √çvarssonar, and most research suggests that Haralds saga is based on that for this section, but the reverse has also been suggested: that H√°konar saga drew on Haralds saga. Snorri drew additionally on his knowledge of orally transmitted skaldic verse and anecdotes.Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15), vol 3 (pp. xi-xiii). Historical reliability The outlines of Haralds saga are independently verified by (near-)contemporary accounts, principally the Byzantine Strategikon of Kekaumenos, Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, and various accounts of the Norman Conquest of England, principally the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Sverrir Jakobsson, 'The Early Kings of Norway, the Issue of Agnatic Succession, and the Settlement of Iceland', Viator, 47 (2016), 171-88 (pp. 4-6 in open-access text); . Snorri seems to have attempted to portray Norwegian royalty in a more positive light than his written sources.King Harald's Saga: Harald Hardradi of Norway, from Snorri Sturluson's 'Heimskringla', trans. by Magnus Magnusson and Hermann P√°lsson (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966), p. 36.Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla, trans. by Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes, 3 vols (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-15), vol 3 (p. xii).

He was a member of the Presidential anti- drug task force in South Florida.  Biography  Ariel Rios was born in New York City to Puerto Rican parents. He graduated from William Howard Taft High School in February 1972, and immediately enrolled in John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and received his B.S. in Criminal Justice in 1976. He married his high school sweetheart, Elsie Morales, immediately upon graduation. Rios started working as a guard with the Washington, D.C., and New York City Department of Corrections; he worked his way up to the Internal Affairs Unit. He then joined the ATF and took the oath of office on December 3, 1978. He completed his formal training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, in 1979. After training, he was assigned to the New Haven office on June 3, 1979.  Undercover operation  On December 2, 1982, as part of the Presidential anti-drug task force in South Florida, Special Agent Rios and his partner, Alexander D'Atri, were sent into a \\"buy and bust\\" undercover operation to negotiate a large cocaine deal from suspected drug traffickers. The meeting took place at the Hurricane Motel on West Flagler Street, Miami. The operation was going well until one of the suspects, standing by the window, noticed other agents closing in. When he pulled a gun, Rios moved forward in an attempt to disarm the man and save his fellow agents. While struggling with the drug dealer, he was shot in the face and died on the scene; his partner was seriously wounded. Rios was survived by his wife and two children. He was buried in Jayuya, Puerto Rico, a beautiful mountain village where Rios had once told his father he could rest forever. Citizens of Miami donated $23,000 to the Ariel Rios Memorial Fund. President Ronald Reagan invited the Rios and D'Atri families to the White House for a special tribute. The Secretary of the Treasury presented medals to Elsie Rios and Alexander D'Atri.  Court sentencing  On April 20, 1983, the district court sentenced Augustin D. Alvarez and Mario C. Simon to life plus 50 years in federal prison, for the first-degree murder of the federal agent Ariel Rios and assault against federal officer Alexander D'Atri, cocaine conspiracy and distribution of cocaine, and using of a firearm during the commission of a felony; Oscar Hernandez to 30 years in prison; Victoriano Concepcion to 25 years in prison; and Eduardo Portal to 22 years in prison. Two other men were sentenced for lesser charges.  Legacy  On February 5, 1985, the block-long federal building at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., that used to house the ATF Headquarters was renamed the Ariel Rios Federal Building in his honor. It now houses the United States Environmental Protection Agency headquarters.

These bikes represent the end of the era of big British singles, as when AMC merged with Norton production concentrated on twins. Development The AJS Model 18 was developed from a design from the 1930s, despite which it was still being manufactured 30 years later. The AJS was updated when a springer frame rear suspension was made available for 1949, to become the Model 18S. The suspension was a vast improvement on the rigid rear end - which had given a bouncy ride. Each of the two 'Candlestick' shocks held only 50 cc of SAE 20 weight oil. They were prone to leaks and were replaced by the larger diameter 'Jampot' shocks on the 1951 version. Engine The engine was released just postwar with a compression ratio of 5.9:1, necessary because of the low quality fuel available in Britain immediately after the War. British singles were designed to make the best of the fuel available. Post war petrol rationing continued until 1950 and it was several years before performance fuels were generally available in the UK. The Model 18's low compression did mean it was easy to start and the model 18s had better performance and fuel economy than the fast cars of the time.Total Bike Classics (accessed 2008-05-10) By 1951 the model 18 had an alloy cylinder head and the competition models had also an alloy cylinder (with steel liner), where the barrel fins went all the way to the base. The magneto was moved in front of the cylinder on the Matchless G80 for 1952. The earlier model did not have a magdyno - the separate magneto was directly above the dynamo behind the cylinder. The leaky pressed-steel primary chain-case that first appeared in early times had a small clutch inspection/adjustment plate added in 1952 and in 1954 the whole clutch dome was replaceable in it. The compression ratio was increased to 8.7:1 in 1956 and in 1958 an alloy cover primary chain-case became available. The unreliable 'jampot' shock absorbers were replaced with Girling shocks in 1956 and in 1957 AMC switched from Burman gearboxes to their own make. In 1960 the model 18 gained a duplex frame. Models The 500 cc \\"long stroke\\" AJS 18CS was produced from 1951 through 1955. In 1956 it was replaced by the shorter stroke, larger bore models that used the same numeric codes. The bore of these early models was , while the 1956 through 1966 \\"short stroke\\" (final version) models had a bore of . The C was for Competition (Scrambles) and the S for Suspension (not a rigid rear frame). Engine numbers usually start with the year of production, followed by model designation, and completed with the production number of the motorcycle The AJS and Matchless singles were doomed when AMC merged with Norton as all production was transferred to twins cylinder bikes - so the short-stroke Model 18 is the end of an era.

They were approved by the Holy See on May 5, 2008. Pope Pius IX granted a Canonical Coronation to her marble image on 23 May 1855. Background Situated in Dauphin√©, in southern France at the foot of the Alps, just southeast of Gap, is the vale of Laus. Its name means \\"lake\\" in the local dialect, as there once was one at the bottom of the basin. In 1666 the hamlet held twenty households scattered in little huts. The inhabitants had built a chapel dedicated to the Annunciation, Notre-Dame de Bon Rencontre (Our Lady of the Good Encounter, i.e., the Annunciation).\\"Our Lady of Laus\\", Magnificat Vol. XL, No. 5 and Vol. XXXVI, No. 5. Apparitions Benoite was born in September 16, 1647, into extreme poverty in the village of St Etienne d‚ÄôAvancon. Her father died when she was only seven. By the time Benoite was twelve she took employment tending sheep. In May 1664, the seventeen-year-old Benoite saw an apparition of Saint Maurice, a 3rd-century martyr who was greatly honored at Laus. This was near a nearby chapel, then in ruins, dedicated to St. Maurice. He warned her that if she remained in that area, the local guards would take her flock if they found it there. St. Maurice told the shepherdess to go to the Valley of Kilns, above Saint-√âtienne, where she would see the Mother of God. On May 16 Benoite took her sheep to the Valley of Kilns. She came to a grotto, when Mary, holding the child Jesus in her arms, appeared to her. Her offer to share the hard bread that she carried made the beautiful lady smile, but she left without saying a word.Mann, Stephanie A. \\"Who Is Our Lady of Laus?\\", Our Sunday Visitor, March 28, 2014 For a period of about four months, the Lady came back every day, and Benoite heard her speak. Others could not hear what Mary said. On August 29, the Lady told Benoite that her name was Mary. The Lady instructed Benoite to go to Laus from her own village nearby and to look for her there, \\"where you will smell a very nice perfume\\". Benoite made her way to Laus and found an old chapel dedicated to Notre Dame de Bonne Rencontre, and, while the smell of the beautiful perfume was there, the chapel was in bad condition. \\"It is my desire that a new chapel be built here in honour of my beloved Son. It will become a place of conversion for numerous sinners and I shall appear here very often,\\" said the beautiful lady. She told Benoite that the oil from the sanctuary lamp would work miracles with the infirm if they received the anointing with faith in her intercession. Message Our Lady of Laus asked for sinners to do penance, a chapel of Eucharistic adoration to be built so Jesus could convert sinners, and a house for priests to be built so the priests could administer the sacraments to sinners. At the heart of the message given to Benoite is a conversion of souls which aims to bring full reconciliation with oneself, with others, and with God. Veneration A few of the saints who have had a particular devotion to Our Lady of Laus include Saint Eugene de Mazenod (1782‚Äì1861), founder of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate; and Saint Peter Julian Eymard (1811‚Äì1868), founder of the Blessed Sacrament Fathers and Servants. When Saint Peter Julian was eleven years old he made a sixty-kilometer pilgrimage on foot in order to pray for nine days at the shrine while preparing for his First Communion. Later he wrote, \\"That is where I first came to know and love Mary.\\"Koenig-Bricker, Woodene, \\"Mary and May: Our Lady of Laus\\", Parish, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc.

Plot Fourteen-year-old Dylan's Hickock father, Bill, had quite often been strange. Bill would often go from one favorite subject to another, borrowing books to suit his interest. Dylan's mother goes on a four-month expedition to Egypt as an Egyptologist. Dylan's father had been on a hunting trip to Mount St. Helens, which is in danger of an eruption. Later, he takes Dylan to a cryptozoology convention called Bigfoot International, where Dr. Theodore Flagg is late for the meeting, and one member shows a snapshot of Bigfoot. Later, when Dr. Flagg, who supports bringing in evidence of Bigfoot in the form of an actual specimen, dead or alive, arrives, someone in the audience named Buckley Johnson objects to his views. Dylan's father objects to the idea as well, but is quiet about it. Dylan and his father later go to his house, because he owns real estate and Mr. Johnson is one of his buyers. There is a giant statue of Bigfoot in his yard, and he is being watched by a neighbor, Peter Nunn, who also owns a house from Bill Hickock's real estate and has set up video cameras and tape recorders. Bill invites Mr. Johnson to dinner with him and Dylan. Mr. Johnson tells them to call him Buck, and denies ever seeing the Sasquatch. Later, while Dylan's father joins Dr. Flagg on the expedition to Mount St. Helens, and everyone comes to Dylan's house for the night, taking away all communications so that the word isn't spread. Dylan's father wants him to quietly get Buck involved in this, but when Dr. Flagg is woken up he points a gun at Dylan, and Bill thinks Dr. Flagg is crazy. Dylan goes over to Buck's house, enters from the back so \\"Peter Nunn\\" is not able to capture them on camera. He finds out that Buck's wife Betty and his son Gary had died, and that Buck is a retired field biologist. Dylan later shows his dad, who is not tech-savvy, how to e-mail. He wants to go on the expedition with them, but his dad says it's too dangerous, and they must leave now before they set up restricted access zones, and Dylan promises to stay with his friend Doug. Dylan meets the expedition's tracker, Kurt Skipp, who is slow at walking but very quick with his hands. When the expedition leaves, \\"Peter Nunn\\", who now calls himself Agent Crow, shows up at Dylan's house. He shows Dylan an FBI badge, and warns him that Buck is dangerous. After Agent Crow leaves, Dylan arrives at Buck's house, and Buck demands the extra communication radio. The radio was left behind by Clyde and his brothers, because they only need one radio as Clyde's brothers are mute and he claims that they were sent by aliens from the planet Zona. Dylan is about to give Buck the radio and a map, but says that he will not give them to him unless he takes Dylan with him to Mount St. Helens. Buck needs the radio and map, so he brings Dylan with him. Buck also says that Agent Crow is following him because he thinks he stole something, and that Agent Crow is no longer an actual FBI agent. On the news, a volcanologist being interviewed says that the volcano is not likely to erupt. On the way to the mountain, Dylan has to pee and is interrupted by tremors caused by the volcano. Buck takes Dylan to an old cabin, which smells horrible, and they open the windows even though it lets ash inside. When they go to sleep, Dylan hears a piercing howl in the distance, and Buck insists it's a mountain lion. The next day, Dylan is sent to fetch water from the river, because Buck uses a walking staff to walk, and the cane has a carving of a mountain and his wife and son. Dylan gets lost and encounters a Sasquatch footprint. He eventually gets back to the cabin, but there is a tremor and a hot pipe sags from the ceiling, and Buck warns Dylan not to touch it. Over breakfast, Dylan convinces Buck to tell him about Sasquatch, but Buck says only if he doesn't ask any more questions. He also explains that a locked cabinet in the cabin is Pandora's Box. Buck tells him that the Sasquatch is real, and that the howl they heard last night was from a Sasquatch, and that his friend Billy Taylor who had previously owned the cabin could talk to the Sasquatch, and when he died the cabin was given to Buck. The next few days it rained, and Dylan and Buck were kept inside. On the radio, they hear that the expedition is to go down to the ravine, and Buck seems to dislike the idea greatly. Dylan goes for a walk and encounters Agent Crow. He explains that Buck, who likely went under the pseudonym D. B. Cooper or Dan Cooper, hijacked an airplane and stole $200,000, and later a boy found some of the money on the ground, and the FBI considered Buck to be a primary suspect. When Dylan returns to the cabin, Buck is not there, and the walking staff, as well as the map and radio were gone as well. Pandora's Box was unlocked, and Dylan finds another staff in it, and uses it to turn a hole in the ground, which opens a trapdoor with an extremely long ladder. Dylan climbs down the ladder, and tries to look for Buck. He gets lost, and there are still tremors, and he discovers money in the caves under the cabin. He yells for help, and Buck and an adult Sasquatch find him. Buck admits that he is D. B. Cooper to Dylan Hickock. He says he committed the hijacking to pay for cancer treatments for his son. He also says that his wife Betty had told Billy to stash the money in the cabin. Buck had also talked to Dylan's dad though the radio by setting up a code. Buck tells Dylan to go to the ravine and make giant Sasquatch footprints using a cast made from real ones, and to lead them away from the tunnel. Agent Crow interferes on the radio, and talks about Buck, and Kurt Skipp soon arrives and discovers Dylan making the footprints, and sees a Bigfoot-like creature, and shoots at it. Dylan tries to stop him, but Kurt knees him in the stomach. At the same time, the volcano had a small eruption, and trees collapse on Kurt and kill him. Dylan hears his dad on the radio and talks to him. Dylan discovers his dad at a waterfall, and he is injured and barely conscious. A Sasquatch takes Dylan's dad to a safer place and beckons Dylan to follow. He talks to Dr. Flagg on the radio and tells him about the situation. A helicopter arrives to take Dylan and his Dad back to civilization. Clyde and his brothers are missing, and Dylan thinks they went back to Zona. When they get back home, Dylan wonders what had happened to Buck, and Dylan sends a message to his mother that Dylan's father is in hospital. Dylan receives an e-mail from Buck that an \\"old friend\\" is about to arrive at his house, but it's Agent Crow. In the fridge, there was a message from Buck for Agent Crow, saying that he confessed to the hijacking. Another message was for Dylan, saying that Agent Crow should get more exercise. After Agent Crow leaves, Dylan also finds a wooden staff from Buck to remember him by. On it, a face resembling Dylan was carved into the handle. See also *D. B.

The apparitions became known as Our Lady of Laus, and the site receives thousands of pilgrim visits a year. On 4 May 2008, Bishop Jean-Michel di Falco of the Diocese of Gap officially recognized the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to Benoite Rencurel at the sanctuary of Laus in the area of Hautes-Alpes, France.\\"Church Approves French Marian Shrine\\", Zenit, May 15, 2008 Life Beno√Æte Rencurel was born on September 16, 1647, in the little town of Saint- √âtienne d'Avan√ßon, in the southern Alps. Her parents lived modestly from the works of their hands. Her father, Guillaume Rencurel, died when Beno√Æte was seven years old. For the widow and her daughters, his death would lead to material destitution. There was no school in Saint-Etienne d'Avan√ßon and so Beno√Æte never learned to read or write.Dom Antoine Marie osb. Abbey of Saint- Joseph de Clairval, 21 July 2003 At the age of twelve, she found work as a shepherdess.\\"Our Lady of Laus\\", Catholic Tradition In a homily during a Mass at the Marian basilica in the town of Laus, Archbishop Georges Pontier of Marseille, France, said that Rencurel had first seen Mary after being guided by a strange scent near her home in Saint-Etienne d'Avancon in May 1664 and later experienced a vision of Christ bleeding on the village cross. During the apparitions, the Blessed Mother asked for a church and a house for priests to be built, with the intention of drawing people to greater conversion, especially through the sacrament of penance. The holy site now draws 120,000 pilgrims annually. Numerous physical healings have also been associated with the site, especially when oil from a lamp is applied on the wounds according to the directives the Virgin Mary gave to Rencurel. She became a Third Order Dominican and ministered to pilgrims and penitents as a lay Dominican tertiary in Laus. She also urged women to be modest. At the shrine in Laus, Beno√Æte is said to have had the gift of reading hearts and so many people came to ask her advice that she had to attend mass through a small window in the gallery of the Church to escape the crowds who sought to overwhelm her. She claimed to receive visions of Jesus in His passion from 1669 to 1679. She died on Christmas Day 1718. The very modern message of Benoite, Bishop di Falco stated, is \\"to live heart to heart with God in prayer, enter deeper into conversion where we are reconciled with ourselves, with others and with God, and live your mission where your life is, in everyday community and joy.\\" She was bestowed the title Servant of God by Pope Pius IX.

History The chapel was built in 1875 by architect William Russell Walker at the behest of James Eddy. Eddy was a wealthy engraver and art dealer who advocated a theology that was unusual for its time. He had a private chapel built on the land adjacent to his property, hoping that he might be able to find some people who agreed with his theology. The chapel sat largely unused until Eddy's death in 1888. His will created an endowment aimed at keeping the chapel in use well into the future. That endowment is still active today. Anna Garlin Spencer, a Providence philanthropist and philosopher, was asked to spearhead the creation of a new congregation using the chapel.

He studied various topics, such as the time reversal of quantum mechanics, pattern recognition, cognitive science, and the concept of time. He was the first physicist to show clearly that quantum probability theory is time-asymmetric (irreversible; non-invariant under time reversal), and reject the conventional analysis of the time reversal of probability laws. He developed the Double Inferential Vector Formalism (DIVF), later known as the Two-state vector formalism (TSVF), which is sometimes interpreted as contradicting his proof of time-asymmetry, but this is a misunderstanding. He also proposed the Ugly duckling theorem. Early life and education Satosi Watanabe was born on May 26, 1910, in Tokyo. He attended Gakushuuin Middle High School and Tokyo High School. In 1933, he graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in theoretical physics, where Torahiko Terada was his teacher. The imperial government sent him to France to study. Louis de Broglie encouraged Watanabe to study thermodynamics and wave mechanics. In 1937, he moved to Leipzig and started to study nuclear theory under Heisenberg. In the same year, Watanabe married Dorothea Dauer, a scholar of German literature. In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, he left Germany and stayed with Niels Bohr for a time. In December, he returned to Japan with his family. Career In Japan, he worked at the Physical and Chemical Research Institute (Rikagaku Kenkyujo) at Tokyo Imperial University as an assistant professor, and as a physics professor at Rikkyo University. In 1950, he left for the United States. His argument that quantum mechanics is time- asymmetric (irreversible; non-invariant under the time reversal transformation) is repeated in a number of his papers (1955; 1965; 1966; 1972). It is informal but quite correct, as a more formal proof (Holster 2003) confirms. This result means that physicists have used the wrong transformation of probability laws to represent time reversal, and the popular claims that quantum mechanics is time reversal invariant are invalid. Watanabe's argument has not been accepted by physicists or philosophers however. The assumption that quantum mechanics is time symmetric on the basis of invalid conventional proofs is almost universal in the literature on time in physics to this day. He developed the Double Inferential Vector Formalism (DIVF),Watanabe, Satosi. \\"Symmetry of physical laws. Part III. Prediction and retrodiction.\\" Reviews of Modern Physics 27.2 (1955): 179. later known as the Two-state vector formalism (TSVF). The DSVF/TSVF is often interpreted as a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics (see Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics). However Watanabe was quite clear that the normal physical theory of quantum mechanics that holds for real physics is time-asymmetric. He consequently rejected the conventional view that physical time asymmetry is only explained by asymmetric boundary conditions on the universe, and claimed it is a law- like feature of quantum physics. Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by Walter Schottky in 1921, and later by several other scientists. Watanabe proposed that information given by forwards evolving quantum states is not complete; rather, both forwards and backwards evolving quantum states are required to describe a quantum state: a first state vector that evolves from the initial conditions towards the future, and a second state vector that evolves backwards in time from future boundary conditions. Past and future measurements, taken together, provide complete information about a quantum system. Watanabe's work was later rediscovered by Yakir Aharonov, Peter Bergmann and Joel Lebowitz in 1964, who later renamed it the Two-state vector formalism (TSVF).Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: Protective measurements of two-state vectors, in: Robert Sonn√© Cohen, Michael Horne, John J.

On October 15, 1993, he died in Tokyo. Family His father, Chifuyu Watanabe, was a Minister of Justice at Second Wakatsuki Cabinet.

Reaction  CNPase catalyzes the following reaction: :nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons nucleoside 2'-phosphate Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and H2O, whereas its product is nucleoside 2'-phosphate.  Function  CNPase is a myelin-associated enzyme that makes up 4% of total CNS myelin protein, and is thought to undergo significant age-associated changes. It is named for its ability to catalyze the phosphodiester hydrolysis of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to 2'-nucleotides, though a cohesive understanding of its specific physiologic functions are still ambiguous. Structural studies have revealed that four classes of CNPases belong to one protein superfamily. CNPase's catalytic core consists of three alpha-helices and nine beta-strands. The proposed mechanism of CNPases phosphodiesterase catalytic activity is similar to the second step of the reaction mechanism for RNase A. CNPase is expressed exclusively by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and the appearance of CNPase seems to be one of the earliest events of oligodendrocyte differentiation. CNPase is thought to play a critical role in the events leading up to myelination. CNPase also associates with microtubules in brain tissue and FRTL-5 thyroid cells, and is reported to have microtubule-associated protein-like activity (MAP; see MAP2), being able to catalyze microtubule formation at low molar ratios. Deletion of the C-terminus of CNPase or phosphorylation abolish the catalytic activity of microtubule formation. CNPase can link tubulin to cellular membranes, and might be involved in the regulation cytoplasmic microtubule distribution. CNNPase has also been demonstrated to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses by binding the retroviral Gag protein and inhibiting the genesis of nascent viral particles. Whether this is a biological function of CNPase or a coincidental activity remains unclear.

His father was a German Bohemian and his mother was Jewish. Urzidil was educated in Prague, studying German, art history, and Slavic languages before turning to journalism and writing. His initial efforts in poetry were influenced by Expressionism, and were published under the pseudonym Hans Elmar. He also worked as a writer and editor of the monthly journal Der Mensch. Among his acquaintances during this period were Franz Werfel, Ludwig Winder and Franz Kafka. From 1922 until 1933 he advised the press section of the German embassy in Prague. When Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939, he was dismissed from employment by the German embassy because of his being \\"Halbjude\\" (\\"half- Jewish\\", a Nazi designation) and this situation caused Urzidil to emigrate to Great Britain. There he was financially supported by the British writer Bryher. In 1941 he and his wife, the poet Gertrude Urzidil, came to the United States, acquiring American citizenship in 1946. Although he published poetry, Urzidil is best known for his prose which, though written in exile, reflects his Bohemian heritage just as well as his new American environment. Among his more notable works are the story Der Trauermantel (1945, Trauermantel is the German name of the Camberwell beauty) about Adalbert Stifter‚Ä≤s youth, and his collections of short stories like ' (1956; the title refers as well to Prague which he had to leave behind when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia as to his first love), Prague Triptych (1960, whose composition is derived from that of an altarpiece), or Kidnapping and Seven Other Incidents (1964, whose eight stories are situated in the USA). Urzidil's only novel The Great Hallelujah (1959) shows as literary collage in the tradition of John Dos Passos, Thomas Wolfe, and Alfred D√∂blin a manifold panorama of the United States as he experienced them since his arrival in 1941. He wrote also books and essays about cultural history, e. g. The Fortune of Presence. Goethe's View of America (1958), America and the Ancient World (1964), and There Goes Kafka (1965, enlarged 1966), or monographs about artists and poets he admired, such as Hollar, a Czech √©migr√© in England (1942, revised and abridged translation of his German book Wenceslaus Hollar - the Engraver of the Baroque Era, 1936), or his opus magnum in this genre Goethe in Bohemia (1932, revised and enlarged 1962 and 1965). More over Urzidil translated texts and books from Czech and English into German; worth mentioning is especially his translation (1955) of By Avon River (1949) by the American poet H.D., the companion of Urzidil's life-saver Bryher. Urzidil won a number of prizes in his career, including the Charles Veillon Prize (1957) and the Gro√üer √ñsterreichischer Staatspreis (1964). He died in Rome in 1970.

The ferries are operated by the Kenya Ferry Services (KFS), and is the only remaining ferry service by KFS. The Likoni ferry started operating in 1937. Passenger services are free while vehicles, tuktuks, motorcycles and trucks have to pay a ferry toll. The Mombasa side terminal of the Likoni line is located at the southern end of the Mombasa Island. The distance of the line is about 500 metres. Service In addition to the main Likoni line, there is a passenger-only peak hour service between Mtongwe and Mombasa island next to Bandari College. It crosses the Kilindini Creek few kilometres west of the Kilindini line. The service was halted pending repairs of the ramp that was damaged. The new ferries MV Kwale and MV Likoni are moored at the Dradenau Terminal in the Port of Hamburg, Germany. Likoni Ferry, early 1950s There are five operating ferries. MV Mvita and MV Pwani were bought in 1969 and 1974, respectively. MV Nyayo, MV Harambee, and MV Kilindini were bought second hand in 1990. KFS is in process to buy two new ferries, but the order was repeatedly delayed.Daily Nation, January 8, 2009: New ferries delay raises eyebrows The two arrived in June 2010. They have been christened as MV Kwale and MV Likoni. Three of the operating ferries,MV Harambee, MV Nyayo and MV Kilindini have been deregistered from Lloyd's Register (an international maritime classification society), being not seaworthy.Daily Nation, March 7, 2010: New ferries no magic wand, say experts As at May 2011, at least MV Nyayo was in use as the relief ferry, now painted blue. The Dongo Kundu bypass has been planned to ease the congested ferry. The road would run from Shika Adabu (between Likoni and Diani) to Miritini (west of Mombasa Island, along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway). The road would be 12‚Äì24 km long depending on whether bridges would be built to cross the Likoni creek.The Standard, January 28, 2010: A bypass might solve the ferry debacle Currently the shortest route by road from Likoni to Mombasa Island is through the Kwale town, 30 kilometres southwest of Mombasa.Kenya - The Rough Guide Map A direct bridge or tunnel from Likoni to Mombasa Island had also been proposed, but the high cost of building them has made these options unlikely.Daily Nation, March 7, 2010: State sitting on grand proposals over ferry problems The U.S. Dept of State in its travel advisory on Kenya updated on Feb 27, 2018 has cautioned the use of the Likoni ferry in Mombasa due to safety concerns.  Accidents  =Mtongwe Disaster= On April 29, 1994, the MV Mtongwe ferry bound for the mainland capsized just 40 meters from port, killing 272 of the 400 people on board.Daily Nation, Wednesday Magazine, November 19, 2003: The restless ghosts of Mtongwe Following the disaster, it was reported that the capacity of the ship was 300. As of 2005, KFS had compensated 81 families a total of KSh 36,902,472 ($486,840 USD).Kenyan ferry firm compensates tragedy victims ‚Äî Ferrynews =MV Harambee Faulty Ramp= On September 29, 2019; A mother, 35 year old Mariam Kighenda, and her 4-year-old daughter Amanda Wambua boarded the MV Harambee Ferry, where they lost their lives after their car (Toyota Isis) slipped off the slippery faulty back ramp and plunged into the ocean. As of October 2nd, the rescue team are using robots in order to locate the victims bodies trapped in the car. On October 9th, the car and the corpses trapped inside were located by the South African divers 58 meters deep. On October 11th 2019, past 4pm Kenyan time, the Kenya Navy divers retrieved the car with the corpses inside using the cord and a crane. After the retrieval, vehicle was opened where the gear was found in Parking mode, the windshield wipers were on and the decomposed but identifiable bodies of mother and daughter were found dead in a tight embrace at the backseat of the car. The deceased family was compensated KSH 200,000 for the car. =MV Likoni= On Saturday night (October 12, 2019), MV Likoni's half part of the roof made of fixed iron sheets was almost blew away by the winds as it rained heavily leading the water to leak inside. On Sunday night, MV Likoni stalled in the middle of Likoni channel facing mechanical problems while carrying passengers and vehicles, leading to it drifting under heavy currents. Moments later MV Jambo came to the rescue by pushing MV Likoni to the shore. Another incident took place on Thursday, October 31st, when the same ferry stalled again, cause of the faulty engine leading the passengers to panic.  Charges  The KFS does not charge people.

In 1874, he retired from military service but remained in Manitoba where he entered politics and was elected to Winnipeg's first city council; he became mayor in 1877. In 1878, he was elected to the Manitoba legislature from the district of Winnipeg and, in 1880, he defeated incumbent Donald A. Smith to become the Conservative MP for Selkirk. He was re-elected in the 1882 federal election in the new riding of Winnipeg. Scott returned to military service, in 1885, while still an MP, after the Minister of the Militia Sir Adolphe-Philippe Caron asked Scott to raise a regiment to put down the North-West Rebellion of 1885.

In 1926, the house and properties were purchased by Providence College. The house was given a wood-framed dormitory addition to its rear, becoming Guzman Hall, the college's first on-campus dormitory. It continued to be a dormitory, housing pre-ecclesiastical students, until 1962, when a new Guzman Hall was opened on land formerly included in the Good Shepherd property, which had been purchased by the college in 1955. At that time, the house was remodeled to its original configuration and renamed for Saint Martin de Porres. Until 1994 the house was used as the house of the President of Providence College, at which time St. Dominic House, another house which was a part of the Good Shepherd property, became the President's residence.

Over the years, more buildings were built on what was then a 33-acre parcel (later cut to 25 acres when Route 95 was built), including a carpenter shop, powerhouse, machine shops, warehouses, grinding shop, and steel storage bins. The complex was largely complete by 1920, although the last structure was built in 1941. The company remained in the location until 1964, when it was sold for $3.2 million.

Because loupes magnify a small field of vision, the amount of light that is focused into through the loupe is less than what is seen by just the naked eye. The dimness experienced is negligible for a nonprofessional user, but for professionals who require accuracy and precision and work in a confined area like dentistry, a loupe light provides illumination that will dramatically increase the level of detail he/she can see through loupes. Loupe lights in the field of dentistry Loupe lights have become very advanced, and their use is growing. In the past, they used to be fiber optic and provided little portability in dentistry. Now, with technological advancements, LED loupe lights have become portable and more ergonomic - the lightest loupe light weighs just 3 grams.

Loupe lights that are corded tend to be much lighter than those that integrate battery packs within the light unit.

King (born December 27, 1946) is an American higher education leader currently serving as Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education at the U.S. Department of Education. He previously served as president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education. Other notable positions include having served Monroe County, New York Executive and as Chancellor of the State University of New York. On July 11, 2019, He was confirmed by the United States Senate as Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education.https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j- trump-announces-intent-nominate-appoint-designate-personnel-key- administration-posts/ King was born and raised in Brighton, Monroe County, New York and graduated from Brighton High School. He graduated from Trinity College (Connecticut) and earned a Juris Doctor at the Vanderbilt University School of Law. He began his career as a Deputy District Attorney in California. He returned to Rochester where he served as an Assistant District Attorney, as well as a Special Assistant United States Attorney working for the Organized Crime Strike Force, and ran unsuccessfully for Monroe County District Attorney against Howard M. Relin in 1983. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1987 to 1991, sitting in the 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures. It was there that he met fellow Assemblyman George Pataki, who greatly influenced his later career. In 1991, he unseated Thomas Frey to become Monroe County Executive. In 1995, King resigned his office to join then-Governor Pataki as director of the State Office of Regulatory Reform. He cited his proposals to reform welfare, his introduction of Total Quality Management to county offices, the development of Frontier Field, education reforms, and collaboration with the city as his proudest achievements and his inability to achieve privatization of government services as his biggest disappointment. In 1998, King became Pataki's budget director. In 1999, after a nearly year-long search, Pataki advanced King as a candidate to fill the shoes of John W. Ryan, the ailing Chancellor of the State University System, a move applauded by fiscal conservatives, but criticized by the SUNY rank and file. King had little experience in higher education and had authorized a SUNY budget freeze only two months prior. Additionally, Pataki had a longstanding desire to reduce the role of the state in the University's funding which already led to one Chancellor's departure. SUNY's board of trustees unanimously approved him and he took office on January 1, 2000. During his time as Chancellor, funding for the University System began to shift from state taxpayers to private hands, which required campuses to seek revenue from tuition increases, from outside research grants and contracts, and from outside donations. King also sought to index tuition to inflation for the first time in the University System's history. Also the system made significant gains in enrollment, average SAT scores, research and fundraising. Total headcount enrollment grew by 40,000 students from 2000 to 2004, and the number of minority students grew 20 percent. SAT scores of incoming freshmen improved at every campus, and the average SAT score for the system was 1150 in 2004, 100 points above the national public mean score. From 2000 to 2005, SUNY research grew from $554.6 million to $918.9 million while fundraising grew $186.9 million in 2000 to $323.6 million in 2003. After five years on the job, King sought a leave of absence, citing family issues, but the paid sabbatical raised the ire of the New York State Legislature. King publicly rescinded his request, and spent the next few months negotiating an agreement to move from his position into that of Interim President of State University of New York at Potsdam. After retiring from SUNY, he joined the Arizona Community Foundation as its President and CEO. At the end of 2008, King retired from the Arizona Community Foundation to take up the position of president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education in January 2009. King served as the Council's third president, succeeding Gordon Davies and Thomas Layzell, until November 2018. As president, King led Kentucky's efforts to implement legislation regarding college readiness (KRS 164.302), college transfer (KRS 164.020) and training college board members (KRS 164.020). He also encouraged significant reform in teacher and principal training through the Kentucky Rising initiative. During King's tenure as the state's higher education leader, Kentucky's public institutions saw steady growth in degrees and credentials, as well as student readiness rates. From 2009 to 2014, degrees and credentials grew 18.8 percent and transfers from the Kentucky Community and Technical College System to four-year colleges increased 31.4 percent. College readiness rates of all high school graduates increased 31 percentage points, of 32 to 63 percent. Readiness of Kentucky college entrants also experienced an increase of 18 percentage points, or 52 to 70 percent. In addition, King moved to limit tuition increases at Kentucky's colleges and universities. Between 2009-10 and 2016‚Äì17, resident undergraduate tuition and fees represented a 60 percent reduction in the average rate of increase compared to the previous seven years. King also led efforts to move a portion of state funding for higher education to an outcomes-based model. King is a member of numerous boards and organizations. He has served as vice chair and chair of the Executive Committee of the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO). Other notable board positions include the Board of Trustees of A.T. Still University and the National Center on Education and the Economy. On August 21, 2018, President Donald J.

He continued to box but had only ten more fights, losing eight of them and winning two. He had his last fight in February 1919, losing to Mike Blake, and died a month later, in poverty.

Unlike more traditional electronic mailing list software, like Majordomo, there is no email interface to send commands to Dada Mail. Rather, almost all administration of the mailing list is done using a web-based control panel. Closed-Loop Opt-in subscriptions are done by sending a confirmation email message, but the actual mechanism is simply a unique confirmation URL.  History  Dada Mail was initially written in December 1999 and released as version 1.0 in January 2000, between Justin's first and second semester at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Its original name was Mojo Mail, a name that came to Justin after having a dream about making a successor to the Majordomo program, after struggling with that program's email-based interface for a non-profit client. The name of this specific program was changed on December 1, 2003, after Justin Simoni received a letter from a lawyer representing Mediaplex Inc. that the name was in violation of their trademark. The name was changed to, Dada Mail. Dada is a direct reference to the early 20th century cultural movement. Justin considers Dada Mail a conceptual work of art.

It is styled as a mock driving institution where young children learn how to drive small cars. Riders are allowed to drive around a miniature course, where they are overseen by marshals. The track is mainly built and themed around the area, Cloud Cuckoo Land. It is decorated with colourful statues and quirky scenery.  History  The attraction was opened in July 2006 as the Peugeot 207 Driving School, with riders driving around in vehicles modelled after the Peugeot 207, however this was renamed simply to the Peugeot Driving School in 2010. Later, in 2012, the ride's sponsorship deal with Peugeot came to an end, with the attraction being given a new name of simply the Alton Towers Driving School. At this time, all Peugeot branding was removed from the ride, however the cars remained modelled vaguely after the Peugeot 207. Finally, in 2017, after a one year renovation period from the 2016 season, the ride received a minor refurbishment and reopened as the Cuckoo Cars Driving School, with cars receiving an updated, patterned shell.  Reception  When opened in 2006, the Peugeot 207 Driving School was immensely popular with children. The appeal of allowing them to drive openly was a first at Alton Towers. A marketing ploy was that the children received a faux driver's license after completing their 5-minute turn.

Early life  Valentine James O'Hara was born on 8 February 1875 in Bernere, Portarlington, County Laois, Ireland. Son of Thomas O'Hara, he had one brother (Charles (1871‚Äì1955)) and two sisters (Mary b 1877 and Elizabeth b 1879). His early education was at Stonyhurst College, near Clitheroe in rural Lancashire. He spent two years at Stonyhurst studying Rudiments and Grammar at this Jesuit College. He finished his education at Queen's College, Galway. Ten years later he returned to Stonyhurst College and taught languages before leaving to devote himself to literary work.  Later career  Valentine was a long term resident in the old Russian Empire. He travelled extensively all over Europe and served on the Anglo-Russian Committee in Petrograd and the Inter-Allied Trade Commission in Stockholm. He was imprisoned under the Bolshevik regime and left Russia in 1918. He enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment for their North Russian Expedition. He was demobilised in 1919 at the request of the Foreign Office, and was appointed to the British Political Mission to the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania).Catholic Who's Who and Year Book 1930 His two best known books are \\"Anthony O'Hara, Knight of Malta\\" which is an interesting account of a distinguished kinsman of the author, in the writing of which Valentine had access to the Tyrawley papers at Annaghmore House, near Collooney, County Sligo. He also wrote \\"Russia\\" in 1925 in collaboration with Nikolai Makeev. This was a much quoted and authoritative account of the late 19th century history of the country.

It was established under the Indian Claims Act of 1946 by the United States Congress to hear any longstanding claims of Indian tribes against the United States.Act of August 13, 1946, ch. 959, 60 Stat. 1049 It took until the late 1970s to complete most of them, with the last case finished in the early 21st century. The commission was conceived as way to thank Native Americans for their unprecedented service in World War II and as a way to relieve the anxiety and resentment caused by the United States' history of colonization of indigenous peoples. Together with the law, the Commission created a process for tribes to address their grievances against the United States, and offered monetary compensation for territory lost as a result of broken federal treaties. However, by accepting the government's monetary offer, the aggrieved tribe abdicated any right to raise their claim again in the future. On occasion, a tribe gave up federal recognition as part of the settlement of a claim. Anthropologists and ethnologists, historians and legalists, as well as government officials including lawyers, were the dominant researchers, advocates, and legal counsel for the plaintiff tribes and the defendant federal government. The greatly expanded amount of anthropological research conducted for the Commission led to the foundation of the American Society for Ethnohistory (ASE). The research and historical reports compiled in evidence for Native American claims was first amassed in 1954 at the inaugural Ohio Valley Historic Indian Conference, the predecessor organization later renamed the ASE. A collection of the studies was published in the series \\"American Indian Ethnohistory\\" by Garland Publishing in 1974. The methodology and theory of ethnohistorical research in general traces back to the work done by anthropologists and other scholars on claims before the Commission.See \\"Introduction\\" to Shoemaker (2002), vii‚Äìix. With the chance to pursue claims against the government, many neglected Indian groups in the Southeast, the Northeast, and California organized tribal governments in order to pursue their claims, particularly for land. In particular, the 1946 act allowed any \\"identifiable\\" group of native descendants to bring a cause of action without regard to their federal recognition status. Tribes such as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama trace their modern federal status to the efforts of Chief Calvin McGhee and his 1950s work with the Indian Claims Commission. Indian land claims were one of the key reasons the Bureau of Indian Affairs established its administrative Federal Acknowledgment Process in 1978. The Commission was adjourned in 1978 by Public Law 94-465,90 Stat. 1990 which terminated the Commission and transferred its pending docket of 170 cases to the United States Court of Claims on September 30, 1978. By the time of the Commission's final report, it had awarded $818,172,606.64 in judgments and had completed 546 dockets.  Land claims  Land was the dominant concern of the litigation by tribes before the Indian Claims Commission (ICC). The statutory authority did not permit this tribunal to grant or restore land to the tribes, but only to award money based upon a net acreage figure of lost lands times the monetary market value of an acre at the time of taking. This limitation on the authority of the ICC was resented by many tribal peoples, who wanted the return of their lands more than money‚Äîe.g., the Pit River Indians of northern California, and the Teton and Lakota of the Black Hills, South Dakota. In a few instances, by way of settlement acts, tribes gained some monetary funds to buy acreage when they had no communal land (as with the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy of Maine and the Catawba of the Carolinas). Special congressional acts on occasion did restore some acreage, as with the Havasupai at the Grand Canyon.Martin, 1985 In preparing expert testimony for litigation brought by the tribes as plaintiffs or for the defense by the U.S. government, researchers explored all forms of data, including the earliest possible maps of original title‚Äîi.e., native or indigenous‚Äîterritory and the cartographic presentations based upon treaties, statutes, and executive orders‚Äîgenerally identified as recognized title. In most cases, recognized title lands could be more easily demonstrated in litigation, while native territory depended upon Indian informants, explorers, trappers, military personnel, missionaries and early field ethnographers. Scholars sought to reconstruct native ecology in terms of food supply and other resources of the environment. In this way, some concept of original territory could be gained that could be mapped. As the Final Report of the ICC revealed, compromises over territorial parcels led to rejecting some acreage which had been used by more than one tribe over time.ICC, 1978; visit online map, see link below The briefs, testimonies, quantum data, findings, and decisions were published in the 1970s in a multiple series of microfiche by Clearwater Publishing, Co., NY, which publisher was sold to CIS, then to Nexis/Lexis.

History After touring as an opening act for Sarah McLachlan's Afterglow tour, Boucher was called to the studio by her record label Geffen Records in 2004 to record the follow-up to her album Flutterby. Spending over a year deciding on producer David Kahne and waiting for him to become available, Boucher did most of the pre-production for the album at her home studio, doing the guitar, bass guitar, electronic keyboard, lead vocals and backing vocals Production for the album began on October 24, 2005. Although Boucher had intended to record the album with a live band, the idea was abandoned after Kahne listened to the demos Boucher had produced, and liked her playing all the instruments herself. Scary Fragile was originally completed in January 2006. Claiming to not \\"want to be too deep\\" about her album titles, Boucher states the title was chosen because \\"it didn't mean anything\\", and \\"can mean whatever you want as well.\\" The other title considered for the album was Just Because. Not knowing how to market the album, Geffen stalled on releasing Scary Fragile before offering Boucher to affiliate Polydor Records to release the album in the United Kingdom first. After the album was found to be too \\"American-sounding\\" for the UK, Boucher re-recorded the album for the UK market with a Swedish producer. In February 2007, the album track \\"A Bitter Song\\" was used on the hit American television series Grey's Anatomy during a pivotal season arch, after which it was released as a single on iTunes. The re-recorded album was completed in June 2007, at which point Boucher began previewing one-off album tracks at irregular intervals on her MySpace page, on what she referred to as \\"Oops Days\\". Although Polydor had set a release date for the album in autumn 2007, Geffen blocked the album' release, agreeing to allow the UK label to release the album only on the condition that the UK affiliate bought Boucher out of her debt to Interscope-Geffen-A&M; for over US$1 million. Polydor refused, and after negotiations through 2008, Boucher was released from her record contract, and gained the master recording rights for both versions of Scary Fragile. Boucher released the album with the original recordings on June 2, 2009 digitally via her own imprint Situation Operation. The single \\"Gun for a Tongue\\" was released digitally on May 12, 2009.

His family was Greek nobility that emigrated from Corfu to Naples after the fall of Constantinople. After studies in Naples (where he married Maria Laskaris), in Padua and Ferrara, he held the office of fiscal in Pesaro from 1492 to 1507. The wealth he obtained by a 1494 marriage to a trader's daughter allowed him to reduce his work as a jurisconsult and concentrate on scholarly pursuits. From 1504 to 1508 he compiled the Chronicon Pisauri, a compilation of notes about legal sources that are now lost. In 1511 he finished the Tractatus de praestantia doctorum, a biographical treatise on the most influential jurists of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. In 1517, Diplovataccio moved to Venice, where, as a publisher of note, he edited De regulis iuris of Dinus, the Commentaria of de Tartagnis and the works of Bartolus, among others. On behalf of the city, he compiled two histories of Venice. Disappointed by their meager success, he moved back to Pesaro, where he spent his last years as an influential member of the city's senate.

The species is known solely from the early Miocene, Clallam Formation and the underlying Pysht Formation deposits on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state, United States. History and classification The species is known from only the holotype female, number UWBM 92012, and five other specimens all of which are currently residing in the collections housed at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, Washington, USA. The type specimens were first studied by Ross E. Berglund and James L. Goedert. Berglund and Goedert's species description was published in the Journal of Paleontology in 1996. The specific epithet \\"starri\\" was coined by the authors in recognition of David Starr, who collected and donated one of the paratype specimens. When first described, M. starri was named Cancer (Metacarcinus) starri by Berglund and Goedert. In 1975, J. D. Nations had divided the genus Cancer into four subgenera, including Metacarcinus. This placement was followed until 2000, when the subgenera were elevated to full genera by Carrie E. Schweitzer and Rodney M. Feldmann, Also available as PDF. making the species' binomial Metacarcinus starri. Description The oval carapace, nearly straight posterolateral margins, and chelipeds with spiny upper margins are used as the basis for placing the species in Metacarcinus. In comparisons of overall morphology, M. starri was noted to be most similar to the living species M. gracils, commonly called the graceful rock crab. When published, M. starri was the oldest species of Metacarcinus to be described, being older than M. coosensis, which is known from fossils found in Washington, Oregon, and California. It is also the third species of Metacarcinus to be identified from Washington state fossils. The age and location indicate a possible Northern Pacific origin for the genus. M. starri lived and was preserved in strata deposited at depths of , placing them in the lower sublittoral zone. The specimens were preserved in concretions found as loose float cobbles along the Strait of Juan de Fuca shoreline and collected at sites B6133 and B6136. However the individual cobble matrices match sediments found in the upper Pysht and lower Clallam Formations. This species lived with several other crustaceans, including the crab Pinnixa and a mud shrimp of the genus Callianassa. The extinct species Branchioplax washingtoniana was formerly though to also occur in the Clallam Formation with M. starri, however with redefinition of the Twin River Group the sediments, B. washingtoniana has been shown to occur in the older Twin River Formation.

He was a left winger who was quite tall and scored his fair share of headed goals. His career lasted from 1924 until 1939 during which time he played 447 league games, scoring 142 goals, he also played for the England national football team on four occasions. He was also a talented musician and often played piano at public appearances. Playing career =Early days= Rimmer was born in Birkenhead on 2 January 1907, he played as an amateur for Parkside, Northern Nomads and Whitchurch before signing as a professional for Tranmere Rovers as a 17-year-old in 1924. In his three seasons with Tranmere, Rimmer played briefly with football legends Dixie Dean and Tom 'Pongo' Waring, making 62 league appearances and scoring 20 goals. His good form alerted other clubs and in February 1928 he was signed by Sheffield Wednesday manager Bob Brown for a fee of ¬£3,000. =Sheffield Wednesday= Sheffield Wednesday were in a grave situation when Rimmer signed for them, they were seven points adrift at the foot of Division One. However Rimmer, who made his Wednesday debut on 25 February 1928 against Newcastle United, was to take part in what has gone down in Sheffield Wednesday history as the \\"Great Escape\\" as they picked up 17 points from a possible 20 in their last 10 matches to avoid relegation by a single point. The following two seasons saw Wednesday transformed from relegation strugglers to league winners as they lifted the Division One title in 1928‚Äì29 and 1929‚Äì30 with Rimmer a virtual ever present on the left wing. He played in Sheffield Wednesday's 2‚Äì1 defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930.

It was originally established for patrons to pray for safety from an epidemic, though it has evolved into a shrine where patrons can pray for general good health. The shrine complex is embedded in a forest of large trees northwest of Daitoku-ji and includes many minor shrines in addition to the main shrine, or honden. On every second Sunday in April, one of the 3 major festivals in Kyoto, Yasurai Matsuri, is held at the shrine. The word means \\"newly constructed.\\" History Imamiya Shrine was founded during the Heian period in 994. In 1001, however, the shrine was moved to its present-day location as a response to an epidemic that had hit the Kyoto area a year earlier. Current iterations of many of the structures were rebuilt in 1902. The shrine's festival, Yasurai Matsuri, was also created as a response to the epidemic. Through music and dance, the festival attempts to appease petrels around Kyoto with cherry blossom petals in their beaks, which were then believed to be spreading disease. Attractions There are several attractions that are unique to Imamiya Shrine. Specifically, there are two longstanding restaurants adjacent to the shrine. These shops' specialty are aburimochi - skewered, roasted rice cakes that are a traditional Kyoto confection. The two restaurants, named Ichiwa and Kazariya, have been open since 1000 and 1656 respectively and are located immediately outside the shrine's east gate. The shrine also houses a rock called ahokashisan. The stone is believed to possess magical properties. If a person rubs the stone and then rubs an injured area of their body, it is said that they will heal quicker than normal. Furthermore, if a person taps the stone three times, then lifts it, the stone will feel heavy. Afterwards, if the same person strokes the stone three times while making a wish and then lifts it for a second time and the stone feels light, it is said that their wish will be granted. The ahokashisan, as well as Yasurai Matsuri, are designated Important Cultural Properties.

First government (1868) In February 1868 the Prime Minister, The Earl of Derby, received medical advice which told him that he could not fully recover from his illness whilst Premier. He therefore asked Benjamin Disraeli (who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time) if he was ready to be Premier. Disraeli said yes, telling his friends, \\"I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole\\".Robert Blake, Disraeli (1966), pp. 485‚Äì87. However his political position was weak‚Äîa caretaker in the minority. Disraeli inherited a minority Conservative administration but was able to pass some notable Acts of Parliament. The Public Schools Act 1868 established a board of governors for nine English public schools. The Telegraph Act 1868 gave the Post Office power to nationalise all telegraph companies. The Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 abolished public executions. Disraeli also appointed a Royal Commission on the Sanitary Laws chaired by Sir Charles Adderley. Blake, Disraeli (1966), p. 495. The Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 transferred the power to try to punish electoral irregularities from the partisan Committee of the House of Commons to the impartial tribunal of judges. The judges objected to these new responsibilities imposed on them but their opposition was overcome and electoral irregularities were then tried in a legal tribunal rather than a committee of party politicians.William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume II. 1860‚Äì1881 (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 382. The main domestic issue was the status of the Anglican Church in Ireland, where it was officially established although enrolling a small minority. It became the main election issue as well.Blake, Disraeli (1966), p. 496. =Foreign policy= A John Tenniel cartoon that appeared in Punch which showed Britannia threatening the jailer of the British prisoners, King Theodore II of Abyssinia On 26 April news came of the result of Sir Robert Napier's expedition to Abyssinia. Napier had defeated the forces of Theodore II of Abyssinia and released the British prisoners: the British envoy and the British consul.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 383. In moving a motion in Parliament thanking Napier and his forces, Disraeli paid to tribute to Napier, who led his army with \\"the elephants of Asia, bearing the artillery of Europe, over African passes which might have startled the trapper and appalled the hunter of the Alps\\". He went on to say that Napier's troops \\"had to scale a mountain fortress, of which the intrinsic strength was such that it may be fairly said it would have been impregnable to the whole world had it been defended by the man by whom it was assailed\\". Disraeli famously said that \\"the standard of St. George was hoisted on the mountains of Rasselas\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 384. The cost of the expedition was originally estimated by Disraeli's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Ward Hunt, to be ¬£5m, raising the income tax from four pence to six pence to fund it. However, in 1869 the Liberal Chancellor had to meet a total of ¬£9m. However Disraeli still defended the expedition, writing to a friend in 1875: \\"I do not look back to the Abyssinian [war] with regret: quite the reverse. It was a noble feat of arms, and highly raised our prestige in the East...Money is not to be considered in such matters: success alone is to be thought of\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 385. Second government (1874‚Äì1880) The beginning of Disraeli's second premiership coincided with a growing demand for the Ritualistic controversy in the Church of England to be settled by legislation. The Public Worship Regulation Bill passed its first and second readings without a division in the House of Lords and, with amendment, passed its third reading without division.Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 653-63. After Gladstone came out against the Bill, Disraeli came out for it, accusing Gladstone of challenging the whole Reformation settlement.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 664. Disraeli urged the Bill to be passed in order \\"to put down Ritualism\\" and that he was prepared to respect Roman Catholicism practised by Roman Catholics but that he objected to the \\"Mass]in masquerade\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 665. The second reading in the House of Commons was passed without division and most clauses of the Bill passed with massive majorities. However the Bill nearly failed to become law when there was a major dispute over the clause which the Archbishops in the Lords had given the Bill: that Bishops should have a veto to prevent \\"frivolous and irresponsible prosecutions of devoted clergyman\\". There was in the Commons inserted a clause which gave the right to appeal against this veto to the Archbishop of the Province, which passed with a majority of 23. The High Church party took up the right of a Bishop to uncontrolled rule in his diocese and the Lords dropped their insistence on the appeal to the Archbishop of the Province. Disraeli was worried that the Commons would not pass the Bill without the Archbishop's veto but he managed to persuade the Commons to pass it without the clause by appealing to the need to put down a \\"small but pernicious sect\\".Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 665‚Äì7. A cartoon that appeared in Punch with the caption: \\"New crowns for old ones!\\", showing Queen Victoria exchanging with Disraeli the British Crown for the imperial diadem Disraeli and the Queen were close, and she wanted an imperial title (her daughter had one in Germany). The Royal Titles Bill, added the title Empress of India to the British monarch's official title. Despite Liberal opposition it passed into law with the assurance that the monarch would only use the Indian title externally; within the United Kingdom the monarch would still be King or Queen rather than Emperor or Empress in ordinary and official usage except when using the \\"I\\" after \\"R\\" in signature, \\"Emperor of India\\" in public proclamations and \\"Ind. Imp.\\" on the coinage.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 811. Disraeli wanted the measure passed to let the world know that Britain would hold onto India: \\"It is only by the amplification of titles that you can often touch and satisfy the imagination of nations; and that is an element which Governments must not despise\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 805. =Social reform= The Disraeli government's programme of social reform began in the second session of parliament, 1874‚Äì75. This government, chiefly under the influence of the Home Secretary Richard Cross and with the encouragement of Disraeli, addressed \\"the condition of the people\\" through major reforms in three areas: housing, savings and labour relations.Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 703‚Äì4. Disraeli's watchword was \\"Sanitas sanitatum, omnia sanitas\\", which the Liberals decried as \\"a policy of sewage\\". Disraeli responded that sanitary reform included \\"most of the civilising influences of humanity\\".Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 702-3. The housing of the working classes was dealt with by the Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875 which for the first time gave local councils in large towns power to destroy slum buildings for sanitary reasons and replace them with new ones for artisans. Councils would compensate previous owners for this expropriation and when six years later it was seen that claims for compensation were impeding councils from embarking on housing reform an Amending Act was passed which provided that if overcrowding had created a nuisance, compensation should be given only at the value of the house after the nuisance had been remedied, so that \\"grasping and callous owners should not profit by their misdeeds\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 704. However the Act was criticised by the Radicals who believed in laissez-faire: Henry Fawcett MP scoffed at the Act and asked why Parliament should secure working-class housing and not that of dukes. The savings of the working classes were secured with the passing of the Friendly Societies Act 1875. This Act allowed friendly societies considerable self-management \\"but insured the adoption of sound rules, effective audit, and rates of payment sufficient to maintain solvency. It established the friendly societies, and with them the people's savings on a satisfactory basis\\".Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 704‚Äì5. Disraeli's government also passed two Acts which dealt with labour relations: the Employers and Workmen Act 1875 and the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875. Previously, a breach of contract by a worker was punished as a criminal act whilst an employer who breached a contract was only liable in a civil court. The Employers and Workmen Act made breaches of contract by a worker a civil offence and therefore made workers and employers equal before the law regarding labour contracts.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 705. The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act amended the law of conspiracy in favour of trade unions and legalised peaceful picketing.Blake, p. 555. Disraeli wrote to a friend that these Acts \\"will gain and retain for the Conservatives the lasting affection of the working classes\\". The Trade Union Manual of Labour Laws called these two Acts \\"the charter of the social and industrial freedom of the working classes\\" and in autumn 1875 the Labour Congress and one of the few labour members of Parliament, Alexander Macdonald, formally thanked the government for passing these measures. Macdonald told his constituents in 1879: \\"The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 709. The Public Health Act 1875 consolidated previous measures of public health and the Factory Act 1878 consolidated all previous Factory Acts, of which the veteran campaigner for Factory Acts, Lord Shaftesbury, spoke strongly in favour of in the House of Lords.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 706. Disraeli's government had previously passed a Factory Act in 1874 which reduced the working day for women and children to ten hours on a weekday and six hours on a Saturday. This was opposed by those Radicals such as Fawcett and 79 Liberals voted against it. The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 outlawed the flow of solid matter into rivers and compelled manufacturers to make sure the liquid flowing from their factories into rivers was harmless. This was again opposed by the Radicals such as Sir Charles Dilke.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 707. =Foreign policy= Disraeli and his foreign minister Lord Derby scored a number of achievements. In 1875 came the purchase of the controlling shares in the Suez Canal company. By negotiations, Russia gave up substantial gains in the Balkans and a foothold in the Mediterranean. Britain gains control of Cyprus from the Ottomans as a naval base covering the Eastern Mediterranean. In exchange, Britain guaranteed the Asiatic territories of the Ottoman Empire. Britain did not do well in conflicts in Afghanistan and South Africa.R. C. K. Ensor, England, 1870‚Äì1914 (1936), pp 37-65. online Suez Canal In 1875, the Khedive of Egypt had gone bankrupt and needed to sell shares in the Suez Canal (of whose traffic four-fifths was British) to gain money. Disraeli purchased 176,602 shares, or 44% of the Canal's total. This did not give Britain ownership, but it did give a strong voice and protection against adverse policies. The investment, financed by the Rothschilds, was financially profitable.Niall Ferguson, The House of Rothschild: Volume 2: The World's Banker: 1849-1999 (1999) pp 297-304 The market value of the shares rose from ¬£4m in 1875 to ¬£24m in 1898; by 1914 they were worth over ¬£40m.Blake, p. 586. Disraeli acted alone in a matter of hours, without consulting Parliament. The Liberals were opposed but largely kept quiet because the purchase was immensely popular. European governments were highly impressed, and saw it as evidence that Britain had finally abandoned her passivity and was embarking upon a \\"spirited foreign policy\\".R.W. Seton-Watson, Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question: A Study In Diplomacy and Party Politics (1935) p 27 Some historiansRichard A. Atkins, \\"The conservatives and Egypt, 1875‚Äì1880.\\" The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 2#2 (1974): 190-205. have argued that ownership of the canal marked a new policy, that of an extended British commitment in Egypt, together with ensuring the imperial lifeline to India and Australia would not be controlled by France. Geoffrey Hicks replies that the commitment to Egypt was the unintended consequence of a pragmatic policy. Instead, the government's goal for the purchase was quite the opposite: to control the French risk and to otherwise minimize British entanglements in the east.Geoffrey Hicks, \\"Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: Some Myths Reassessed.\\" History 97.326 (2012): 182-203. Eastern Question The \\"Eastern Question\\" was how the major powers would deal with the military and economic decline of the Ottoman Empire, especially in the face of Russian efforts to break it up and seize the best parts, such as the Straits.Richard Millman, Britain and the Eastern question, 1875‚Äì1878 (1979) Seton-Watson, Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question (1935) pp 1-15 Like British leaders before him, Disraeli believed that an integral Ottoman Empire would be barrier to Russian advance in the Mediterranean, a move that was feared as a threat to the British Empire in India. Disraeli wanted to halt possible Russian advance in the Balkans whilst avoiding war. Gladstone and the Liberals were rallying public support by denouncing Turkish atrocities against Christian communities in the Balkans, most notably in Bulgaria in 1876.Se√°n Lang, \\"Bulgarian horrors,\\" Modern History Review (2005) 16#4 pp 13-16.Seton- Watson, Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question (1935) pp 51-89.Mark Rathbone, \\"Gladstone, Disraeli and the Bulgarian Horrors.\\" History Review 50 (2004): 3-7. online Disraeli realized that his defense of the Ottomans was politically risky. Nevertheless, in public he robustly declared (in November 1875) that British interests in the East were as important as any other power's. He said in November 1876 that if war were forced on Britain by Russia, Britain \\"would not terminate till right was done\\".R. C. K. Ensor, England, 1870‚Äì1914 (1936), p. 42, quote p 46. When the Russo-Turkish War broke out in 1877 Disraeli's government declared Britain neutral as long as Britain's national interests were respected. These were the security of free communication with the East through the Suez Canal; Egyptian neutrality; and for Russia not to invade Constantinople.Ensor, pp. 46‚Äì7. The Russian foreign minister, Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov, agreed to these proposals. The Ottoman victories under Osman Pasha and Suleiman Pasha roused traditional anti-Russian feeling in Britain.Ensor, p. 47. However, when Russia recovered from these setbacks and advanced into Adrianople, Disraeli's government (on 23 January 1878) ordered the Mediterranean fleet of the Royal Navy into the Dardanelles to Constantinople and Parliament voted to raise ¬£6m for military purposes. One week later Russia granted the Ottomans an armistice. However the Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon, resigned in protest (Derby returned when the order to send the fleet was rescinded).Ensor, p. 48. When it was rumoured a week later that the Russians were in Constantinople the government sent part of the fleet to the city \\"for the protection of life and property\\" and Parliament assented to the ¬£6m without debate. In response the Russians advanced their army and an outbreak of war fever occurred in Britain and a popular music hall song gave rise to the word \\"jingoism\\" to describe bellicose patriotism. On 19 February Russia agreed not to occupy Gallipoli and Britain agreed not to land any soldiers in Turkey. However, when the Russians and the Ottomans signed the Treaty of San Stefano on 3 March, Disraeli's government viewed it as unacceptable due to its Pan-Slavism. Disraeli insisted that any European conference between the great powers must include the possible revision of the treaty. On 27 March Disraeli got the Cabinet's assent to call up the reserves and send to the Mediterranean a large number of Indian soldiers. Lord Derby resigned in reaction to this and was replaced by Lord Salisbury. Salisbury's Circular Note convinced Bismarck to a conference which could discuss the treaty and the Congress of Berlin met from 13 June to 13 July 1878. It included the heads of government of the great powers of Europe to discuss the \\"Eastern Question\\". The British plenipotentiaries were Disraeli, Salisbury and Lord Odo Russell. From the start Disraeli was \\"the lion of the Congress\\" and the centre of attention.Blake, p. 646. He made his opening address to the Congress in English rather than French, which caused a sensation and offended the Russians.Blake, p. 648. Disraeli achieved his goals regarding Bulgaria by intimating that he would leave the Congress if his demands were not met, and Russia gave way. During the Congress the Cyprus Convention (which ceded Cyprus to Britain from the Ottoman Empire in return for a defensive alliance) was announced: \\"a sensational stroke\\" which brought the plenipotentiaries attention back to Disraeli.Blake, p. 649. At the end the plenipotentiaries signed the Treaty of Berlin. When the British plenipotentiaries arrived back in England on 16 July they were met with popular acclaim. From Charing Cross to Downing Street there was an immense crowd singing patriotic songs. After arriving at Downing Street, Disraeli appeared at the window and declared that they had brought back from Berlin \\"Peace with Honour\\".Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1217‚Äì8. In his speech to the House of Lords, Disraeli asserted that through the Congress and the Cyprus Convention the threat to the British Empire was averted and that the threat to European independence in the Treaty of San Stefano had been eliminated.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1221. The Cyprus Convention was necessary to protect Britain's route to India: \\"In taking Cyprus the movement is not Mediterranean, it is Indian\\".Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1226. After Gladstone had denounced the Convention as adding to Britain's responsibilities and that it was an \\"insane convent\\" Disraeli, in a speech given on 27 July, defended it by claiming that a renewed Russia in \\"ten, fifteen, it might be twenty years\\" could invade the Ottoman Empire and march towards Constantinople. Disraeli claimed any party in power in Britain at that moment would wish to prevent Russian conquest of Asia Minor and that therefore the Convention was not adding to Britain's responsibilities but that the responsibility was already there.Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1227‚Äì8. Disraeli then asked who would enter an insane convention: English gentlemen \\"honoured by the favour of their Sovereign and the confidence of their fellow-subjects\\" or \\"a sophistical rhetorician, inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, and gifted with an egotistical imagination that can at all times command an interminable and inconsistent series of arguments to malign an opponent and to glorify himself?\\"Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1228‚Äì9. The House of Commons endorsed the Treaty with a majority of 143; it passed without division in the House of Lords.Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1230. Disraeli's biographer Robert Blake has consluded: > Judged by the criteria of tactical skill and achievement of objectives, > Disraeli's foreign policy was an undoubted success. As for the Berlin > settlement, of course it was not perfect. No treaty ever is. But it was > followed by almost as long a period of peace between the European great > powers as the interval separating the Crimean War from the Congress of > Vienna. As one of the two principal plenipotentiaries at Berlin Disraeli > must share with Bismarck some part of the credit.Blake, pp. 652‚Äì3. Landslide loss in the election of 1880 Disraeli's preoccupation with foreign affairs and his long neglect of domestic issues cost him his prime ministership in the election in 1880. Gladstone vehemently attacked the foreign policy of Disraeli (now known as Lord Beaconsfield) as utterly immoral. Historian Paul Smith paraphrases the rhetorical tone which focused on attacking \\"Beaconsfieldism\\" as a: :Sinister system of policy, which not merely involved the country in immoral, vainglorious and expensive external adventures, inimical to peace and to the rights of small peoples, but aimed at nothing less than the subversion of parliamentary government in favour of some simulacrum of the oriental despotism its creator was alleged to admire. Smith notes that there was indeed some substance to the allegations, but, \\"Most of this was partisan extravaganza, worthy of its target's own excursions against the Whigs.\\"Smith p 199 Disraeli himself was now the Earl of Beaconsfield in the House of Lords, and custom did not allow peers to campaign. His party was unable to deal effectively with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organization of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry, and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party. Besides issues of foreign policy, even more important thing Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front. The 1870s coincided with a long term global depression caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s: prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that cause much hardship among the industrial working class. The free trade system supported by both parties made Britain defenseless against the flood of cheap wheat from North America, which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power, of course, got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasized the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli's party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs. His Conservative strength fell from 351 to 238, while the Liberals jump from 250 to 353. Disraeli resigned on 21 April 1880.Smith, pp 202-3Blake, 707-13, 717 Notes Further reading * Aldous, Richard.

Domain- general learning theories also recognize that although learning different types of new information may be processed in the same way and in the same areas of the brain, different domains also function interdependently. Because these generalized domains work together, skills developed from one learned activity may translate into benefits with skills not yet learned. Another facet of domain-general learning theories is that knowledge within domains is cumulative, and builds under these domains over time to contribute to our greater knowledge structure. Psychologists whose theories align with domain- general framework include developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, who theorized that people develop a global knowledge structure which contains cohesive, whole knowledge internalized from experience, and psychologist Charles Spearman, whose work led to a theory on the existence of a single factor accounting for all general cognitive ability. Domain-general learning theories are in direct opposition to domain-specific learning theories, also sometimes called theories of Modularity. Domain-specific learning theories posit that humans learn different types of information differently, and have distinctions within the brain for many of these domains. Domain-specific learning theorists also assert that these neural domains are independent, purposed solely for the acquisition of one skill (i.e. facial recognition or mathematics), and may not provide direct benefits in the learning of other, unrelated skills.  Related Theories  = Piaget‚Äôs Theory of Cognitive Development = Jean Piaget Developmental psychologist, Jean Piaget, theorized that one's cognitive ability, or intelligence ‚Äì defined as the ability to adapt to all aspects of reality ‚Äì evolves through a series of four qualitatively distinct stages (the sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational and formal operational stages). Piaget's theory describes three core cognitive processes that serve as mechanisms for transitioning from one stage to the next. Piaget's core processes for developmental change: * Assimilation: The process of transforming new information so that it fits with ones' existing way of thinking. * Accommodation: The process of adapting ones' thinking to account for new experiences. * Equilibration: The process by which one integrates their knowledge about the world into one unified whole. However, these processes are not the only processes responsible for progressing through Piaget's developmental stages. Each stage is differentiated based upon the types of conceptual content that can be mastered within it. Piaget's theory holds that transitioning from one stage of development to the next is not only a result of assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration, but also a result of developmental changes in domain- general mechanisms. As humans mature, various domain-general mechanisms become more sophisticated, and thus, according to Piaget, allow for growth in cognitive functioning. For example, Piaget's theory notes that the humans transition into the concrete operation stage of cognitive development when they acquire the ability to take perspective, and no longer have egocentric thinking (a characteristic of the pre-operational stage). This change can be viewed as the result of developmental changes in information processing capacity. Information processing is a mechanism that is used across many different domains of cognitive functioning, and thus can be seen as a domain- general mechanism. = Psychometric Theories of Intelligence = Psychometric analysis of measurements of human cognitive abilities (intelligence) may suggest that there is a single underlying mechanism that impacts how humans learn. In the early 20th century, Charles Spearman noticed that children's scores on different measures of cognitive abilities were positively correlated. Spearman believed that these correlations could be attributed to a general mental ability or process that is utilized across all cognitive tasks. Spearman labeled this general mental ability as the g factor, and believed g could represent an individual's overall cognitive functioning. The presence of this g factor across different cognitive measures is well-established and uncontroversial in statistical research. It may be that this g factor highlights domain-general learning (cognitive mechanisms involved in all cognition), and that this general learning accounts for the positive correlations across seemingly different cognitive tasks. It is important to note, however, there currently is no consensus to what causes the positive correlations. An illustration of frame Spearman's work was expanded upon by Raymond B. Cattell, who broke g into two broad abilities: fluid intelligence (Gf) and crystallized intelligence (Gc). Cattell's student, John Horn, added additional broad abilities to Cattell's model of intelligence. In 1993, John B. Carroll added more specificity to Cattell and Horn's Gf-Gc model by adding a third layer of human intelligence factors. Carroll named these factors ‚Äúnarrow abilities‚Äù. Narrow abilities are described as abilities that do not correlate with skills outside their domain, following more along the lines of domain-specific learning theories. Despite breaking g into more specific areas, or domains of intelligence, Carroll maintained that a single general ability was essential to intelligence theories. This suggests that Carroll, to some extent, believed cognitive abilities were domain-general.  Skills That May Be Acquired via. Domain-General Mechanisms  As discussed above, Piaget's theory of cognitive development posits that periods of major developmental change come about due to maturation of domain-general cognitive mechanisms. However, although Piaget's theory of cognitive development can be credited with establishing the field of cognitive development, some aspects of his theory have not withstood the test of time. Despite this, researchers that call themselves \\"neo-Piagetians\\" have often focused on the role domain-general cognitive processes in constraining cognitive development. It had been found that many skills humans acquire require domain-general mechanisms rather than highly specialized cognitive mechanisms for development. Namely, memory, executive functioning, and language development. = Memory = One theory of memory development suggests that basic (domain-general) memory processes become more superior through maturation. In this theory, basic memory processes are frequently used, rapidly executed memory activities. These activities include: association, generalization, recognition, and recall. The basic processes theory of memory development states that these memory processes underlie all cognition, as it holds that all more complex cognitive activities are built by combining these basic processes in different ways. Thus, these memory basic processes can be seen as domain-general processes that can be applied across various domains. Domain general processes in memory development: * Association is the most basic memory process. The ability to associate stimuli with responses is present from birth. * Generalization is the tendency to respond in the same way to different but similar stimuli * Recognition describes a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information retrieved from memory * Recall is the mental process of retrieval of information from the past In addition to these general processes, working Memory in particular has been extensively studied as it relates and functions as a domain-general mechanism to constraints on cognitive development. For example, researchers believe that with maturation, one is able to hold more complex structures in their working memory, which results in an increase of possible computations that underlie inference and learning. Thus, working memory can be viewed as a domain-general mechanism that aids development across many different domains. = Executive Functions = Researchers have expanded the search for domain-general mechanisms that underlie cognitive development beyond working memory. The advancement in cognitive neuroscience technology is credited as making this expansion possible. Within the last decade, researchers have begun to focus on a group of cognitive mechanisms, collectively named Executive Functions. Mechanisms commonly labeled executive functions include: working memory, inhibition, set shifting, as well as higher-order mechanisms that involve combinations of the prior (planning, problem-solving, reasoning). Piagetian tasks ‚Äì tasks that measure behaviors that relate to cognitive abilities associated with Piaget's developmental stages ‚Äì have been used in studies of cognitive neuroscience to investigate whether executive functions relate to cognitive development. Such studies revealed that the maturation of the prefrontal cortex (an area of the brain identified to underlie the development of executive functions such as working memory and inhibition) may relate to success on tasks that measure the Piagetian concept of object permanence. Thus, this research supports Piaget's notion that developmental changes in domain-general mechanisms promote cognitive development. = Language = The general cognitive processes perspective of language development emphasizes characteristics of the language learner as the source of development. The general cognitive processes perspective states that the broad cognitive processes are sufficient for a child to learn new words. These broad cognitive processes include: attending, perceiving, and remembering. Important to this perspective is the idea that such cognitive processes are domain-general, and are applied to learning many different kinds of information in addition to benefiting word acquisition. This perspective contrasts the grammatical cues perspective, which emphasizes characteristics of the language input as a source of development. Furthermore, the general cognitive processes perspective also contrasts the constraints perspective of language development, in which children are said to be able to learn many words quickly because of constraints that are specialized for language learning. *  Opposing Theories  The relationship between domain general learning and domain specific learning (also known as the modularity debate or modularity of mind) has been an ongoing debate for evolutionary psychologists. The modularity of mind or modularity debate states that the brain is constructed of neural structures (or modules) which have distinct functions. Jerry Fodor, an American philosopher and cognitive scientist, stated in his 1983 book that brain modules are specialized and may only operate on certain kinds of inputs. According to Fodor, a module is defined as ‚Äúfunctionally specialized cognitive systems‚Äù. These modules are said to be mostly independent, develop on different timetables, and are influenced by a variety of different experiences an individual may have.Callaghan, T. C. (2005). Cognitive Development Beyond Infancy. In B. Hopkins (Ed.), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Child Development (pp. 204‚Äì209). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX1311100053&v;=2.1&u;=cuny_hunter‚Å¢=r&p;=GVRL&sw;=w&asid;=c822fe0523f5b1258756f6e7855acc8d Some argue that Piaget's domain general theory of learning undermines the influence of socio-cultural factors on an individual's development. More specifically, the theory does not explain the influence of parental nurture and social interactions on human development. Domain-specific learning is a theory in developmental psychology that says the development of one set of skills is independent from the development of other types of skills. This theory suggests that training or practice in one area may not influence another. Domain-specificity has been defined by Frankenhuis and Ploeger as that ‚Äúa given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information‚Äù. Furthermore, domain-specific learning prescribes different learning activities for students in order to meet required learning outcomes. Modern cognitive psychologists suggest a more complex relationship between domain-generality and domain-specificity in the brain. Current research suggests these networks may exist together in the brain, and the extent to which they function in tandem may vary by task and skill-level. Possible Applications = Workplaces = Technology advancements and changes in the labor market show the need for workers/employees to be adaptive. This may suggest that school curricular should incorporate activities focusing on developing the necessary skills for dynamic environments. People tend to use domain-general learning processes when initially learning how to perform and complete certain tasks, and less so once these tasks become extensively practiced. = Early Childhood Education = Problem solving is considered to be an individual's ability to partake in cognitive processing in order to understand and solve problems where a solution may not be immediately apparent. Domain-specific problem solving skills may provide students with narrow knowledge and abilities. Because of this, school teachers, policy makers and curriculum developers may find it beneficial to incorporate domain general skills (such as time management, teamwork or leadership) in relation to problem solving into school curriculum. Domain general problem solving provides students with cross-curricular skills and strategies that can be transferred to multiple different situations/environments/domains. Examples of cross-curricular skills include, but are not limited to: information processing, self-regulation and decision making. = Language Development = Additionally, linguistic knowledge and language development are examples of domain-general skills. Infants can learn rules and identify patterns in stimuli which may imply learning and generalizable knowledge. This means parents of young children and early childhood educators may want to consider its application while supporting language development.

The film was designed by Robert Edmond Jones, who was hired by Pioneer Pictures to design the film in a way to show the new full-color Technicolor Process No. 4 (\\"three-strip\\" Technicolor) at its best. Process No. 4 had been used since 1932, mainly in Walt Disney cartoons. Jock Whitney and his cousin C. V. Whitney, the owners of Pioneer, were also major investors in Technicolor. La Cucaracha was made like a short feature and cost about $65,000. The usual short film at that time cost little more than $15,000 to film. Although La Cucaracha is sometimes called the first live-action use of Process No. 4, it was preceded by a musical number in the feature film The Cat and the Fiddle, released by MGM in February 1934, and in some short sequences filmed for other movies made during 1934, including the final sequences of The House of Rothschild (Twentieth Century Pictures/United Artists) with George Arliss. Also, Warner Brothers released a Leon Errol short, Service With a Smile (released July 28, 1934), just before La Cucaracha. Producer Kenneth Macgowan won an Oscar in 1935 for Best Short Subject (Comedy) for this film. Plot Se√±or Martinez, a famous theater owner, visits a local caf√© in Mexico because of its reputation for good food and to audition the famous dancer who performs there. Martinez tells the caf√© owner that if the dancer is as good as he has heard, he will offer the dancer a contract to perform in his theater.

However, they acknowledged that the bike was fast, and a sales team led by BSA Vice-President Don Brown decided to launch the bike by using a Rocket-3 to set some records at Daytona, records which were broken in 1971 by the Kawasaki Z1. Brown felt that the BSA/Triumph triples needed a different look to succeed in the USA, and he engaged designer Craig Vetter to give the BSA A75 a customised face-lift, with a brief to make it \\"sleeker and more balanced\\". (Brown revealed the Vetter project to Peter Thornton, President of BSA/Triumph North America, but as Brown's initiative had not been authorised by BSA, Vetter had problems being paid, waiting two years for his fee). Vetter created the Triumph Hurricane in the summer of 1969,Craig Vetter‚Äôs (designer) web site and in October 1969 he unveiled the prototype with \\"BSA\\" on the tank as the new ‚ÄòRocket Three‚Äô. Thornton and the American officials were impressed, and Vetter's bike was then sent to the UK, but the bike arrived in England just as the BSA marque was about to be ended. At BSA-Triumph's design facility at Umberslade Hall, the design was seen as too \\"trendy\\" by chief designer Bert Hopwood; but after very positive public reaction to the design when it appeared on the front of US magazine Cycle World in September 1970, the UK managers changed their minds. They realised they had a large stock of obsolete BSA Rocket-3 parts that could now be turned into a premium-priced motorcycle. Engineer Steve Mettam was given the job of supervising production for the 1972/3 season; and the Vetter BSA Rocket3 became the Triumph X75 Hurricane. 1,183 engines were put aside for X75 production. However, BSA was facing bankruptcy and the design went into a limited production run of 1200 as the Triumph X-75 Hurricane in 1972. Production stopped in 1973 after the X-75 was unable to meet new American noise standards.Craig Vetters database of Hurricanes (accessed 2008-05-12) The prototype BSA Hurricane is on display at the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame museum in Pickerington, Ohio. on display ;Hurricane at Birmingham National Motorcycle Museum { frameless frameless frameless } See also *List of Triumph motorcycles References External links * Story of the X-75 design @ motohistory.net H Category:Standard motorcycles Category:Motorcycles designed by Craig Vetter ","title":"Triumph X-75 Hurricane"},{"id":"17371444","text":"' was a Japanese fudai daimy≈ç of the Edo period.

Some sources spell his surname as Heywood or Hayward.  Biography  Haywood was born in Horninglow, Burton upon Trent. He turned professional with Woolwich Arsenal in January 1896; he made his debut against Leicester Fosse on 25 January 1896 and was an ever-present for the rest of the 1895-96 season. He continued to play as a mainstay in the Arsenal side the following three seasons, scoring regularly as well (his best being 1898-99, when he scored 12 goals in 23 league games). In total he played 91 times for Arsenal, scoring 36 goals, but Arsenal's financial situation meant they were forced to accept a ¬£50 bid from Glossop North End in May 1899. Haywood spent just three months at Glossop before joining Queens Park Rangers in August 1899, becoming part of an experienced squad of ex-League players, including four ex-Arsenal colleagues. While at QPR, Haywood was part of the Rangers side who beat Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1900.Match report of Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Queens Park Rangers 1900 Wolves were so impressed by Haywood's display over the two games that, within a year, via a short stay at New Brompton, he was signed by the First Division club, going on to make over a century of top-flight appearances. May 1905 saw him transfer to West Bromwich Albion, where he was the club's top league scorer during 1905‚Äì06, finding the net 21 times. He remained at Albion for two-and-a-half years before signing for Blackpool. He made his debut for Blackpool, in the number-8 shirt, on 30 November 1907, in a defeat at Derby County. He made twelve more League appearances for the club before the end of the 1907‚Äì08 season, his final one being in a defeat at Lincoln City, this time in the number-10 shirt. He scored one goal during his short career on the Fylde Coast ‚Äì in a 2‚Äì1 Lancashire derby defeat at Burnley on Christmas Day. He also made one FA Cup appearance for Blackpool ‚Äì in yet another defeat, this time at the hands of Manchester United at Old Trafford on New Year's Day, 1908. He joined Crystal Palace as player-coach in May 1908, finally retiring from playing football in 1909.*  Death  Haywood died in May 1932.

Creation and casting In 2000 an Australian consultant made several large changes to the show that would see a more working class hospital portrayed. Adam and his mother, Barb and brother, Marshall were introduced through the revamp. As part of the revamp, producers wished for a more community based cast with established family links, mimicking the past presence of the Warner and McKenna families. The Heywood's were created to fulfill this role. Leighton Cardno auditioned for the role and quickly won it. He had little expectations but quickly found he loved the job and relished the opportunity. Cardno was also acting in a series based for teenagers called Being Eve and as such, Adam was portrayed with long dirty hair, something the character would traditionally not have. Although Cardno enjoyed his time on the show, upon arrival he decided to only stay short term so as not to become a \\"Ken Barlow\\". Storylines Adam arrived to Ferndale alongside his mother Barb (Annie Whittle) and brother Marshall (Paul Reid). He got a job at the hospital and briefly dated Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) before a brief fling with Robyn Stokes (Kirstie O'Sullivan) which ended when she slept with Marshall. He started a romance with Toni Thompson (Laura Hill). However Adam discovered he was in love with Waverley (Claire Chitham), only to end up sleeping with Toni again. He and Waverley finally got together as the year ended. Waverley eventually dumped Adam and he returned to Toni. But Toni dumped Adam and he attempted to sabotage her wedding to Matt McAllister (Roy Snow). Adam was stabbed by Victor's (Calvin Tuteao) nemesis, Kurt. Adam survived the stabbing but developed a reliance on his medication. Adam reunited with Toni in the aftermath of his addiction but the two broke up indefinitely before Adam departed to the United States. Character development =Characterisation= Upon arrival, Adam was labelled the most responsible of the Heywood family and someone wiser than his years. The character's debut year set up the characters initial characterisation but the following year, Adam vastly changed with Cardno stating; \\"all the strengths of Adam that they established in the first year, this year they flipped around and used them against them. So for someone who was confident and supportive, he's become controlling, dominant and stuck in his ways.\\" Cardno enjoyed portraying the darker side of the character saying; \\"It's interesting to move towards playing the dark aspects of a person. I felt like last year I was more or less a function, the nice guy. I felt [this year] like I've been exploring new territory, going into areas that were interesting and challenging. That's when it starts to become fun.\\" Reception Upon arrival, Cardno opted that the Heywood family unit would be a positive for Shortland Street, stating; \\"We're people you can relate to. We're the middle-class striving family, never learning lessons. We're good for the Street.\\" Adam's declaration of love towards Waverley Wilson was viewed on positively, something producer ‚Äì Harriet Crampton, believed was due to it being unexpected. After Adam was stabbed in the 2002 cliffhanger, a phone poll was taken and a majority of voters hoped Adam would not survive.

Outside of literary mainstream, he spent most of his life in extreme poverty. He is still unknown to a wider public but has been praised by several well-known authors for his writing and his radical thinking about life and literature.  Biography  Hohl was the son of a pastor and was born in the small town of Netstal. He went to Gymnasium in Frauenfeld but was expelled due to the alleged bad influence he had on other students. He never worked in an ordinary profession and spent most of his life in poverty suffering from alcoholism. From 1924 to 1937 he lived outside of Switzerland, first in Paris (1924‚Äì1930), then in Vienna (1930/31) and The Hague (1931‚Äì1937). He then returned to Switzerland and lived first in Biel, then in Geneva, from 1954 to 1974 in a small basement flat which became legendary. His financial situation then improved due to an inheritance, but in his last years, he suffered from several physical illnesses. Hohl died in 1980 from an inflammation of his legs. He had been married five times and had one daughter. Hohl's works never gained him commercial success; he published several himself. His small income came from writing for magazines and newspapers as well as private and public support. In the 1940s and 50s, he took legal action against his publisher who refused to print the second volume of his Notizen (see below) because the first volume had sold less than two hundred copies. Hohl won ‚Äì which, according to some sources, substantially improved the position of authors versus publishers in Swiss jurisdiction ‚Äì but the second volume sold equally badly. In the 1970s, he finally achieved some recognition from the literary world. Siegfried Unseld, head of the renowned German publishing house Suhrkamp Verlag, had been introduced to Hohl by Adolf Muschg, and Unseld and Hohl agreed on a contract for a new edition of Hohl's works. In 1970 and 1976, Hohl was awarded prizes by the Schweizerische Schillerstiftung, in 1978 he received a special prize dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Robert Walser's birth, and in 1980 he won the Petrarca-Preis. Ludwig Hohl's literary estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern.  Works  Hohl published some poems and stories. His best work of fiction may be the narrative Bergfahrt (the German word Bergfahrt, literary mountain ride, is an old term for climbing), which he wrote in 1926, rewrote several times over the next decades and which was finally published in 1975. An English edition of this novella, called Ascent, was published in 2012; it is the first and, as of 2013, only English translation of one of Hohl's works. Many regard Die Notizen oder Von der unvoreiligen Vers√∂hnung as Hohl's opus magnum. The title could be translated as Notes, or: On Non-Premature Reconciliation. Hohl wrote it in 1934-36; problems with his publisher (see above) delayed the publication until 1954; it was re-published, with some additions and in one volume, in 1981, a few months after his death. The volume is divided into twelve parts (with titles like 'On Working', 'On Writing', 'On Death') which consist of hundreds of numbered 'notes' in the form of short essays, aphorisms, quotations, poems, outlines for stories etc. Hohl insisted that these notes are not a disparate collection but have a deep inner connection. The main thought which lies behind them is that there is only one true meaning of life, namely to exercise one's own creative forces. This is what Hohl calls 'Arbeit' (work). This 'work' includes the philosophical concepts of knowledge and action, which become one in the person who works. Hohl also polemizes against the masses of people who do not 'work' in this way, but are very busy trying to 'avoid' such true work. Hohl personifies this flawed way of life in his antagonist, 'der Apotheker' (the pharmacist) or 'Herr Meier' (Mr. Average). A second volume with similar format was not published until after Hohl's death. It is called 'Von den hereinbrechenden R√§ndern' ('On the margins closing in') or simply 'Nachnotizen' ('After-notes'). Hohl often quotes the few authors and thinkers he held in highest esteem. They include Goethe, Lichtenberg, Montaigne and Spinoza. He called Goethe's writings his 'daily bread'. Hohl's opinion was that many good things had already been said, and that he would not be able to improve on the way in which those thinkers had said them, but that it was important to re-think them for oneself. Hohl dismissed most literature because it was not the product of 'work'. Among the few writers he praised are Honor√© de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Karl Kraus and Katherine Mansfield.  Influence  As of 2016, Hohl's influence remains extremely limited. Most of his works are (again) out of print. However, there have been several authors who have praised Hohl's writing, including the Swiss authors Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, Max Frisch and Adolf Muschg as well as the Austrian writer Peter Handke.

Listed at , 158 lb., he batted and threw right- handed. Career A native of Bloomfield, Iowa, Rawlings attended high school in Los Angeles. He started his professional career in 1911 with the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League. Rawlings entered the majors in 1914 with the Cincinnati Reds, appearing for them in 33 games before jumping during the mid-season to the Kansas City Packers of the outlaw Federal League. After one and a half seasons in Kansas City, he spent 1917 with the Toledo Iron Men of the American Association. Rawlings returned to major league action with the Boston Braves (1917-20), and later played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1920-'21), New York Giants (1921-'22) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1923-26). His most productive season came in 1921 for Phillies and Giants, when he posted career highs in hits (156), runs (60), extrabases (27), RBI (46) and games played (146), while hitting .278 average. In 1922, Rawlings hit .282 in 82 games, good enough to play for John McGraw's National League pennant winning Giants in 1921 and 1922. He hit .333 (10-for-30) with three doubles and four RBI for the 1921 Giants World Series champions. Of particular note was the last play in the series, the last time a best-of-nine game format was used. With the Giants winning in the ninth inning and the Yankees facing elimination, Yankees manager Miller Huggins sent Babe Ruth in to pinch hit to lead off the inning. Ruth had knee and elbow injuries and had missed Games 6 and 7 completely, and had sat out Game 8 thus far. He grounded out to the first baseman unassisted. Aaron Ward coaxed a walk, and represented the tying run. The next batter was Home Run Baker. After fouling off several pitches, he hit a ball that appeared to have eyes for right field. Ward took off on contact. Rawlings reached the ball, and after tumbling, threw to first base from his knees to get the out. Ward inexplicably continued running, rounded second base, and with his head down, barreled toward third. An astute throw to Frank Frisch at third base nailed Ward for the third out, and the Series was won by the Giants. Six seasons later, the winning pitcher, Art Nehf, then with the Cincinnati Reds, would call Rawlings' snag the best play he had ever seen.Evening Tribune (San Diego, California) ‚Äì March 15, 1927 ‚Äì p. 27 In all, Rawlings earned three World Series rings, though he did not play for the 1922 Giants and 1925 Pirates series champions. During an early September game at Pittsburgh against the St. Louis Cardinals, Rawlings, now playing for the eventual World Champion Pirates, broke the fibula near the ankle in his left leg, while sliding into second base. The injury would keep him out of the World Series, and would cut short his major league playing career the following year. Following his major league career, Rawlings played in the minors until 1930. He began the 1930 season with the Pacific Electric ball club in Los Angeles, but by June, fate found him playing infield on the same Texas League Dallas Steers ball club with former Major League great Grover Cleveland Alexander, a future Baseball Hall of Famer. After he was released by the Steers in June, Rawlings signed on in July as a utility infielder with the Los Angeles Angels. From the 1940s Rawlings coached for a number of years and also managed during eight years in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for the Grand Rapids Chicks (1946-'50), Peoria Redwings (1951) and Rockford Peaches (1953-'54). He led his teams to six playoff appearances, including a Championship Title with the 1947 Chicks. Personal life Johnny Rawlings was married to the former Alexia Selma Wieben (1894‚Äì1986) in Los Angeles, California on October 19, 1917. They had two daughters, Audrey (later Mrs. Jack Perry), who was born in 1921 in Pennsylvania, and Joanne (later Mrs. Jack Lynwood), who was born in 1927 in California. Shortly after his retirement from playing baseball, Johnny Rawlings was an insurance salesman in Los Angeles.Omaha World Herald (Omaha, Nebraska)- Friday, August 5, 1932 ‚Äì p.17 Rawlings died in Inglewood, California in 1972, at the age of 80.

Over the next several years he was released and readmitted to the hospital many times(from the book Tarcisio Merati opere 1975-1991 print in the 1993). From 1974 to 1984, Merati's mental condition did not change greatly, but his creative output increased. A clinical note dated 23 July 1983 reads: \\"He‚Äôs discreetly clean, in the atelier [occupational therapy ward] too, he draws pictures quite abstract (from article of Maria Rita Parsi in Tarcisio Merati opere 1975-1991 print in the 1993). Actually those years are the more interesting in his artistic production(from the book Tarcisio Merati opere 1975-1991 print in the 1993. During this time, Merati's care was managed by Amilcare Cristini, who befriended Merati and introduced him to painting. Painting is not the only passion of \\"coccolone\\", he‚Äôs very good with words and music too. As a matter of fact at the beginning he was famous, and sometimes searched, for his particular and eccentric way of talking, and for his unintelligible but genial dialectic performances. The music played by him (especially on the unturned piano in the atelier) had some obsessive and minimalist characteristics. In his artistic collection his objects are often repeated; they‚Äôre always Story Toy, just simple abstract toys which he describes as \\"macchinetta trombetta\\" (trumpet machine) or \\"aeroplanino silurino\\" (torpedo airplane) not to mention the without numbers \\"uccellino sul nidino\\" (bird in his little nest), the cactus and the pine cones. After the Basaglia‚Äôs Law, dated 1983, with frequent permissions and later in 1984 he‚Äôs free to leave the hospital when he desires. As a consequence he has to leave the Atelier, has to live with his sister and that‚Äôs when Merati gives up painting. In 1991 Tarcisio moves to a home for the aged near the old hospital and near to the beloved Atelier. Thank to some permissions he can go and start drawing again, but his rhythm is very slow and tired. Nevertheless in 1993 a big event happens: at the Social Theatre of Bergamo his first exhibition is organized and later, in 2006 there has been a second exhibition titled \\"Beyond the reason\\" that Bergamo and the county of Lombardia dedicate to the mayor artist of the mental hospital art, the so- called Art Brut. Unfortunately Merati doesn‚Äôt live here, he died in 1995, 22 October because of a lung cancer. It is deserving to remember how many things in common Merati has with another marginal artist, another great protagonist as Adolf W√∂lfli. Both shared a surprising simile and (without knowing it) biography, artistic style and human characteristics. Extracted by a critical report of Bianca Tosatti: '' ... Tarcisio Merati is the manicomia artist for excellence: to the shelter from the hostile world against which he is insert in form of novelist, musician, political man, teacher; to the shelter from the poverties and from the vulgarity he can finally devote to the operation of the wonder.''

It was activated in June 1941 as a light tank battalion, equipped with M3 Stuart tanks, and sent to Iceland as part of the garrison force in mid-1942. After a year it moved to the United Kingdom, in mid-1943, and was landed in Normandy on D+10, 16 June 1944. It was attached to the 2nd Infantry Division and fought in the St-Lo area. When the 2nd Division moved westwards towards Brest in mid-August, the battalion was attached to the 4th Cavalry Group, with which it would serve for the remainder of the war. Moving eastwards, it crossed the Seine north of Paris in late August with VII Corps, then over the Meuse, entering Germany on 13 September. In December, it moved north into the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, and was the first unit to receive the M24 Chaffee tank. It then took up defensive positions, before reaching the Rhine in early March. It moved through Germany capturing a number of small towns in April, and ended the war in Aschersleben, eastern Germany, where it began occupation duties. Limitations of the M3/M5 light tank Major Loyal Fairall, who commanded the battalion in August/September 1944, wrote of the limitations of the Stuart light tank: > ...(it) is apparent that a Light Tank Battalion, armed with only 37mm guns, > unless very skillfully employed with Infantry, will suffer severe casualties > in men and material.

The original party, founded by Nigerien Progressive Party (PPN) co-leader Djibo Bakary when he was expelled from the PPN. In the mid-1950s it created a broad coalition led by urban leftists but forged of conservative rural notables, especially from Hausa areas, which dominated the nascent Nigerien independence movement. In this period it was renamed Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba, and then simply Sawaba. In pushing for complete independence from France in a 1958 referendum, the party fractured. At independence in 1960 it found itself in opposition and outlawed by Niger's first president, Hamani Diori. From exile, the party attempted an abortive guerrilla campaign in the mid-1960s, and then largely disappeared. Its leadership returned to Niger following the 1974 military coup, but soon found themselves arrested, in exile, or marginalised. Following the return of democracy in 1991, the now elderly Bakary re-founded the party as UDFP-Sawaba. In the 1993 elections it took only a small numbers of votes. Within the year the party had split, with a new faction (UDFR-Sawaba) joining the government coalition. Despite Bakary's death in 1998 and their continued electoral underachievement, both parties holding the Sawaba name continue. History =Pre-independence= Sawaba was an outgrowth of several sources, and passed through several name changes prior to Niger's independence from France in 1959-1960. Under first the French Union and then the French Community, the colonies of French West Africa began to develop semi-autonomous political institutions in the decade and a half of the French Fourth Republic. Territories, like Niger, were granted consultative posts, first to the colonial government of West Africa (in Dakar), and later in Territorial Assemblies. These bodies had very limited powers, limited seats for Africans, and those elected were chosen by a very restricted electorate.Samuel Decalo. Historical Dictionary of Niger (3rd ed.). Scarecrow Press, Boston & Folkestone, (1997) pp. 56-59 (\\"Bakary\\"), 247-255 (\\"Political Parties\\"), 272 (\\"SAWABA\\") In 1946 the single pro-independence party in Niger was the Nigerien Progressive Party (PPN), of which Djibo Bakary was a prominent member, and which numbered only 5,000 members.Decalo (1997), p.243. Simultaneously, these colonial territories were allowed limited representation in the French National Assembly, with Niger allotted one seat in 1946 and a second in 1948. PPN Party leader Hamani Diori filled the first, and a French educated Niamey lawyer, Djibo Bakary filled the second.Decalo (1997), p.242. Bakary, a leftist, helped push the party‚Äîalready perceived as anti-French‚Äîin a populist direction. The PPN was allied to the pan-colony African Democratic Rally (RDA), which itself caucused with the French Communist Party in the National Assembly. Some elements, such as RDA leader F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, were uncomfortable with this connection. Many in the PPN felt the same way, while many other, grouped around Bakary and the tiny Nigerien Trades Union movement, pulled to the left. Earlier splits of the PPN, of conservative Djerma traditional leaders and a small Franco-Nigerien contingent in 1946, were added to 1948 in reaction to Bakary and his circle and to the continued association with the RDA. Harou Kouka and Georges Condat split to form a group (Parti Independent du Niger-Est, PINE) that quickly joined with previous dissidents to create the Union of Nigerien Independents and Sympathisers (UNIS). This relatively conservative coalition benefited from French support, and gained control of the consultative institutions of the Niger colony from 1948-1952. Formation of UDN In the interim, the PPN split further. The RDA, never ideologically cohesive, finally split from the French Communist Party, in 1951, in part because of the ideological differences of most African independence leaders with Communism, but also under pressure of vehemently anti-communist Colonial administrators in French West Africa, and at the urging of moderates like the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in the French Assembly. The PPN then split on the issue of connection to the Communists, a rupture that had been growing since its formation. Djibo Bakary was expelled from the RDA for his refusal to break from the PCF, and the left of the PPN formed the UDN (Nigerien Democratic Union) in 1954. The UDN, although small in numbers and led by a leftist Djerma intellectual, had powerful support amongst elements of the Hausa east of Niger, who viewed the UNIS (one of whose leaders was the Djermakoy of Dosso) as unrepresentative of their interests. In 1954-56 the UNIS itself split over involvement in the African Convention coalition, fracturing into the Nigerien Democratic Forces (FDN) and the Nigerien Action Bloc (BNA). The PPN was the winner in this confusion, forming the largest alliance of traditional rulers while retaining its pro-independence stance. The UDN, on the other hand, became the primary opposition, with some PPN members claiming Bakary was being aided by the French, simply to damage the PPN. Rule In the 1955 Territorial elections, the BNA defeated the PPN, with the UDN making little ground. But politics in the Niger Territory of this period was a largely unideological game of traditional and urban elites. The 1955 elections saw less than 250,000 votes cast in a nation of almost 3 million, and these were mostly won in blocks directed by the elite of Djermakoys, Sultans, Mais, Sarkis, and chiefs. Between 1954 and 1956, Bakary and the UDN managed to cobble together a coalition of Zinder merchants, Maradi notables, the Djermakoy and his BNA party, and the tiny urban labour and leftist movements of Niamey.Finn Fuglestad.

The Journal of African History, Vol. 14, No. 2 (1973), pp. 313-330 This last group led the UDN into an interterritorial faction called the African Socialist Movement (MSA). The UDN absorbed the BNA, and took the name \\"Sawaba\\": Hausa for \\"Freedom\\". In the run up to the 1956 Niger colony municipal elections, while negotiations were still ongoing to create the MSA bloc, the Nigerien party preemptively rechristened itself Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba. This new bloc, aided by the distaste of the French authorities for the PPN, led Sawaba to victory in Niamey and Hausaland. In 1956 Bakary became the mayor of Niamey.Behnke, Alison. Niger in pictures. Minneapolis: Twenty-First Century Books, 2008. p. 28 In 1957 the party won the Territorial legislative elections, and Bakary, as party leader, became President of the Niger Territorial Assembly.Mamoudou Djibo. Les enjeux politiques dans la colonie du Niger (1944-1960). Autrepart no 27 (2003), pp. 41-60.Abbink, J./de Bruijn, Mirjam/van Walraven, Klaas. Rethinking resistance revolt and violence in African history. Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2003. p. 225 But Sawaba's left soon fell afoul of the Territories French administrator, Governor Colombani. With the Creation of the French Fifth Republic, all French colonial territories were to vote on a new mandate for the continuation of French control in a new, if largely unchanged, structure, the French Community. The 1956 reforms of the Loi Cadre and the French Union had not dampened resistance to French rule in east Asia, Madagascar and elsewhere. The 1958 constitution aimed to do just this. With the RDA leadership behind the new reform, the French seemed certain to maintain legal authority for their control of West Africa, until two African parties unexpectedly came out for a \\"No\\" vote: Sekou Toure's Guinean Democratic Party in Guinea and Djibo Bakary and Sawaba. The French authorities in Guinea failed to, despite much effort, to encourage or coerce a \\"yes\\" vote, and it became the first of the French African colonies to declare independence in December 1958. Sawaba, on the other hand, was roundly defeated, garnering barely 20% of the vote. Its Hausa, Fulani and Djerma traditionalist leaders deserted the party and the French withdrew their support and began to aid the PPN, who had formed their own coalition to advocate for a \\"Yes\\" vote on the referendum. The vote was immediately followed by one for the new Nigerien Constituent Assembly which was to replace the Territorial Assembly under the French plan. The PPN not only won, but took 44 seats to Sawaba's 8. With the ascension of Diori and the PPN, Sawaba was banned by the authorities in 1959, just prior to the first elections for the new National Assembly of Niger. Niger did not have multiparty legislative elections again until 1993. =Post-independence= Underground 1960-1974 In June 1960, 18 Sawabists were arrested on conspiracy charges, including Abdoulaye Mamani, Amadou Sekou and Issaka Koke. The party was forced underground. Bakary went into exile, to Ghana, East Germany and Guinea until 1975.Klaas Van Walraven. Sawaba's Rebellion in Niger (1964‚Äì1965): Narrative and Meaning. In Abbink, de Bruijn, van Walraven (eds). Rethinking resistance revolt and violence in African history. Leiden/Boston: Brill, (2003). p. 226 Gradually Sawaba moved from a pro-Soviet to a pro-China position. On April 13, 1963, the party tried to kill president Hamani Diori with a grenade attack. Guerrilla forces were allegedly trained in Algeria, Ghana and China. In November 1964 the Sawaba guerrillas entered Niger attacking the small desert outpost of Tamanrasset, and after engaging in a high-profile skirmish, were arrested. Both the government and Sawaba publicised this for their own ends.Klaas Van Walraven. From Tamanrasset: The struggle of Sawaba and the Algerian connection, 1957-1966. The Journal of North African Studies, Volume 10, Issue 3 & 4 September 2005 , pages 507 - 528 With the overthrow of Malian leader Modibo Keita in 1968, and the eventual death of Chairman Mao Zedong in China, the party reoriented itself back to a pro-Soviet position.van Walraven (2003) p. 218 1974-91 Following the 1974 coup which removed Diori, Bakary returned to Niger in an attempt to bring Sawaba above ground, but he, like his old rival, was confined to house arrest under the military regime in 1977, accused of breaking his pledge to say out of politics.van Walraven (2003) p. 226 Post-1991 Following the move to democratization in 1991-1993, Sawaba re-emerged as a left-wing parliamentary party. Bakary led the party, now called the UDFP-Sawaba. In 1992, the tiny party split further, with the UDFR-Sawaba moving to a center-left position and from 1991 to 1996 becoming a minor member of the Alliance of the Forces of Change (AFC) coalition, ironically beside the reformation of its bitter enemy from the 1950s, the PPN. Djibo Bakary led the UDFP-Sawaba faction into coalition with the rival National Movement for the Development of Society coalition, until his death in 1998; the 1993 parliamentary elections saw the party win two seats in the National Assembly, and in the subsequent presidential elections, Bakary finished last in a field of eight candidates with 1.7% of the vote. Sawaba lost both seats in the early elections in 1995, and boycotted the 1996 parliamentary elections that followed a coup earlier in the year. The party returned to contest the 1999 general elections, but received only 0.6% of the vote and failed to win a seat. The 2004 elections saw its vote share fall to 0.5%, with the party remaining seatless. It did not contest the 2009 parliamentary elections or the 2011 or 2016 general elections.

The name was given in the 19th century to identify the maker or makers of a body of work consisting of 67 paintings to which since 40 more have been added.Hans M. Schmidt, et al. \\"Masters, anonymous, and monogrammists.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 Feb. 2016 The Master created female figures in genre scenes, small religious and mythological works, landscapes and portraits. Identification of the oeuvre Rest on the flight into Egypt The works attributed to the Master of the Female Half-Lengths were apparently the product of a large workshop that specialized in small-scale panels depicting aristocratic young ladies at half-length. The ladies are shown engaging in various activities such as reading, writing, or playing musical instruments. The women all share the same heart-shaped face and gentle demeanor. The expressions of the female figures are characterised by their sweetness and grace. The Master clearly expressed in these works the high artistic and moral humanistic values of the Northern Renaissance.D√≠az Mat√≠as Padr√≥n, Una tabla del maestro de las medias figuras atribu√≠da a Ambrosio Benson en la galer√≠a Phillips de Londres., in: Bolet√≠n de la Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, no 69, 1989, p. 169-178 The figures are typically placed in a wood- panelled interior or against a neutral background. Some of the women are represented with an ointment jar, the attribute of Mary Magdalene. Lady writing at a desk To the Master are also attributed a few paintings of mythological subjects and copies of standardized compositions such as the Crucifixion, the Deposition, the Virgin of Sorrows, St Jerome and Lucretia. These religious paintings are characterised by the prominence of the landscape settings and the small figures. The workshop nature of the production of these paintings as shown in the repetition of motifs and compositions and the lack of indications of their patronage or destination point a production aimed mainly at the open market and export. A few portrait paintings have also been attributed to the artist. Identification of the artist There is no agreement on the Master's identity and the place and period of his activity. Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen and the French court have been proposed for the location of his workshop. Estimates for his period of activity vary from the early to the late 16th century. Generally, it is believed the master was active in the early 16th century.Master of the Female Half-Lengths at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The art historian Otto Benesch proposed an identification with the Bruges artist named Jan or Hans Vereycke. This identification has not found universal support among art historians. Some art historian have argued that the artist must have worked in Antwerp or Mechelen in the 1520s and 1530s since the landscapes of the master are close to those of Joachim Patinir and the female types resemble those of Bernard van Orley. Certain similarities between the Master's work and that of the Bruges artists Ambrosius Benson and Adriaen Isenbrant have also been observed. While his figures show an affinity with those of Isenbrant who worked in Bruges, the Master is more likely to have been active in Antwerp. The reasons are that he seems to have worked mainly for the export trade for which Antwerp was then the principal hub in Flanders and that his landscapes relied on the landscapes of Joachim Patinir. A similarity between the figures of the Master and those of another anonymous painter active in Antwerp referred to as the Master with the Parrot has also been noted.

Neu-aufgefundene Saurier- √úberreste aus dem lithographischen Schiefern und dem oberen Jurakalk. Abhandlungen der Mathemat.-Physikalischen Classe der K√∂niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 6: 661-710.  Distribution  Several other species have since been named, including C. suevicus by Fraas in 1901 (originally as a species of Geosaurus).Fraas E. 1901.

One former species, C. medius (named by Wagner in 1858) has since been reclassified as a junior synonym of Rhacheosaurus gracilis.

Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 39: 1467‚Äì1483.  Classification  The original three skulls (all assigned to different species) were poorly known, and the genus had been considered a junior synonym of Metriorhynchus, Geosaurus or Dakosaurus by different palaeontologists in the past.Steel R. 1973. Crocodylia. Handbuch der Pal√§oherpetologie, Teil 16. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer Verlag, 116 pp. Some phylogenetic analysis did not support the monophyly of Cricosaurus,Young MT. 2007. The evolution and interrelationships of Metriorhynchidae (Crocodyliformes, Thalattosuchia). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 27 (3): 170A. However, a more comprehensive analysis in 2009 showed that the species contained in Cricosaurus were valid, and furthermore that several long-snouted species formerly classified in the related genera Geosaurus, Enaliosuchus and Metriorhynchus were in fact more closely related to the original specimens of Cricosaurus, and thus were re-classified into this genus.Young, M.T. and de Andrade, M.B. (2009). \\"What is Geosaurus? Redescription of Geosaurus giganteus (Thalattosuchia: Metriorhynchidae) from the Upper Jurassic of Bayern, Germany.\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 157: 551-585. Cladogram after Young et al. (2020).  Paleobiology  Restoration of C. suevicus All currently known species would have been three metres or less in length. When compared to living crocodilians, Cricosaurus can be considered moderate to small-sized. Its body was streamlined for greater hydrodynamic efficiency, which along with its finned tail made it a more efficient swimmer than modern crocodilian species.Massare JA. 1988. Swimming capabilities of Mesozoic marine reptiles; implications for method of predation. Paleobiology 14 (2):187-205. = Salt glands = Recent examination of the fossil specimens of Cricosaurus araucanensis have shown that both juveniles and adults of this species had well-developed salt glands. This means that it would have been able to \\"drink\\" salt-water from birth (necessary for a pelagic animal) and eat prey that have the same ionic concentration as the surrounding sea water (i.e. cephalopods) without dehydrating.Fern√°ndez M, Gasparini Z. 2000. Salt glands in a Tithonian metriorhynchid crocodyliform and their physiological significance. Lethaia 33: 269-276.Fern√°ndez M, Gasparini Z. 2008. Salt glands in the Jurassic metriorhynchid Geosaurus: implications for the evolution of osmoregulation in Mesozoic crocodyliforms. Naturwissenschaften 95: 79-84. Adult specimens of Metriorhynchus also have these well-developed salt glands.Gandola R, Buffetaut E, Monaghan N, Dyke G. 2006. Salt glands in the fossil crocodile Metriorhynchus. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26 (4): 1009-1010. = Niche partitioning = Several species of metriorhynchids are known from the M√∂rnsheim Formation (Solnhofen limestone, early Tithonian) of Bavaria, Germany: Cricosaurus suevicus, Dakosaurus maximus, Geosaurus giganteus and Rhacheosaurus gracilis. It has been hypothesised that niche partitioning enabled several species of crocodyliforms to co-exist. The top predators of this Formation appear to be D. maximus and G. giganteus, which were large, short-snouted species with serrated teeth. The long-snouted C. suevicus and R. gracilis would have fed mostly on fish, although the more lightly built Rhacheosaurus may have specialised towards feeding on small prey. In addition to these four species of metriorhynchids, a moderate-sized species of Steneosaurus was also contemporaneous.Andrade MB, Young MT. 2008. High diversity of thalattosuchian crocodylians and the niche partition in the Solnhofen Sea . The 56th Symposium of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy From the slightly older Nusplingen Plattenkalk (late Kimmeridgian) of southern Germany, both C. suevicus and Dakosaurus maximus are contemporaneous. As with Solnhofen, C. suevicus feed upon fish, while D. maximus was the top predator.Dietl G, Dietl O, Schweigert G, Hugger R. 2000. Der Nusplinger Plattenkalk (Wei√üer Jura zeta) - Grabungskampagne 1999. = Possible viviparity = The hip of Cricosaurus araucanensis contains several features that create an unusually large pelvic opening. The acetabulum, or femur articulation on the hip, is placed very far towards of the bottom of the body relative to the vertebral column, and the sacral ribs are angled downwards at 45¬∞, further increasing the distance between the vertebral column and the pubis-ischium. The hip was effectively a vertical ellipse in cross-section, being tall and wide. In other pseudosuchians like Steneosaurus, Machimosaurus, and Pelagosaurus, the sacral ribs are less angled and more horizontal; in this way, Cricosaurus is actually more similar to aquatic reptiles like Chaohusaurus, Utatsusaurus, and Keichousaurus, the latter of which live birth has been suggested for. In an evaluation of different reproductive hypotheses for Cricosaurus and other metriorhynchids, Herrera et al. considered viviparity more likely than oviparity.

Weingast notes that there is a fundamental dilemma facing a government attempting to build and protect markets: the government must be strong enough to protect property rights and enforce contracts, but weak enough to credibly commit the state to honoring such rules. Market-preserving federalism is a means by which some countries address the fundamental dilemma of government. By decentralizing the authority to make economic policies, market-preserving federalism reduces the ability of both the central government to act arbitrarily (it has given up these powers) and the subnational governments (they face competition with one another for scarce capital and labor). Montinola, Qian, and Weingast argue that this form of federalism was critical for the success of China's reforms in the early 1980s.  Conditions for market-preserving federalism  Montinola, Qian, and Weingast identify a set of five conditions that represent an ideal type of institutional arrangement for market-preserving federalism (italics in original). (F1) There exists a hierarchy of governments with a delineated scope of authority (for example, between the national and subnational governments) so that each government is autonomous in its own sphere of authority. (F2) The subnational governments have primary authority over the economy within their jurisdictions. (F3) The national government has the authority to police the common market and to ensure the mobility of goods and factors across subgovernment jurisdictions. (F4) Revenue sharing among governments is limited and borrowing by governments is constrained so that all governments face hard budget constraints. (F5) The allocation of authority and responsibility has an institutionalized degree of durability so that it cannot be altered by the national government either unilaterally or under the pressures from subnational governments. While condition F1 is the defining feature of federalism, conditions two through five are required to ensure federalism's market-preserving qualities. Federal systems that fail to satisfy these five conditions generally do not sustain markets and economic development; for example, Argentina, India, and Mexico.

It was the official entry from Belgium for the 81st Academy Awards, but was not chosen as one of the films to be nominated during the ceremony. It was filmed in Wallonia. Plot Yvan (Bouli Lanners), a used car salesman, comes home late one evening to his house in the Belgian countryside. He discovers that a burglar (Fabrice) has just broken into his house and is hiding under his bed. When the burglar tries to escape, Yvan knocks him over by throwing a metal pipe at him. Upon confronting him, he discovers that the burglar is a young man in need of money to fuel his drug addiction. Yvan decides to help this young man, who says his names is Elie, by not turning him over to the police and by giving him a little money for the road. Finally, out of pity and remembering his own brother who had died of an overdose, Yvan decides to drive Elie, at his request, to the home of his parents in southern Belgium. Thus begins a journey across Wallonia, on which they face unsettling encounters with random people and humorous situations.

After Latvia regained independence in 1991, vehicle registration plates of the Soviet Union with Latin letters LA and LT were used until 1993, when the new type of vehicle registration plates were introduced. Up until 2004 a small Latvian national flag with the initials LV would have been used on the left-side of the plate. Ever since Latvia joined the European Union, the EU blue label has been included on the license plate with the initials LV. Front number plates are 520 mm x 111 mm in size.

However, Latvian army cars and trucks have LA letters on plates meaning Latvijas Armija and Government cars - MK letters meaning Ministru Kabinets. VS letters mean Vƒìsturiskais Spƒìkrats (Vintage car).  Personalized plates  The Latvian government allows registering personalized plates. In 2006, CSDD decided to increase price from 542.80 LVL to 2,500 LVL, because the old price became too affordable. Personalized plates can consist from two to eight symbols: letters, numbers or spaces. The same symbol can be repeated maximum 3 times without breaks (for example, \\"XXXIXXX\\"). The plate cannot include only numbers, so the minimum requirement is one letter and one number (e.g., \\"4O\\" (forty) consist of the number 4 and the letter O) or two letters.

History The first documents begin in the early nineteenth century telling of settlement in this region refer to lands belonging to Joaquina do Pompeu, whose complete name was Joaquina Maria Bernarda da Silva de Abreu Castello Branco Souto Maior de Oliveira Campos. With the death of this rich cattle baroness in 1824 lands were divided among heirs but a large area was acquired by an English company, Brazil Land Cattle and Packing Company. These lands were abandoned during the Second World War and later expropriated by President Get√∫lio Vargas. In 1952 a caravan of settlers arrived from Pirapora and began to occupy the lands. The lands were divided into lots of 100 hectares that were given to the settlers along with 20 heifers, one bull, and some oxen. They had 20 years to pay it off, when they would receive the final deed of ownership. By 1980 the population had reached 7,000 inhabitants. In 1991 the district of Brasil√¢ndia was created inside the municipality of Jo√£o Pinheiro. In 1995 a vote was taken for emancipation and Yes got 3,305 votes and the No got 69 votes In 1995 the municipality was created and in 1996 the first elections took place for mayor.

The vegetation is transitional between cerrado and caatinga. The maximum temperature is 38¬∞C, the average is 23¬∞C and the minimum is 15¬∞C. Annual rainfall averages 1,400mm.City government Brasil√†ndia de Minas belongs to the statistical micro- region of Paracatu. The region has ten municipalities and an area of 35,111.00 km¬≤. It lies just north of the Paracatu River, a major tributary of the S√£o Francisco River, southeast of where it receives the Preto River. A paved road, MG-181, crosses the river and heads south to join the important national highway BR-040 near Jo√£o Pinheiro. The distance to Jo√£o Pinheiro is 84 km. Bras√≠lia is 300 km away while the state capital of Belo Horizonte is 496 km. The economy The main economic activities are cattle raising (50,340 head in 2006) and the cultivation of soybeans (2,800 ha.), corn (2,100 ha.), manioc, beans, and rice. There is also a small area of coffee. There were 341 farms in 2006 with a total area of 141,357 ha. Of the total 15,000 hectares were planted in crops and the rest was natural pasture and forest land. Around 1,300 workers were involved in agriculture. There were 134 tractors.IBGE In the urban area there were 1,900 workers in industries (2005), 500 in commerce and 302 in public administration.

Early years Born in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, Bonventre immigrated to New York with his family. The family settled in the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a stronghold of immigrants from their village. Bonventre soon joined the local Castellammarese criminal organization, the precursor of the modern Bonanno crime family. Boss Cola Schiro ran the organization until 1930, when he was forced out by Salvatore Maranzano. Bonventre was the uncle of family founder Joseph Bonanno, who himself immigrated to New York City in 1924. Bonventre's nephews were Joseph Profaci, the future founder of the Profaci crime family and Cesare Bonventre. Bonventre married Caterina Vitale, but it is unknown if they had any children. Association with Bonanno family With the end of the Castellammarese War, a major conflict between the Sicilian clans in New York, Bonanno became boss of the reorganized Bonanno family and Bonventre became a caporegime, the captain of a crew of mobsters. That same year, Bonanno and Bonventre purchased a dairy farm near Middletown, New York in the Catskill Mountains. The farm's main product was mozzarella cheese; Bonanno and Bonventre used their mob influence to eventually dominate the production of this cheese in New York State, Wisconsin, and Vermont. Bonventre's other business ventures included a garment factory in Brooklyn. At some point, Bonventre was promoted to family underboss, directly under Bonanno. Move to Sicily In 1950, Bonventre decided to move back to Sicily. However, this move did not end his involvement in the Bonanno family. In 1957, Bonventre attended the abortive Apalachin Conference of American Cosa Nostra leaders in rural Apalachin, New York that was broken up by New York State Police; Bonanno and Bonventre were picked up by police as they tried to escape the meeting site through a field. In September 1957 Bonventre had attended several meetings in Palermo, Sicily with Bonanno and the exiled mob boss Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. In May 1971, Italian Carabinieri police banished Bonventre and 14 other Sicilian Mafia leaders to Filicudi, a island off the coast of Sicily.\\"Mafia Still in Europe\\" Rome News- Tribune July 15, 1971 (Google Books) References *Bureau of Narcotics, U.S. Treasury Department, \\"Mafia: the Government's Secret File on Organized Crime, HarperCollins Publishers 2007 Category:1901 births Category:Year of death missing Category:American mobsters of Sicilian descent Category:Bonanno crime family Category:People from Williamsburg, Brooklyn ","title":"Giovanni Bonventre"},{"id":"17372622","text":"Hangin' with Heaven and Hell is a video by heavy metal band Black Sabbath.

Bernlef, was a Dutch writer, poet, novelist and translator, much of whose work centres on mental perception of reality and its expression. He won numerous literary awards, including the Constantijn Huygens Prize in 1984 and the P. C. Hooft Award in 1994, both of which were for his work as a whole. His book Hersenschimmen features on the list of NRC's Best Dutch novels. Life Marsman was born on 14 January 1937 in Sint Pancras and worked in a number of genres under a variety of pseudonyms, which included Ronnie Appelman, J. Grauw, Cas den Haan, S. den Haan, and Cas de Vries. There had already been a well-known Dutch poet named Hendrik Marsman who had died in 1940, so this Marsman preferred to take the name of an 8th-century blind Frisian poet named Bernlef as his chief nom de plume. 1958 was a key year in Bernlef's life, during which he spent some time in Sweden, enabling him years later to translate Swedish writers; he also co-edited the English language A pulp magazine for the dead generation (under the name Henk Marsman) with the Beat poet Gregory Corso, published from Paris by Piero Heliczer‚Äôs The Dead Language Press.Dutch National Library Together with two other poets, K. Schippers and G. Brands, he went on to visit the Dada exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum and inspired by that launched with them the seminal magazine Barbarber (1958-71).http://www.literaturfestival.com/archive/participants/authors/2004/bernlef?set_language=en In 1960 his first poetry collection, Kokkels (Cockles) was awarded the Reina Prinsen Geerligs-prijs. In that year he married Eva Hoornik, daughter of the poet Ed. Hoornik, by whom he eventually had two children. At the same time, his friend Schippers married her twin sister Erica.Kunstbus Later he began writing novels and became widely known for his Hersenschimmen (translated as Out of Mind) in 1984. He was an industrious writer and shortly before his death a photo showed the pile of his works as equaling him in height.Author's home page Bernlef died on 29 October 2012, aged 75, at his home in Amsterdam after a short illness. One tribute paid to Bernlef then hailed him as \\"one of the greats of Dutch literature.\\" Another, from Sara Whyatt, Deputy Director of PEN International, pointed out that ‚ÄúHenk was not only a distinguished writer himself, but also a great defender of other writers.‚Äù In the late 1980s he had taken over as director of The PEN Emergency Fund, a lifeline to writers and their families whose lives had been blighted by prison, threats, torture and censorship, and worked untiringly for their relief.PEN International Work Barbarber, the magazine set up by Bernlef and his friends in 1958, originally came out in an edition of 100 copies and was filled with Neo-Dadaist gestures, ready-mades and both verbal and pictorial collages.

Lebesque was born in Nantes, at the Quai Barbin (now dock Barbusse), and had his secondary education in Clemenceau High School. In 1930, he was editor-in-chief at the Loire Echo. Responsible for the Nantes branch of the Breton Autonomist Party (Parti Autonomiste Breton), Lebesque left the latter in 1931 and founded, with Th√©ophile Jeusset, the more extremist movement Breiz da Zont, and its political wing, the Parti Nationaliste Breton Int√©gral. During the German occupation of France in World War II, he worked for the collaborationist newspaper L'Heure Bretonne, then for various journals in Paris, where he met and befriended Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. In 1952, Lebesque joined the satirical journal Le Canard Encha√Æn√©, for which he wrote a popular column, modelling his style on Albert Camus, with whom he became a close friend. He eventually became an editor of the journal. After 1966, Lebesque also participated in the Breton autonomist revue Ar Vro.

History Speedway meetings had been taking place at Yarmouth Stadium since 1932. In 1948 the Yarmouth Bloaters speedway team were created and they joined the National League Division Three. The original plan was to use the name Yarmouth Mariners but the name was disliked by supporters and the name Bloaters was chosen because of the town's connections with the fishing industry. It was also the nickname of the local football team, Great Yarmouth Town F.C.. The team's race jacket consisted of red and black quarters which then became red with black cross adorned with an image of a silver bloater. In 1949 the Bloaters finished joint top of Division Three with the Hanley Potters, but the Potters superior race points average meant that Yarmouth finished as runners up. Yarmouth were offered promotion and moved up to the National League Division Two for the 1950 season. Yarmouth wanted to open the 1954 season several weeks late but this wish was denied by the Speedway Control Board and the Bloaters were not issued a racing licence for that year. The track remained closed until a consortium of local businessmen took over in 1957. Yarmouth continued with a number of open meetings and minor local speedway leagues until becoming one of the founder members of the Provincial League in 1960. During the season the club lost money after several home meetings were cancelled due to bad weather, and they finished seventh out of ten teams. The decision was taken not to enter the Provincial League for the 1961 season by the promoters and after taking part in several open meetings the Bloaters closed due to financial problems. The stadium now hosts greyhound and stock car racing, and the speedway track has been covered over with tarmac.

ExxonMobil Corp., No. 4:08-cv-01138 (N.D. Cal.), is a lawsuit filed on February 26, 2008, in a United States district court. The suit, based on the common law theory of nuisance, claims monetary damages from the energy industry for the destruction of Kivalina, Alaska by flooding caused by climate change. The damage estimates made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Government Accountability Office are placed between $95 million and $400 million. This lawsuit is an example of greenhouse gas emission liability. The suit was dismissed by the United States district court on September 30, 2009, on the grounds that regulating greenhouse emissions was a political rather than a legal issue and one that needed to be resolved by Congress and the Administration rather than by courts. An appeal was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in November 2009. In September 2012, the panel of appeals judges decided not to reinstate the case. The city appealed the court of appeals decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and on May 20, 2013 the Supreme Court justices decided not hear the case, effectively ending the city's legal claim.Hurley, Lawrence.

Village issue Kivalina is a traditional I√±upiat Eskimo community of about 390 people and is located about 625 miles northwest of Anchorage. It is built on an 8-mile barrier reef between the Kivalina River and the Chukchi Sea. Sea ice historically protected the village, whose economy is based in part on salmon fishing plus subsistence hunting of whale, seal, walrus, and caribou. But the ice is forming later and melting sooner because of higher temperatures, and that has left it unprotected from fall and winter storm waves and surges that pummel coastal communities. > The village is being wiped out by global warming and needs to move urgently > before it is destroyed and the residents become global warming refugees\\", > Kivalina's attorney, Matt Pawa of suburban Boston said. \\"It's battered by > winter storms and if residents don't get some money to move, the village > will cease to exist. In 1953 the size of the village was roughly 54 acres but due to accelerating erosion activity, the village is currently at 27 acres. Due to the dramatic loss of land, Kivalina residents chosen a relocation site, an area known as Kiniktuuraq, about two miles southeast of the current location. Before relocating Kivalina residents are finding out that the new site may be prone to flooding. It has not been mentioned that the flooding will be attributed to climate change in the case. Overview According to an attorney of Kivalina, Matt Pawa, Kivalina v. ExxonMobil has two chief aims. The first is to recover \\"monetary damages for defendants' past and ongoing contributions to global warming\\"; the second, to recover \\"damages caused by certain defendants' acts in furthering a conspiracy to suppress the awareness of the link between these emissions and global warming\\". The lawsuit accuses some of the defendants of a conspiracy to mislead the public regarding the causes and consequences of climate change. The lawsuit invokes the federal common law of public nuisance. Every entity that contributes to the pollution problem harming Kivalina is liable. District Court ruling On September 30, 2009, the United States District Court dismissed the suit filed by Kivalina. The 2nd Circuit ruled that a public nuisance suit brought by states and environmental groups against ExxonMobil Corporation and twenty-three other oil, energy and utility companies based on their business being major producers of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions posed a non-justiciable political question (In a court system they only have the authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question. Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are non-justiciable), and that the plaintiffs did not have standing, because the problem is abstract and is difficult to pinpoint its source. Shortly after it came down, Judge Sandra Brown Armstrong in the Northern District of California dismissed the nuisance claims, stating that the plaintiffs did pose non-justiciable under the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs \\"otherwise lacked standing under Article III of the United States Constitution.\\" On standing, the Kivalina Court applied the \\"fairly traceable\\" standard used in the Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc, but in the Kivalina case Kivalina's injuries were not fairly traceable to GHGs emitted by the defendants. Here too the Court relied on what it determined was a tenuous causal link to find that plaintiffs lacked standing. Defendants of current climate change cases such as Comer v. Murphy Oil USA and Connecticut v. American Electric Power are using this ruling as a way to support their defense of a lack of claim for the plaintiff and therefore there is no standing per Article III of the Constitution. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals An appeal was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in November 2009. On July 7, 2010, the Washington Legal Foundation filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit urging it to reject an appeal and that the dismissal be affirmed because the lawsuit lacks standing In November 2011 arguments for and against reinstatement of the case were made before an Appeals Panel. On September 21, 2012, the court published an opinion affirming district court decision. On October 4, 2012, the plaintiffs submitted a petition for rehearing by the court en banc.

Identified in the twentieth century by Bernard Berenson as the Master of Terenzano, the Master was renamed for a polyptych from his hand, dating to the 1320s, that originally stood in the Medici Chapel of the church of Santa Croce in Florence. The panels, half-length depictions of saints, have since been separated, and are used as pinnacles for the altarpiece on the high altar of the same church. It would appear that the Master was well respected, even if he occupied a modest position in local artistic circles. He forms part of a line of artists, beginning with the Master of Saint Cecilia and continuing through Pacino de Bonaguida, whose work bears the influence of Giotto even as it stands in contrast. Similar painters, who have been described as being of the \\"miniaturist tendency\\", were best known for their work on illuminated manuscripts; nevertheless, the Master of the Cappella Medici Poliptych is known only through a donzen panel paintings. Among these is a large Crucifix in Stuttgart, as well as smaller works, such as a Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Saints (once part of a portable altarpiece, now separated and found in Detroit). Based upon the limited evidence of these works, the Master likely trained in Pacino's workshop at some point during the second decade of the fourteenth century. His figures are generally timid-looking and doll-like, and reveal a kinship with the younger and more prolific Master of the Dominican Effigies; so similar are their works that the two were initially confused, and it is still believed that they may have worked together. A debt to Giotto may be seen in some works; from the 1320s on his style betrays knowledge of the work of Jacopo del Casentino and Bernardo Daddi. Unlike the latter, however, he had little success in adapting his training in smaller genres to the large- scale style of Giotto.

She served on the Canadian route from 1927 to 1936. After the merger of the White Star Line with Cunard Line, the ship was mainly used for cruise service. After December 1935, however, she was laid up unused in Liverpool. In August 1939, she was requisitioned and converted into an auxiliary cruiser for the Royal Navy for service in the Second World War. The Laurentic was torpedoed by the on 3 November 1940 off Bloody Foreland, County Donegal, Ireland during a rescue mission for another ship that had been torpedoed and sunk, but she remained afloat. After two more torpedoes smashed into the Laurentic, she foundered, taking the lives of 49 people. Construction Postcard of Laurentic The construction of this ship is peculiar in several respects. In fact, it was the only time in sixty years that White Star Line ordered from the shipyard Harland & Wolff on the basis of a defined budget. The Laurentic thus appeared to be a ship at a discount, an unusual fact in the history of the company. The very origin of the construction was rather nebulous, since she was built with the hull number 470, while the Doric, put into service in 1923 (four years before her), had the hull number 573. This would suggest that the decision to build the Laurentic was made in the early 1920s and that the construction sites retained the cumbersome unfinished structure for more than five years, but the cause of the delay is unknown. Not only did it have a profile similar to that of the Doric, the Laurentic also stood out for its archaism: she was still propelled by coal when most of the newer ships were fueled by oil, and its propulsion is similar to the one used by the first Laurentic in 1909. She used two quadruple expansion engines powering sided propellers and a low pressure turbine for the central propeller.Laurentic 2 , The White Star Line. Retrieved 11 August 2009 The construction was delayed by the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. The ship was eventually launched without a ceremony on 16 June 1927. She was completed five months later on 1 November, after which she left Belfast for Liverpool with representatives of the company and shipyards on board. Passenger career On 31 December 1927, she began her maiden voyage, sailing from Liverpool and cruising around the Mediterranean before returning to Liverpool on 17 April 1928. On 27 April 1928, the ship was transferred to the Liverpool - Quebec - Montreal route and remained there for most of her commercial career but also occasionally cruised the Mediterranean.SS Laurentic (II), White Star Liner. Retrieved 11 August 2009 In January 1931, it was expected that the ship be transferred to a Mediterranean cruise but the Great Depression made the service unprofitable. The Laurentic had two collisions during her career. The first occurred on 3 October 1932 with Lurigethen of the HE Moss Line. Both vessels remained afloat following the collision. An inquiry later determined that the crews of the Laurentic was responsible for the accident. The second occurred on 18 August 1935 with Napier Star of the Blue Star Line, leaving six dead among the crew of Laurentic.White Star Liner RMS and HMS Laurentic (2nd) 1927-1940 torpedoed and sunk by U-99 - 49 killed, White Star Ships. Retrieved 11 August 2009 On 25 February 1934, she made her last crossing on a regular line for the White Star between Boston, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Halifax, and Liverpool. She was then assigned to cruises. In March of that year, she transported 700 pilgrims from Dublin to Rome for the Easter celebrations. Many unnecessary ships were sold in the following years, but the Laurentic was retained and temporarily assigned to the Montreal route before returning to cruising. Military service and sinking The White Star Line and Cunard Line merged in 1934, without affecting the career of the ship. The ship was docked in December 1935 and served the following September as troop transport bound for Palestine. In this capacity, she made her last trip for the White Star Line in December of that year. In 1937 she took part in the Coronation Naval Review at Spithead carrying government guests. In 1939, with the start of the Second World War, Laurentic was requisitioned as HMS Laurentic and converted into an auxiliary cruiser, losing her recasting part of the superstructure aft. On 3 November 1940, the Laurentic responded to a call for help from a ship that had been torpedoed by a U-boat. Arriving at the scene, she was targeted by two torpedoes from U-99 commanded by Otto Kretschmer, however these torpedoes missed, but after four hours, she was struck by a two further torpedoes which sent her to the bottom, killing 49 of 416 people aboard.

These ichthyosaurs were small, at 1‚Äì1.5 m (3.3‚Äì4.9 ft) in length. Fossil remains from Svalbard from the specimen SVT 203 were originally assigned to Grippia longirostris but are now thought to have belonged to a non-ichthyopterygian diapsid related to Helveticosaurus. Discovery History Fossils have been found along the coasts of Greenland, China, Japan, Norway, and Canada (Sulfur Mountain Formation); of Early Triassic age. No complete skeletons has ever been found. However, well-preserved remains have been found, with the most notable ones including: *The Marine Ironstone found in Agardh Bay Norway. This specimen consists of a partial skull fossil; however, it was lost during World War II and presumably destroyed. *Previously, the Vega Phroso Siltstone Member of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in British Columbia. This specimen consists of a well preserved forelimb, several ribs, and a single centrum. However, it has now been reclassified as Gulosaurus helmi, a close relative of Grippia. Taxonomy Currently there is only one species belonging to the genus Grippia, this species is Grippia longirostris. Grippia longirostris was an entirely marine species and is considered to be the most basal example of Ichthyopterygia. G.longirostris measured in at 1-1.5m (3.3-4.9 feet) in length making it the smallest species within the superorder Ichthyopterygia. Other definitive features of G.longirostris include the arrangement of carpals and metacarpals that constitute the forelimbs and the morphology of the skull. Members of this species swam via lateral movements of their tail similar to that of a modern-day eel. Evolution Ichthyopterygia are fully aquatic reptiles that evolved from terrestrial tetrapods, with no transitional lineage being discovered so far. Grippia is one of earliest examples of the superorder Ichthyopterygia and is fully adapted to aquatic life. Grippia are believed to have lived from 250-235 Ma during the Olenekian ‚Äì Anisian of the early to mid-Triassic. Grippia are considered to be basal ichthyosaurs along with several other early genus, with Grippia being the most basal of all of them. This is due to its primitive anatomy when compared to older ichthyosaurs and because Grippia is the most thoroughly studied out of all basal ichthyosaurs. It is hypothesised that Grippia became extinct because it was outcompeted by more advanced ichthyosaurs. This limited the amount of food that Grippia could secure, eventually leading it to its extinction around 235 Ma. Below is a cladogram which represents Ichthyopterygia showing how Grippia diverged early in the lineage. Biology The skeletal structure of G. longirostris has been documented, especially the forelimbs by Ryosuke Motani in 1998 and the skull by Ryosuke Motani in 2000 . These studies involved modern documentation and research of previously discovered specimens. =Skull= Several different Grippia skulls have been analyzed since 1929. Seven well known cranial specimens belonging to G. longirostris were reanalyzed, in order to construct detailed descriptions of each specimen and to form a coherent compilation to represent the genus as a whole. An important thing to note is how no skull has been found to have a snout; therefore any descriptions of the snout are speculative. Montani constructed several diagrams based on his analysis, which depict the skull of G. Lonirostris as: *Having a narrow shape. *Possessing orbits that are larger than the upper temporal fenestra. *The quadratojugal does not enter the upper temporal fenestra. *The anterior margin of the external naris is formed by the premaxilla. *The postfrontal have a posterior process that overlaps the bone of the large postorbital, similar to the skulls of other basal ichthyosaurs. =Forelimbs= The forelimbs of G.longirostris are characteristic of the species. Descriptions created by Wiman in 1933 originally depicted G.longirostris as having very primitive forelimbs that were not yet completely specialized for aquatic life. These descriptions involved the presence of ‚Äúhoofs‚Äù at the tips of each digit, this observation has since been discredited. The most recent descriptions of the forelimbs were performed in 1998 by Motani. This analysis focused on one specimen that was nearly complete, although it was determined to be missing several distal segments of the phalanges. This study revealed: *Grippia possesses pentadactyl limbs. *The humerus and phalanges are well developed. *It possessed an articular radius. *The ulna and radius extend in a wide fan shape. *The first four proximal and distal carpals aid in separating the metacarpals. *The second to fourth metacarpals and phalanges are similar to that of other amniotes, however they are flattened. *The first and fifth metacarpals and phalanges are lunate in appearance and concave inwards towards the interior carpals. *The phalanges of the distal end of the fourth and fifth digits appear to take more of an oval shape. Lifestyle G. longirostris were well adapted to an aquatic lifestyle during early ‚Äì mid Triassic. They inhabited equatorial to equatorial shallow coastal seas. This paleohabitat was based upon how areas where fossils are found were at equatorial latitudes during the early Triassic when these animals lived. The exact diet of these animals is highly debated. Analysis of dental remains belonging to G. Longirostris has shown blunt posterior teeth and replacement maxillary teeth, which suggests that these animals practiced an omnivorous feeding style. This evidence is contradictory when cross examined against previous work done in the thirties and eighties, which theorized that G. Longirostris practiced a diet specialized in mollusca and small fish. All of these results were based on samples that did not include an existing snout, therefore they were highly speculative and paleontologists will not know what these animals ate until a full skull is found. Trivia *The first G. longirostris skull was found in 1929. Many palaeontologists believe it was the most complete specimen ever found, however, it was destroyed in a bombing raid on Germany in WWII. *Grippia is Greek for anchor.

Interwoven with the patient stories are interviews with experts from the Fibromyalgia Rehabilitation Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. On their website, the filmmakers call Living with Fibromyalgia \\"the film they wished their family could have watched together when they first heard the word fibromyalgia.\\" The filmmakers stated that they would donate 10 percent of all sales of the film to the National Fibromyalgia Association to support fibromyalgia research and education. When interviewed by Jennifer Prokopy, the editor and founder of an on online resource for women with chronic illnesses called ChronicBabe.com, filmmaker Daneen Akers shared her reasons for creating the film and revealed that she sold her house as part of fundraising efforts. Release The film first screened on November 18, 2006 at the Dodge College of Film's Folino Theatre at Chapman University in Orange, California. Hosted by The National Fibromyalgia Association and Trillusion Media, the film had its world premi√®re in San Diego on March 22, 2007 at the Hillcrest Landmark Theatre. The documentary was screened, with free admission, around the United States as part of the National Fibromyalgia Association's May, 2007 Fibromyalgia Awareness Day campaign.

Plot summary The story takes place in 1962. Tom Llewyllyn have been working at the BBC for some years. He engages Fielding Gray to do a documentary about Cyprus. Gray, who had his face disfigured on that very island is reluctant but gives in since he hopes to find some facts that will give him some kind of revenge. Llewyllyn is not terribly happy in his marriage with the sloppy and not 100% mentally stable Patricia. Her sister Isobel, on the other side, is very happily married to Gregory Stern. The publisher Stern has lately become very interested in his Jewish heritage and neglects his publishing a bit. When Gray goes by train to Greece he meets Leonard Percival, who warns him to continue the trip on that particular train. A nervous Gray eventually jumps of the train in Yugoslavia right before it crashes off a bridge, killing all aboard. Gray, who is unharmed, is transported to Athens where he meets friend and colleague captain Detterling. Meanwhile, Somerset Lloyd-James and Lord Canteloupe, scared that nasty things about the British engagement on the island will be revealed, are trying to prevent Llewyllyn and Gray from making their documentary. Gray and Detterling also meet the couple Max de Freville and Angela Tuck. De Freville is trying to make a comeback as a gambler and tells some interesting things about Cyprus. Gray has sex with Angela and they discus memories from the summer of 1945. Leonard Percival arrives also and confirms that forces on Cyprus wanted to kill Gray. An important person in this group is Earl Restarick, an American spook working for the CIA. De Freville can, however, prove that this man has been involved in killings on Cyprus since he left a handkerchief near the body of a murdered boy. Gray, after arriving at Cyprus, manages to find the body and the handkerchief. To get more proof against Restarick, Gray wants an interview with the famous guerrilla leader colonel Georgios Grivas. Restarick, who has been following the affair, has his own interview with Angela Tuck and she reveals some of Grays's weaknesses. Somerset Lloyd-James is trying to drag Tom Llewyllyn down by using Maisie but she refuses, and even tells Llewyllyn about the dodgy business. Restarick sends out the beautiful Greek boy Nicos to catch Gray, and he manages quite well. The somewhat confused Gray takes him for his dead lover Christopher. Nicos manages to keep Gray away from Athens and Grivas and Gray forgets about all his duties. Meanwhile, Tom Llewellyn is fired from the BBC since it turns out that he hasn't had a National Insurance Card for years and didn't even know about it. Tom has even lied about the card since he wasn't that interested in the matter. When Restarick hears about this he recalls Nicos, who unceremoniously dumps the devastated Gray. At that moment Isobel Stern is having a miscarriage in London. Gray stays in Argos and drinks very heavily for a week but Max de Freville, a somewhat decent fellow, sends his friend Harriet Ongley to pick him up and get him in shape. Tom is invited to take up a Namier Fellowship at Lancaster College and accepts ‚Äì right at the moment when his wife Patricia finds she's pregnant for the second time.

Howard about the pirate Cormac Mac Art, a Gael who joins a band of Danish Vikings during the reign of King Arthur. (Historically, Cormac Mac Art is the name of a famous High King of Ireland, but among the many legends told of him there is no reference to him having been a pirate.) Tigers of the Sea was first published in 1973 by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in an edition of 3,400 copies. The stories feature Howard's character Cormac Mac Art; the volume was edited by Richard L. Tierney. Except for one, the stories are pure historical fiction, dealing with struggles between various groups of human beings waged by mundane human weapons. The exception is \\"The Temple of Abomination\\", in which Cormac Mac Art and his Viking fellows defeat the very last of the monstrous Serpent Men, whom King Kull fought in the much earlier Howardian cycle. Contents * Introduction, by Richard L. Tierney * \\"Tigers of the Sea\\" (by Howard, completed by Tierney) * \\"Swords of the Northern Sea\\" * \\"The Night of the Wolf\\" * \\"The Temple of Abomination\\" (by Howard, completed by Tierney) Robert E. Howard Library Vol. I: Cormac Mac Art. The stories of Cormac Mac Art were also printed by Baen Books in 1995. This edition included the same stories from Tigers of the Sea with an additional new story, \\"The Land Towards Sunset\\", published by author David Drake Cormac Mac Art and Wulfhere the Skull-Splitter Originally, Cormac Mac Art (nicknamed an Cluiun - \\"The Wolf\\") was a member of the Irish Reivers - bold pirates who range far among the ruins of the Roman Empire, reaching Spain and on occasion even Egypt, though their ships are less sound than those of the Scandinavian Vikings. Usually, Reivers and Vikings are on bad terms with each other - being competitors for the same loot. However, at one point, Cormac Mac Art (for unspecified reasons) became an outlaw and had to leave Ireland in a hurry. Soon, he found refuge and a new home among the Danish Vikings led by Wulfhere the Skull-Splitter. He became Wulfhere's right hand man, the two of them complementing each other and working harmoniously together. The giant Wulfhere is a bellicose and formidable fighter, quite deserving of his nickname. He is impetuous, easily roused, and on bad terms with most of the other Viking leaders - though not overtly cruel and capable at times of surprising compassion. Cormac Mac Art, though a formidable swordsman in his own right when in need, is a more subtle man: well-informed on the affairs of the numerous kingdoms, tribes, and factions inhabiting the turbulent British Islands and beyond. He's also a fluent speaker of many languages, a competent spy able to infiltrate enemy strongholds, and the originator of complicated or intricate plots. Cormac has many enemies, Irish as well as Scandinavian, who would dearly love to put an end to his career - but he manages to elude them, again and again. Wulfhere appreciates Cormac's advice and mostly follows it, while Cormac accepts Wulfhere's leadership of the band and has no intention of challenging it. Together, they go through many dangerous adventures and emerge from various near-fatal traps. Like most Irish people of his time, Cormac is a Pagan, a staunch believer of the Druidic religion, and his opinion towards Christianity is far from positive - though in \\"The Temple of Abomination\\" he (like his Danish fellows) comes to respect the courage and dedication of a Christian priest whom they save from the monstrous snake-man. Andrew Offutt novels Andrew Offutt continued Cormac Mac Art's adventures beyond where Howard left off, writing no less than six such novels (some of them in collaboration with Keith Taylor). * Sword of the Gael (1975) * The Undying Wizard (1976) * The Sign of the Moonbow (1977) * The Mists of Doom (1977) * When Death Birds Fly (1980, with Keith Taylor) * The Tower of Death (1982, with Keith Taylor) Arthurian background In The Temple of Abomination Cormac tells his Danish companions about King Arthur - a view significantly different from that seen in the Arthurian legends. > \\"... most of the chiefs are gathering about Arthur Pendragon for a great > concerted drive. Pendragon ‚Äî ha! He's no more Uther Pendragon's son than you > [Wulfhere] are. Uther was a black-bearded madman ‚Äî more Roman than Briton > and more Gaul than Roman. Arthur is as fair as Eric here. And he's pure Celt > ‚Äî a waif from one of the wild western tribes that never bowed to Rome. It > was Lancelot who put it into his head to make himself king ‚Äî else he had > still been no more than a wild chief raiding the borders.\\" \\"Has he become > smooth and polished like the Romans were?\\" \\"Arthur? Ha! One of your Danes > might seem a gentlewoman beside him. He's a shock-headed savage with a love > for battle.\\" Cormac grinned ferociously and touched his scars. \\"By the blood > of the gods, he has a hungry sword! It's little gain we reivers from Erin > have gotten on his coasts!\\" \\"Would I could cross steel with him,\\" grunted > Wulfhere, thumbing the flaring edge of his great axe. \\"What of Lancelot?\\" \\"A > renegade Gallo-Roman who has made an art of throat-cutting. He varies > reading Petronius with plotting and intriguing. Gawaine is a pure-blooded > Briton like Arthur, but he has Romanish leanings. You'd laugh to see him > aping Lancelot ‚Äî but he fights like a blood-hungry devil. Without those two, > Arthur would have been no more than a bandit chief. He can neither read nor > write.\\" \\"What of that?\\" rumbled the Dane. \\"Neither can I. ...\\" Though Cormac obviously had some direct contact with Arthur and Lancelot before his exile from Ireland, they never appear onstage in the stories about him - most of which take place much further to the north, in the islands around Scotland. As depicted in the stories, in his own time Arthur and his court were not as much in the center of attention as the later myth would imply, since there was very much else going on in the British Islands. There were the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes pushing westwards against the Britons; further north, the Gaels pushing eastwards against the Picts; and pirates and rovers, Irish and Scandinavian, constantly raiding everybody. Each of these groups could at any moment come into conflict with any of the others, or burst into internecine conflict between different factions; especially, among the Scandinavian Vikings, there is a deep hatred and enmity between Danes and Norwegians. Alliances of convenience might also be formed from time to time - for example, Vikings are seen as occasionally forming alliances with Britons against the Saxons. Obviously, the Arthurian tales passed on to later generation would reflect only a small fraction of all these complicated conflicts occurring during Arthur's time. Such an \\"outsider\\" view of King Arthur is very rare in the extensive Arthurian Literature, Medieval or Modern. Virtually the only other example of such an approach is Alfred Duggan's Conscience of the King, which tries to reconstruct how Arthur was seen by his Saxon foes.

History West Blatchington Windmill was built in the 1820s, first appearing on Greenwood's map of 1823. It was painted by John Constable in 1825. The mill is hexagonal in plan, whereas most smock mills are octagonal. She was working until 1897, when two sails were damaged. In 1937, the mill was acquired from the Marquess of Abergavenny by Hove Corporation, and has been maintained as a landmark. Repairs were done to the mill by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights in 1937. The windmill was listed at Grade II* on 24 March 1950. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Description As built, West Blatchington Windmill is a three-storey smock mill on a three- storey brick base, with a stage at third-floor level. In 1825 she had four Common sails but latterly was worked with four Patent sails. These were carried on a cast-iron Windshaft, mounted on a cross, similar to the Lincolnshire practice. The mill is fitted with Holloway's screw brake. The cap is in the Kentish style, winded by a fantail. The mill drove two pairs of underdrift millstones. The mill stood at the junction of three barns, one of the original barns remains standing today, and one of the others was replaced with a new build barn in 1997. Most of the machinery was removed in 1937, leaving the Brake Wheel and Upright Shaft. image:West Blatchington Barn.jpg image:West_Blatchington_1937_by_R_Jameson.jpg image:West_Blatchington_Mill_by_R_Jameson_1937.jpg These four watercolours were painted in 1937 by R Jameson.

The breed was developed in the 1860s in north-central France, in the vicinity of the villages of Houdan and Faverolles. The breed was given the name of the latter village and the singular is thus also Faverolles, not Faverolle.British Faverolles Society Since the final ‚Äús‚Äù is silent in French, this is only necessary when writing the name. Faverolles were originally bred in France as a utility fowl, used for both eggs and meat but are now primarily raised for exhibition. When Faverolles reached the UK in 1886, the breed was further altered to meet exhibition standards, British breeders developed a type of Faverolles with longer, higher raised tail feathers than their German and French Cousins. Characteristics Faverolles are classified as a heavy breed and have a beard, muffs, feathered feet and five toes per foot, rather than the usual four. Faverolles are well adapted both to confinement and free range. When battery cages began to be used at the very beginning of the twentieth century, Faverolles tolerated the close confinement better than the Houdan breed. Thus, the Faverolles was the primary breed which produced eggs for the Paris market during the early part of the century. Although primarily kept today as an ornamental and exhibition breed, it remains an excellent layer, as well as a fine meat chicken. The most common color is Salmon. The plumage of salmon females is mainly brown and creamy white. The males are darker, with black, brown, and straw-colored feathers. Other varieties, including white, black, ermine, cuckoo, splash and blue also exist. Hens are good winter layers of medium-sized, light brown to pinkish eggs. Some cocks are the quietest of all breeds and Faverolles are also known for their extreme docility. As a result, they tend to get bullied in a mixed flock for being so gentle and friendly. They thrive in groups with other Faverolles, or perhaps, with other docile breeds such as the Sussex. Because of their gentleness Faverolles have become a popular breed of chicken to keep as a pet, especially for children. They are also enjoying increasing popularity with people who keep small home flocks, who favor dual purpose breeds which are well suited to both egg production and use as meat. Faverolles are considered to be very good layers, a well-cared for Faverolles hen will lay approximately four eggs per week.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1979 to 1993 sitting with the governing Progressive Conservative caucus. During his time in office he served a couple different cabinet portfolios under the government of Don Getty. Early life Norman Allen Weiss was born December 23, 1935 in Edmonton, Alberta to Alfred William Weiss and Matilda Steltter. He attended Victoria Composite High School, and married Carol Elaine Dittberner on June 15, 1961, with which he had two daughters. Weiss would work for Shell Canada as the Western Marketing Manager and transfer to Vancouver, British Columbia, and later transfer to Fort McMurray, Alberta to operate a Shell bulk plant and Ski-Doo dealership. During his time in Fort McMurray, Weiss would serve as the vice-chair of the Fort McMurray Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Kinsmen Club, Rotary Club and Muffalloose Trailblazers. Political career Weiss ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature as a candidate for the governing Progressive Conservative party in the 1979 Alberta general election. He won the election to hold the Lac La Biche-McMurray electoral district for his party. He won over half the popular vote, easily defeating three other candidates. Weiss stood for re- election in the 1982 Alberta general election. He won a super majority defeating three other candidates in his bid for a second term in office. Lac La Biche-McMurray was abolished due to redistribution in 1986. Weiss ran for a third term in office in the new Fort McMurray electoral district for the 1986 general election. He won the new district in a tight race with NDP candidate Ann Dort Maclean finishing just over 700 votes ahead in the polling. After the election Premier Don Getty appointed Weiss to the Executive Council of Alberta to serve as Minister of Recreation and Parks. Weiss ran for his fourth term in office in the 1989 Alberta general election this time with ministerial advantage. He once again faced Maclean and held his seat, because her plurality dropped while his went up marginally. After the election Getty made Weiss the new Minister of Career Development and Employment. He held that portfolio until Ralph Klein became Premier in 1992. Weiss retired from the assembly at dissolution in 1993. Later life Following his retirement from politics, Weiss moved to Courtenay, British Columbia. Weiss was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. Weiss died on June 2, 2015 in Courtenay, British Columbia. He had Parkinson's disease, Lewy Body Dementia and throat cancer.

Plot Set in a 20th-century Creole village in the Mississippi Delta, the opera focuses on the deadly revenge that the beautiful Clothilde enacts on Bazile, a handsome young man who does not return her expressions of love. When Clothilde discovers that Bazile has been in communication with Aurore, a spirit who identifies herself as Bazile's lover from a distant era, Clothilde threatens to have Bazile arrested for violating local religious customs. When Bazile continues to refuse to wed Clothilde, she arranges for a mob to have him lynched. In his death throes, however, Bazile's soul is united with Aurore; Clothilde lives out the remainder of her years as a bitter recluse. Productions Still composed A Bayou Legend in 1941, but it was not professionally staged until 1974, when Opera/South in Jackson, Mississippi presented its world premiere, 33 years later. The company revived the opera in 1976, and in 1979 collaborated with the Mississippi Educational Television Authority to create a made-for-television film version. However, post-production problems delayed its broadcast until June 15, 1981. This marked the first time that an opera composed by an African American was broadcast on television. The opera was performed in 1976 in its West Coast Premier at East Los Angeles City College, featuring a mostly African-American professional cast, including Delcina Stevenson, conducted by the late Calvin Simmons, directed by Gary Fisher, and designed by Donald McAfee. This production shifted the time of the setting to the 1920s. Daniel Carriaga's review of the opera for the Los Angeles Times and Metropolitan Opera News described it as a \\"lyrical and theatrical masterpiece\\". Still's widow and author of the libretto, Verna Arvey, attended the Los Angeles production. She was given a plaque honoring William Grant Still and said that the production had fully embodied the spirit of her husband's work. The New York Times review of the television production praised the opera as \\"simple but effective,\\" and described the cast as \\"exceptionally handsome and talented.\\" The production received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction. To date, the televised production has not been commercially released on DVD.

He was possibly imprisoned for a year on his return. In 1657, he married Catherine, daughter of James Pollexfen and niece of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. A True Account of the Apprehending of Sir Thomas Armstrong, printed at London, 1684 Following the Restoration, he received, in February 1661, a commission as captain- lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards. In August 1675, Armstrong killed the son of one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting at a London theatre. Armstrong was pardoned on the grounds that his opponent had drawn first. Armstrong served with James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth in France from 1672, fighting at the Siege of Maastricht (1673) and alongside the Dutch, in 1678. He was wounded at St Denis. In 1679, he helped suppress the covenanter rising and fought at the battle of Bothwell Bridge, at the same time that the Popish Plot in England was scaring the Anglican establishment. Monmouth's influence secured him as MP for Stafford in March 1679 to the First Exclusion Parliament.  Death  Engraving depicting the execution of Sir Thomas Armstrong in 1684 Following the Rye House Plot, in 1683, he was indicted in the Court of King's Bench for high treason. A wanted man, Armstrong fled to Cleves and then Rotterdam but was captured in Leiden and sentenced to death by Judge George Jeffreys. He was dragged by hurdle to Tower Hill, where he was hanged, drawn and quartered, on 20 June 1684. His head was affixed to Westminster Hall, three of his quarters were displayed in London, and the fourth at Stafford.

Each side of the square is X+Y in length. The area of the square is the sum of the area of the yellow region (=X2), the area of the green region (=Y2), and the area of the two white regions (=2√óX√óY). The freshman's dream is a name sometimes given to the erroneous equation (x + y)n = xn + yn, where n is a real number (usually a positive integer greater than 1). Beginning students commonly make this error in computing the power of a sum of real numbers, falsely assuming powers distribute over sums.Julio R. Bastida, Field Extensions and Galois Theory, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1984, p.8.Fraleigh, John B., A First Course in Abstract Algebra, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1993, p.453, . When n = 2, it is easy to see why this is incorrect: (x + y)2 can be correctly computed as x2 + 2xy + y2 using distributivity (commonly known as the FOIL method). For larger positive integer values of n, the correct result is given by the binomial theorem. The name \\"freshman's dream\\" also sometimes refers to the theorem that says that for a prime number p, if x and y are members of a commutative ring of characteristic p, then (x + y)p = xp + yp. In this more exotic type of arithmetic, the \\"mistake\\" actually gives the correct result, since p divides all the binomial coefficients apart from the first and the last, making all intermediate terms equal to zero. The identity is actually true in the context of tropical geometry, where multiplication is replaced with addition, and addition is replaced with minimum. Examples *(1+4)^2 = 5^2 = 25, but 1^2+4^2 = 17. *\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} does not generally equal \\\\sqrt{x^2}+\\\\sqrt{y^2}=x+y. For example, \\\\sqrt{9+16}=\\\\sqrt{25}=5, which does not equal . In this example, the error is being committed with the exponent . Prime characteristic When p is a prime number and x and y are members of a commutative ring of characteristic p, then . This can be seen by examining the prime factors of the binomial coefficients: the nth binomial coefficient is :\\\\binom{p}{n} = \\\\frac{p!}{n!(p-n)!}. The numerator is p factorial, which is divisible by p. However, when , neither n! nor is divisible by p since all the terms are less than p and p is prime. Since a binomial coefficient is always an integer, the nth binomial coefficient is divisible by p and hence equal to 0 in the ring. We are left with the zeroth and pth coefficients, which both equal 1, yielding the desired equation. Thus in characteristic p the freshman's dream is a valid identity. This result demonstrates that exponentiation by p produces an endomorphism, known as the Frobenius endomorphism of the ring. The demand that the characteristic p be a prime number is central to the truth of the freshman's dream. A related theorem states that if p is prime then in the polynomial ring \\\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]. This theorem is a key fact in modern primality testing.A. Granville, It Is Easy To Determine Whether A Given Integer Is Prime, Bull. of the AMS, Volume 42, Number 1 (Sep. 2004), Pages 3‚Äì38. History and alternate names The history of the term \\"freshman's dream\\" is somewhat unclear. In a 1940 article on modular fields, Saunders Mac Lane quotes Stephen Kleene's remark that a knowledge of in a field of characteristic 2 would corrupt freshman students of algebra. This may be the first connection between \\"freshman\\" and binomial expansion in fields of positive characteristic.Colin R.

(Mathematical Association of America), The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 62, No. 421 (Oct., 1978), The Mathematical Association. p. 221. Since then, authors of undergraduate algebra texts took note of the common error. The first actual attestation of the phrase \\"freshman's dream\\" seems to be in Hungerford's graduate algebra textbook (1974), where he quotes McBrien.Thomas W.

Lampert was the third son of the future King B√©la I of Hungary and his Polish wife. He was born in Hungary when his father had already returned from Poland and had already received the Tercia pars regni in appanage from his brother, King Andrew I of Hungary. Following the death of King B√©la I (11 September 1063), Lampert and his elder brothers (G√©za and Ladislaus) fled to Poland from their cousin, King Solomon, who had returned to the kingdom with the military assistance of the Emperor Henry IV. When the German armies left the kingdom shortly afterwards, the three brothers returned followed by the troops King Boles≈Çaw II, their maternal cousin, provided them. The parties, however, wanted to avoid the civil war; therefore they accepted the mediation services of the bishops, and they made an agreement (20 January 1064) in Gy≈ër. Under the agreement, Lampert and his brothers accepted King Solomon's rule, and they received their father's former duchy, i.e., the Tercia pars regni. In the next years, the three dukes collaborated successfully with King Solomon, but afterwards new conflicts emerged among them. The three dukes rebelled against the king and the eldest of them, G√©za, was proclaimed king following their victory over Solomon's troops (14 March 1074). When King G√©za I died (25 April 1077) his brother, Ladislaus, ascended the throne. During his brothers' reign, Lampert probably continued to govern the duchy or only its parts centered on Bihar (today Biharea in Romania). He invited Saxon settlers to his province and founded Lampertsz√°sz that became the nucleus of the future Beregsz√°sz (today Berehove in Ukraine). Lampert founded the a monastery for the White Canons in Titel (today in Serbia).

It was transferred to Pakistan Army on Partition of India in 1947 and merged with the Baluch Regiment in 1956. Madras Infantry The 8th Punjab Regiment had its origins in the Madras Army, where its first battalion was raised at Masulipatam in 1798. Four more battalions were raised in 1799-1800. In 1824, they were designated as the 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd Regiments of Madras Native Infantry. In the early 19th century, these battalions were engaged in fighting the Marathas and took part in a number of foreign expeditions including the Anglo-Burmese Wars. Between 1890 and 1893, they were reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims and Sikhs as Burma Battalions and permanently based in Burma to police the turbulent Burmese hill tracts. Under the Kitchener Reforms of 1903, they were redesignated as the 89th, 90th, 91st, 92nd Punjabis, and 93rd Burma Infantry. They were delocalized from Burma before the First World War.Ahmad, Maj RN, and Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2006). Unfaded Glory: The 8th Punjab Regiment 1798-1956.

Their long list of honours and awards includes the Victoria Cross awarded to Naik Shahmed Khan of 89th Punjabis in 1916. The 89th Punjabis had the unique distinction of serving in more theatres of war than any other unit of the British Empire. These included Aden, where they carried out the first opposed sea-borne assault landing in modern warfare, Egypt, Gallipoli, France, Mesopotamia, North-West Frontier Province, Salonika and Russian Transcaucasia.Geoghegan, Col NM, and Campbell, Capt MHA.

During the Second World War the 8th Punjab Regiment again distinguished itself, suffering more than 4500 casualties. It was awarded two Victoria Crosses to Havildar Parkash Singh and Sepoy Kamal Ram, besides numerous other gallantry awards. The regiment raised a further nine battalions. Two of its battalions, the 1st and 7th, were captured on Singapore Island, when the British Commonwealth Army surrendered there to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. Four battalions fought in the Burma Campaign, while others saw service in Iraq, Iran, Italy, French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies. Two men from the 8th Punjab Regiment received the Victoria Cross: Havildar Parkash Singh in Burma and Sepoy Kamal Ram in Italy. By the end of the war, the Regiment consisted of 14 Battalions. However, most of the war- raised units were disbanded in 1946 except the 6th and 8th Battalions. Post- independence history In 1947, the 8th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan, and Sikhs and Gujars were exchanged with Hindustani Muslims from units allotted to India. In January 1948, 6th Battalion was disbanded, only to be re-raised in October along with the 9th Battalion, in response of the Kashmir War with India.

Biography Henry Conyngham was born into an aristocratic family of Anglo-Irish descent, the eldest son of The 7th Marquess Conyngham (1924‚Äì2009) by his wife, Eileen Wren Newsom. He attended Harrow School before studying at Harvard University. Henry became known as the Earl of Mount Charles, a courtesy title, in 1974. He succeeded his father in the Marquessate of Conyngham and other hereditary peerages in March 2009. However, in the Republic of Ireland, he is frequently referred to as 'Lord Mount Charles', his former courtesy title. He also inherited the title Baron Minster, of Minster Abbey in the County of Kent, created in 1821 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for his ancestor, The 1st Marquess Conyngham, thereby giving the Marquesses Conyngham the automatic right to sit in the British House of Lords (until 1999). The then Lord Mount Charles unsuccessfully contested the Louth constituency for Fine Gael at the 1992 general election. In 1997, Lord Mount Charles stood for election to Seanad √âireann for the University of Dublin, again without success. At the 2004 European Parliament election, he was approached by Fine Gael to enter the contest for selection as a Fine Gael candidate for the East constituency. However, when the television presenter and agricultural journalist Maire√°d McGuinness emerged as a potential candidate, Lord Mount Charles withdrew from the race. Lord Conyngham, as he has been known since March 2009, and his wife divide their time between Beauparc House and Slane Castle in County Meath; the latter was the family's principal ancestral seat until it was badly damaged by fire in 1992, but has now been restored. Lord Conyngham enjoys a high profile in Ireland as the author of a weekly column in the Irish Daily Mirror. He has been dubbed the rock and roll aristocrat or the rock and roll peer owing to the very successful series of rock concerts he has hosted since 1981, held in the natural amphitheatre in the grounds of Slane Castle. These concerts have included performances by The Rolling Stones, Thin Lizzy, Queen, U2, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Oasis and Madonna. Henry, Lord Conyngham, received the Industry Award at the 2010 Meteor Awards. In his autobiography Public Space‚ÄìPrivate Life: A Decade at Slane Castle, he described his business career and the challenges of being an Anglo-Irish peer in modern Ireland, and how being Anglo-Irish has gradually become more accepted there. Marriages and children Lord Conyngham, when he was styled as Viscount Slane, married Juliet Ann Kitson in 1971. They had three children, a daughter and two sons, and were divorced in 1985: * Alexander Burton Conyngham, Earl of Mount Charles (born 30 January 1975), married Carina Bolton (paternal granddaughter of banker Sir George Bolton and paternal granddaughter of the 4th Baron Terrington), having a daughter and two sons: **Lady Laragh Conyngham (born 2009) ** Rory Nicholas Burton Conyngham, Viscount Slane (born 2010) **The Hon.

Vagrants usually live in poverty and support themselves by begging, garbage scraping, petty theft, temporary work, or welfare (where available). Historically, vagrancy in Western societies was associated with petty crime, begging and lawlessness, and punishable by law by forced labor, forced military service, imprisonment, or confinement to dedicated labor houses. A person who experiences this condition may be referred to as a vagrant, vagabond, rogue, tramp or drifter. Both vagrant and vagabond ultimately derive from the Latin word vagari, meaning \\"wander\\". The term vagabond is derived from Latin vagabundus. In Middle English, vagabond originally denoted a person without a home or employment.Definition of vagabond from Oxford Dictionaries Online Historical views A woodcut from c. 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England. Vagrants have been historically characterised as outsiders in settled, ordered communities: embodiments of otherness, objects of scorn or mistrust, or worthy recipients of help and charity. Some ancient sources show vagrants as passive objects of pity, who deserve generosity and the gift of alms. Others show them as subversives, or outlaws, who make a parasitical living through theft, fear and threat. Some fairy tales of medieval Europe have beggars cast curses on anyone who was insulting or stingy towards them. In Tudor England, some of those who begged door-to-door for \\"milk, yeast, drink, pottage\\" were thought to be witches.The Discovery of Witchcraft (London, 1584) by Reginald Scot p. 6 Many world religions, both in history and today, have vagrant traditions or make reference to vagrants. In Christianity, Jesus is seen in the Bible shown having compassion for beggars, prostitutes, and the disenfranchised. The Catholic church also teaches compassion for people living in vagrancy. Vagrant lifestyles are seen in Christian movements in notable figures such as St. Paul. Many still exist in places like Europe, Africa, and the Near East, as preserved by Gnosticism, Hesychasm, and various esoteric practices. In some East Asian and South Asian countries, the condition of vagrancy has long been historically associated with the religious life, as described in the religious literature of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Muslim Sufi traditions. Examples include sadhus, dervishes, Bhikkhus and the sramanic traditions generally.  In law  = Belgium = From 27 November 1891, a vagabond could be jailed. Vagabonds, beggars and procurers were imprisoned in vagrancy prisons: Hoogstraten; Merksplas; and Wortel (Flanders). There, the prisoners had to work for their living by working on the land or in the prison workhouse. If the prisoners had earned enough money, then they could leave the ‚Äúcolony‚Äù (as it was called). On 12 January 1993, the Belgian vagrancy law was repealed. At that time, 260 vagabonds still lived in the Wortel colony. = Denmark = In medieval times, vagabonds were controlled by an official called the Stodderkonge who was responsible for a town or district and expelled those without a permit. Their role eventually transferred to the police. = Finland and Sweden = In premodern Finland and Sweden, vagrancy was a crime, which could result in a sentence of forced labor or forced military service. There was a \\"legal protection\\" (Finnish: laillinen suojelu) obligation: those not part of the estates of the realm (nobility, clergy, burghers or land-owners) were obliged to be employed, or otherwise, they could be charged with vagrancy. Legal protection was mandatory already in medieval Swedish law, but Gustav I of Sweden began strictly enforcing this provision, applying it even when work was potentially available. In Finland, the legal protection provision was repealed in 1883; however, vagrancy still remained illegal, if connected with \\"immoral\\" or \\"indecent\\" behavior.Original definition: \\"se, joka ilman elatusta omista varoistaan tahi toisen huolenpidon kautta ty√∂tt√∂m√§n√§ kuljeksii harjoittaen siveet√∂nt√§ ja s√§√§dyt√∂nt√§ el√§m√§√§...\\" In 1936, a new law moved the emphasis from criminalization into social assistance. Forced labor sentences were abolished in 1971 and anti-vagrancy laws were repealed in 1987. =Germany= In Germany, according to the 1871 Penal Code (¬ß 361 des Strafgesetzbuches von 1871), vagabondage was among the grounds to confine a person to a labor house.The unsettled, \\"asocials\\" University of Minnesota In the Weimar Republic, the law against vagrancy was relaxed, but it became much more stringent in Nazi Germany, where vagrancy, together with begging, prostitution, and \\"work-shyness\\" (arbeitsscheu), was classified \\"asocial behavior\\" as punishable by confinement to concentration camps. = Russia =  Russian Empire  In the Russian Empire, the legal term \\"vagrancy\\" (, brodyazhnichestvo) was defined in another way than corresponding terms (vagabondage, Landstreicherei) in Western Europe. Russian law recognized one as a vagrant if he could not prove his own standing (title), or if he changed his residence without a permission from authorities, rather than punishing loitering or absence of livelihood. Foreigners who had been twice expatriated with prohibition of return to the Russian Empire and were arrested in Russia again were also recognized as vagrants. Punishments were harsh: According to Ulozhenie, the set of currently empowered laws, a vagrant who could not elaborate on his kinship, standing, or permanent residence, or gave false evidence, was sentenced to 4-year imprisonment and subsequent exile to Siberia or another far-off province.  Soviet Union  In the , which came into force on 1 January 1961, systematic vagrancy (that which was identified more than once) was punishable by up to two years' imprisonment (section 209).–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –†–°–§–°–† –æ—Ç 27.10.1960 ¬´–û–± —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –£–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å–∞ –†–°–§–°–†¬ª (–≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ —Å ¬´–£–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å–æ–º –†–°–§–°–†¬ª) // –°–≤–æ–¥ –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –†–°–§–°–†. ‚Äì —Ç. 8, ‚Äì —Å. 497, 1988 // –í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –í–° –†–°–§–°–†. ‚Äì 1960. ‚Äì ‚Ññ 40. ‚Äì —Å—Ç. 591 This continued until 5 December 1991, when Section 209 was repealed and vagrancy ceased to be a criminal offence.–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω ¬´–û –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏ –¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ –£–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å –†–°–§–°–†, –£–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ-–ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å—É–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å –†–°–§–°–† –∏ –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å –†–°–§–°–† –æ–± –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö¬ª jn 5.12.1991 ‚Ññ 1982-I // –í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –°—ä–µ–∑–¥–∞ –ù–î –†–§ –∏ –í–° –†–§, N 52, 26.12.91, —Å—Ç. 1867  Russian Federation  At present, vagrancy is not a criminal offence in Russia, but it is an offence for someone over 18 to induce a juvenile (one who has not reached that age) to vagrancy, according to Chapter 20, Section 151 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. The note, introduced by the Federal Law No. 162 of 8 December 2003, provides that the section does not apply, if such act is performed by a parent of the juvenile under harsh life circumstances due to the loss of livelihood or the absence of living place. = United Kingdom = The Pass Room at Bridewell, c. 1808. At this time paupers from outside London apprehended by the authorities could be imprisoned for seven days before being sent back to their own parish. The Ordinance of Labourers 1349 was the first major vagrancy law in England and Wales. The ordinance sought to increase the available workforce following the Black Death in England by making idleness (unemployment) an offence. A vagrant was a person who could work but chose not to, and having no fixed abode or lawful occupation, begged. Vagrancy was punishable by human branding or whipping. Vagrants were distinguished from the impotent poor, who were unable to support themselves because of advanced age or sickness. In the Vagabonds Act 1530, Henry VIII decreed that \\"beggars who are old and incapable of working receive a beggar's licence. On the other hand, [there should be] whipping and imprisonment for sturdy vagabonds. They are to be tied to the cart-tail and whipped until the blood streams from their bodies, then they are to swear on oath to go back to their birthplace or to serve where they have lived the last three years and to 'put themselves to labour'. For the second arrest for vagabondage the whipping is to be repeated and half the ear sliced off; but for the third relapse the offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and enemy of the common weal.\\" In the Vagabonds Act 1547, Edward VI ordained that \\"if anyone refuses to work, he shall be condemned as a slave to the person who has denounced him as an idler. The master has the right to force him to do any work, no matter how vile, with whip and chains. If the slave is absent for a fortnight, he is condemned to slavery for life and is to be branded on forehead or back with the letter S; if he runs away three times, he is to be executed as a felon...If it happens that a vagabond has been idling about for three days, he is to be taken to his birthplace, branded with a red hot iron with the letter V on his breast, and set to work, in chains, on the roads or at some other labour...Every master may put an iron ring round the neck, arms or legs of his slave, by which to know him more easily.\\"An Act for the Punishing of Vagabonds, 1 Edward VI, c. 3 In England, the Vagabonds Act 1572 passed under Elizabeth I, defined a rogue as a person who had no land, no master, and no legitimate trade or source of income; it included rogues in the class of vagrants or vagabonds. If a person were apprehended as a rogue, he would be stripped to the waist, whipped until bleeding, and a hole, about the compass of an inch about, would be burned through the cartilage of his right ear with a hot iron.1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Theatre A rogue who was charged with a second offence, unless taken in by someone who would give him work for one year, could face execution as a felony. A rogue charged with a third offence would only escape death if someone hired him for two years. The Vagabonds Act of 1572 decreed that \\"unlicensed beggars above fourteen years of age are to be severely flogged and branded on the left ear unless someone will take them into service for two years; in case of a repetition of the offence, if they are over eighteen, they are to be executed, unless someone will take them into service for two years; but for the third offence they are to be executed without mercy as felons.\\" The same act laid the legal groundwork for the enforced exile (transportation) of \\"obdurate idlers\\" to \\"such parts beyond the seas as shall be [‚Ä¶] assigned by the Privy Council\\".An Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds, 14 Elizabeth I, c. 4, 5 At the time, this meant exile for a fixed term to the Virginia Company's plantations in America. Those who returned unlawfully from their place of exile faced death by hanging. The Vagabonds Act 1597 banished and transplanted \\"incorrigible and dangerous rogues\\" overseas. In Das Kapital (Capital Volume One, Chapter Twenty-Eight: Bloody Legislation Against the Expropriated, from the End of the 15th Century. Forcing Down of Wages by Acts of Parliament), Karl Marx wrote: In late-eighteenth-century Middlesex, those suspected of vagrancy could be detained by the constable or watchman and brought before a magistrate who had the legal right to interview them to determine their status. If declared vagrant, they were to be arrested, whipped, and physically expelled from the county by a vagrant contractor, whose job it was to take them to the edge of the county and pass them to the contractor for the next county on the journey. This process would continue until the person reached his or her place of legal settlement, which was often but not always their place of birth. In 1795, the Speenhamland system (also known as the Berkshire Bread Act) tried to address some of the problems that underlay vagrancy. The Speenhamland system was a form of outdoor relief intended to mitigate rural poverty in England and Wales at the end of the 18th century and during the early 19th century. The law was an amendment to the Elizabethan Poor Law. It was created as an indirect result of Britain‚Äôs involvements in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793‚Äì1815).Polanyi, Karl, and Robert Morrison MacIver. The great transformation. Vol. 5. Boston: Beacon Press, 1957. p.168 In 1821, the existing vagrancy law was reviewed by a House of Commons select committee, resulting in the publication of the, 'Report from the Select Committee on The Existing Laws Relating to Vagrants'. After hearing the views of many witnesses appearing before it the select committee made several recommendations. The select committee found that the existing vagrancy laws had become over- complicated and that they should be amended and consolidated into a single Act of Parliament. The payment of fixed rewards for the apprehension and taking vagrants before magistrates had led to abuses of the system. Due to the Poor Laws, vagrants to receive and poverty relief had to seek it from the parish where they were last legally settled, often the parish where they were born. This led to a system of convicted vagrants being 'passed' from parish to parish from where they had been convicted and punished to their own parish. The 'pass' system led to them being transported by vagrancy contractors, a system found to be open to abuses and fraud. It also found that in many instances the punishment for vagrancy offences were insufficient and certain types of vagrants should be given longer prison sentences and made to complete hard labour during it. Based on the findings and recommendations from the 1821 House of Commons Select on Vagrancy, a new Act of Parliament was introduced, 'An Act for the Punishment of Idle and Disorderly Persons, and Rogues and Vagabonds, in that Part of Great Britain called England', commonly known as the Vagrancy Act 1824. The Vagrancy Act 1824 consolidated the previous vagrancy laws and addressed many of the frauds and abuses identified during the select committee hearings. Much reformed since 1824, some of the offences included in it are still enforceable. = United States = Political cartoon by Art Young, The Masses, 1917. Colonists imported British vagrancy laws when they settled in North America. Throughout the colonial and early national periods, vagrancy laws were used to police the mobility and economic activities of the poor. People experiencing homelessness and ethnic minorities were especially vulnerable to arrest as a vagrant. Thousands of inhabitants of colonial and early national America were incarcerated for vagrancy, usually for terms of 30 to 60 days, but occasionally longer. After the American Civil War, some Southern states passed Black Codes, laws that tried to control the hundreds of thousands of freed slaves. In 1866, the state of Virginia, fearing that it would be \\"overrun with dissolute and abandoned characters\\", passed an Act Providing for the Punishment of Vagrants. Homeless or unemployed persons could be forced into labour on public or private works, for very low pay, for a statutory maximum of three months; if fugitive and recaptured, they must serve the rest of their term at minimum subsistence, wearing ball and chain. In effect, though not in declared intent, the Act criminalized attempts by impoverished freed people to seek out their own families and rebuild their lives. The commanding general in Virginia, Alfred H. Terry, condemned the Act as a form of entrapment, the attempted reinstitution of \\"slavery in all but its name\\". He forbade its enforcement. It is not known how often it was applied, or what was done to prevent its implementation, but it remained statute in Virginia until 1904.Tarter, B. Vagrancy Act of 1866, 2015, August 25, in Encyclopedia Virginia retrieved March 30, 2018 Other Southern states enacted similar laws in order to funnel blacks into their system of convict leasing. Since at least as early as the 1930s, a vagrancy law in America typically has rendered \\"no visible means of support\\" a misdemeanor, yet it has commonly been used as a pretext to take one into custody for such things as loitering, prostitution, drunkenness, or criminal association. The criminal statutes of law in Louisiana specifically criminalize vagrancy as associating with prostitutes, being a professional gambler, being a habitual drunk, or living on the social welfare benefits or pensions of others.LA Rev Stat ¬ß 14:107, http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=78260 This law establishes as vagrants all those healthy adults who are not engaged in gainful employment. In the 1960s, laws proven unacceptably broad and vague were found to violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Such laws could no longer be used to obstruct the \\"freedom of speech\\" of a political demonstrator or an unpopular group. Ambiguous vagrancy laws became more narrowly and clearly defined. In Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a Florida vagrancy law was unconstitutional because it was too vague to be understood.* Nevertheless, new local laws in the U.S. have been passed to criminalize aggressive panhandling.Legal Opinion 2008-1 (On Aggressive Panhandling) Nashville, February 20, 2008Aggressive Panhandling & Solicitation ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Crime and You Can Help!

History St. Georges Church Jesmond Newcastle According to local tradition, some time shortly after the Norman conquest there occurred in the valley of the Ouse an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The ruins of St Mary's Chapel, first recorded in 1272, are in Jesmond Dene on the west side of the valley. A trace of the processions to the shrine which occurred during the Middle Ages is found in the name of that section of the former Great North Road running north of the Tyne called Pilgrim Street. During a period in which the shrine was in need of repair it was endowed with indulgences by a rescript or edict of Pope Martin V on certain feasts of the liturgical year. A spring known as St Mary's Well of uncertain date may also be found near to the chapel. It has the word \\"Gratia\\" inscribed upon the stone above it. The greater part of the history of the shrine, its origins and the miracles which were said to have occurred there, were lost in the 16th century when the chapel was suppressed in the Reformation and fell into ruin. The ruin and its grounds later passed through various owners (one of whom tried to turn the well into a bathing pool). It was acquired by Lord Armstrong in the 19th century and given by him to the City of Newcastle. Mass is now offered there on occasion by the local Roman Catholic priest and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. Flowers along with letters and candles are often left in the ruins by pilgrims and others. A booklet outlining the surviving history of the chapel may be obtained from the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Name on North Jesmond Avenue.

Jesmond also has an extra section of non-passenger track called the Manors Stock Curve, used for re- routing trains. The old Jesmond station, which formed part of the suburban rail network prior to the Tyne and Wear Metro network, is situated on the Manors Stock Curve and can be observed from Osborne Terrace with intact platforms. Religion There has been an active Bah√° º√≠ Faith community in Jesmond for over 25 years, Jesmond is also home to the only Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Centre in North East England, located on Victoria Square near the civic centre. One of the largest evangelical Anglican churches in the UK is Jesmond Parish Church, which is affiliated with the Christian Institute (based in nearby Gosforth). Nightlife Due to a rising population of students and young professionals, Osborne Road has in recent years become a popular venue for nightlife, eating and socialising. With a large number of bars and restaurants in one location it can become congested on busy nights. The road also has a number of medium- sized hotels.

Built in 1905 by Omaha beer magnate Gottlieb Storz, the mansion was designated an Omaha Landmark on December 21, 1982, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 7, 1974. It was included in the Gold Coast Historic District when the district was listed in the NRHP on March 14, 1997. About Prominent German immigrant Gottlieb Storz founded the Storz Brewing Company in Omaha in 1876. After two decades of success he constructed this 27-room mansion in 1905. Built in the Jacobethan Revival style, the Storz Mansion is said to provide a rare visual connection to a \\"golden era\\" in Omaha's history. The mansion is home to the Adele and Fred Astaire Ballroom on the top floor, which is the only memorial to their Omaha roots.Wishart, D.J. (2004) Encyclopedia of the Great Plains University of Nebraska Pres. p 259. Built with beige brick and limestone trim, the mansion features a red tile roof, steep gables, rectangular windows with stone mullions and transoms, and a symmetrical facade. Much of the exquisite original interior remains, including hand-carved oak woodwork, a solarium covered by a stained glass dome, and distinctive mosaic fireplaces in the living and dining rooms.Gerber, K. and Spenser, J.S. (2003) Building for the Ages: Omaha's architectural landmarks. Landmarks, Inc. p 103. The mansion's heyday was the mid-20th century when Arthur Storz, Jr., owned it. The mansion was the scene of an opulent party celebrating the movie Strategic Air Command in 1955. The movie premiere was held in Omaha and the premiere party was held at the Storz mansion with guests including James Stewart and June Allyson, as well as the Strategic Air Command Commander Curtis LeMay.\\"Can of the Month: Storz\\", RustyCans.com. Retrieved 5/12/08. During that same period Robert Storz raised his son, Todd, in the mansion. Todd Storz grew to love ham radio while living there; he eventually pioneered the Top 40 radio format that grew to popularity around the world.Fisher, M. \\"Chapter 1: Omaha Morning\\" , The magic of radio. Retrieved 5/12/08. The mansion has continuously been occupied by a single family throughout its history, unlike many of the other notable houses throughout this neighborhood, which were frequently converted from single to multiple-family dwellings, and often reconverted. After it left the Storz family, Michael Gaughan, son of Jackie Gaughan, bought the house in 1989 and gave it to Creighton University in 2002. After leasing it as a residence the University sold the 27-room mansion in 2007. The new owner, Wayne Stuberg, is a professor and director of physical therapy at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Munroe-Meyer Institute.Burbach, C. \\"Storz Mansion Changes Hands,\\" Omaha World-Herald.

It is a federal Superfund site, although it was deleted from the National Priorities List in December 2006. A neighboring residential subdivision called South Bend, now abandoned, was located along and north of the northern boundary of Brio North. The former South Bend neighborhood consisted of about 670 homes, an elementary school, and a Little League baseball field. Documents pertaining to the Brio Superfund site are located at the San Jacinto College South Campus Library, which houses Brio Site Repository Documents, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Records, and documents concerning the adjoining Dixie Oil Processors site. Site history and contamination The 58-acre Brio Refinery site was home to several chemical companies between 1957 and 1982, when the owner, Brio Refinery Inc. declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. During that period, the site had been used for copper recovery and petroleum re-refining, typically the processing of tar, sludge, and other residue from oil tanks and other sources, as also occurred at the adjacent Dixie Oil Processors site. Throughout the years, at both sites, unprocessed petroleum and waste materials were stored in 12 large earthen pits, ranging from 14 to 32 feet deep and extending into porous soil and, thus, groundwater. Leaks from these pits also spilled into a local drainage ditch, Mud Gulley, and subsequently, via the adjoining Clear Creek, into Galveston Bay. By the late 1980s, the EPA had detected copper, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, fluorene, styrene, ethylbenzene, toluene, benzene and other toxic chemicals, including numerous chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the air and groundwater.id.USEPA Site Narrative http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar792.htm The EPA placed the Brio site on the National Priorities List in 1984. Beginning in 1989, the EPA began remediation by demolishing buildings, digging out contaminated soils for processing or disposal, containing groundwater by use of a physical barrier, and capping the site. The site was removed from the National Priorities List in 2006. Impact on the Southbend neighborhood Although groundwater was contaminated, as noted above, community wells in the adjoining South Bend neighborhood were not contaminated.Miller, McGeehin, et al. Southbend Subdivision Health Study-Harris County, Texas. Atlanta: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), 1995. Print. Pulte Homes, which built much of the Southbend community, claimed it was unaware of the problem until 1983, which was after it had built many of the homes, although it has been reported that construction workers complained of health problems while the initial homes were being built. Not long after, residents began reporting health problems. Women in the area had reported an above average rate of miscarriages and there was an increase in upper respiratory ailments, central nervous system disorders, and birth defects (particularly reproductive and heart problems). Some of the residents moved out, fearing for their health and for that of their children. Former residents have since reported various illnesses which include cancer, vasculitis, and autoimmune disease. To address these health concerns, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, conducted a cross-sectional health outcomes study to compare current residents of the Southbend subdivision with residents of a comparison group. In addition, a separate study of adverse reproductive outcomes of both current and former Southbend residents was initiated. Because of limited participation and the small number of birth defects verified by medical records, analysis of this phase of the study would not have been scientifically valid and the study was terminated. A report titled \\"Southbend Subdivision Health Outcomes Study\\" was issued in August 1995 by the ATSDR. The report delivered three conclusions: \\"1) Although findings suggest that Southbend participants were less healthy than participants from the comparison area, design limitations and potential biases must be considered. Intense media coverage, litigation, and migration from the Southbend area could have affected the results of this study. None of these associations should be interpreted to imply causality. 2) Population distributions of various biomarker levels analyzed in this study were significantly different between the two populations. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 3) The clinical significance and public health implications of isolated findings were difficult to interpret and might have been due to bias or to chance. However, the multiple symptoms reported in excess for the respiratory system are a cause of concern.\\" In 1992, the Brio Superfund site was the subject of a US$207 million court settlement, which was at the time the largest out-of-court settlement for a toxic waste case. Cleanup Razing of the houses (which sold for $70,000 to $90,000 when the subdivision was being built) began on January 2, 1997. Site remediation was originally to be done through an on-site incinerator, but after a significant portion of the incinerator apparatus was built, the plan was scrapped due to community opposition and because many of the pollutants were nonburnable minerals. The South Belt-Ellington Leader,South Belt-Ellington Leader a community newspaper still in publication as of December 2019, was known for publishing details of the Brio Superfund site and being a key opponent to on- site incineration. The EPA determined that full remediation was infeasible given technological and financial constraints, so the in-place containment with clay slurries and various forms of site monitoring was performed. As of December 8,2019, the area is restricted by a surrounding fence with \\"no trespassing\\" signs. Some remains of the baseball field can be found in the surrounding wooded areas. As of December 8, 2019, the site is currently in an operations and maintenance phase and monitored by the EPA. In 2010, there was a contaminant leak discovered at the site. According to the EPA Superfund Remedial Project Manager at the time, Gary Miller, the contaminant plume posed no threat to residents. The Third Five-Year Review was completed on April 25, 2008.Third Five-Year Review Report for Brio Superfund Site, Harris County, TX. 2008. United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6. The review found that the remedy at the site was protective of human health and the environment. Elevated groundwater contaminant concentrations have been reported in the Fifty-Foot Sand water-bearing zone (FFSZ) at one well within the Brio Site boundary.Brio Refining Superfund site. 2012. United States Environmental Protection Agency. The Brio Site Task Force is completing field work for an investigation of the FFSZ groundwater at multiple locations on site in order to assess the need for further remedial action. The next Five- Year Review Report is scheduled for completion in 2018. The Fifth Five-Year Review was completed in September of 2018, in which the EPA said the remedial actions performed are acting as designed.

Midtbyen is part of district Aarhus C, with postal code 8000, together with Vesterbro, N√∏rre Stenbro and Frederiksbjerg and it has a population of 55,000. Midtbyen is characterized by narrow, winding, cobbled streets and a busy street life, with many small squares, caf√©s and shops. Parts of the old town center has been saved and protected from destructive modern development and can be experienced in the neighbourhood of Latinerkvarteret, but old individual listed houses are scattered all across Midtbyen. A large part of the area is carfree and the neighborhood has been increasingly pedestrianised. The square of Store Torv (lit.: large square) in front of the cathedral, forms a natural centre of the large pedestrian zone. The stream of Aarhus √Ö flows through Midtbyen and adds to the areas' distinct charm. The waterway was covered by roads for many decades, but has recently been opened up again. History Midtbyen comprise the oldest part of the city of Aarhus and was where the town itself originated more than a thousand years ago. Midtbyen dates back to at least late 700 AD, at the beginning of the Viking Age and was originally and previously confined by fortifications and walls. Nowadays the defensive walls are long gone, but survive in placenames such as N√∏rreport (English: Northern Gate) and a number of streets named after their location relative to the old town center, such as S√∏ndergade, N√∏rregade and Vestergade meaning southern street, northern street and western street respectively. A similar naming structure can be observed in many older Danish towns and cities. The canal of the Aarhus River runs through Midtbyen, along the street of √Öboulevarden and was important to the development of the early settlements, that sprawled around it. Infrastructure The streets in Midtbyen are mostly narrow and laid out in a somewhat chaotic pattern. Many are closed to motorized traffic, instead serving as pedestrian zones with a lively street life and shopping opportunities. Outside of these areas, a lot of the roads are one way directed and it can be difficult to navigate or find a free parking spot, if you do not know the area well. Midtbyen has some heavy traffic during rush hours and it can also be a problem. To guide the traffic and take of the pressure, the inner city of Aarhus is surrounded by a number of ring roads. In Midtbyen, the streets of N√∏rre All√© (Northern Avenue), Vester All√© (Western Avenue) and S√∏nder All√© (Southern Avenue), works as a ring road, following the former city walls of medieval times and guiding the traffic around the narrow and most difficult streets of the inner centre. There are several large car parks in or just outside the city centre, including Magasin du Nord, Dokk1, Salling, Brunn's Galleri, Scandinavian Center and Storcenter Nord. Most of the yellow city buses in Aarhus pass through Midtbyen, while the blue regional and Inter- city buses terminate at the Aarhus Bus Terminal close to the Central Station. The street of Park All√© (Park Avenue) next to the City Hall, serves as a major bus hub. Even though the traffic situation can be difficult for motorized vehicles, it is fairly easy and safe to walk or bike around Midtbyen. Major roads has bike paths next to them and some streets are dedicated bike roads. It is not allowed to bike in the pedestrianised zones.

ASLV replicates in chicken embryo fibroblasts, the cells that contribute to the formation of connective tissues. Different forms of the disease exist, including lymphoblastic, erythroblastic, and osteopetrotic. Avian sarcoma leukosis virus is characterized by a wide range of tumors, the most common of which are lymphomas. Lymphoid leukosis is the most common form of this disease and with typical presentation of gradual onset, persistent low mortality, and neoplasia of the bursa. The disease is also characterized by an enlarged liver due to infiltration of cancerous lymphoid cells. In addition, other abdominal organs and the bursa of Fabricius are often infected. Occurrence Lymphoid leukosis has a worldwide distribution, and is most commonly found in birds 16 weeks or older. History Sarcoma in chickens has been studied since the early 1900s when Ellerman and Bang demonstrated that erythroleukemia can be transmitted between chickens by cell-free tissue filtrates, and in 1911 when (Francis) Peyton Rous proved that sarcoma can be transmitted through cell free extracts of solid chicken tumors. Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery in 1966. By the 1960s, ASLV became a problem with egg-laying hens and effort was made to isolate the disease. However, the movement was unsuccessful in maintaining leukosis-free flocks. In 1961, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), which is closely related to ASLV, was shown to contain RNA, and oncogenic viruses, such as RSV and ASLV, were termed RNA tumor viruses. By the late 1960s, Howard Temin hypothesized that RSV made a copy of its own DNA and integrated that into the host cell's chromosomal DNA. Much debate in the scientific community surrounded this issue until DNA integration was demonstrated by Temin in 1968 and reverse transcriptase was independently discovered by both Temin and David Baltimore in 1970. Temin and Baltimore won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1975.All Nobel Laureates Lymphoid leukosis was eradicated in primary breeders in the 1980s and 1990s which dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease in commercial laying hens. Commercial broilers are still struggling with ALV-J virus in many countries. Both layers and broilers may still become infected, especially if there are contaminated vaccines.3 Today, research is carried out on ASLV in order to better understand retroviral cell entry. Since ASLV uses distinct cellular receptors to gain entry into cells, it has proven useful for understanding the early events in retroviral infection. A detailed understanding of retroviral cell entry may lead to the discovery of ways in which to block the viruses from entering cells. Retroviruses also have the potential to serve as gene delivery vectors in gene therapy. Classification ASLV is a Group VI virus of the family Retroviridae. It is of the genus Alpharetrovirus, and has a C-type morphology. Hence, it is an enveloped virus with a condensed, central core, and has barely visible envelope spikes, or proteins. ASLV is divided into six subgroups, labelled A through E and J, each having a different antigenicity due to variances in viral envelope glycoproteins. Strains A through E are highly related and are believed to have evolved from the same ancestor. The subgroups evolved to utilize difference cellular receptors to gain entry into avian cells due to the host developing resistance to viral entry. Some antigenic variation can occur within subgroups, and all strains are oncogenic, but oncogenicity and the ability to replicate varies between subgroups. Viral structure and composition Like many retroviruses, ASLV consists of a lipid envelope containing transmembrane and cell surface glycoproteins. Enclosed within the envelope is a capsid surrounding single stranded RNA, integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that allows for the reversal of genetic transcription. As with all retroviruses, the virus is transcribed from RNA to DNA, instead of DNA to RNA as in normal cellular replication. Viral glycoprotein-receptor interactions are required to initiate membrane fusion of the virus and cell. The surface glycoproteins contain the major domains that interact with the host cell receptor while the transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins anchor the surface glycoproteins to the virus membrane. The TM glycoproteins are directly involved in the fusion of the virus and host membranes for entry. The surface glycoproteins for subgroups A-E are almost identical and include the conservation of all cysteine amino acid residues. Viral specificity is determined by five hyper variable regions, vr1, vr2, hr1, hr2, and vr3, on the surface glycoproteins. Binding specificity is determined primarily by the hr1 and hr2 regions, with the vr3 region contributing to receptor recognition but not to binding specificity of the viral glycoprotein and cellular receptor. In chicken chromosomes, three autosomal loci, t-va, t-vb, and t-vc, have been identified which control cell susceptibility of the ASLV virus subgroups A, B, and C respectively. Each of these genes codes for the cellular receptors Tva, Tvb, and Tvc. Tva contains sequences related to the ligand binding region of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR). The Tvb receptor is believed to be very closely related to the receptors for both ASLV D and E, so that the ASLV D and E will bind to Tvb. Tvb is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. The Tvc receptor is closely related to mammalian butyrophilins, which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. ASLV is genetically closely related to the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), but unlike RSV, ASLV does not contain the src gene, which codes for a tyrosine kinase, and does not transform the fibroblasts that it infects. Both RSV and ASLV contain the gag gene, which is common to most retroviruses and encodes for the capsid proteins, and the pol gene which encodes for the reverse transcriptase enzyme. ASLV and some RSVs also contain the env gene, which encodes a precursor polyprotein that assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum. The polyproteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, glycosylated and cleaved to produce two glycoproteins: one surface and one transmembrane. Resources The Avian Diagnostic and Oncology Laboratory, in East Lansing, MI is the primary laboratory for research in ALV and other tumor viruses.

Larry and Phil have a singular hope for the evening‚Äîto make the acquaintance of Dick Fuller -- CEO of one of the largest manufacturing firms in the Midwest and, as such, a potential savior of their ailing company... a man whom they invited but have never met or seen. As the three prepare the room and themselves to host the evening's festivities, the conversation tacks into delicate issues not often discussed in a business environment‚Äîincluding religion, where the stark differences between Larry and Bob come to light and subtle battle lines are drawn below the surface. Late that night, when the last of the partygoers has downed his last drink and left the room, Phil and Larry are desolate because Dick Fuller didn't show. Larry had even left the room to search for him earlier in the night but was unable to hunt him down. All seems truly lost until, by a slip of the tongue, they realize that Dick Fuller did show up and that Bob unwittingly talked to him at length about a lot of issues unrelated to industrial lubricants, including religion‚Äîa fact that accentuates the battle lines and brings Larry's blood to a low boil. Bob is sent on a mission to find Dick Fuller at another party down the street and relay Larry and Phil's desire to speak to him about lubricants. Later still, as Phil and Larry wait for Bob, the questions bugging Phil about life and purpose make themselves known‚Äîcutting through the veneer of their relationship and exposing both to their true feelings about each other. When Bob returns and reveals that he found Dick Fuller but that he could only bring himself to talk to him about Jesus, the gloves come off, and no one is left unscathed.

It was fought on open ground in Cornwall, on 19 January 1643. An apparently easy victory for the Royalists under Sir Ralph Hopton secured Cornwall for King Charles and confirmed Hopton's reputation as a commander. Hopton also gained respect for the mercy shown to his foe, of whom 1,500 were captured during and after the battle. The precise location of the battlefield is a matter of dispute, though English Heritage believe it to be within parkland at Boconnoc. Prelude Hopton had been attempting to march into Devon from Cornwall but was prevented from doing so by the Parliamentarian force at Plymouth under the Earl of Stamford and William Ruthven. He retreated across Bodmin Moor and on 17 January was able to replenish his food and ammunition stores from three Parliamentarian ships that sought refuge from a storm at Falmouth and were captured. Sir Ralph Hopton's Royalist forces had been camped the night of 18/19 January at Boconnoc. On breaking camp, their dragoon vanguard encountered Parliamentarian cavalry to the east, and discovered Ruthven's army deployed on Braddock Down. Ruthven had been unwilling to wait for reinforcements sent by Stamford to arrive and had marched to face the Royalists in the hope of a quick victory. Ruthven initially believed he was facing stragglers from Hopton's main army but was instead lured into facing the entire Royalist force. Battle Ruthven had more cavalry, but Hopton had more infantry and also two light cannons. These he kept concealed during the first two hours of the battle, which was largely a long-range musket duel. After deciding to attack, Hopton ordered his Cornish foot under Sir Bevil Grenville to charge. The defending Parliamentarians, drawn from newly raised and inexperienced forces, fired just one volley at the Cornish, causing two casualties, then turned and fled.  Aftermath  The defeated Parliamentarians were pursued into Liskeard where over 1,200 were captured. In all 1,500 Parliamentarians were captured and a further 200 killed with few losses on the Royalist side. Hopton drove another band of survivors out of Saltash, where they had fled after the battle. The battle cost the Royalists little but had severe consequences for the Parliamentarians, who lost the prospect of controlling Cornwall. Hopton's reputation as a commander was bolstered by his victory here and he was also commended for the mercy shown to his surrendered foe.  Battlefield  The location of the battle is a matter of dispute. English Heritage considers the location to be slightly south of Middle Taphouse. However traditional opinion places the battle within Boconnoc Park. The exact location is not likely to be discovered without archaeological excavation. A cross from Lanlivery was made into the upper section of \\"The Monument\\" on Druids Hill, St Winnow. It was brought from Lanlivery in 1846; this monument commemorates the loss of life in the Battle of Braddock Down.

History A bottle of Tusker in 2008. New design bottles with the current logo have since been launched. In 1922, Kenya Breweries (now East African Breweries) was formally incorporated as a private limited company. The company's first beer was brewed on 15 December 1922. The first batch was delivered to the Stanley Hotel, where it was met with mixed reactions. The beer, originally from Kenya, shifted through to Tanzania and other countries in the African Great Lakes region, and soon began to be exported. The company's first annual general meeting was held in 1923. George Hurst, the company's founder, was killed in an elephant hunting accident and in his memory, his brother Charles decided to name the first beer brewed \\"Tusker\\". In 1929, the company's board moved to use malted barley in the beer's production instead of using imported malt extracts, significantly improving its taste and colour and saving the company at least ¬£780 (approx. US$1,240 or ‚Ç¨985) per year. In 2012, that is approximately ¬£35,400 (approx. US$56,220 or ‚Ç¨44,690), assuming an annual inflation rate of 2% from 2011 onwards. Wooden beer cases were replaced with plastic cases in 1970. In 1987, Central Glass Industries also began producing Tusker bottles for the first time.

Toxascaris leonina, or T. leonina, is an ascarid nematode, a worldwide distributed helminth parasite which is in a division of eukaryotic parasites that, unlike external parasites such as lice and fleas, live inside their host. The definitive hosts of T. leonina include canids (dogs, foxes, etc.) and felines (cats), while the intermediate hosts are usually rodents, such as mice or rats. Infection occurs in the definitive host when the animal eats an infected rodent. While T. leonina can occur in either dogs or cats, it is far more frequent in cats. A coprolite containing T. leonina eggs was excavated in Argentina's Catamarca Province and dated to 17002‚Äì16573 years old. This finding indicates that T. leonina exists in South America since at least the Late Pleistocene. Life cycle The life cycle of T. leonina is fairly simple. Eggs are ingested and hatch in the small intestine. The juveniles then penetrate the mucosal lining of the small intestine. After growth and molt, they return to the intestinal lumen and mature. The adult female worm lays eggs which are passed in the feces of the animal. The eggs become infective after 3‚Äì6 days in the environment. Cats can become infected by ingesting either the egg or rodents that contain the larvae. Rodents are usually the intermediate hosts of T. leonina. The rodent ingests the eggs and, once the eggs are hatched, the larvae migrate through the tissues of the rodent. The definitive host is then infected with this parasite when it eats an infected rodent. The egg of the T. leonina is usually more oval than round. The prepatent period for T. leonina is two to three months. The adult worms are usually 3-4 inches long and can be seen in the feces and vomit of the animal. Toxascaris leonina differs from other Toxocara in that the larvae do not migrate through the lungs; but rather, the entire developmental cycle occurs in the gut. Symptoms of infection Roundworms absorb the nutrients from the animal, which can interfere with digestion and can also damage the lining of the intestine. Animals may not show any outward symptoms of roundworms at all, or in other, usually more severe cases, animals may have diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, experience thinning, dull coats, and in puppies or kittens, can develop distended abdomens, or \\"pot- belly\\" appearance. Infection symptoms are similar to infection by other Toxacara species (T. canis, T. cati). It is a common cause of diarrhea in young animals and can cause vomiting as well. Sometimes the worms themselves are vomited up, which can be alarming as they can be quite large with females reaching lengths of up to seven inches. The worms consume the host's food and can lead to lethargy and a classical pot-bellied appearance. Unlike T. canis and T. Cati, T. leonina is nonmigratory with its life cycle affecting only one organ. Prevention and treatment It is recommended to de-worm all puppies and kittens at 6 weeks and repeat treatment 2‚Äì4 weeks after the first treatment. T. leonina roundworm infections are treated with the same medication protocol as the T. canis or T. cati roundworm infections (see Toxocariasis). Therefore, when eggs are seen on a fecal flotation exam, or fecal swab, it is not necessary to determine which species is present. Roundworm infections are treated with medication, called \\"de-wormers\\", and includes such drugs as fenbendazole, pyrantel, milbemycin oxime, and piperazine. To prevent reinfection of parasitic roundworms, it is recommended that anything that the animal has been in contact with should be cleaned thoroughly or replaced, including bedding and kennels. It is also strongly recommended that outside areas where defecation may occur be cleaned, as well as all feces removed daily from outdoor pet runs, crates, and the yard. Risk to humans Humans are usually not infected with T. leonina; however, this parasite has been found in humans in a few instances and is a cause of visceral larva migrans in children, though less frequently implicated than is Toxocara canis, the most common roundworm parasite found in dogs.

The red square = Remains of Tenshukaku is a Japanese castle located in the city of Komoro, central Nagano Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the Edo period, Komoro Castle was home to a junior branch of the Makino clan, daimy≈ç of Komoro Domain. It was also known as or . Today, it is open to public as KaikoenÔºàÊáêÂè§ÂúíÔºâ.  History  During the Muromachi period, the area which later became the city of Komoro was under the control of a local warlord, Oi Mitsutada, who built a fortification at the site of Komoro Castle. After the area came under the control of Takeda Shingen by 1554, the fortification was completely reconstructed into a castle under the direction of Shingen's master strategist Yamamoto Kansuke. Following the destruction of the Takeda clan by Oda Nobunaga in 1582, the castle was given to Takigawa Kazumasu, one of Nobunaga's generals. After Nobunaga was assassinated in the Honn≈ç-ji incident, it came briefly under the control of the Later H≈çj≈ç clan of Odawara. After 1590, following the Battle of Odawara, Komoro came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who assigned it to his general Sengoku Hidehisa as daimy≈ç of Komoro Domain, a 50,000 koku holding later confirmed under the Tokugawa shogunate. He reinforced the walls and reorganized the structure around a central bailey surrounded by a north and south bailey. He was followed by his son, Sengoku Tadamasa. Tadamasa improved the castle, and the three-story Tenshukaku's foundation dates from this time. The foundation of the tench (Tenshukaku) The domain was transferred to the Hisamatsu branch of the Matsudaira clan from 1624‚Äì1648. In 1626, the donjon was struck by lightning and burned down. It was never rebuilt.Komoro castle ‚Äì SamuraiWiki The domain and castle subsequently passed through a number of clans: the Aoyama from 1648-1662, the Sakai from 1662-1679, the Nishio from 1679‚Äì1682 and the Ishikawa clanfrom 1682‚Äì1702. In 1702, a junior branch of the Makino clan was awarded Komoro, and remained in control until the end of the Edo period. The castle was damaged from flooding in 1742 (ja).

The Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel is a proposed rail undersea tunnel that would span the Gulf of Finland and connect the Finnish and Estonian capitals. Mike Collier. \\"Helsinki mayor still believes in Tallinn tunnel\\", The Baltic Times, 3 April 2008. Retrieved on 2008-05-13. The tunnel's length would depend upon the route taken; the shortest distance across would have a submarine length of , making it the longest undersea tunnel in the world (both the Channel Tunnel and Seikan Tunnel, whilst longer, have less length undersea). The tunnel, if constructed, is estimated to cost ‚Ç¨9‚Äì13 billion and would open sometime after 2030. The European Union has approved ‚Ç¨3.1 million in funding for feasibility studies. Background Helsinki and Tallinn are separated by the Gulf of Finland. The distance between the cities is about . Travel between the capitals is currently mainly by ferry and fast passenger boat, travel time varying from 1 hour 40 minutes (fast summer ferries operating from April to October) to three and a half hours (normal ferries operating year-round), but most ferries now take two hours per trip. Some eight million trips are made by ferry each year, including both leisure cruises and scheduled commuter service. Overland travel between Helsinki and Tallinn requires an journey through Russia. There are also around 300,000 air trips done per year between the cities. Project status Both cities have promised ‚Ç¨100,000 for preparatory studies, though the relevant ministries of each country have refused to grant any funding. An application is now planned to the EU to gain the additional funds needed for a comprehensive survey, estimated to cost between ‚Ç¨500,000 and ‚Ç¨800,000.\\"Helsinki-Tallinn Rail Tunnel Link?\\", YLE News, 28 March 2008. Retrieved on 2008-05-13. On 13 January 2009, newspaper reports suggested the application to the EU, through the Interreg programme, for comprehensive surveys had been denied. An expert at the City of Helsinki's International Affairs department suggested this may have been because of political tension within Estonia, between the national administration and the City of Tallinn, both controlled by rival political groups. Nevertheless, both cities are said to be considering funding the surveys themselves. On 2 April 2014, it was announced that a ‚Ç¨100,000 preparatory survey named TalsinkiFix will assess whether a more comprehensive profitability calculation should be done. The European Union will cover 85 per cent of the survey costs and the cities of Helsinki and Tallinn and the Harju County will pay the rest. This is the first official survey about the tunnel. The results of the preparatory survey were released in February 2015.Pre-feasibility study of Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn fixed link (Sweco, february 2015) The cost of the tunnel was estimated to be ‚Ç¨9‚Äì13 billion and the tunnel could open at earliest after 2030. The survey recommended the tunnel to be built for railway connections only with the traveling time between Helsinki and Tallinn being half an hour by train. On 4 January 2016, it was announced that the transport ministers of Finland and Estonia as well as the leadership of the cities of Helsinki and Tallinn will sign a memorandum on traffic cooperation between the two countries, including a further study to examine the feasibility of the tunnel. This study is the first to be conducted on the state level and will focus on the tunnel's socio-economical effects and geological analysis. Finland and Estonia are asking financial support from the EU for the study. In June 2016, the EU granted ‚Ç¨1 million for the study which is expected to be ready in early 2018. In August 2016 a two-year study was launched by the Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council. Other partners in the study are the government of Harju County, the cities of Helsinki and Tallinn, the Finnish Transport Agency and the Estonian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The project is headed by Kari Ruohonen, the former director general of the Finnish Transport Agency. In February 2017 two consortia were commissioned to study aspects of the project. One will study passenger and freight volumes and do a cost-benefit analysis. The other will study the technical aspects of the project. In March 2019 a similar project by Peter Vesterbacka has moved forward. Vesterbacka has made a tentative deal with Chinese investment company called Touchstone Capital Partners. The deal consists of memorandum of understanding for a 15 billion euros financial deal to fund 4 stations, the tunnel and the trains. Cost and benefits The cost of the tunnel connection has been tentatively estimated to be ‚Ç¨9‚Äì13 billion. This includes ‚Ç¨3 billion for the tunnel excavation, ‚Ç¨2‚Äì3 billion for infrastructure and security systems, over ‚Ç¨1 billion for rolling stock and other equipment and ‚Ç¨1‚Äì3 billion risk marginal for unexpected situations. The project is estimated to be financially feasible if the European Union covers at least 40 per cent of the cost, the rest being shared by Finland and Estonia and the two capital cities (for comparison, the Rail Baltica project has received 85 per cent of its funding from the EU). The √òresund Bridge integrates the cities of Copenhagen and Malm√∂ to a single economic area. The Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn tunnel is expected to have a similar effect. The economic benefits would be significant, both in terms of increased connections and economic integration between the two cities (the √òresund Region has been offered as an example), but also in a wider context of convenient passenger train connections between Southern Finland and the Baltic states, and a fixed link for freight from across Finland on to the Rail Baltica, thus providing a rail freight connection with the rest of Europe. An estimated 12.5 million annual passengers would use the tunnel. Geopolitically, the tunnel would connect two close but separated parts of the European Union in an environmentally friendly way, removing the need to use sea or air transport, or to travel through Russia. The Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn connection is part of the EU's TEN-T network's North Sea‚ÄìBaltic corridor. The ports of Helsinki and Tallinn have previously received EU funding to improve transport conditions between the two cities. Technical details Railways in Finland and Estonia use track gauge. The Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn tunnel would according to current planning use European gauge tracks to connect directly to Rail Baltica which uses the same gauge. This means trains traveling through the tunnel from Tallinn to Helsinki could not continue onwards to other Finnish destinations and vice versa (apart from the Rail Baltica track) without new tracks being built or the use of a variable gauge system. Tentative plans have been made to build separate freight stations in Southern Finland (Riihim√§ki and Tampere have been suggested) which would make it possible to load trains outside Helsinki for transportation through the tunnel. Tampere and Helsinki Airport could also host passenger terminals for trains heading to Tallinn and onwards to Central Europe.

The game stars Mutt, a dog-like devil in the Underworld whose goal is to obtain the \\"Mystical Pizza of Plenty\\" from the Labyrinth of Chaos. Litil Divil's release was delayed several times, and the game was initially advertised in magazines under the name Little Divil. Gameplay The player takes control of a little red devil called Mutt who is trying to retrieve the \\"Mystical Pizza of Plenty\\" from the Labyrinth of Chaos. The dungeon consists of a maze navigated from an over-the-shoulder perspective and rooms where Mutt is facing various riddles. Development Litil Divil first began development in July 1990, with the Amiga CD32 version releasing after four years in development in August 1994; Litil Divil's release was delayed several times. However, the original art design behind Litil Divil is stated to have happened five years before release. Litil Divil's demo was initially created by Emerald Software, and was being developed concurrently with Plan 9 From Outer Space in 1992 by Gremlin Sheffield, and was named \\"Little Divil\\" at the time. Litil Divil was first released for PC on CD, and a later floppy release on PC required frames to be removed from animation and the quality of the music to be lowered due to compression. The One interviewed Tommy Rolfe, one of Litil Divil's programmers, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview. Litil Divil was programmed by Gremlin Ireland, but work on the game was originally begun by Gremlin Sheffield, which Rolfe says \\"must have been, oh, five years ago now. It produced some artwork, sketches and things, and passed it over to us.\\" One of the original designers for Litil Divil was Heimdall 2 artist Jerr O'Carroll, prior to his departure from Gremlin and subsequent employment with Core Design in 1991. O'Carroll's artstyle is present in Mutt's design. Originally there were five different Mutts who were \\"competing with each other to get through five levels of Hell\\"; the development team decided that it would be better to concentrate on one character, and Hell was later changed to Underworld. The plot device of The Mystic Pizza of Plenty was introduced late into development. Steve McKevitt from Litil Divil's publisher Gremlin Graphics named the game, Litil Divil was chosen as opposed to 'Little Devil' because McKevitt's wife has an Irish accent, and \\"she and her family always say \\"Ooh, you litil divil\\" to the kids, when they're naughty.\\" Litil Divil was originally intended for release for the Super Famicom CD drive \\"in 1990 or 1991\\", but due to the CD drive's cancelled release, Rolfe states that \\"while we were waiting around, we thought it might be a good idea to start converting it to the PC CD-ROM. After a year or so we realized that we'd probably never see the Super Famicom CD, so we just went full steam ahead with the PC version.\\" The Amiga CD32 port was impeded by the Amiga's lower RAM, Rolfe states that \\"we developed Litil Divil originally for a PC with a minimum of 4Mb RAM. So you can see 2Mb isn't really that much when you're creating a graphics-intensive program like Litil Divil ... We recently converted Litil Divil for the [CD-i], which has 2.5Mb RAM, so we had already compacted the data down to that level - and for the CD32 we just had to go a little bit further.\\" Ports A port for the Atari Jaguar CD was in development by Gremlin Interactive and slated to be published around the second quarter of 1995, but it was never released. Reception Computer Gaming World in March 1994 called Litil Divil \\"a delightful graphic adventure\\", predicting that the game \\"should cause quite a stir ... stuffed full of game play and long term enjoyment\\". The magazine predicted that a sequel and imitations would appear. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly had a moderately positive reaction to the CD-i version, praising the multifaceted gameplay, the graphics, the sound, and the cute, humorous personality of the player character, but criticizing the lagging controls. They awarded it a score of 6.5 out of 10. Next Generation reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"The various levels [...] fail to offer anything more than a stimulus-response style of play that will have most players (even children) disinterested inside of a few minutes.\\" The One gave the Amiga version of Litil Divil an overall score of 74%, criticizing the fact that the player cannot save the game at will, instead requiring finishing a level or discovering a save room, as well as the tunnel sections of the game, calling them \\"tedious\\", and furthermore a source of \\"over-riding boredom ... there is too much bloody wandering around.\\" The One praised the art style and comical sound effects, and enjoyed the puzzle-solving and arcade sections of the game, but found the lengthy tunnel sections to be filler, remarking that without them the game would be more fun, calling Litil Divil a \\"missed opportunity\\". Re-release Funbox Media re- released the game in DotEmu (PC), Good Old Games (PC) and GamersGate (PC, Mac) on May 11, 2011, June 21, 2011, and March 19, 2014, respectively. OS X and Linux versions were added in GOG.com by Blue Moon Red Owl, the current distributor of the game on GOG.com, on May 9, 2013 and July 24, 2014.
