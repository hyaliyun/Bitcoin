In the US, it was published by Tri Synergy. It combines the attributes of a massive multiplayer online role- playing game and a real-time strategy game. Having won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the 2001 Independent Games Festival and hosted through the Game Developers Conference, the game has been commercially unsuccessful due in large part to its dated graphics engine. The game was published under the name Tactical Commanders in South Korea, published by Nexon until December 31, 2005. This game has also been serviced in Japan, Taiwan, and Germany. Plot Shattered Galaxy is set in a post-apocalyptic future. A teleportation device was found buried on Earth's surface, though scientists were not able to master its secrets. Various non-living substances were successfully sent through and retrieved, but when a common rat was inserted into the portal, it activated the artifact in an unexpected way: the device immediately teleported itself, as well as all matter in a 2000 kilometer wide radius around it, to the planet Morgana Prime. The player is one of the survivors of this incident. The planet itself was devoid of sentient life, but robotic war machines were found on its surface, and humans have since learned to control them telepathically (allowing the humans themselves to stay out of harm's way). Humans have since expanded to another planet (server) in the Morgana system, Relic, where wars likewise rage. Gameplay Development As of September 29, 2008, the game can be played using a basic account at no charge with a few minor handicaps or upgraded to an elite account at a cost of US$9.95 per month to play with all limitations removed. Nexon has closed Tactical Commanders' service in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. As of October 31, 2008, the German service was closed due to lack of players.http://tc.gamigo.de/news/#1070 Reception John Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you'd like to capture chunks of pie-charted landscapes, this is a decent persistent online game. Teamwork required.\\" The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Shattered Galaxy was a runner-up for The Electric Playgrounds \\"Best Independent PC Game\\" prize, but lost to Serious Sam: The First Encounter.

Stretching from The Presidio east to The Embarcadero (with a gap on Telegraph Hill), most of the street's western segment is a major thoroughfare designated as part of U.S. Route 101. The famous one-block section, claimed to be \\"the crookedest street in the world\\", is located along the eastern segment in the Russian Hill neighborhood. It is a major tourist attraction, receiving around two million visitors per year and up to 17,000 per day on busy summer weekends, as of 2015.San Francisco County Transportation Authority: Lombard Study: Managing Access to the \\"Crooked Street\\". February 2017 (PDF) San Francisco surveyor Jasper O'Farrell named the road after Lombard Street in Philadelphia.Loewenstein, Louis, K. (1984) Streets of San Francisco: The Origins of Street and Place Names. Don't Call It Frisco Press. Route description Lombard Street's west end is at Presidio Boulevard inside The Presidio; it then heads east through the Cow Hollow neighborhood. For 12 blocks, between Broderick Street and Van Ness Avenue, it is an arterial road that is co-signed as U.S. Route 101. Lombard Street continues through the Russian Hill neighborhood and to the Telegraph Hill neighborhood. At Telegraph Hill it turns south, becoming Telegraph Hill Boulevard to Pioneer Park and Coit Tower. Lombard Street starts again at Winthrop Street and ends at The Embarcadero as a collector road. Lombard Street is known for the one-way block on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, where eight sharp turns are said to make it the most crooked street in the world. The design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and built in 1922, was intended to reduce the hill's natural 27 percent grade, which was too steep for most vehicles. The crooked block is about long ( straightline), is one-way (downhill) and is paved with red bricks. The sign at the top recommends . The segment normally sees around 250 vehicles per hour, with average daily traffic reaching 2630 vehicles in 2013. During peak times, vehicles have to wait up to 20 minutes to enter the Crooked Street segment, in a queue that can reach Van Ness Avenue. To reduce habitual congestion and delays, future visitors may be required to reserve a time and pay a fee to drive down the crooked street. The Powell-Hyde cable car stops at the top of the block on Hyde Street. By 2017, the area around the curved segment had become a hot-spot of what has been described as \\"San Francisco's car break-in epidemic.\\" This may in part have been due to its heavy traffic and association with tourism. The Academy of Art University owns and operates a building called Star Hall on the street for housing purposes. Past residents of Lombard Street include Rowena Meeks Abdy, an early California painter who worked in the style of Impressionism. Chase scenes in many films have been filmed on the street, including Good Neighbor Sam, Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, What's Up, Doc?, Magnum Force, and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Lombard Street is also portrayed in the 2015 Pixar film Inside Out.

St. Leger was active in the Saratoga Campaign, commanding an invasion force that unsuccessfully besieged Fort Stanwix. St. Leger remained on the frontier for the duration of the war; after its conclusion, he served briefly as commander of British forces in Quebec. Life St. Leger was baptised on 1 May 1733 in County Kildare, Ireland.Fredriksen, p. 483 He was a younger son of Sir John St Leger, a leading Irish judge and politician, and his second wife Lavina Pennefather. He was the brother of Gen. Anthony St Leger (British Army officer), the founder of the St Leger Stakes. The St Legers of Kildare were a junior branch of the family of Viscount Doneraile, and the Pennefathers were a wealthy landowning family in County Tipperary. He was educated at Eton College, and then at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He joined the British Army in April 1756, serving as an ensign in the 28th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the French and Indian War under the command of Jeffery Amherst at the 1758 siege of Louisbourg, and in 1759 under the command of James Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec. He was appointed brigade-major in July 1760 and served as a staff officer in the campaign against Montreal under James Murray. On 16 September 1762, St. Leger was promoted to major in the 95th Regiment of Foot. When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, St. Leger was a lieutenant-colonel in the 34th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the 1776 British relief of Quebec following the Continental Army's 1775 invasion of that province. He was selected to lead the western offensive that formed one leg of the 1777 Saratoga Campaign. John Burgoyne breveted him as brigadier-general for this mission so that he would outrank the militia officers involved. He moved a mixed force of British regulars, Hessians, Indians, Canadiens, and Loyalists up the Saint Lawrence River to Fort Oswego, and from there to Fort Stanwix (the site of modern Rome, New York). The fort was more strongly defended than he and Burgoyne had anticipated, so he laid siege to it. When word arrived that an American relief column was approaching to break the siege, he sent a group of mostly Indians and Loyalists to oppose them. They ambushed Nicholas Herkimer's force in the Battle of Oriskany, but the fort's occupants sortied and raided their camp.Fredriksen, p. 484 When reports of a relief force under Benedict Arnold reached him he was abandoned by his Indian supporters, and was forced to withdraw back to Quebec. He then tried to join up with Burgoyne's army near Saratoga, but had only reached Fort Ticonderoga by the time Burgoyne surrendered his army in October 1777.Fredriksen, p. 485 For the next several years, St. Leger was a leader of the British frontier war against the Americans. He was promoted to colonel in 1780. In 1781, he led an attempt to kidnap General Philip Schuyler. He was also involved in the secret negotiations between Frederick Haldimand, Quebec's governor, and the Vermont Republic's leaders over the possibility of bringing Vermont into the British fold. These negotiations ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Following the war he remained in Quebec, and briefly commanded the British forces there in 1784. He resigned his commission the following year due to ill health, and died in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England. His Will was proved on 14 February 1794 at the PCC London by Frances St. Leger, widow.

Santorum does not believe the right to privacy under the United States Constitution covers sexual acts, and criticized the US Supreme Court ruling in the case of Lawrence v. Texas that ruled to the contrary. Santorum has stated that the U.S. military's \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policy, which ended in 2011, should be reinstated and has voiced his opposition to same-sex parenting. Santorum's views provoked criticism from Democratic politicians and other groups, but have been supported by some conservative Christians. 2003 interview When asked for his position on the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in 2003, Santorum said that the scandal involved priests and post-pubescent men in \\"a basic homosexual relationship\\" (rather than child sexual abuse), which led the interviewer to ask if homosexuality should be outlawed. Santorum then brought up the then-pending U.S. Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas, which challenged a Texas sodomy law, and said that \\"he did not have a problem with homosexuals, but a problem with homosexual acts\\", \\"the right to privacy doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution\\", and \\"sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts which undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.\\" When Jordan asked \\"Okay, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?\\" Santorum stated: The AP also quoted Santorum as saying, \\"If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything.\\" and \\"Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, whether it's sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.\\" In response to attacks from WorldNetDaily, Jordan made a recording of the interview available. The AP released a transcript it described as \\"an unedited section\\" of the interview on April 23.USA Today: \\"Excerpt from Santorum interview,\\" April 23, 2003, accessed March 4, 2012 Public reaction Santorum's comments evoked responses ranging from George W. Bush's remark, relayed through spokesperson Ari Fleischer, that \\"the President believes that the senator is an inclusive man\\", to sharp criticism from former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean that \\"gay-bashing is not a legitimate public policy discussion; it is immoral\\", to conservative groups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for America who came to Santorum's defense. Dean called on Santorum, \\"to resign from his post as Republican Conference chairman.\\" Other Democratic politicians who responded included Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who remarked that Santorum's comments were \\"out of step with our country's respect for tolerance\\". The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanded that Santorum resign as chairman of the Republican Senate Caucus. Brad Woodhouse of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called the comments, \\"divisive, hurtful and reckless.\\" Santorum faced criticism for his comments from Republican Senators including Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Lincoln Chafee, and Gordon H. Smith. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona stated, \\"I think that he may have been inartful in the way that he described it.\\" Critics of the statement included the Log Cabin Republicans, and the Republican Unity Coalition. LGBT rights groups which condemned the comments by Santorum included the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, OutFront, the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign. The conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America agreed with Santorum's comments in a written statement. The group said Santorum was \\"exactly right\\" and attributed criticism of Santorum to the \\"gay thought police\\". Director of Concerned Women for America's Culture and Family Institute, Robert Knight, criticized those Republicans who spoke out against Santorum, \\"Maybe they ought to think about switching parties. It shows great disloyalty to their party to join the sworn enemies in calling for the head [of Santorum]. They're doing their party a great disservice.\\" Vice President for Communications at the conservative Family Research Council Genevieve Wood supported Santorum's remarks, and commented, \\"I think the Republican party would do well to follow Senator Santorum if they want to see pro-family voters show up on Election Day.\\" Conservative publications released articles supporting Santorum's comments, including National Review with a piece by the philosopher Robert P. George, and Townhall.com in an opinion piece by the political commentator Ben Shapiro. In a follow-up statement released after the Associated Press interview was published, Santorum said some of his remarks were \\"taken out of context\\", and defended his comments in the interview asserting \\"It is simply a reflection of the law.\\" In an interview with Fox News Channel, Santorum said he was not going to apologize for his remarks, \\"I do not need to give an apology based on what I said and what I'm saying now ‚Äì I think this is a legitimate public policy discussion. These are not ridiculous comments. These are very much a very important point.\\" In 2015, during an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, he expressed regret for associating homosexuality with bestiality.http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2015/07/22/watch-rick- santorum-regrets-man-dog-remark-sort Santorum defended his remarks, declaring that his comments were not intended to equate homosexuality with incest and adultery, but rather to challenge the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults, a position he disputes, because he does not believe that there is a general constitutional right to privacy. =Campaign for a \\"santorum\\" neologism = Dan Savage, a widely syndicated columnist who was offended by Santorum's remarks, hosted a contest in his Savage Love column for readers to create a definition for \\"santorum\\". He created a website, spreadingsantorum.com, for the winning definition, \\"The frothy mix of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex\\". This became a top internet search result for santorum in 2003, displacing the Senator's official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing. * \\"Some observers even suggested [the neologism] may have contributed to Santorum‚Äôs crushing 18-point defeat in his 2006 campaign against Bob Casey.\\" In 2011, during his presidential campaign, Santorum requested Google's assistance to end the return of certain search results, but Google said there was nothing it could do. As of 2019, Savage's santorum.com remains the top result of a Google search for \\"santorum\\". 2012 presidential campaign While campaigning in New Hampshire, Santorum engaged college students who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and suggested that allowing it would lead to the legalization of polygamy and other forms of marriage. The exchange resulted in him being booed at the conclusion of the event. At another event, Santorum said that children would be better off having a father in prison than being raised by lesbian parents. On September 22, 2011, during a Republican primary debate in Orlando, Florida, Santorum replied to a question posed by a gay soldier deployed in Iraq who asked the candidates whether, as president, they would take measures to \\"circumvent\\" the repeal of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\".

Geography El Nabatat Island is one of two major islands on the Nile in vicinity of Aswan, the other one being Elephantine. Elephantine is the larger one, and is located between El Nabatat Island and the city of Aswan (east bank). Therefore, it can be hard to see the smaller El Nabatat Island from Aswan: \\"Aswan disappears behind Elephantine Island\\". History The island was previously known as Kitchener's Island, named after Lord Kitchener who owned it. He was gifted the island, when he served as Consul-General in Egypt from 29 September 1911 to June 1914. With the aid of the Ministry of Irrigation, Kitchener rapidly transformed the small long island into a paradise of exotic trees, many from India, and plants in gardens with view walkways. It later passed into the property of the Egyptian government and was used as a research station called the Botanical Research Institute, Asw√¢n Botanic Island. Aswan Botanical Garden The island, as a whole, constitutes the Aswan Botanical Garden. One can view the many types of subtropical, exotic, and rare plantings and trees such as the Royal Palm tree and the Sabal Palm tree. The collection was begun by Lord Kitchener and cared for since. The gardens are popular among the local people and tourists, as a place to go for a quiet afternoon away from the noise of the city, and for weekend picnics.

It is also called The Haight and The Upper Haight. The neighborhood is known as the birthplace of the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. Location The district generally encompasses the neighborhood surrounding Haight Street, bounded by Stanyan Street and Golden Gate Park on the west, Oak Street and the Golden Gate Park Panhandle on the north, Baker Street and Buena Vista Park to the east and Frederick Street and Ashbury Heights and Cole Valley neighborhoods to the south. The street names commemorate two early San Francisco leaders: pioneer and exchange banker Henry Haight, and Munroe Ashbury, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1864-70. Both Haight and his nephew, as well as Ashbury, had a hand in the planning of the neighborhood and, more importantly, nearby Golden Gate Park at its inception. The name \\"Upper Haight\\", used by locals, is in contrast to the Haight-Fillmore or Lower Haight district, the latter being lower in elevation and part of what was previously the principal African- American and Japanese neighborhoods in San Francisco's early years. The Haight-Ashbury district is noted for its role as a center of the 1960s hippie movement. The earlier bohemians of the beat movement had congregated around San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood from the late 1950s. Many who could not find accommodation there turned to the quaint, relatively cheap and underpopulated Haight-Ashbury. The Summer of Love (1967), the 1960s era as a whole, and much of modern American counterculture have been synonymous with San Francisco and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood ever since. History =Farms, entertainment, and homes= Before the completion of the Haight Street Cable Railroad in 1883, what is now the Haight-Ashbury was a collection of isolated farms and acres of sand dunes. The Haight cable car line, completed in 1883, connected the east end of Golden Gate Park with the geographically central Market Street line and the rest of downtown San Francisco. As the primary gateway to Golden Gate Park, and with an amusement park known as the Chutes on Haight Street between Cole and Clayton Streets between 1895 and 1902 and the California League Baseball Grounds stadium opening in 1887, the area became a popular entertainment destination, especially on weekends. The cable car, land grading and building techniques of the 1890s and early 20th century later reinvented the Haight-Ashbury as a residential upper middle class homeowners' district. It was one of the few neighborhoods spared from the fires that followed the catastrophic San Francisco earthquake of 1906. =Depression and war= The Haight was hit hard by the Depression, as was much of the city. Residents with enough money to spare left the declining and crowded neighborhood for greener pastures within the growing city limits, or newer, smaller suburban homes in the Bay Area. During the housing shortage of World War II, large single-family Victorians were divided into apartments to house workers. Others were converted into boarding homes for profit. By the 1950s, the Haight was a neighborhood in decline. Many buildings were left vacant after the war. Deferred maintenance also took its toll, and the exodus of middle class residents to newer suburbs continued to leave many units for rent. =Postwar= In the 1950s, a freeway was proposed that would have run through the Panhandle, but due to a citizen freeway revolt, it was cancelled in a series of battles that lasted until 1966. The Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council (HANC) was formed at the time of the 1959 revolt. The Haight-Ashbury's elaborately detailed, 19th century, multi-story, wooden houses became a haven for hippies during the 1960s,San Francisco Landmark Number 253 due to the availability of cheap rooms and vacant properties for rent or sale in the district; property values had dropped in part because of the proposed freeway. The bohemian subculture that subsequently flourished there took root, and to a great extent, has remained to this day. =Hippie community= The mainstream media's coverage of hippie life in the Haight-Ashbury drew the attention of youth from all over America. Hunter S. Thompson labeled the district \\"Hashbury\\" in The New York Times Magazine, and the activities in the area were reported almost daily.T. Anderson, The Movement and the Sixties: Protest in America from Greensboro to Wounded Knee, (Oxford University Press, 1995), p.174 The Haight-Ashbury district was sought out by hippies to constitute a community based upon counterculture ideals, drugs, and music. This neighborhood offered a concentrated gathering spot for hippies to create a social experiment that would soon spread throughout the nation.Ashbolt, Anthony. \\"'Go Ask Alice': Remembering the Summer of Love Forty Years On\\". JSTOR. JSTOR, n.d. Web. 2 Mar. 2014. The first ever head shop, Ron and Jay Thelin's Psychedelic Shop, opened on Haight Street on January 3, 1966, offering hippies a spot to purchase marijuana and LSD, which was essential to hippie life in Haight- Ashbury.Tamony, Peter. \\"Tripping out in San Francisco\\". American Speech. 2nd ed. Vol. 56. N.p.: Duke UP, n.d. 98-103. JSTOR. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. Along with businesses like the coffee shop The Blue Unicorn, the Psychedelic Shop quickly became one of the unofficial community centers for the growing numbers of freaks, heads, and hippies migrating to the neighborhood in 1966-67. The entire hippie community had easy access to drugs, which was perceived as a community unifier.Ashbolt, Anthony. \\"From Haight-Ashbury to Soulful Socialism: Culture and Politics in the Movement\\". Australasian Journal of American Studies. 3rd ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: Australia and New Zealand American Studies Association, n.d. 28-38. JSTOR. Web. 13 Mar. 2014. Another well-known neighborhood presence was the Diggers, a local \\"community anarchist\\" group known for its street theater, formed in the mid to late 1960s. One well known member of the group was Peter Coyote. The Diggers believed in a free society and the good in human nature. To express their belief, they established a free store, gave out free meals daily, and built a free medical clinic, which was the first of its kind, all of which relied on volunteers and donations. The Diggers were strongly opposed to a capitalistic society; they felt that by eliminating the need for money, people would be free to examine their own personal values, which would provoke people to change the way they lived to better suit their character, and thus lead a happier life. During the 1967 Summer of Love, psychedelic rock music was entering the mainstream, receiving more and more commercial radio airplay. The Scott McKenzie song \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair),\\" became a hit that year. The Monterey Pop Festival in June further cemented the status of psychedelic music as a part of mainstream culture and elevated local Haight bands such as the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Jefferson Airplane to national stardom. A July 7, 1967, Time magazine cover story on \\"The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture,\\" an August CBS News television report on \\"The Hippie Temptation\\" and other major media interest in the hippie subculture exposed the Haight-Ashbury district to enormous national attention and popularized the counterculture movement across the country and around the world. The neighborhood's fame reached its peak as it became the haven for a number of psychedelic rock performers and groups of the time. The members of Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Janis Joplin, all lived close to the intersection. They not only immortalized the scene in song, but also knew many within the community. The Summer of Love attracted a wide range of people of various ages: teenagers and college students drawn by their peers and the allure of joining a cultural utopia; middle-class vacationers; and even partying military personnel from bases within driving distance. The Haight- Ashbury could not accommodate this rapid influx of people, and the neighborhood scene quickly deteriorated. Overcrowding, homelessness, hunger, drug problems, and crime afflicted the neighborhood. Many people left in the autumn to resume their college studies. On October 6, 1967, those remaining in the Haight staged a mock funeral, Digger happening, \\"The Death of the Hippie\\" ceremony.. Mary Kasper explained the message of the mock funeral as: =Recent history= After 1968, the area went into decline due to hard drug use, and a lack of policing, but was improved and renewed in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, the Haight became an epicenter for the San Francisco comedy scene when a small coffee house off Haight Street called The Other Caf√© at 100 Carl Street (currently the restaurant Crepes on Cole) became a full-time comedy club that helped launch the careers of Robin Williams, Dana Carvey, and Whoopi Goldberg. Attractions and characteristics Storefronts on Haight Street The Red Victorian hotel is a popular attraction. An independent theater of the same name operated about a block away from the hotel from 1980 to 2011. The Tubes performing at 2012 Haight-Ashbury Street Fair. The Haight-Ashbury Street Fair is held on the second Sunday of June each year attracting thousands of people, during which Haight Street is closed between Stanyan and Masonic to vehicular traffic, with one sound stage at each end.

It is crossed by over 200 bridges, 27 tunnels, six public ferries, one cable car link, and one ford along its course. Barrier and boundary Until sufficient crossings were established, the river provided a formidable barrier for most of its course - in post-Roman Britain during the Dark Ages Belgic-Celtic tribal lands and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and subdivisions were defined by which side of the river they were on. When English counties were established, the river formed a boundary between the counties on either side. After rising in Gloucestershire, the river flows between, on the north bank, the historic counties of Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Middlesex and Essex; and on the south bank, the counties of Wiltshire, Berkshire, Surrey, and Kent. However the many permanent crossings that have been built over the centuries have changed the dynamics and made cross-river development and shared responsibilities more practicable. In 1911 Caversham, on the north bank, was transferred into Berkshire. In 1965, with the creation of Greater London, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames united areas formerly in Middlesex and Surrey; and at the same time two urban districts in Middlesex (united in 1974) became part of Surrey. Further changes in 1974 moved some of the boundaries away from the river. For example, much of the north west of Berkshire including Wallingford, Abingdon and Wantage became part of Oxfordshire, and some southern parts of Buckinghamshire became part of Berkshire, including Slough, Eton and Wraysbury. The number of county councils has dwindled (as well as their area) in south-east and central southern England in favour of increased localisation. Despite these changes, in the sports of rowing and skiffing the river banks are still referred to by their traditional county names, and in sports such as football and cricket historic county areas are sometimes used. History of crossings Wallingford Bridge (Oxfordshire) Many of the present road bridges over the river are on the sites of earlier fords, ferries and wooden structures. The earliest known major crossings of the Thames by the Romans were at London Bridge and Staines Bridge. At Folly Bridge in Oxford the remains of an original Saxon structure can be seen, and medieval stone structures such as Wallingford Bridge, Newbridge and Abingdon Bridge are still in use. Kingston's growth is believed to stem from its having the only crossing between London Bridge and Staines until the beginning of the 18th century. Proposals to build bridges across the Thames at Lambeth and Putney in around 1670 were defeated by the Rulers of the Company of Watermen, since it would mean ruin for the 60,000 rivermen who provided ferry services and also provided a pool of naval reserve.An engraving by Claes Van Visscher showing Old London Bridge in 1616 During the 18th century, many stone and brick road bridges were built ‚Äì from new or to replace existing structures ‚Äì in London and further up the river. These included Westminster Bridge, Putney Bridge, Datchet Bridge, Windsor Bridge and Sonning Bridge. Several central London road bridges were built in the 19th century, most conspicuously Tower Bridge, the only bascule bridge on the river, designed to allow ocean-going ships to pass beneath it. The most recent road bridge sites are the bypasses at Isis Bridge and Marlow By-pass Bridge and the motorway bridges, most notably the two on the M25: Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and M25 Runnymede Bridge. The development of the railways resulted in a spate of bridge building in the 19th century, including Blackfriars Railway Bridge and Charing Cross (Hungerford) Railway Bridge in central London, and the spectacular railway bridges by Isambard Kingdom Brunel at Maidenhead, Gatehampton and Moulsford. The world's first underwater tunnel was the Thames Tunnel by Marc Brunel built in 1843, designed for horse-drawn carriages but used as a pedestrian route; since 1869 the tunnel has carried trains on the East London Line. The Tower Subway (1870) was briefly used for a railway; later came all the deep-level tube lines. Two road tunnels were built in East London at the end of the 19th century, the Blackwall Tunnel and the Rotherhithe Tunnel; and the latest tunnel is the Dartford Crossing. Many foot crossings were established across the weirs that were built on the non-tidal river, and some of these remained when the locks were built ‚Äì for example at Benson Lock. Others were replaced by a footbridge when the weir was removed, as at Hart's Weir Footbridge. Around the year 2000, several footbridges were added, either as part of the Thames Path or in commemoration of the Millennium. These include Temple Footbridge, Bloomers Hole Footbridge, the Hungerford Footbridges and the Millennium Bridge, all of which have distinctive designs. Some ferries still operate on the river. The Woolwich Ferry carries cars and passengers across the river in the Thames Gateway and links the North Circular and South Circular roads. Upstream are smaller pedestrian ferries, for example Hampton Ferry and the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry; the latter is the only non-permanent crossing that remains on the Thames Path. Note on the listing The list starts at the downstream (estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the source. A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings using walkways across lock gates and bridges above or adjacent to the adjoining weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not completely cross the river, or are restricted to authorised personnel only, and are therefore not listed. Crossings listed in italics are inaccessible to the public. Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services operating along the river in London, and tourist boat services operating both in London and upstream. Whilst the principal purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so.

The \\"common sewer\\" is now marked by Curtain Road, and the \\"ditch from the horse-pond\\" by New Inn Yard Enlarge The Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse in Shoreditch (in Curtain Road, part of the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. It was the first permanent theatre ever built in England. It was built in 1576 after the Red Lion, and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager James Burbage, near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the Lord Chamberlain's Men, which employed Shakespeare as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the Globe Theatre on Bankside. History The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink, and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey. The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one John Brayne, (the owner of the Red Lion) on property that had originally been the grounds of the dissolved Halliwell Priory (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575). The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the theatre. This area in the \\"suburbs of sin\\" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the Curtain Theatre was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district.Mullaney, 1988. \\"When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in- law over a different mortgage\\" Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.Berry, Herbert. English Professional Theatre, 1530‚Äì1660. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Throughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.Mateer, David. \\"New Light on the Early History of the Theatre in Shoreditch [With Texts].\\" English Literary Renaissance 36.3 (2006): 335‚Äì375. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013. Although Burbage's son later claimed the Theatre as the first permanent playhouse in the London conurbation, it may not have been the first permanent theatre to serve Londoners. The Newington Butts Theatre may have been built as early as 1575, certainly actor Jerome Savage renewed a lease on the site on 25 March 1576, three weeks before Burbage's lease in Shoreditch. Newington Butts was clearly established by Lady Day 1577,Ingram (1992) p170 and Wickham et al. interpret the available documents as saying that Savage was adapting an existing building constructed by Richard Hicks rather than building from scratch.Wickham et al (2000) p321 The design of The Theatre was possibly adapted from the inn-yards that had served as playing spaces for actors and/or bear baiting pits. The building was a polygonal wooden building with three galleries surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a thrust stage. The Theatre is said to have cost ¬£700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.Egan, 2005. The open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a penny. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron. Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre's appearance, but it has been described as an \\"amphitheater\\". The Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for Leicester's Men, the acting company of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the Admiral's Men, of which James Burbage's son, Richard was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the Rose Theatre which was under the management of Philip Henslowe. In 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the Lord Chamberlain's Men which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his early plays had their premi√®re at The Theatre. \\"At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces.\\" Richard's most noted role is‚Äîwhich holds close to his namesake ‚Äî his part as Richard in Shakespeare's Richard III. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse. Towards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby Curtain. The lease had been granted to Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen \\"stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert.\\" The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day: Brayne's widow, Margaret Brayne, and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it‚Äîin disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. \\"The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe.\\" Capp, Bernard. \\"The Burbages At Law (Again).\\" Notes & Queries 47.4 (2000): 433. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013. At the time of Margaret Brayne's death there were still lawsuits that had not been settled, and in her last will and testament she left all of her prospective winnings to Robert Myles. Though Giles Allen was the landlord John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for the sum of ¬£30. Cuthbert then went to Walter Cope, a trusted business man, and had Cope ask Hyde if Cuthbert could outright pay for the lease and own it himself. Cuthbert paid and outright owned the lease now, ultimately squeezing Margaret Brayne out of the business. They justified this by stating that now that the lease was in Cuthbert's name and no longer in James‚Äô name John Brayne had no dealings with the Theatre and therefore neither did Margaret Brayne. This state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter Peter Street and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street's yard near to Bridewell. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe..Schoenbaum 1987: 206‚Äì209 Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies. He also attempted to sue Cuthbert and Richard Burbage for trespassing. =Archaeological investigation= In August 2008 archaeologists from the Museum of London excavating in New Inn Broadway, Shoreditch, announced they had found the foundation of a polygonal structure they believed to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of The Theatre. The Theatre and Shakespeare's involvement with it are commemorated by two plaques on 86‚Äì90 Curtain Road, the building at the corner with New Inn Yard currently occupied by a Foxtons office.

Bulgarian-French structuralist literary critic Tzvetan Todorov originated the concept, characterizing the fantastic as the hesitation of characters and readers when presented with questions about reality.  Definition  The fantastic is present in works where the reader experiences hesitation about whether a work presents what Todorov calls \\"the uncanny\\", wherein superficially supernatural phenomena turn out to have a rational explanation (such as in the Gothic works of Ann Radcliffe) or \\"the marvelous\\", where the supernatural is confirmed by the story. Todorov breaks down the fantastic into a manner of systems, filled with conditions and properties that make it easier to understand. The fantastic requires the fulfillment of three conditions. First, the text must oblige the reader to consider the world of the characters as a world of living persons and to hesitate between a natural or supernatural explanation of the events described. Second, this hesitation may also be experienced by a character; thus the reader's role is so to speak entrusted to a character, and at the same time the hesitation is represented, it becomes one of the themes of the work‚Äîin the case of naive reading, the actual reader identifies himself with the character. Third, the reader must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text: he will reject allegorical as well as \\"poetic\\" interpretations. The fantastic also explores three conditions; reader‚Äôs hesitation, hesitation may be felt by another character, and the reader must have a certain mindset when reading the text. There is also a system to the fantastic that he explores that uses three properties. The utterance which discusses the use of figurative discourse, how everything figurative is taken in a literal sense. The supernatural begins to exist within the fantastic due to exaggeration, figurative expression being taken literal, and how the supernatural originates from the rhetorical figure. Leading into the second property, the act of uttering. In this property, it is most connected to the narrator of the story and the idea (discourse-wise) is that the narrator/character must pass this \\"test of truth\\". The narrator is someone who cannot \\"lie\\"; they explain the supernatural (marvelous), but doubt in what they say creates the fantastic. The final property is the syntactic aspect. Penzoldt‚Äôs theory (see below) is what focuses on this property the most.Todorov, Tzvetan, The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre, trans. by Richard Howard (Cleveland: Case Western Reserve University Press, 1973), p. 33 The fantastic can also represent dreams and wakefulness where the character or reader hesitates as to what is reality or what is a dream. Again the fantastic is found in this hesitation‚Äîonce it is decided the Fantastic ends.Manguel, Alberto, Blackwater: the book of Fantastic literature Picador, London, 1984 introduction. An example of fantastic being used is \\"Alastair Ashcroft is a fantastic person\\" Rosemary Jackson builds onto and challenges Todorov's definition of the fantastic in her 1981 nonfiction book Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion. Jackson rejects the notion of the fantastic genre as a simple vessel for wish fulfillment that \\"transcend[s]\\" (Jackson, 2) human reality in worlds presented as superior to our own, instead positing that the genre is inseparable from real life, particularly the social and cultural contexts within which each work of the fantastic is produced. She writes that the \\"unreal\\" (4) elements of fantastic literature are created only in direct contrast to the boundaries set by its time period‚Äôs \\"cultural order\\" (3), acting to illuminate the unseen limitations of said boundaries by undoing and recompiling the very structures which define society into something \\"strange\\" and \\"apparently new\\" (8). In subverting these societal norms, Jackson claims, the fantastic represents the unspoken desire for greater societal change. Jackson criticizes Todorov's theory as being too limited in scope, examining only the literary function of the fantastic, and expands his structuralist theory to fit a more cultural study of the genre‚Äîwhich, incidentally, she proposes is not a genre at all, but a mode that draws upon literary elements of both realistic and supernatural fiction to create the air of uncertainty in its narratives as described by Todorov. Jackson also introduces the idea of reading the fantastic through a psychoanalytical lens, referring primarily to Freud‚Äôs theory of the unconscious, which she believes is integral to understanding the fantastic‚Äôs connection to the human psyche.Jackson, Rosemary, \\"Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion\\", Methuen & Co. Ltd., 1981, introduction (pp. 2‚Äì10) There are however additional ways to view the fantastic, and often these differing perspectives come from differing social climates. In their introduction to The Female Fantastic: Gender and the Supernatural in the 1890s and 1920s, Lizzie Harris McCormick, Jennifer Mitchell, and Rebecca Soares describe how the social climate in the 1890s and 1920s allowed for a new era of \\"fantastic\\" literature to grow. Women were finally exploring the new freedoms given to them and were quickly becoming equals in society. The fear of the new women in society, paired with their growing roles, allowed them to create a new style of \\"fuzzy\\" supernatural texts. The fantastic is on the dividing line between supernatural and not supernatural, Just as during this time period the women were not respecting the boundary of inequality that had always been set for them. At the time, women's roles in society were very uncertain, just as the rules of the fantastic are never straight forward. This climate allowed for a genre similar to the social structure to emerge. The Fantastic is never purely supernatural, nor can the supernatural be ruled out. Just as women were not equal yet, but they were not completely oppressed. The Female Fantastic seeks to enforce this idea that nothing is certain in the fantastic nor the gender roles of the 1920s. Many women in this time period began to blur the lines between the genders, removing the binary out of gender and allowing for many interpretations. For the first time, women started to possess more masculine or queer qualities without it becoming as much of an issue. The fantastic during this time period reflects these new ideas by breaking parallel boundaries in the supernatural. The fantastic breaks this boundary by having the readers never truly know whether or not the story is supernatural.*McCormick, Lizzie Harris, Jennifer Mitchell, and Rebecca Soares, The Female Fantastic: Gender and the Supernatural in the 1890s and 1920s (Routledge, 2019)  Related genres  There is no truly typical \\"fantastic story\\", as the term generally encompasses both works of the horror and gothic genres. Two representative stories might be: * Algernon Blackwood's story \\"The Willows\\", where two men traveling down the Danube River are beset by an eerie feeling of malice and several improbable setbacks in their trip; the question that pervades the story is whether they are falling prey to the wilderness and their own imaginations, or if there really is something horrific out to get them. *Edgar Allan Poe's story \\"The Black Cat\\", where a murderer is haunted by a black cat; but is it revenge from beyond the grave, or just a cat? There is no clear distinction between the fantastic and magic realism as neither privilege either realistic or supernatural elements. The former, in its hesitation between supernatural and realistic explanations of events, may task the reader with questioning the nature of reality and this may serve to distinguish the Fantastic from Magical Realism (in which magical elements are understood to constitute in part the reality of the protagonists and are not themselves questionable). The fantastic is sometimes erroneously called the Grotesque or Supernatural fiction, because both the Grotesque and the Supernatural contain fantastic elements, yet they are not the same, as the fantastic is based on an ambiguity of those elements. In Russian literature, the \\"fantastic\\" (—Ñ–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞) encompasses science fiction (called \\"science fantastic\\", –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–∞—è —Ñ–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞), fantasy, and other non-realistic genres.

It is replaced further east by its relative, the bimaculated lark. Taxonomy and systematics The calandra lark was originally placed in the genus Alauda. The current genus name, Melanocorypha is from Ancient Greek melas, \\"black\\", and koruphos a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with korudos, \\"lark\\". \\"Calandra\\"' derives ultimately from kalandros the Ancient Greek name for this bird. The bimaculated lark is also sometimes termed as the calandra lark. = Subspecies = Four subspecies are recognized: * Western calandra lark (M. c. calandra) - (Linnaeus, 1766): Found in southern Europe and north-western Africa to Turkey (except south- central and south-eastern Turkey), Transcaucasia and north-western Iran * Eastern calandra lark (M. c. psammochroa) - Hartert, 1904: Found from northern Iraq and northern Iran to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan * M. c. gaza - Meinertzhagen, R, 1919: Originally described as a subspecies of the bimaculated lark. Found from eastern Syria and south-eastern Turkey to south- western Iran * Levant calandra lark (M. c. hebraica) - Meinertzhagen, R, 1920: Found from south-central Turkey and north-western Syria to Israel and western Jordan Description This is a large, robust lark, 17.5‚Äì20 cm long. It is an undistinguished-looking species on the ground, mainly streaked greyish brown above and white below, and with large black patches on the breast sides. It has a white supercilium. In flight it shows short broad wings, which are dark below, and a short white-edged tail. The wing and tail patterns are distinctions from its more easterly relatives. The song is like a slower version of that of the skylark. Distribution and habitat It is mainly resident in the west of its range, but Russian populations of this passerine bird are more migratory, moving further south in winter, as far as the Arabian peninsula and Egypt. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. This is a bird of open cultivation and steppe. Its nest is on the ground, with 4‚Äì5 eggs being laid. Food is seeds supplemented with insects in the breeding season. It is gregarious outside the breeding season. Behaviour and ecology This species occupies open plains, from steppes and pastures to extensive dry cereal cultivations and true steppe with dense grass cover. In the Mediterranean Basin it is mainly found in dry pastures and dry cultivations. In cultivated areas, it prefers fallows, long-fallows and field edges and to a lesser extent sown fields, selecting unirrigated legumes and barley fields. The species is monogamous and lays eggs from early April to July. The nest is made from grass stems and small leaves, lined with softer material and built in a shallow depression on the ground, often under a tussock. Clutches are usually three to six eggs (de Juana and Su√°rez 2004). Its diet is seasonal, feeding mostly on insects in the summers and seeds and grass shoots in the winter. Mediterranean populations are resident, forming large flocks in the autumn and winter (Snow and Perrins 1998, de Juana and Su√°rez 2004). Eastern populations are migratory or partially migratory (de Juana and Su√°rez 2004).https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22717285/87485192 Parasites of the calandra lark include the chewing louse Ricinus vaderi, described from specimens collected in Azerbaijan. In culture The song is considered so musical to human ears that the calandra lark was formerly a popular cagebird in its range. It is mentioned in, for instance, the Tuscan proverb \\"Canta come una calandra\\", he or she sings like a lark, and the Spanish ballad \\"Romance del prisionero\\", where its song is the only way the prisoner knows when day breaks.

It was built between 1899 and 1902 as part of Lord Kitchener's wide-ranging educational reforms. Named for General 'Chinese' Charles George Gordon of the British army, who was killed during the Mahdi uprising in 1885, it was officially opened on 8 November 1902 by Kitchener himself. The first students which entered the school in 1903 were primary school students. In 1905 secondary education courses for assistant engineers and land surveyors were added and in 1906 a four-year course for training primary school teachers was started.Historical Background University of Khartoum, Retrieved 21 August 2012 By 1913 there were about 500 students in the college. In 1924 the college commenced Sharia, Engineering, Teachers' Training, Clerical Work, Accounting and Science vocational courses. Post-secondary education courses in Science, Arts, Engineering, Veterinary Science and Law were started in 1938. There were strong links between courses and Sudan government departments where it was anticipated students would work after graduation. At the beginning of 1945, all these schools were grouped together in a special arrangement with the University of London and secondary education was moved elsewhere. In 1948 there were 262 students at the college. In 1951, the Gordon Memorial College was merged with the Kitchener School of Medicine (founded in 1924) and renamed University College Khartoum with the University of London setting the examinations and awarding the degrees. In 1956, the University College became the fully independent University of Khartoum. The University of Khartoum claims to be the oldest University in Sudan based on the founding of the Gordon Memorial College in 1902.Akec, John A.

On August 6, 1777, a party of Loyalists and several hundred Indigenous allies across several nations ambushed an American military party that was marching to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix. This was one of the few battles in which the majority of the participants were Americans; Patriots and allied Oneidas fought against Loyalists and allied Iroquois in the absence of British regular soldiers. There was also a detachment of Hessians in the British force, as well as Western Indians including members of the Mississauga people. The Patriot relief force came up the Mohawk Valley under the command of General Nicholas Herkimer and numbered about 800 men of the Tryon County militia plus a party of approximately 60 Oneida warriors. British commander Barry St. Leger authorized an intercepting force consisting of a Hanau J√§ger (light infantry) detachment, Sir John Johnson's King's Royal Regiment of New York, Indian allies from the Six Nations, particularly Mohawks and Senecas and other tribes to the north and west, and Indian Department Rangers, totaling at least 450 men. The Loyalist and Indigenous force ambushed Herkimer's force in a small valley about six miles (10 km) east of Fort Stanwix, near the Oneida village of Oriskany, New York. Herkimer was mortally wounded, and the battle cost the Patriots approximately 451 casualties, while the Loyalists and Indians lost approximately 150 dead and wounded. The result of the battle remains ambiguous. The apparent Loyalist victory was significantly affected by a sortie from Fort Stanwix in which the Loyalist camps were sacked, damaging morale among the Indigenous allies. The battle also marked the beginning of a war among the Iroquois, as Oneida warriors under Colonel Louis and Han Yerry allied with the American cause. Most of the other Iroquois tribes allied with the British, especially the Mohawks and Senecas. Each tribe was highly decentralized, and there were internal divisions among bands of the Oneida, some of whom also migrated to Canada as allies of the British. The site is known in Iroquois oral histories as \\"A Place of Great Sadness.\\"Bilharz (2009), p. 93. The site has been designated a National Historic Landmark; it is marked by a battle monument at the Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site.  Background  In June 1777, the British Army, under the command of General \\"Gentleman Johnny\\" Burgoyne, launched a two-pronged attack from Quebec. Burgoyne's objective was to split New England from the other colonies by gaining control of New York's Hudson Valley. The main thrust came south across Lake Champlain under Burgoyne's command; the second thrust was led by Lt. Colonel Barry St. Leger and was intended to come down the Mohawk Valley and meet Burgoyne's army near Albany.Ketchum (1997), p. 84 St. Leger's expedition consisted of about 1,800 men who were a mix of British regulars, Hessian J√§gers from Hanau, Loyalists, Rangers, and Indians of several tribes, including the Mohawk and Seneca of the Iroquois. They traveled up the Saint Lawrence River and along the shore of Lake Ontario to the Oswego River, which they ascended to reach the Oneida Carry in Rome, New York. They began to besiege Fort Stanwix, a Continental Army post guarding the portage.Nickerson (1967), pp. 195‚Äì199 Prelude Tryon County's Committee of Safety head Nicholas Herkimer was warned of a possible British attack along the Mohawk River, and he issued a proclamation on July 17 warning of possible military activity and urging the people to respond if needed.Glatthaar (2006), pp. 159‚Äì160 Oneida allies warned him on July 30 that the British were just four days from Fort Stanwix, and he put out a call-to-arms. The force raised totaled 800 from the Tryon County militia composed primarily of poorly trained farmers who were chiefly of Palatine German descent. They set out on August 4 and camped near the Oneida village of Oriska on August 5. A number of the militia dropped out of the column due to their lack of conditioning, but Herkimer's forces were augmented by a company of 60 to 100 Oneida warriors led by Han Yerry, a strong supporter of the Patriot cause.Glatthaar (2006), p. 160 That evening, Herkimer sent three men toward the fort with messages for the fort's commander Colonel Peter Gansevoort. Gansevoort was to signal the receipt of the message with three cannon shots and then sortie to meet the approaching column. The couriers, however, had difficulty getting through British lines, and they did not deliver the message until late the next morning, after the battle was already underway.Glatthaar (2006), p. 161 Bloody Creek, New York St. Leger learned on August 5 that Herkimer and his relief expedition were on their way from a messenger that Molly Brant had sent to her brother Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who led a portion of St. Leger's \\"Indian\\" contingent.Glatthaar (2006), p. 163 St. Leger sent a detachment of light infantry from Sir John Johnson's Royal Yorkers toward the position that evening to monitor Herkimer's position, and Brant followed early the next morning with about 400 Indians and Butler's Rangers. Many of the Indigenous allies were armed with muskets, while others carried only tomahawks and spears.Glatthaar (2006), p. 164 Battle Herkimer held a war council on the morning of August 6. He wanted to wait because he had not heard the expected signal from the fort, but his captains pressed him to continue, accusing him of being a Tory because his brother was serving under St. Leger.Nickerson (1967), p. 202 He was stung by the accusations and relented, ordering the column to march on toward Stanwix.Nickerson (1967), p. 203 About six miles (9.6 km) from the fort, the road dipped more than 50 feet (15 m) into a marshy ravine with a stream at the bottom that was about three feet wide. Seneca chiefs Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter chose this place to set up an ambush;Watt (2002), p. 135 the King's Royal Yorkers waited behind a nearby rise and the Indigenous allies concealed themselves on both sides of the ravine. The plan was for the Yorkers to stop the head of the column, after which the Indigenous troops would attack the extended column.Nickerson (1967), p. 205 At about 10 am, Herkimer's column descended into the ravine, crossed the stream, and began ascending the other side with Herkimer on horseback near the front. Monument marking the location of the tree to which Herkimer was taken Contrary to the plan, the Indigenous troops lying in wait opened fire on the rear of the column and taking the column completely by surprise. Colonel Ebenezer Cox was leading the 1st Regiment (Canajoharie district), and he was shot off his horse and killed in the first volley. Herkimer turned his horse to see the action and was struck by a ball that shattered his leg and killed the horse.Glatthaar (2006), p. 166 Several of his officers carried him to a beech tree and urged him to retire from further danger. He defiantly replied, \\"I will face the enemy\\", and calmly sat leaning against the tree smoking a pipe and giving directions and words of encouragement to the men nearby.Nickerson (1967), p. 207 The trap had been sprung too early and portions of the column had not yet entered the ravine. Most of these men panicked and fled; some of the Indigenous fighters pursued them, resulting in a string of dead and wounded that extended for several miles.Nickerson (1967), p. 206 Between the loss of the column rear and those killed or wounded in the initial volleys, only about one half of Herkimer's men were likely still fighting 30 minutes into the battle. Some of the attackers who were not armed with muskets waited for the flash of an opponent's musket fire before rushing to attack with the tomahawk.Nickerson (1967), p. 208 Mohawk Chief Louis Atayataronghta was fighting with Herkimer's men, and he shot one of the enemies whose fire had been devastatingly accurate, noting that \\"every time he rises up he kills one of our men\\".Glatthaar (2006), p. 167 Herkimer's men eventually rallied, fighting their way out of the ravine to the crest just to its west. John Johnson was concerned about the militia's tenacity, so he returned to the British camp and requested some reinforcements from St. Leger, returning with 70 men.Watt (2002), p. 174 A thunderstorm caused a one-hour break in the fighting, during which Herkimer regrouped his militia on the higher ground. He instructed his men to fight in pairs; while one man fired and reloaded, the other waited and then only fired if attacked. They were to keep at least one weapon loaded at all times to reduce the effectiveness of the tomahawk attacks. Ranger John Butler took time during the thunderstorm to question some of the captives, and thus learned about the three-cannon signal. Johnson and his reinforcements arrived, and Butler convinced them to turn their coats inside out to disguise themselves as a relief party coming from the fort.Watt (2002), pp. 179‚Äì180 When the fighting restarted, Johnson and the rest of his Royal Yorkers joined the battle, but Patriot Captain Jacob Gardinier recognized the face of a Loyalist neighbor. Close combat continued for some time, often hand-to-hand between men who were neighbors.Glatthaar (2006), p. 168 Lt. Col. Marinus Willett, a 1791 portrait by Ralph Earl =Sortie from Fort Stanwix= Herkimer's messengers reached the fort at around 11 a.m., and Colonel Gansevoort organized the requested sortie. Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett led 250 men from the fort and raided the nearly deserted enemy camps to the south, driving away the few British and Indians left in them (including women) and taking four prisoners along the way.Glatthaar (2006), p. 171 They stole blankets and other personal possessions from the Indigenous camps, and they also raided John Johnson's camp, taking his letters and other writings (including an intercepted letter to Gansevoort from his fianc√©e).Nickerson (1967), p. 210Watt (2002), p. 196 One of the Indigenous allies guarding the camps ran to the battlefield to alert fellow warriors that their camps were being raided.Watt (2002), p. 185 They disengaged with cries of \\"Oonah, oonah!\\", the Seneca signal to retire, and headed for the camps to protect their women and possessions. This forced the smaller number of German and Loyalist combatants to also withdraw. Aftermath =Patriots= Herkimer was seriously wounded and many of his captains were killed, and the battered remnant retreated to Fort Dayton. His men carried him from the battlefield and his leg was amputated, but the operation went poorly and he died on August 16.Glatthaar (2006), p. 169 The Indigenous fighters who died on the battlefield were retrieved by the following day, but many dead and wounded Patriots were left on the field. Benedict Arnold's relief column marched through several weeks later, and the men were moved by the stench and grisly scene.Watt (2002), p. 263 Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant, 1776 portrait by George Romney General Philip Schuyler learned of the retreat from Oriskany and immediately organized additional relief to be sent to the area. Arnold's relief column arrived at Fort Stanwix on August 21, and he sent messengers into the British camp who convinced the British and Indian besiegers that his force was much larger than it actually was.Glatthaar (2006), pp. 174‚Äì5 They abandoned their siege and withdrew. =Loyalists= Loyalist John Butler was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel for his role in the battle, and he was authorized to raise a regiment that became known as Butler's Rangers.Bowler (2000) After the siege was lifted, some Loyalists returned to Quebec while others joined Burgoyne's campaign on the Hudson, including numerous warriors from various tribes.Watt (2002), p. 269 =Indians= Brant and Seneca chief Sayenqueraghta proposed the next day to continue the fighting by pursuing the Patriots downriver toward German Flatts, New York, but St. Leger turned them down.Kelsay (1984), p. 208 This battle marked the beginning of a war among the tribes in the Iroquois Confederacy, as it was the first time that they had fought against one other. The Mohawks, Senecas, Cayugas, and Onondagas were allied with the British, as were some Oneidas, and the Iroquois in St. Leger's camp met in council and decided to send the Patriot-allied Oneidas a bloody hatchet. Brant's Mohawks raided and burned the Oneida settlement of Oriska later in the siege. In retaliation, the Oneidas plundered the Mohawk strongholds of Tiononderoge and Canajoharie. They later raided the Fort Hunter Mohawks, prompting most of the remaining Mohawks in central New York to flee to Quebec.Glatthaar (2006), p. 177 Some people think that Brant's Indigenous allies tortured and ate some of their prisoners,Stone (1865)], pp. 459‚Äì460 but modern historians debate this. It is likely that some of the prisoners were ritually killed (as that is what often happens in time battle), but there does not appear to be any evidence of cannibalism. =Winners and losers= The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war, based on the percentage of casualties suffered.Canfield (1909), p. 57 About half of Herkimer's force were killed or wounded, as were about 15-percent of the British force. St. Leger claimed the battle as a victory, as he had stopped the American relief column, but the Americans maintained control of the battlefield after the withdrawal of the opposing Indians. The British victory was tempered by the discontentment of the Indians after the battle. When they joined the expedition, they expected that the British forces would do most of the fighting, but they were the dominant fighters in this action, and some suffered the loss of their personal belongings taken during the American sortie from the fort. This blow to their morale contributed to the eventual failure of St. Leger's expedition.Nickerson (1967), p. 211 Legacy Monument to the unknown Tryon County patriots Blacksnake, a war chief of the Shawnee nation, was interviewed many years afterwards. He recalled, \\"I thought at that time the Blood Shed a Stream running down on the ground.\\"Watt (2002), p. 177 A monument was erected in 1884 to commemorate the battle at 43¬∞ 10.6‚Ä≤N 75¬∞ 22.2‚Ä≤W,Cookinham (1915), p. 340. and much of the battlefield is now preserved in the Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site.

It is played with Icehouse pyramids on a chessboard. To play with a number of players other than two or four, a non-Euclidean surface can be tiled to produce a board of the required size, allowing up to six players. In his review in Abstract Games Magazine, Kerry Handscomb stated: \\"The first thing to note about Martian Chess is that it is not a chess-type game at all. Instead, the objective is to accumulate points by capturing pieces.\\" \\"Martian Chess is [...] an original game with novel tactics and strategy.\\" Looney in 1996 had invented Monochrome Chess, a similar two player game that uses regular chess pieces where the half of the board determined who controlled a piece. While the king is not royal, that piece and rook can castle.  History  Martian Chess was one of four games in the Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set released by Looney Labs in 1999. The set was Looney Labs's first Icehouse release and first to showcase its potential as a game system. The other three games were IceTowers, IceTraders and Zarcana. In 2001, Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set won the Origins Award for Best Abstract Board Game of 2000. The rules to the game were reissued in 3HOUSE booklet in 2007, again by 2013 in Pyramid Primer #1 Alt URL and in 2016 as a part of Pyramid Arcade boxed set.  Rules  Four-player and two-player starting setups = Initial setup = Each player starts with nine pieces: three small (pawns), three medium (drones), and three large (queens). The color of the pieces is irrelevant to the gameplay. A mix of colors is recommended. Players initially place their pieces in the corners of the board as shown. In a two-player game, only a half-board is used. The players decide who moves first. Play turns alternate, and pass to the left after each move. = Movement and capturing = The red lines in the diagrams indicate notional canals which divide the board into territories, or quadrant. At any given time a player controls only those pieces that are in his or her territory. The pieces move as follows: * Pawns move one space diagonally in any direction. (Unlike chess pawns, they may move backwards.) * Drones move one or two spaces horizontally or vertically, without jumping. (Like chess rooks, but with limited range.) * Queens move any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, without jumping. (The same as chess queens.) As in chess, a square may contain no more than one piece, and a piece is captured when an enemy piece lands on the square it occupies. The capturing player removes the piece and puts it aside for later scoring. In the two-player game, a player may not immediately reverse an opponent's last move (i.e. may not move the piece across the canal back to its departure square, on the next turn). = End of game and scoring = The game ends when one player runs out of pieces (i.e., their territory becomes empty). Players then compute their scores by adding up the point values of the pieces they captured: queen = 3, drone = 2, pawn = 1. The player or team with the highest total wins the game. In the four-player game, the players form two teams, with teammates in opposite corners. Teammates play for a combined score. Aside from strategic differences, play is unaffected; it is legal (and sometimes good strategy) to capture your teammate's pieces.  Strategy  Capturing with a queen often allows the opponent to immediately recapture, leading to a back-and-forth battle until one player runs out of pieces in the line(s) of capture. This is more common in two-player games, since other players may interfere in the four-player version. The net point difference is usually minor with two players, but can give the players involved a significant lead over the others in a four-player game.

It is the eastern counterpart of its relative, the calandra lark. Taxonomy and systematics The bimaculated lark was originally placed in the genus Alauda. The current genus name, Melanocorypha is from Ancient Greek melas, \\"black\\", and koruphos a term used by ancient writers for a now unknown bird, but here confused with korudos, \\"lark\\". \\"Bimaculate\\" and the specific bimaculata are from New Latin bimaculatus, \\"two-spotted\\". The alternate name calandra lark should not be confused with the species of the same name. The alternate name Eastern calandra lark is also used for a subspecies of the calandra lark. Description This is a large, robust lark, 16‚Äì18 cm in length. It is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly streaked grey above and white below, and with two small black patches on the breast sides, which give this species its name. It has a white supercilium. In flight it shows short broad wings, which are grey-brown below, and a short tail with a white tip, but not white edges. The wing and tail patterns are distinctions from its more westerly relative. The song is like a harder version of that of calandra lark. Distribution and habitat The bimaculated lark is found from west-central Turkey to southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, north-eastern Iran and northern Afghanistan. It is also found in northern Israel, Lebanon, western Syria and northern Iraq. It is mainly migratory, wintering in northeast Africa, and ranges widely throughout the greater Middle East to Pakistan, India and Tibet. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. This is a bird of stony semi- desert and higher altitude cultivation. Its nest is on the ground, with 3-4 eggs being laid. Food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season. It is gregarious in winter.

Google announced at its Marketing Live event in May 2019 that the new Google Shopping will integrate the existing Google Express marketplace into a revamped shopping experience.https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/google-express-becomes-an-all- new-google-shopping-in-big-revamp/ In the U.S, Google Shopping is accessible from the web and mobile apps, available on Android and iOS. Google Shopping is also available in France, accessible from the web only.https://9to5google.com/2019/03/21/google-shopping-homepage-france-test/ Like its predecessor, Google Shopping is free and requires a personal Google account in order to purchase from the platform. A colored price tag icon replaces the parachute icon from Google Express. On the web, shoppers can either go to the Google Search homepage to enter a search query and then select the Shopping tab under the navigation bar, or go directly to the Google Shopping homepage to search for specific items, browse departments, and see trending items and promotional offers. The Google Shopping mobile app opens directly to the shopping homepage, where shoppers can similarly search or browse, and access their shopping lists, order history and notification settings. Currently, the product inventory available on the app is less robust than what is available on the web, since it currently reflects items shoppers can only buy directly on Google. In addition to shopping from well-known online stores, users can shop with confidence at lesser-known online stores when they choose to buy directly on Google, which includes a Google-backed guarantee.https://shopping.google.com/u/0/about?ved=0CBIQ7coCKAhqFwoTCIygg9z ---QCFcZRYgod_P8P6hAC The guarantee includes Google customer support, available 7 days a week, and added assistance if the order is late, if something is wrong with the shipment, and to simplify the return and refund process - regardless of the seller. When on the web, shoppers can identify products they can buy on Google by either looking for the colored cart icon within a product image, or by selecting the Buy on Google filter. Free delivery is available on qualifying orders that meet the store‚Äôs minimum order amount. Shoppers can see personalized product recommendations and promotional offers on the Google Shopping homepage depending on their Google account settings. Other features geared to help shoppers find the best prices and places to buy include the ability to track the price of a product, compare the total order cost at online or nearby stores, and access product reviews and related video content. Over the coming year, additional shopping capabilities will be rolled-out and tied into other Google products and platforms in order to simplify a shopper‚Äôs buying journey. Originally, the service listed prices submitted by merchants, and was monetized through AdWords advertising like other Google services. However, in May 2012, Google announced that the service (which was also immediately renamed Google Shopping) would shift in late-2012 to a paid model where merchants would have to pay the company in order to list their products on the service. In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record ‚Ç¨2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results. History Created by Craig Nevill- Manning and launched in December 2002, Froogle was different from most other price comparison services in that it used Google's web crawler to index product data from the websites of vendors instead of using paid submissions. As with Google Search, Froogle was instead monetized using Google's AdWords keyword advertising platform. With its re-branding as Google Product Search, the service was modified to emphasize integration with Google Search; listings from the service could now appear alongside web search results. Google prominently featured the service result in Google Search starting in January 2008 in Germany and the United Kingdom. It subsequently extended the practice to France in October 2010, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain in May 2011, the Czech Republic in February 2013 and Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden in November 2013. =Change to paid listings= Alongside the announcement of an immediate re-brand to Google Shopping on May 31, 2012, Google also announced that in late 2012, it would change the service to use a \\"pay-to-play\\" model, where merchants would have to pay Google to list their products on the service, with results influenced by both relevance and the bid amounts they pay. Google justified the move by stating that it would allow the service to \\"deliver the best answers for people searching for products and help connect merchants with the right customers.\\" The change proved controversial; some small businesses showed concern that they would not be able to compete with larger companies that can afford a larger advertising budget. Microsoft's Bing also attacked the move in an advertising campaign known as \\"Scroogled,\\" which called Google out for using \\"deceptive advertising practices\\" and suggesting that users use its competing Bing Shopping service instead. Google also revealed plans to integrate Google Catalogs with Google Shopping, to give users \\"more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brand.\\" In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record ‚Ç¨2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results. In March 2018, Google introduced Shopping Actions, a commission based model, where customers can shop \\"on the Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart, whether they're on mobile, desktop, or even a Google Home device\\" Initial case studies on the impact of Shopping Actions vs Google Shopping alone show positive results, with higher Average Order Value, increase in basket size, and higher revenue to merchants. Naming alt=Froogle Logo Google Shopping was originally known as Froogle, a pun on the term \\"frugal.\\" On April 18, 2007, the product was renamed Google Product Search; the original name was dropped due to concerns surrounding internationalization, people not understanding the pun or understanding what the service was actually about, and concerns related to the company's trademark infringement lawsuit against competing website Froogles. On May 31, 2012, the product was renamed to Google Shopping. The URL \\"froogle.com\\" remains as a redirect to Google Shopping's website.  Antitrust fine  On June 27, 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, fined Google ‚Ç¨2.4 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google was found to have abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to another Google product, its own comparison shopping service.Statement by Commissioner Vestager on Commission decision to fine Google ‚Ç¨2.42 billion for abusing dominance as search engine by giving illegal advantage to own comparison shopping service, on europa.eu, accessed on 7 July 2017. According to the European Commission, Google started giving its own Froogle significantly better treatment than rivals as early as 2008. It first began in Germany and the United Kingdom, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, then the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden. A total 418 million citizens of the European Economic Area are claimed to have been deprived of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation. Further damage payments may have to be required from Google should it not comply with European antitrust rules within 90 days.

Feldmarschall Franz Xaver Josef Graf Conrad von H√∂tzendorf (since 1919 Franz Conrad; 11 November 1852 ‚Äì 25 August 1925), sometimes anglicised as Hoetzendorf, was an Austrian general who played a central role in World War I. He served as Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff of the military of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy from 1906 to 1917. He was in charge during the July Crisis of 1914 that caused World War I. For years he had repeatedly called for preemptive war against Serbia to rescue the multiethnic Habsburg Empire, which was, he believed, nearing disintegration. Later on, he came to believe that the Dual Monarchy had taken action at the eleventh hour. The Army was also unprepared and he had resorted to politics to further his goals. He was unaware that Germany would relocate the majority of his forces to the East, rather than in the Balkans. Conrad was anxious about invading Russia and when the Tsar's armies had captured the Carpathian mountain passes and were on the verge of invading Hungary, Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies. Nevertheless, the Austro-Germans cleared Galicia and Poland during the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive in the summer of 1915 and later conquered Serbia in October. From 1915 his troops were increasingly reliant on German support and command. Without support from his German allies the Austro-Hungarian Army was an exhausted force.Geoffrey Wawro, A mad catastrophe: the outbreak of World War I and the collapse of the Habsburg Empire (2014). In March 1917, Charles I of Austria dismissed him as Chief of Staff after Emperor Franz Joseph died and Conrad's Trentino Offensive had failed to achieve its objective; he then commanded an army group on the Italian Front until he retired in the summer of 1918.Richard Holmes, ed. The Oxford companion to military history (2001) p 224. He died in 1925. For decades he was celebrated as a great strategist, albeit one who was defeated in all his major campaigns. Historians now rate him as a failure whose grandiose plans were unrealistic. During his tenure, repeated military catastrophe brought the Austrian army to its near destruction. Life Conrad was born in Penzing, a suburb of Vienna, to an Austrian officers' family. His great-grandfather Franz Anton Conrad (1738‚Äì1827) had been ennobled and added to his name the nobiliary particle von H√∂tzendorf as a predicate in 1815, referring to the surname of his first wife who descended from the Bavarian Upper Palatinate region. His father Franz Xaver Conrad (1793‚Äì1878) was a retired colonel of Hussars, originally from southern Moravia, who had fought in the Battle of Leipzig and took part in the suppression of the Vienna Uprising of 1848, wherein he was severely wounded. Conrad married Wilhelmine le Beau (1860‚Äì1905) in 1886, with whom he had four sons. In the latter part of his life, he was known to hold doubts about his fitness for office and occasionally suffered severe bouts of depression. These worsened after the death of his wife in 1905. In 1907, while attending a dinner party in Vienna, Conrad met Virginia von Reininghaus, an Italian aristocrat, and became quickly enamoured. In the weeks following this, he made many attempts to court Reininghaus, despite the fact that she was already married with six children, which eventually resulted in the two conducting an affair. This illegitimate pairing continued until their marriage in 1915. Upon his death in 1925, a journal titled \\"Diary of my Sufferings\\" was found. The journal compiled over 3000 letters written to Reininghaus, some over 60 pages in length, detailing the extent of Conrad's love for her. In order to prevent a scandal breaking out from a potential leak, Conrad kept the letters private and they were never sent to their intended recipient. =Military career= Conrad joined the cadet corps of the Hainburg garrison and was educated at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He developed a strong interest in natural science, especially in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. In 1871, at age 19, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in a J√§ger battalion. After graduating from the Kriegsschule military academy in 1876, he transferred to the General Staff Corps of the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1878‚Äì1879, upon the Treaty of Berlin, these duties brought him to the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sanjak of Novi Pazar, when those Ottoman provinces were assigned to the military administration of Austria- Hungary. He was a Captain (Hauptmann) and served as a staff officer during the 1882 insurrection in the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia. In 1886, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 11th Infantry Division at Lemberg, where he showed great ability in reforming field exercise. In the fall of 1888, Conrad was promoted to Major and appointed professor of military tactics in the Kriegsschule in Vienna, a position he prepared for by touring the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War. Conrad proved to be a good teacher who was quite popular among his students. =Return to command and Chief of Staff= Chief of Staff, 1906 In 1892 he requested transfer back to command and took charge of the 93rd Infantry Regiment at Olm√ºtz. From 1895 he commanded the 1st Infantry Regiment Kaiser at Krak√≥w and from 1899 the 55th Infantry Brigade in Trieste, promoted to a Generalmajor (one-star general). After acting against a major Italian uprising in the city in 1902, he was made Feldmarschalleutnant and took command of the 8th Infantry Division at Innsbruck in 1903. By the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff for the Austro-Hungarian military forces at the suggestion of the heir to the throne (Thronfolger), Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in November 1906, Conrad had established a reputation as a teacher and writer. Like other Austro-Hungarian officers of his generation, he had little direct combat experience, but had studied and written extensively about theory and tactics. His published works on infantry tactics sold well and were printed in multiple editions. He was a tireless campaigner for modernization of the armed forces. He was made General der Infanterie in November 1908. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria vested Conrad with the noble rank of a Freiherr in 1910. His differences with Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal, who several times objected to Conrad's suggestion of a preventive war against Italy, over the Bosnian crisis led to his dismissal in 1911, under the pretext of an affair with his later wife Virginia Reininghaus. Nevertheless, after Aehrenthal had resigned and died the next year, Archduke Franz Ferdinand urged for Conrad's re-appointment, which took place during the Balkan Wars in December 1912. Although Conrad's ideas had considerable impact in the decision making process of the government, especially in the lead-up to the First World War, historian John Leslie describes him as a \\"loner\\" who did not easily win friends or influence people and was politically inept. =First World War= Planning Conrad and his admirers took special pride in his elaborate war plans that were designed individually against various possible opponents, but did not take into account having to fight a two front war against Russia and Serbia simultaneously. His plans were kept secret from his own diplomatic and political leadership‚Äîhe promised his secret operations would bring quick victory. Conrad assumed far more soldiers than were available, with much better training than they actually had. In practice, his soldiers were inferior to the enemy. His plans were based on railroad timetables from the 1870s, and ignored German warnings that Russia had much improved its own railroad capabilities. Conrad assumed the war would result in victory in six weeks. He assumed it would take Russia 30 days to mobilize its troops, and he assumed his own armies could be operational against Serbia in two weeks. When the war started, there were repeated delays, which were made worse when Conrad radically changed plans in the middle of mobilization. Russia did much better than expected, mobilizing two thirds of its army within 18 days, and operating 362 trains a day ‚Äì compared to 153 trains a day by Austria-Hungary.Herweg, 1997, pp 53-56. During the July Crisis upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Conrad was the first proponent of war against the Kingdom of Serbia in response. Germany is thought to have requested an immediate invasion of Serbia, but Conrad delayed for over a month. Many Army units were on leave to harvest crops and not scheduled to return until 25 July. To cancel those leaves would disrupt the harvest and the nation's food supply, scramble complex railroad schedules, alert Europe to Vienna's plans, and give the opposition time to mobilize. Meanwhile, Emperor Franz Joseph went on his long-scheduled three week summer vacation. Victories & Defeats Conrad at the map table, 1914 When he was ready, Conrad on August 12 sent his army into Serbia, where it was defeated with the loss of 100,000 soldiers. On 22 August he launched an even larger campaign against Russia through Galicia, after early victories at Krasnik and Komarow which were followed by defeat and the loss of Lemberg.Herweg, 1997, pp 52-53. Conrad unexpectedly had to deal with a massive incursion of Imperial Russian troops into Austrian Galicia. His plans had underestimated Russian strength and speed, while ignoring the glaring weaknesses in his own army. His forces did win a great victory at Limanowa in December 1914 saving Cracow.Herweg, 1997, pp 87-96, 112-13. After the Germans scored major victories especially at Tannenberg, and after the Western front was bogged down in stalemate, Germany had resources to help Austria. Although Conrad was officially in command, the German forces alongside him increasingly took control of the situation. Berlin sent in large armies and together they conquered large parts of Serbia, Montenegro and Romania and stabilised the Italian front. He urged the new Foreign Minister Stephan Buri√°n von Rajecz to annex the occupied lands, and he continuously intrigued against the Hungarian prime minister Istv√°n Tisza as well as against the Austrian minister president Count Karl von St√ºrgkh, whom he considered a fool, though to no avail. On the other hand, the relations with the German Supreme Army Command (OHL) worsened due to the uneasy relationship between Conrad and General Erich von Falkenhayn. Eased out of power Following the accession of Emperor Charles I of Austria to the throne in November 1916, Conrad was elevated to the rank of field marshal, one of only three men in Austria-Hungary to hold that rank at the time. While still the heir-apparent, Charles had reported to Emperor Franz Josef that the \\"mismanagement\\" in the army's high command could not be cleared out until Conrad was replaced, but admitted that finding someone to take his role would not be easy. Yet under the new emperor, Conrad's powers were gradually eroded. In December, the commander-in-chief Archduke Friedrich of Austria-Teschen was removed from office, which the new emperor assumed himself. Charles took operational control of all combat units in the army and navy and on 1 March 1917 officially dismissed Conrad, who then requested retirement. The emperor personally asked him to remain on active duty, and when Conrad accepted, he was placed in command of the South Tyrolean Army Group. In the late spring of 1918, the failure of the Austro-Hungarian offensives against the Italians, with costly and bloody assaults led by both Conrad and Boroeviƒá, brought condemnation upon the imperial leadership. Further complicating Conrad's image was his identification with those in the government intent on continuing the war. In this atmosphere, Conrad, described as a \\"broken man\\", was dismissed on 15 July, perhaps in an effort to deflect further criticism. At the same time he was promoted from Freiherr to the noble rank of a Graf (Count) and received the honorific post of a Guard colonel. =Death= After the war, Conrad denied any personal guilt for the outbreak and the results of the war and blamed the Imperial court and politicians for it. Embittered and sickened, he died on 25 August 1925, while taking a cure in Mergentheim, Germany. When he was buried at Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna on 2 September 1925, more than 100,000 mourners participated in observances. After long discussions, his grave of honor () was changed into a historical grave in 2012. Titled Freiherr (usually translated as Baron) since 1910; from 1918 until April 1919 raised to the title of Graf, usually translated as Count; from April 1919 Conrad's official name was Franz Conrad-H√∂tzendorf, since the First Austrian Republic abolished nobility for its citizens by law. Strategies and performance Conrad late in life Conrad's legacy as a commander remains controversial, with earlier historians regarding him as a military genius, while more recent works characterize him as an utter failure; at least one military historian considered him to be \\"probably the best strategist of the war.\\"Edmonds, Sir James E. (1951) A Short History of World War I London: Greenwood Press. ; cited by Terraine, John (1965) The First World War 1914-1918 London: Macmillan. p.15 In military matters, Conrad emphasized the importance of aggressive, well-trained infantry and the strategic and tactical offensive. But historian Gunther E. Rothenberg argued that his unrealistically grandiose plans disregarded the realities of terrain and climate, and that the plans which he drew up frequently underestimated the power of the enemy and the potential of quick-firing artillery forces. Conrad also refused to take responsibility for the start of the war, or for Austria-Hungary's defeat, arguing that he had \\"been 'just a military expert' with no voice in the key decisions\\". To his admirers he was a military genius. Soviet general and theorist Boris Shaposhnikov presented Conrad as a model for a good Chief of the General Staff in his 1927 book Mozg Armii. The historian Cyril Falls, in his 1959 book The Great War, argues that Conrad was probably the best strategist of the war and that his plans were brilliant in conception. He argues that German generals in the east based most of their successful offensive operations on Conrad's plans.Falls, Cyril: The Great War, Putnam, New York 1959, p. 36. German general Paul von Hindenburg praised Conrad as a man of superior ability and a bold general, only hindered by the weaknesses of his army.World war I, the global revolution, Lawrence Sondhaus Conrad's critics contend that his mistakes led to the disastrous first year of war that crippled Austro-Hungarian military capabilities. For example, in the 1914 Serbian Campaign, led by General Oskar Potiorek, the Serbian Army proved far more effective than Conrad had expected despite the Austro-Hungarian manpower advantage. Undefeated in all major battles, it finally enforced a full-scale retreat of Potiorek's troops by the end of the year. Also the first Austro- Hungarian offensives against Russia were remarkable for their lack of effect, culminating in the lost Battle of Galicia and the disastrous Siege of Przemy≈õl combined with massive human cost. Conrad was fully responsible for this disaster, for he had committed too many troops in Serbia, leaving severely outnumbered units to resist the Russian advance. Conrad blamed the German allies, who had driven out the Russian Army from East Prussia in the Battle of Tannenberg, for the lack of military support. The most disastrous defeat came in 1916, in the Russian Brusilov Offensive, one of the most lethal battles in world history, whereby the Austro-Hungarian forces under Conrad's command lost more than 600,000 men, and were never again capable of mounting an offensive without German help. The disaster was mostly due to Austrian overconfidence as well as Conrad having sent reinforcements to Italy, ignoring the Russian threat. Most of Austria's victories on the eastern front were possible only in cooperation with the German High Command (OHL), on which the Austro-Hungarian army became increasingly dependent. After his defeats of the first year, Conrad was increasingly sidelined by the Germans on the eastern front. Conrad was a Social Darwinist, and believed life consisted of \\"an unremitting struggle for existence\\" in which the offensive was the only effective form of defence. The power of the Magyar elite within Austria-Hungary troubled him, as he believed it weakened and diluted what he saw as an essentially German- Austrian empire. He also worried about Italian ambitions in the Balkans. However, his greatest ambition was for a pre-emptive war against Serbia in order to neutralize the threat that he believed they posed, and at the same time change the political balance within the Dual Monarchy against the Magyars by incorporating more Slavs in a third Yugoslavian component under Austrian control, denying the principle of self-determination. According to Hew Strachan, \\"Conrad von H√∂tzendorf first proposed preventive war against Serbia in 1906, and he did so again in 1908‚Äì09, in 1912‚Äì13, in October 1913, and May 1914: between 1 January 1913 and 1 January 1914 he proposed a Serbian war twenty-five times\\".Strachan, Hew. The First World War: Volume 1: To Arms. Oxford, 2001. Legacy For decades, the reputation of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Conrad as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history was a matter of national pride among patriotic circles in post-war Austria‚Äîthough his policies and tactics had already been criticized by contemporaries like Karl Kraus, who in his satirical drama The Last Days of Mankind portrayed him as a vain poser (I 2). Not until the 1960s, in the course of the renewed controversy over the causes of World War I, the evaluation of his role shifted from hagiography towards a widespread perception as a warmonger and imperialist. Nevertheless, up to today several streets in Austria are named after him. Conrad's guard uniform and some of his personal belongings are on display at the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna. In 1938 the Wehrmacht barracks of the 1st Mountain Division in Oberammergau, Bavaria were named Conrad-von-H√∂tzendorf-Kaserne; it is today operated by the Bundeswehr and site of the NATO School. The medical service centre of the Austrian Armed Forces in Innsbruck is named after Field Marshal Conrad. In the Austrian cities of Graz and Berndorf streets were named Conrad- von-H√∂tzendorf-Stra√üe. =Theatrical portrayal= * Conrad has a prominent role in Dennis Wheatley's historical adventure The Second Seal (1950). * He is portrayed by T.

The gate took its name from the Moorfields, an area of marshy land that lay immediately north of the wall. The gate was demolished in 1762, but gave its name to a major street, Moorgate, laid out in 1834. The area around the street and around Moorgate station is informally also referred to as Moorgate. The Moorgate district is home to many financial institutions and has many notable historic and contemporary buildings. Moorgate station was the site of the Moorgate tube crash of 1975, when a Northern City Line train failed to stop and hit a brick wall killing 43. This resulted in systems, known as Moorgate control, being installed on the Underground in order to stop trains at dead-ends. The Gate An engraving showing Moorgate before it was demolished in 1762 The earliest descriptions of Moorgate date from the early 15th century, where it was described as only a postern in the London city wall. Located between Bishopsgate and Cripplegate and leading to a marshy open space known as Moorfields, it was not one of the larger or more important of the city gates. In 1415 an ordinance enacted that the old postern be demolished. It was replaced with a newer and larger structure located farther to the west, which included a wooden gate to be shut at night. This gate was enlarged again in 1472 and 1511, and then damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Although the City gates had ceased to have any modern function apart from decoration, it was replaced along with Ludgate, Newgate, and Temple Bar with a stone gate in 1672. The Moorgate linked the parts of Coleman Street Ward on either side of London's Wall Moorgate and the Wall originally formed the northern boundary of Coleman Street Ward. It appears that the area outside, the once very marshy Lower and Little Moorfields (now mostly occupied by Finsbury Circus and the surrounding buildings), previously part of the Manor of Finsbury were added in the 17th century,The Ward did not extend beyond the wall at the time of John Stows survey of 1603 ‚Äì but it did by the time of Ogilby and Morgans map of 1676 though it was not developed until 1817. Moorgate was demolished with most of the other London city wall gates in 1761/2, and the resulting stone was sold for ¬£166 to the City of London Corporation to support the starlings of the newly widened centre arch of the London Bridge. Little Moorgate was a postern opposite Little Winchester Street leading into Moorfields. It had been demolished by 1755, but gave its name to a street Boyle, P. Boyle's View of London, and its Environs; 1799. London, accessed at 2008-04-12 that was later removed for the building of a railway. Moorgate Street and locality Moor House CityPoint The area around the former gate, Moorgate street and Moorgate station is referred to informally as the Moorgate area. This locale roughly approximates to the Coleman Street Ward of the City of London. The contemporary street of Moorgate runs north from Princes Street and Lothbury at the back of the Bank of England, across the road named London Wall and the location of the old gate, and then continues north. After leaving the City of London in the direction of the London Borough of Islington, the street is known as Finsbury Pavement (which at one time was known as Moor Fields Pavement) and then City Road. The street was constructed around 1846 as one of the new approaches to London Bridge. While the street was formally known as \\"Moorgate Street\\", the street part of the name eventually fell out of use. The Chartered Accountants' Hall, on Moorgate Place, is the home of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The Guildhall is connected to Moorgate station via Bassishaw Highwalk. The Guildhall is the home of the City of London Corporation and the centre of City government since the Middle Ages. Adjacent and internally connected to the Guildhall is the Guildhall Art Gallery, which houses the art collection of the City of London. It occupies a stone building in a semi-Gothic style which was completed in 1999 to replace an earlier building destroyed in 1941. The Moorfields were an extensive area of open land, partly in the City of London, partly in the Manor of Finsbury. The Lower Moorfields was home to the Bethlem Royal Hospital (also known as Bedlam, Europe's oldest psychiatric hospital) from 1676 to 1815. Rocque e1 MoorgateCrop The Lower Moorfields was developed in 1817, with the building of Finsbury Circus. Finsbury Circus includes a number of classical buildings surrounding an oval-shaped circus. The gardens in the centre of the circus occupy a plot enclosed by railings, and include the lawn of the City of London Bowls Club. Moorgate is also the birthplace of John Keats, one of the principal poets in the English Romantic movement. Keats was born in 1795 in the Swan and Hoop Inn at 199 Moorgate, where his father was an ostler. The pub is now called \\"The John Keats at The Globe\\", having previously been known as \\"The Moorgate Coffee House\\", \\"The Moorgate\\" and \\"The John Keats at Moorgate\\", only a few yards from Moorgate station. A new commercial development on Moorgate, known as Moor House, opened in 2005. The building is located at the corner of Moorgate and London Wall, and was designed by Foster and Partners. The building has of office space in 19 storeys, and is built in the location of a smaller office building built in the 1960s known as Moor House. A 36 m shaft under the building incorporates part of Crossrail's new station and ticket hall serving Liverpool Street. During the 1940s-60s, HM Customs and Excise investigation staff were based at Moorgate Hall, 153 Moorgate. There is a campus of the London Metropolitan University, formerly a Polytechnic, and part of the London Guildhall University, on Moorgate. The campus houses its business school, a library, and other administrative facilities. A number of large buildings are being planned or already built in the neighbouring streets. These include a 43-storey, 140 m residential skyscraper at Milton Court (The Heron), that is taller than CityPoint, and a 90 m office tower at Ropemaker Place is also being developed by British Land, with construction already underway.

MOL container logo MOL reefer container History MOL (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines) was founded in 1964, following the merger of founded in 1878, and Mitsui Steamship Co., Ltd. founded in 1942, formerly Mitsui Line, under the Law Concerning the Reconstruction and Reorganization of the Shipping Industry. At that time the company was the largest shipping company in Japan, capitalized at ¬•13.1 billion, with 83 vessels aggregating . =1884-1950= OSK OSK was founded in 1884, when 55 ship owners, each of whom had only a small number of vessels, combined their operations. The chief representative of these ship owners was Hirose Saihei, senior manager of the Sumitomo zaibatsu, or conglomerate, and a prominent figure in Osaka financial circles. OSK was capitalized at ¬•1.2 million, with 93 vessels totalling . O.S.K. Line's travel brochure \\"The Inland Sea,\\" circa 1932. In the first few years its routes were limited to coastal services in the western area of Japan. In 1890, OSK inaugurated an Osaka-Pusan run followed in 1893 by the operation of an Osaka-Incheon route and Korean coastal services. The company was recapitalized at ¬•1.8 million in 1893, rising to ¬•2.5 million in 1894, to ¬•5 million in 1896, when the government of Taiwan granted OSK subsidies for Osaka-Taiwan liner services, and to ¬•10 million in 1898 when the company started to operate on the Yangtze River. In 1898, Tokugoro Nakahashi became the company's third president. He made a great effort to rationalize the internal organization of OSK, to penetrate the Chinese market, and also to inaugurate the first OSK ocean route, a Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington service, in 1908. In 1911 OSK started a Kobe to Bombay service. The route was under the monopoly of the Far Eastern Freight Conference (FEFC) of which Nippon Yusen K.K. (NYK) was the only Japanese member. OSK fought against the FEFC and was admitted to the conference in 1913. In 1918, the company opened a Bombay to Marseilles route and was admitted to full membership of the FEFC. Meanwhile, it opened a San Francisco route, an Australia route, and a South America route, offering a worldwide liner service. It began a New York City service in 1920 but operated at a deficit. In 1930 OSK made a huge investment in five new high-speed motor ships in order to start a New York express service. This service entirely transformed raw-silk transportation from Asia to America; raw silk began to be carried by water all the way to New York instead of going by land. OSK's share of cargo shipped on this route grew, and its business performance improved in spite of unfavourable business conditions. Steamship brochure \\"Japan and Round the World, O.S.K. Line,\\" circa 1933. During the Great Depression, OSK and NYK made a cooperative agreement in 1931 whereby OSK abolished its Puget Sound route, which had called at Tacoma and Seattle, and in turn acquired a monopoly on the South American east coast route. OSK quickly recovered from the deficits of 1930 and 1931, and resumed paying dividends in 1932. The company's profits peaked in 1941, when OSK was capitalized at ¬•87 million and had 112 vessels aggregating . Mitsui Bussan Kaisha The Mitsui Line was originally the shipping department of the trading company Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. Mitsui Bussan was established in 1876 and obtained exclusive rights to export and market the coal mined at the state-run Miike mines. It chartered boats and transported coal on its own account. In 1878 it bought a steamship, and in 1888 it bought the mines. Mitsui Bussan became an industrial carrier and the shipping section was established in 1898. The section expanded to become the Shipping Department and moved to Kobe in 1904. The company then owned 9 ships aggregating , and on the eve of World War I the fleet totalled 15 ships with , increasing to 30 ships totalling in 1919. The third general manager, Teijiro Kawamura, expanded the business of the department during World War I; in 1914 it began a tramp service carrying the company's own cargo and that of other companies. In 1917 it constructed a shipyard and set up the shipbuilding department and in 1920 it opened a semi-liner service from Dalian via Kobe to Seattle, whereby a liner service operated on outbound voyages but on the return voyage, owing to insufficient cargo at Seattle, ships had to stop and collect cargo at other ports. Mitsui Bussan's Shipping Department built two sister ships in 1924. One was equipped with reciprocal oil-burners, the other had diesel engines and was the first ocean-going diesel ship in Japan. The department put these ships on the North American route and compared their performance. Akagisan Maru, the diesel ship, proved superior, and Mitsui concluded a manufacturing and marketing license agreement with Burmeister and Wain Co. (B & W), who had manufactured the engine, in 1926. In 1928 Mitsui opened a Bangkok route, in 1931 a Philippines route, in 1932 a Dalien to New York route, and in 1935 a Persian Gulf route. From 1933 the Shipping Department became known as Mitsui Line. In 1937 it owned 35 ships aggregating . The shipbuilding department was separated off as the Mitsui Tama Shipyard in 1937, and in 1942 the former Shipping Department too became a separate company, Mitsui Steamship Co., Ltd. (MS). It was capitalized at ¬•50 million, and Takaharu Mitsui was elected chairman. World War II During World War II OSK, like other Japanese shipping companies, was forced to be a mere ship owner. When the war ended it had only 55 vessels left, totalling , most of which were so-called wartime standard ships, of poor quality. All ships were under control of the Allied powers through the Civilian Merchant Marine Committee. In 1950, however, OSK returned to global service. By the end of 1957 the company had almost recovered the sailing rights it had been given by the FEFC before the war, and was making 18 voyages per month on 13 overseas liner routes. Competition was far more intense than before the war, as anyone who had money could construct ships under the government-sponsored shipbuilding program, started in 1947. Before the war, conference members had sought to exclude newcomers. OSK constructed 38 ships under the program. In 1953 OSK established an eastbound route to South America to transport emigrants from Japan. At first the service was profitable, but the number of emigrants fell to below 2,000 per year in 1962. In 1963 OSK established the Japan Emigration Ship Co., Ltd. (JES) to hive off this loss making business. Later, JES was reorganized into Mitsui OSK Passenger Co., Ltd. In this period most of OSK's businesses were loss making. In 1964 it owned 41 vessels totalling . The company was capitalized at ¬•7.6 billion and its debts totalled approximately ¬•34.9 billion. =1950-1964= During World War II, and after the war, all MS ships were under the control of the government. When Japan lost the war in 1945, only 17 of MS's vessels were left, increasing to 22 vessels totalling when MS re-acquired operations that had previously been chartered out to the Civilian Merchant Marine Committee (CMMC). Post- War MS then began a vigorous expansion of its fleet and routes to re- establish its pre-war network, and went so far as to apply to the FEFC. When its application was rejected, MS placed outsider‚Äînon-conference-member‚Äîships on this route in 1953. After a long struggle, the conference attempted to resolve the issue politically and the British ambassador openly criticized Japan's shipping policies in 1955. Japan joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) the same year, and Japan's minister of transport was anxious to settle the issue without dispute. The final proposal of the conference, through the mediation of the minister of transport, contained extremely harsh conditions which MS had to accept, one of which was that MS could only join the FEFC if it operated under the management of NYK for several years. The 39-month battle was over, and MS began placing ships under the auspice of NYK in 1956. Five years later, MS at last joined the conference. Shipbuilding MS constructed 38 vessels between 1950 and its merger with OSK in 1964, and its operating tonnage was the largest in Japan. One of its ships, Kinkasan Maru, was the first bridge-controlled ship in the world. MS planned to rationalize its crews and at the same time improve the working conditions of engineers. It cooperated with Mitsui Shipbuilding & Engineering Co., a direct successor of Mitsui Tama Shipyard, and designed innovatory bridge-controlled ships. The Kinkasan Maru was delivered in 1961 and MS placed it, along with another bridge-controlled ship, on the New York route, which was re-opened in 1951. Besides the New York route, MS operated westbound and eastbound routes around the world, a Central and South America route, a West Africa route, and a Great Lakes route. In 1964 MS owned 45 vessels aggregating . However, MS's performance was disappointing from 1950 until the OSK merger in 1964, when it was capitalized at ¬•5.5 billion and had debts of ¬•26.7 billion. Mitsui-OSK merger The MOL Enterprise container ship in 2004 Soon after the shipping industry reorganization of 1964, in which Japanese shipping companies were restructured into six groups, world shipping moved toward containerization. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL), formed by the merger of OSK and MS, began container services on the California route, joining a space-charter consortium of four Japanese operators. Business results improved after the merger, and the loss brought forward was written off in 1966. The company was recapitalized at ¬•20 billion in 1968, and at ¬•30 billion in 1972. The owned fleet increased to 152 vessels, totalling in 1974, and the operating fleet‚Äîowned vessels and time-chartered vessels‚Äînumbered 291 vessels, totalling . =Containerization= The first container ship, MOL's America Maru, sailed from Kobe to San Francisco in October 1969. Containerization spread to other routes, including the Australia route, with NYK and Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co., in 1970; the North Pacific route, with five other Japanese companies, in 1971; and the Europe route, as part of the TRIO Group consisting of MOL, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Overseas Container Line, Ben Line, and Hapag-Lloyd, in 1971. On the New York route and Mediterranean routes a container service began in 1972. =Carrying ore= The other trend was toward specialization. Both OSK and MS had ore carriers, and after the merger MOL held the largest share of the Japanese ore market. The Yachiyosan Maru, at , built in 1970 under a cargo guarantee from Nippon Steel Corporation, was the largest ore carrier in Japan at that time. =Cars= MOL built Oppama Maru, the first Car Carrier ship in Japan in 1965, under cargo guarantee from Nissan Motor Company. MOL could not carry cars at a low freight rate because it had to stick to the conference rate. Nissan therefore established the Nissan Motor Car Carrier Co. in 1970 to operate the Oppama Maru and transport its cars. Based on this model, MOL and Honda Motor Co. established the Act Maritime Co. in 1973 to carry Honda cars to the United States. MOL Ro-Ro Car Carrier division is named ACE (Auto Car Carrier Express), and majority of the Roll-on/roll-off vessels in the company fleet have the suffix ACE in their name.https://steelguru.com/auto/mol-announces- delivery-of-the-beluga-ace-1st-next-generation-flexie-series-car- carrier/504880?type=logistic The division specializes in maritime transport and distribution of brand new and used automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machineries and further types of rolling freight. Since 1990, MOL has invested in the regional feeder line Euro Marine Logistics. In July 2006, MOL-operated MV Cougar Ace suffered one of the worst stability accident in the industry. In that occasion, despite all her cargo was a total loss, the ship was salvaged and still sails. On 1 January 2019, MV Sincerity Ace caught fire when sailing northwest of Oahu, en route from Japan to Honolulu port.http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/americas/search- continues-for-two-missing-from-mol-car-carrier-sincerity-ace-three-feared- dead.html Several vessels sailing close by were diverted by the US Coast Guard to rescue her Crew, however 4 fatalities and 1 missing person were reported. =Oil Crisis= The U.S. gold embargo in 1971 and the advent of a floating world monetary system was a severe blow for MOL. It changed its financial strategy, keeping more funds in U.S. dollars and in other currencies. More serious was the 1973 oil crisis. MOL immediately cancelled tankers under construction and recorded its best business performance since the merger; freight revenue topped ¬•327.5 billion. Soon afterward, however, results deteriorated rapidly and the downslide continued until 1978. MOL made great efforts to curtail costs, and simultaneously increased the size and number of container ships. Containerization increased on routes between industrially advanced and developing countries, and huge investment was needed to finance this expansion. The development of intermodal transportation on the North America route also began, and MOL introduced a Mini Land Bridge (MLB) service in 1972, using rail transport as well as shipping to reduce transit time, to compete with the U.S. shipping company Sea-Land, extending the service to IPI (Interior Point Intermodal) service in 1980. Around the time that the MLB service started, the world trade structure began to change and in 1979 about 60% of general cargo from Asia to the United States came to be loaded at newly industrialized countries (NICs). MOL reorganized its routes, changing its starting ports for U.S. voyages from Japan to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other NICs, while shipping companies in the newly industrialized countries captured this new demand and branched out into the Pacific routes. The competition in sea transportation increased and MOL began a direct container service between the Far East and the west coast of North America in 1982. MOL invested huge capital to consolidate these services and to establish a service network in the United States. As a countermeasure against rising oil costs MOL built energy-efficient ships, cooperating with Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding. Awobasan Maru, delivered in 1981, was the first ship incorporating innovations that reduced fuel consumption by 30%. In 1974 MOL established the Saudi Arabian Shipping Co., Ltd. (SASCO) and Arabian Marine Operation Co. Ltd. (AMOCO) as joint ventures with the prince of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. SASCO is the shipowner, while AMOCO manages tanker operations. MOL hoped that this joint venture would give it an advantageous status in any future nationalization of oil, but at first the performance of these companies was not good, and AMOCO acquired the rights to bunker supply in 1977. Two years later the second oil crisis occurred and MOL was able to get a stable bunker supply. =Scaling back= MOL ship with a Liberian flag of convenience Personnel expenses increased after the first oil crisis, and the yen was revalued. These changes hit MOL heavily as a large part of its income was in U.S. dollars. To make itself more competitive, MOL reduced the number of its own vessels and increased the number of flag of convenience (FOC) ships; its own ships fell in number from 127 in 1975 to 82 in 1982, and the number of employees at sea from 3,127 to 2,233, while freight revenue increased from ¬•282 billion to ¬•476 billion over the same period. MOL also built highly rationalized ships in cooperation with MES, which would require a crew of only 18, the minimum number accepted by the Seamen's Act, while other ships required 22 or 24. The first super-advanced ship was the Canberra Maru, delivered in 1979, which was put on the Australia route. =Passenger service= Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo. In 1970 MOL established Mitsui OSK Passenger Co., Ltd. (MOP), with the reorganization of JES. MOP has three passenger ships. The company was the only one in Japan to operate an ocean- going passenger service at that time, but later in the 1990s a few Japanese shipping companies entered this market to cope with the boom in travelling by sea. =LNG= In 1983 the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Free on Board (FOB) conditions began as part of the diversification of Japan's energy resources, and MOL, NYK, Kawasaki Steamship, Chubu Electric Power Company, Incorporated and other Japanese electricity and gas companies jointly established two specialized companies, Badak LNG Transport Inc. and Arun, to transport LNG from Indonesia. These two companies operated seven LNG ships, constructed by MOL and other shipping companies. MOL also took delivery in 1983 of the Kohzan Maru, Japan's first large-sized methanol carrier, and transported methanol from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan's exports of industrial plant grew at that time and modularization began. MOL was interested in the transportation of massive plants and took delivery of five specialized ships, including the Atlas Maru, equipped with a 600-ton capacity derrick, one of the largest in the world. Plant exports began to decline in the late 1980s and these special ships were mostly sold or changed their flags. =Restructuring= In 1984 the Maritime Act of the United States was revised and the mandatory independent action clause was introduced. This gave shipping companies the right to introduce a discount tariff if registered at the Federal Maritime Commission. The conferences on North American routes became extremely weak and freight rates on the routes dropped sharply. Every route between the Far East and the United States made losses and MOL's business performance deteriorated again. Once more, MOL worked hard to curtail expenses and establish greater competitiveness on these routes. In the same year it decided to enlarge its container terminal facilities at Los Angeles, and also installed its own container terminals at Asian ports, including Kaohsiung. MOL also made great efforts to reorganize operations on the Pacific routes, dissolving the consortium of six Japanese companies. In 1985 it began a two- company consortium with Kawasaki Steamship's K Line service (KL) on the Japan/Pacific southwest route, and with East Asiatic Co. (EAC) on the Far East/Pacific southwest route. It also decided to start a three-company consortium with KL and EAC on the Pacific northwest route. On each route it began a weekly service with newly built large container ships. The first such ship, Asian Venture, was an FOC ship at 1,960 20 feet equivalent unit (TEU), indicating the number of containers loaded, and the main ships placed on this route became FOC ships after they were launched in 1984. Moreover, MOL began operating a double stack train service between Los Angeles, Chicago, and Columbus, Ohio in 1985 and extended it to New York in the following year. The New York route became the most competitive because of this trend toward intermodal forms of transport. NYK, Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co.--later merged with Japan Line to establish Nippon Liner Systems for liner business and Navix Lines for tramp business‚Äîand MOL began a joint operation service in 1986 and put on it six high-speed large vessels including MOL's Alligator series ships. To improve services, MOL introduced a computer booking system in 1984 and enlarged its online system to cover the United States and the Far East in 1986. This route, however, became lossmaking after 1986, seriously affecting the company's performance; MOL did not pay dividends between 1987 and 1989. =Internationalization= MOL's financial activities became more international after the first oil crisis. The company issued corporate debentures and warrant bonds on the Swiss capital market. Shareholders' equity was ¬•57.36 billion, and net income ¬•5.94 billion in 1991. In the same year, the number of directly owned vessels was 54, aggregating , and there were 296 operating vessels, aggregating . =2018 Container activities merge= On Monday 31 October 2016, Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha agreed to merge their container shipping business via establishing a completely new joint venture company. The integration included their overseas terminal activities. The new joint venture company operating under the name \\"Ocean Network Express\\" from 1 April 2018, has holding company office in Tokyo, global headquarter in Singapore and regional headquarters in United Kingdom (London), United States (Richmond, VA), Hong Kong, and Brazil (Sao Paulo). =2020 oil spill= From 25 July 2020, MOL-operated MV Wakashio ran aground and spilled oil at the South of Mauritius.https://www.mol.co.jp/en/pr/2020/20042.html =Select list of ships= * America Maru Bulk carriers * Aurora Light * Brasil Maru * Crystal Pioneer (woodchip carrier)Students rescued after Concordia tall ship sinks, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 19 February 2010. * Eigen * Enchanter * Energia Centaurus * Grandis * Envoyager * Hokuetsu Delight (woodchip carrier) * KN Arcadia * Kurenai * Lambert Maru * Midnight Dream * Mona Linden * Pleiades Dream * RMC Rigel * Sea Navigator * Shiyo * Vega Dream * Zebra Wind port of Bremerhaven (2010) Car carriers * Adria Ace * Amethyst Ace * Aquamarine Ace * Azalea Ace * Bergamot Ace * Bravery Ace * Camelia Ace * Cougar Ace *Courageous Ace * Divine Ace * Elegant Ace * Emerald Ace * Eminent Ace * Eternal Ace * Euphony Ace * Freedom Ace * Frontier Ace * Genuine Ace * Galaxy Ace * Gardenia Ace * Gracious Ace * Heroic Ace * Iris Ace * Istra Ace * Liberty Ace * Mercury Ace * Meridian Ace * Miraculous Ace * Neptune Ace * Onyx Ace * Opal Ace * Pearl Ace * Planet Ace * Precious Ace * Prime Ace * Primrose Ace * Prominent Ace * Sanderling Ace * Salvia Ace * Sapphire Ace * Serenity Ace * Singa Ace * Sunlight Ace * Sunrise Ace * Sunshine Ace * Swallow Ace * Swan Ace * Swift Ace * Tranquil Ace * Triumph Ace * Violet Ace * Wisteria Ace Cruise carriers * Fuji Maru * Nippon Maru Ferries and domestic transportation * Blue Diamond * Sunflower Tomakomai LNG carriers * Abdelkader * Al Aamriya * Al Deebel * Ben Badis * Dukhan * Fraiha * Fukurukuju * Fuwairit * GDF Suez Point Fortin * Grand Mereya * LNG Aquarius * LNG Aries * LNG Capricorn * LNG Ebisu * LNG Jurojin * LNG Pioneer * LNG Taurus * Murwab Majuro * Senshu Maru * Surya Satsuma Tankers * Advance Victoria * Ambassador Norris * Asian Progress 3 * Asian Progress 4 * Atlantic Explorer * Atlantic Pioneer * Azumasan * Breezy Victoria * Gassan * Great Tribute - LPG Carrier * Guanabara * Hakaisan * Hakkusan * Isla de Bioko * Ivy Express * Kaimon 2 * Kasagisan * Kashimasan * Katsuragisan * Kirishima * Las Cuevas * Libra Trader * LPG/C Ayame - LPG Carrier * Maracas Bay * Mayaro * Millennium Explorer - Methanol Carrier * Mitake * Nariva * Noble Express * Noble Spirit - Methanol Carrier * Opal Express * Pacific Alliance * Pacific Partner * Pacific Voyager * Pigeon Point * Omega Trader * Oriental Jade * Perseus Trader * Phoenix Admiral * Phoenix Advance * Phoenix Vanguard * Phoenix Vigor * Pico Basile * Saamis Adventurer * San Fernando * Vemillion Express - Product Tanker * Yufusan * Yakumasan Container ships * MOL Abidjan * MOL Anchorage * MOL Advantage * MOL Bravery * MOL Celebration * MOL Comfort (Written Off - June 2013) * MOL Competence * MOL Contribution * MOL Cosmos * MOL Creation * MOL Dedication * MOL Delight * MOL Dignity * MOL Diamond * MOL Earnest * MOL Efficiency * MOL Eminence * MOL Endeavor * MOL Endurance * MOL Enterprise * MOL Gateway * MOL Grace * MOL Grandeur * MOL Maestro * MOL Magnificence * MOL Maneuver * MOL Marvel * MOL Matrix * MOL Mission * MOL Modern * MOL Prestige (Intermittently called MSC Prestige when she was under charter to MSC) * MOL Triumph Ships on order In 2015 MOL announced its intention to order six new container ships that will be capable of carrying 20,150 20-foot containers.

London‚Äôs wall and the Moorgate are clearly seen, and some of the administrative boundaries can also be discerned. Moorfields was an open space, partly in the City of London, lying adjacent to ‚Äì and outside ‚Äì its northern wall, near the eponymous Moorgate. It was known for its marshy conditions, the result of the defensive wall acting like a dam, impeding the flow of the River Walbrook and its tributaries.on the wall eventually becoming an inadvertent? dam to hold back the walbrook https://www.british- history.ac.uk/rchme/london/vol3/pp10-18 Moorfields gives its name to the Moorfields Eye Hospital which occupied a site on the former fields from 1822‚Äì1899, and is still based close by, in the St Luke's area of the London Borough of Islington.History from the hospital's own web page https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/content/our-history Setting Moorfields is first recorded in the late 12th century, though not by name, as a great fen. The fen was larger than the area subsequently known as Moorfields. Moorfields was contiguous with Finsbury Fields, Bunhill Fields and other open spaces, and until its eventual loss in the 19th century, was the innermost part of a green wedge of land which stretched from the wall, to the open countryside which lay close by. Moorfields separated the western and eastern growth of London beyond the city wall ‚Äì with the eastern extension being better known as the East End. The fields were divided into four areas; the Little Moorfields, Moorfields proper, Middle Moorfields and Upper Moorfields. =Great Fen= The origins of Moorfields lie in a wider area, described by William Fitzstephen as the \\"great fen which washed against the northern wall of the City\\".Recorded by William FitzStephen, writing in the 1170s, a discussion on the extent of the marsh is included in ‚Äúreclaiming the Marsh‚Äù by Pre-Construct Archaeology. This was authored by Johnathon Butler and others and sub-titled ‚ÄúArchaeological excavations at Moor House, City of London The marshy conditions appear to have been caused by London‚Äôs Wall acting as a dam, restricting the flow of the river.on the wall eventually becoming an inadvertent? dam to hold back the walbrook https://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/london/vol3/pp10-18 The fen covered much of the Manor of Finsbury, but its exact extent is not clear. It has been suggested that it extended west from the Walbrook which fed it, extending to the vicinity of Old Street in the north, and the road from Cripplegate in the west. Other commentators have suggested that the topography of the area means the marsh probably didn‚Äôt extend as far west due to higher ground there, but did extend further north and possibly, in places, further east.Discussed in ‚ÄúReclaiming the Marsh - Archaeological excavations at Moor House, City of London‚Äù by Pre-Construct Archaeology. The original suggestion had been made by Marjorie Honeybourne, with commentary and alternative views from the author of Chapter 5 =Little Moorfields and Moorfields Proper= The Little Moorfields and Moorfields proper (also known as Lower Moorfields) were just north of London's wall, and from 1676-1815 included the Bethlem Hospital. Little Moorfields was the element that was left lying just west of Moorgate Street after gap had been made in the wall to create the Moorgate, and the associated road from the north, in the 15th and 16th century. These parts were inside the City boundaries, lying in the Coleman Street Ward. It is thought that this open space was not included within the City‚Äôs administrative boundaries until the 17th century, prior to that being part of the Manor of Finsbury.The Ward did not extend beyond the wall at the time of John Stows survey of 1603 ‚Äì but it did by the time of Ogilby and Morgans map of 1676 The Walbrook, known at this point as Deepditch and running on the line of modern Blomfield Street, seems to have formed the eastern boundary of Moorfields proper. It also formed an administrative boundary,BHO source on the Moorfields area https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol8/pp88-90 with Coleman Street Ward to the west (including the open spaces of Little Moorfields and Moorfields proper); while on the East End side lay the urbanised extra-mural ward of Bishopsgate Without, and also the parish of Shoreditch. Moorfields proper and Little Moorfields formed the extra-mural part of Coleman Street Ward This section of the Walbrook, around Blomfield Street, was the focal point of the Walbrook Skulls; the result of the deposit of immense quantities of de-capitated Roman-era human skulls into the water.London's Hadrianic War? Dominic Perring These are still regularly uncovered during building work. =Middle and Upper Moorfields= Middle Moorfields and Upper Moorfields lay outside the City, to the north-west of Moorfields proper, in the Manor of Finsbury. The manor was coterminous with the parish of St Luke's (a late sub- division of the parish of St Giles-without-Cripplegate).Records of St Giles without Cripplegate, Chapter 6 see https://archive.org/stream/recordsstgilesc01dentgoog/recordsstgilesc01dentgoog_djvu.txt =Neighbouring areas= The Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch (which replaced the parish of Shoreditch, being based on the same boundaries), had an electoral ward named Moorfields, this was adjacent to the former Moorfields (and also the famous Moorfields Eye Hospital) with only a small part of the area ever having been part of Moorfields, and only at an early date. History An early name for Moorfields proper appears to have been Moor Mead.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol8/pp88-90 The Moor place-name element usually refers to fen environments,Concise Oxford Dictionary of Place Names, Eilert Ekwall, fourth edition. He doesn't refer to Moorfields, only the place name element. and the wet nature of the area persisted, though this was improved by a drainage scheme in 1572.The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert In the 15th century the monasteries of Charterhouse and St Bartholomews diverted the headwaters of the Walbrook to their sites in the River Fleet catchment. It has been suggestedStephen Myers, The River Walbrook and Roman London, 2016 that this caused a significant reduction in the flow of the river, causing Moorfields to become drier, and allowing the Mayor to construct the new Moorgate. Moorgate was built by upgrading a postern built in 1415, and enlarged in 1472 and 1511. The gate remained poorly connected as there was no direct approach road from the south until 1846, long after the gate and wall were demolished. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, refugees from the fire evacuated to Moorfields and set up temporary camps there. King Charles II of England encouraged the dispossessed to move on and leave London, but it is unknown how many newly impoverished and displaced persons instead settled in the Moorfields area. In the early 18th century, Moorfields was the site of sporadic open-air markets, shows, and vendors/auctions. Additionally, the homes near and within Moorfields were places of the poor, and the area had a reputation for harbouring highwaymen, as well as brothels. James Dalton and Jack Sheppard both retreated to Moorfields when in hiding from the law. Parts of the area were known as public cruising areas for gay men. A path in the Upper Moorfields, beside a wall that separated the Upper and Middle Moorfields was known as Sodomites Walk: the wall was removed in 1752 but the path remains as the south side of Finsbury Square.Homosexuality in 18th century England, Rictor Norton, http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/brown.htm In 1780 it was the site of some of the most violent rioting during the Gordon Riots. The district was once the site of The Foundery, a centre of Wesleyan Methodism. A fashionable carpet manufactory was established here by Thomas Moore (c. 1700‚Äì1788) in the mid- eighteenth century. Moore's carpet manufactory at Moore Place made a number of fine carpets commissioned by the architect and interior designer, Robert Adam, for the grand rooms he designed for his wealthy clients. Thomas Moore lived at his home on Chiswell Street until his death. His Moore Park factory remained in operation until 1793, when his daughter, Jane, and her husband, Joseph Foskett, sold the lease to another carpet manufacturer. Demise and legacy Much of Moorfields was developed in 1777, when Finsbury Square was developed; the remainder succumbed within the next few decades, notably when Moorfields proper was replaced by the modern Finsbury Circus in 1817. Finsbury Circus occupies the site of Moorfields proper, the Walbrook ran under what is now Blomfield Street, on its eastern side Today the name survives in the names of Moorfields Eye Hospital (since moved to another site); St Mary Moorfields; Moorfields the short street (on which stands the headquarters of the British Red Cross) parallel with Moorgate (and containing some entrances to Moorgate station); and Moorfields Highwalk, one of the pedestrian \\"streets\\" at high level in the Barbican Estate. Moorfields Highwalk is featured in the music video to Robbie Williams' song \\"No Regrets\\".

Nicholas Herkimer (also known as Nikolaus Herchheimer; c. 1728 ‚Äì August 16, 1777) was an American patriot militia brigadier general during the American Revolutionary War. He died of wounds after the Battle of Oriskany. Early life and career Herkimer was born in the vicinity of German Flats in the Mohawk Valley of the Colony of New York, and was the elder brother of Loyalist Captain Johan Jost Herkimer. Their parents were Catherine Petri and Johann Jost Herchheimer, a son of the Palatine German immigrant Georg Herchheimer or Hirchemer from Sandhausen in the parish of Leimen south of Heidelberg.Jones, Henry Z, Jr., The Palatine Families of New York 1710; Universal City, California. 1985, Vol. 1, p. 388-390. Nicholas was of slender build, with a dark complexion and black hair; he was not quite six feet tall. He could speak German, English and Mohawk. During the attack on German Flatts in the French and Indian War, he was involved in its defense. He was made a captain in the militia on January 5, 1758, and he repelled a second attack on German Flatts in April of that year. Herkimer built his new house in 1764 on the south shore of the Mohawk River, near the falls and the present-day city of Little Falls. He held a number of African slaves as workers on his estate.Falk, Cynthia G. \\"Forts, Rum, Slaves, and the Herkimer's Rise to Power in the Mohawk Valley,\\" New York History, 89 (Summer 2008), 221‚Äì34. Nicholas Herkimer joined the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, being initiated in the St. Patrick's Lodge, Johnstown, NY. American Revolution In July and August 1775 Herkimer headed the Tryon County Committee of Safety, and became colonel of the district militia. After the split in which Loyalist militia members from the area withdrew to Canada, he was commissioned a brigadier general in the Tryon County militia by the Provincial Congress on September 5, 1776. In June 1776, he led 380 men of the Tryon County militia to confront the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant at Unadilla, New York. Herkimer asked the Mohawk and five other Iroquois nations to remain neutral, while Brant said the Indians owed their loyalty to the King. When Herkimer learned of the siege of Fort Stanwix to the west in late July 1777, he ordered the Tryon County militia to assemble at Fort Dayton. He marched them out to Fort Stanwix, about 28 miles to the west. His force marching in column was ambushed on August 6 by a mixed force of British regulars, Tory militia, and Mohawk in the Battle of Oriskany. Herkimer's horse was shot, and he was seriously wounded in the leg. In spite of his injuries, he sat propped up against a tree, lit his pipe, and directed his men in the battle, rallying them to avoid two panicked retreats. When they withdrew, they carried him home. The brigade surgeon, William Petrie, dressed Herkimer's wound in the field and placed him on a litter. The wound quickly became infected, but the decision to amputate the leg was delayed for about ten days after the battle. The operation was performed by an inexperienced surgeon, Robert Johnson, because Petrie had also been wounded in the battle and was not available. The operation went poorly, the wound bled profusely, and Herkimer died of the injury on August 16, at around the age of 49. Legacy A bronze statue of Herkimer was erected in 1907 in Myers Park, Herkimer New York Herkimer's home, in what is now Little Falls, New York, is preserved as the Herkimer Home State Historic Site. Herkimer County, New York was named in his honor. His nephew, John Herkimer, later became a U.S. Congressman. In popular culture * Roger Imhof portrays Herkimer in the 1939 film Drums Along the Mohawk, directed by John Ford. It is based on the 1936 historical novel by Walter D.

Rosal√≠a with her family - 1884 (J. Palmeiro). Life Writing in Galician and Spanish, after the period known as the S√©culos Escuros (lit. Dark Centuries), she became an important figure of the Galician Romantic movement, known today as the Rexurdimento (\\"Renaissance\\"), along with Manuel Curros Enr√≠quez and Eduardo Pondal. Her poetry is marked by saudade, an almost ineffable combination of nostalgia, longing and melancholy. She married Manuel Murgu√≠a, a member of the important literary group known as the Royal Galician Academy, historian, journalist and editor of Rosal√≠a's books. The couple had seven children: Alexandra (1859‚Äì1937), Aura (1868‚Äì1942), twins Gala (1871‚Äì1964) and Ovidio (1871‚Äì1900), Amara (1873‚Äì1921), Adriano (1875‚Äì1876) and Valentina (stillborn, 1877). Only two of Rosal√≠a's children married, Aura in 1897 and Gala in 1922; neither they nor their siblings left any children, and thus, today there are no living descendants of Rosal√≠a de Castro and her husband. Their son Ovidio was a promising painter, his career cut short by early death. Rosal√≠a published her first collection of poetry in Galician, ' (\\"Galician Songs\\"), on 17 May 1863. This date, 17 May, is now known as the D√≠a das Letras Galegas (\\"Galician Literature Day\\"), and commemorates Rosal√≠a's achievement by dedicating, every year, this special day to a different writer, who must also write in the Galician language, since 1963. D√≠a das Letras Galegas is an official holiday in the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Relative poverty and sadness marked Rosal√≠a's life, in spite of this, she had a strong sense of commitment to the poor and to the defenseless. She was a strong opponent of authoritative abuse or abuse of authority and an ardent defender of women's rights. Rosal√≠a suffered from uterine cancer and died in Padr√≥n, province of A Coru√±a, Spain, on 15 July 1885. She is buried in the Pante√≥n de Galegos Ilustres, a pantheon (mausoleum) in the Convent of San Domingos de Bonaval in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Legacy Statue of Rosal√≠a de Castro at Padr√≥n. Rosal√≠a de Castro is today one of the unquestionable poets laureate of Galicia. Highly educated, expected to speak and write in Spanish and Galician she took the bold, unconventional step of writing her early poems in the Galician language. Her defiance earned her the contempt and spite of many that deemed Galician as a Spanish dialect fit \\"only for the illiterate and the churlish\\". However, Rosal√≠a's defiant gesture won her the love and admiration of the common folk, who spoke Galician at home or on a daily basis. Schools in Galicia,Rosalia de Castro School Association.

The name Rosal√≠a de Castro has been used by several institutions, public spaces and/or parks, and on consumer goods, thus showing the social influence and impact this poet has had on the region. Today, it is possible to find schools and universities named after the writer in the Spanish Autonomous Region of Galicia as well as other parts of Spain, Russia, Venezuela (Teatro Rosal√≠a de Castro) and Uruguay also have places that bear her name. Furthermore, there are numerous parks, plazas and streets, cultural associations, prizes granted to people that are intimately linked with the Galician and Spanish languages, libraries, folk groups, choirs, and even a wine with the name R√≠as Baixas. There is also a plane from the airline Iberia, as well as an aircraft belonging to the Maritime Safety and Rescue Society (Salvamento Mar√≠timo), have been given the name of Rosal√≠a de Castro. Moreover, there are a multitude of monuments, commemorative plaques and sculptures dedicated to her in many parts of the world. Monument to Rosal√≠a de Castro at Porto, Portugal. On 23 October 1979, the last of the 500 peseta bills was printed, being that in 1987, this bill was to be substituted by a coin of the same value. The bill had the portrait of Rosal√≠a de Castro displayed on the obverse side, created by Pablo Sampedro Moledo: on the reverse side were the House/Museum of Rosal√≠a located in Padr√≥n and a few handwritten verses from Rosal√≠a de Castro's work Follas Novas. With the printing of this bill, Rosal√≠a de Castro became, excepting Isabella I of Castile, the only non-allegorical female to be placed on the obverse side of a Spanish bill.

His brother William Woodfall later established the Daily, a paper that reported on parliamentary debates. from 21 January 1769 to 21 January 1772. The signature had been already used, apparently by him, in a letter of 21 November 1768. These and numerous other personal letters were not included in his Letters of Junius collection, published in 1772. Choice of \\"Junius\\" as a pseudonym The name may have been chosen because the same author had already signed Lucius and Brutus, and wished to exhaust the name of Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman patriot who led the overthrow of the Roman monarchy. Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Roman poet Juvenal, who was thought also to have had the nomen Junius. Some say that the author of the Junius letters had previously written under numerous other pseudonyms, and that he continued to do so, under different pseudonyms, after the 36-month period (January 1769 ‚Äì January 1772) in which the Junius letters were published. He may, for example, have written as Philo-Junius, a character who came to the rescue of Junius when it was clear that the public was misinterpreting his messages. There is weak evidence that he also wrote as Veteran, Nemesis and other anonymous correspondents published in the Public Advertiser. Objectives, goals and achievements There is a marked distinction between the main Letters of Junius, intended for the erudite public, and his miscellaneous letters. The latter deal with a variety of subjects, some of a purely personal nature, such as the alleged injustice of the Viscount Barrington, the secretary at war, to the officials of his department. The Letters of Junius had a definite objective: * to inform the public of their historical and constitutional rights and liberties as Englishmen; * to highlight where and how the government had infringed upon these rights. Foremost in his sights was the ministry of Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, a fellow Whig whom Junius viewed as particularly corrupt. Grafton's administration had been formed in October 1768, when William Pitt the Elder was compelled by ill health to retire from office, and was a reconstruction of his cabinet of July 1766. Junius fought for the return to power of Pitt, who had recovered and was not on good terms with his successors. Junius' private correspondence has been preserved, written in his usual disguised handwriting. He communicated with Pitt, with George Grenville, with Wilkes (all opponents of the Duke of Grafton), and also with Henry Sampson Woodfall, printer and part owner of the Public Advertiser. The letters are of interest on three grounds: * their political significance; * their style; and * the mystery which long surrounded their authorship. The matter of his letters is considered by some to be invective, though close inspection of his writings reveals a principled man ahead of his time, exposing blatant corruption by the only means available (anonymity) in a country struggling with the idea of freedom of speech. He began with a general attack on the ministry for their personal immorality. An ill-judged defence of John Manners, Marquess of Granby, the popular Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, by Sir William Draper gave Junius an easy victory over a vulnerable opponent with weak arguments. It was in this short tussle that Junius' style and wit first developed a reputation and public audience. Junius then realised the potential he had to influence public opinion. Confidently, Junius then went on to expose the problems at their cause‚Äîthe ministries of Grafton, Lord North (Grafton's cousin) and the Duke of Bedford. The core of Junius' arguments were the arbitrary appointments made by Grafton, presumably to stay in favour with the Duke of Bedford and his party (also known as the Bedfordites or Bloomsbury Gang). Most notable was Col. Henry Lawes Luttrell (later 2nd Earl Carhampton), whom Grafton appointed MP for Middlesex (instead of the duly elected Wilkes), and Richard Rigby, whom Grafton made Paymaster of the Forces. Junius ended with an assault on Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, who Junius argued had set dangerous legal precedents regarding press freedom and political libel from the Wilkes affair. Junius was highly disappointed not to have influenced King George III in his 19 December 1769 letter. He tried to encourage the King to overcome his resentments towards the petty Wilkes and also to relinquish his trust in corrupt officials. Junius was not a radical anti-royal Whig, as many texts suggest, though he did trouble himself with explaining to the public the real constitutional role of the royal prerogative, and (if engaged correctly) how it benefited the country. Contrary to some opinions, the practical effect of the letters was highly significant‚Äîthey made Grafton unpopular enough to end his ministry in January 1770. Junius could only have been disappointed by Grafton's replacement, Lord North. Junius confessed himself beaten in his private letter to Woodfall of 19 January 1773 for not having achieved his goals. Despite this, Junius' letters were noticed and talked about for generations afterwards and spread throughout Europe in many languages. His concepts on democratic elections, freedom of the press, legal history and the constitutional rights of individuals are now common-place. Few in history have influenced so many and sparked an interest in such real concepts of liberty. Style Latin literature (such as the satires of Juvenal, and the speeches of Cicero against Verres and Catiline) was not only studied but imitated at that time, and supplied the inspiration for numerous writings. If Junius was doing what others did, he did it better than anybody else, a fact which sufficiently explains his rapid popularity. His superiority lay in his style. Here also he was by no means original, and he was uneven. There are passages in his writings which can be best described in the words which Burke applied to another writer: \\"A mere mixture of vinegar and water, at once vapid and sour\\". But at his best Junius attains to a high degree of artificial elegance and vigour. He shows the influence of Bolingbroke, of Swift, and above all of Tacitus, who appears to have been his favourite author. The imitation is never slavish. Junius adapts, and does not only repeat. No single sentence will show the quality of a style which produces its effect by persistence and repetition, but a typical passage as follows displays at once the method and the spirit. It is taken from Letter XLIX to the duke of Grafton, 22 June 1771: > \\"The profound respect I bear to the gracious prince who governs this country > with no less honour to himself than satisfaction to his subjects, and who > restores you to your rank under his standard, will save you from a multitude > of reproaches. The attention I should have paid to your failings is > involuntarily attracted to the hand which rewards them; and though I am not > so partial to the royal judgment as to affirm that the favor of a king can > remove mountains of infamy, it serves to lessen at least, for undoubtedly it > divides, the burden. While I remember how much is due to his sacred > character, I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the > meanest and the basest fellow in the kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do not > think you so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which > you have hitherto so happily directed your ambition, as long as there is one > man living who thinks you worthy of his confidence, and fit to be trusted > with any share in his government.... With any other prince, the shameful > desertion of him in the midst of that distress, which you alone had created, > in the very crisis of danger, when he fancied he saw the throne already > surrounded by men of virtue and abilities, would have outweighed the memory > of your former services. But his majesty is full of justice, and understands > the doctrine of compensations; he remembers with gratitude how soon you had > accommodated your morals to the necessities of his service, how cheerfully > you had abandoned the engagements of private friendship, and renounced the > most solemn professions to the public. The sacrifice of Lord Chatham was not > lost on him. Even the cowardice and perfidy of deserting him may have done > you no disservice in his esteem. The instance was painful, but the principle > might please.\\" What seems artificial and stilted in this style did not offend the would-be classic taste of the eighteenth century and no longer conceals a venomous hate and scorn that the laboriously arranged words and artfully counterbalanced clauses convey. Readership The pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for the rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by Burke and Johnson. Before 1772 there appeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters, made by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection titled Junius: Stat nominis umbra, with a dedication to the English people and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick succession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by Robert Heron. In 1806 another appeared with notes by John Almon. The first new edition of real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It contained the correspondence of Junius with Henry Sampson Woodfall, a selection of the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his handwriting, and notes by John Mason Good. Curiosity as to the mystery of the authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the writings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he secured by concealment. \\"The mystery of Junius increases his importance\\" is his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated 18 September 1771. Woodfall felt assured that > when kings and ministers are forgotten, when the force and direction of > personal satire is no longer understood, and when measures are only felt in > their remotest consequences; this book will, I believe, be found to contain > principles worthy to be transmitted to posterity. Identity of Junius The identity of Junius is open to question and debate, and may never be finally resolved unless documents are found which establish his identity. Some scholars support the identification of Philip Francis. The 1st Marquess of Lansdowne claimed to know the 'Junius secret' a fortnight before his death, but died without revealing what he thought he knew. More recent use of Junius Samuel Saenger, political editor of the Fischer publishing house's journal Neue Rundschau from 1908 to 1934, signed several of his articles as 'Junius'. Most of these were political chronicles that presented a critical left-liberal perspective on German politics. Many of these texts were titled 'Aus Junius' Tagebuch' - 'From Junius' Diary'. Rosa Luxemburg published the Junius Pamphlet in Switzerland in April 1916, and it was secretly distributed in Germany. The text, also known as The crisis in German Social Democracy, had been started in prison in February 1915. It was adopted as the founding policy statement of the International Group, better known as the Spartacus League, which became one element of the Communist Party of Germany in January 1919. The pseudonym was used as well by the great Italian economist Luigi Einaudi, who expressed his liberal beliefs in two series of letters signed 'Junius': the former published in 1920, the latter in 1944, while he was living as a refugee in Switzerland. Robert Goddard's 2005 suspense novel Sight Unseen is set in the present day; however, the identity of Junius is a major theme in the novel. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail has carried the following legend on its editorial or front page for many years: \\"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. Junius\\". A Boston, Massachusetts, indie-rock band has been performing and recording under the name Junius since around 2003. In the third season of the HBO series \\"True Detective,\\" Junius is a central figure to the cover-up and mystery. The character had been identified earlier as \\"Mr. June.\\" See also * Letters of Junius * Identity of Junius Notes References * *Elleg√•rd, Alvar: Who was Junius?

He was born and lived in London. Biography British Liberties, or the Free-born Subject's Inheritance, an anonymous 1766 book published by Woodfall and William Strahan, \\"Law-Printers to the King's Most Excellent Majesty\\" Woodfall's grandfather Henry Woodfall (c. 1686‚Äì1747), was the author of the ballad Darby and Joan, for which John Darby and his wife were the originals: the elder Woodfall had been apprenticed in 1701 to Darby, a printer in Bartholomew Close in the Little Britain area of London, who died in 1730. Woodfall's grandfather printed many of the works of Alexander Pope. Woodfall's uncle George was a bookseller in Charing Cross. His father, Henry Woodfall (1713‚Äì1769), was the printer of the newspaper the Public Advertiser, and Woodfall was apprenticed to his father. At the age of nineteen, Woodfall took over the control of the newspaper. In it appeared, between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772, the famous letters of Junius. In December 1769 Woodfall published a \\"Letter to the King\\" by Junius that brought legal charges against Woodfall and five others for seditious libel; Woodfall's case went before a jury in June 1770 but a verdict of mistrial was handed down by Lord Mansfield in November 1770. Woodfall sold his interest in the Public Advertiser in 1793. His son George Woodfall (1767‚Äì1844) was also in the family printing business. Woodfall's younger brother, William Woodfall (1746‚Äì1803), a journalist, established in 1789 a daily paper called the Diary, or Woodfall's Register, in which, for the first time, reports of parliamentary debates were published on the morning after they had taken place. William Woodfall's nickname was \\"Memory\\" Woodfall based on his ability to memorize Parliamentary speeches at a time when journalists were not allowed to take notes or write down speeches while they were being delivered.

The chain has over 1,000 locations in 23 countries throughout North and South America, Asia, and Australia. It was founded in March 1988 with its first location in Tampa by Bob Basham, Chris T. Sullivan, Trudy Cooper, and Tim Gannon. It was owned and operated in the United States by OSI Restaurant Partners until it was acquired by Bloomin' Brands, and by other franchise and venture agreements internationally. Canadian Outback Steakhouse restaurants began in 1996. In March 2009, Outback Steakhouse Canada abruptly closed all nine locations in the province of Ontario, citing poor economic conditions, but in June 2009, Outback Steakhouse opened a location in Niagara Falls, Ontario. A second location in Niagara Falls has been opened, but these are the only Outback Steakhouse locations operating in Canada. On June 14, 2007, OSI Restaurant Partners completed a stock repurchase plan, and the company became privately held. In April 2012, Bloomin' Brands, the current owner of Outback Steakhouse, filed with the SEC to raise up to $300 million in an initial public offering. Bloomin' Brands, Inc. became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \\"BLMN.\\" Menu Restaurant at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, California in September 2007. This was relocated to the outdoor wing in 2018 and was redeveloped into Marshalls. =Bloomin' Onion= The Bloomin' Onion is a signature Outback item. It is a one-pound onion cut to 'bloom' open, breaded, deep-fried and served with mayonnaise-horseradish sauce. Other restaurants offer items similar to the Bloomin' Onion, as in Chili's Awesome Blossom (discontinued) and Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon's Texas Rose. Many of the Bloomin' Onions have come under fire for high-calorie counts, sometimes going over 1,500 calories. =Other menu items= Outback also features a variety of steaks, seafood, and other American chain restaurant menu items from burgers to salads. While 'Outback Australian' cuisine is not especially well-defined, ordinary Australian foods that are well-defined are not represented in Outback Steakhouse's menu and the chain can be considered to use the 'Australian' moniker for marketing purposes only, without any real attempt to reflect Australian cuisine, despite its visual merchandising's attempts to do otherwise. Involvements =Community= Outback Steakhouse has a program to support the communities in which its restaurants are located. They have also joined GroupRaise, a platform where non-profits can book restaurant fundraisers in their locations.https://www.groupraise.com/outback On a national level, Outback partners with Heineken USA and their Heineken with a Heart program to raise funds for various organizations in these communities. =Political= The company and its founders are major contributors, via the Outback Steakhouse PAC, to the Republican Party, contributing $303,015 and $334,197 for the 2000 and 2004 election cycles, respectively.

Works He wrote in his sixteenth year a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, which was prefixed by Henry Pemberton to his View of Newton's Philosophy, published in 1728. In 1737, he published an epic poem in praise of liberty, Leonidas, which was thought to have a special reference to the politics of the time; commended by the prince of Wales and his court, it soon passed through several editions. In 1739, Glover published a poem entitled London, or the Progress of Commerce; and in 1740 he published a ballad, Admiral Hosier's Ghost, popular in its day. The ballad's real target was not the Spanish but Sir Robert Walpole. He was also the author of two tragedies, Boadicea (1753) and Medea (1761), written in close imitation of Greek models. The Athenaid, an epic in thirty books, was published in 1787, and his diary, entitled Memoirs of a distinguished literary and political Character from 1742 to 1757, appeared in 1813. In May 1774, shortly after the death of Oliver Goldsmith, Glover published his \\"Authentic Anecdotes\\" on the poet in The Universal Magazine. Edmund Burke included the piece in The Annual Register for that year, and when Edmond Malone in 1776 worked on a biographical memoir for Poems and Plays by Oliver Goldsmith (1777) he based it on Glover's Anecdotes as well as first-hand information from Dr. Thomas Wilson, Senior Fellow at Trinity College, Dublin.

The design was initially conceived by Bevin McKinney, who shared it with Gary Hudson. In 1996, Rotary Rocket Company was formed to commercialize the concept. The Roton was intended to reduce costs of launching payloads into low earth orbit by a factor of ten. The company gathered considerable venture capital from angel investors and opened a factory headquartered in a facility at Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California. The fuselage for their vehicles was made by Scaled Composites, at the same airport, while the company developed the novel engine design and helicopter-like landing system. A full-scale test vehicle made three hover flights in 1999, but the company exhausted its funds and closed its doors in early 2001.  The venture's origins  Bevin McKinney had been thinking about the idea of a launch vehicle using helicopter blades for several years, when Wired magazine asked Gary Hudson to write an article on the concept.Wired - Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane? The resulting article resulted in a commitment of funding from billionaire Walt Anderson, which was combined with an initial investment from author Tom Clancy and allowed the company to get started. Hudson and McKinney were joined by co-founders Frederick Giarrusso, Dan DeLong, James Grote, Tom Brosz, and Anne Hudson, who together launched the company in October 1996.  Rotary Rocket design evolution  = Helicopter to orbit = Gary Hudson's and Bevin McKinney's initial concept was to merge a launch vehicle with a helicopter: spinning rotor blades, powered by tip jets, would lift the vehicle in the earliest stage of launch. Once the air density thinned to the point that helicopter flight was impractical, the vehicle would continue its ascent on pure rocket power, with the rotor acting as a giant turbopump.Wired - Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane? Calculations showed that the helicopter blades modestly increased the effective specific impulse (Isp) by approximately 20‚Äì30 seconds, essentially only carrying the blades into orbit \\"for free\\". Thus, there was no overall gain from this method during ascent. However, the blades could be used to soft land the vehicle, so its landing system carried no additional cost. One problem found during research at Rotary was that once the vehicle left the atmosphere additional thrust would be necessary. Thus multiple engines would be needed at the base as well as at the rotor tips. This initial version of the Roton had been designed with the small communications satellite market in mind. However, this market crashed, signaled by the failure of Iridium Communications. Consequently, the Roton concept needed to be redesigned for heavier payloads. = Helicopter from orbit = The revised and redesigned Roton concept was a cone-shaped launch vehicle, with a helicopter rotor on top for use only during landing. An internal cargo bay could be used both for carrying payloads to orbit and bringing others back to Earth. The projected price to orbit of this design was given as $1,000 per kg of payload, less than one-tenth of the then-current launch price. Payload capacity was limited to a relatively modest . The revised version would have used a unique rotating annular aerospike engine: the engine and base of the launch vehicle would spin at high speed (720 rpm) to pump fuel and oxidizer to the rim by the rotation. Unlike the landing rotor, due to the shallow angle of the nozzles in the base rotor, the rotation speed self limited and required no control system. Since the density of the LOX (liquid oxygen) was higher than that of the kerosene, extra pressure was available with the LOX, so it would have been used to cool the engine's throat and other components, rather than using the kerosene as the coolant as in a conventional LOX/kerosene rocket. However, at the high G levels at the outer edge of the rotating engine block, clarity on how LOX would work as a coolant was both unknown and difficult to validate. That added one layer of risk. In addition, the rotating exhaust acted as a wall at the outer edge of the engine base, lowering the temperature of the base to below ambient due to ejector pump effect and creating a suction cup at the bottom in atmosphere. This could be alleviated using makeup gas to develop base pressure, requiring an additional rocket engine to fill up the base of the main rocket engine. (Similar problems would have occurred in a conventional aerospike engine, but there, natural recirculation plus use of the turbopump gas-generator's exhaust as the makeup gas would have largely alleviated the problem \\"for free.\\") At the rim, 96 miniature jets would exhaust the burning propellants (LOX and kerosene) around the rim of the base of the vehicle, which gained the vehicle extra thrust at high altitude ‚Äì acting as a zero-length truncated aerospike nozzle.United States Patent 5842665 A similar system with non-rotating engines was studied for the N1 rocket. That application had a much smaller base area, and did not create the suction effect a larger peripheral engine induces. The Roton engine had a projected vacuum ISP (specific impulse) of ~, which is very high for a LOX/kerosene engine ‚Äìand a thrust to weight ratio of 150, which is extremely light.Anselmo, Joseph C., \\"Rotarians.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, October 5, 1998, p. 17. During reentry, the base also served as a water-cooled heatshield. This was theoretically a good way to survive reentry, particularly for a lightweight reusable vehicle. However, using water as a coolant would require converting it into superheated steam, at high temperatures and pressures, and there were concerns about micrometeorite damage on orbit puncturing the pressure vessel, causing the reentry shield to fail. These concerns were resolved using a failure-resistant massively redundant flow system, created using thin metal sheets chemically etched with a pattern of micropores forming a channel system that was robust against failure and damage. In addition, cooling was achieved two different ways; one way was the vaporization of the water, but the second was even more significant, and was due to the creation of a layer of \\"cool\\" steam surrounding the base surface, reducing the ability to heat. Further, the water metering system would have to be extremely reliable, giving one drop per second per square inch, and was achieved via a trial/error design approach on real hardware. By the end of the Roton program, some hardware had been built and tested. The reentry trajectory was to be trimmed, similar to the Soyuz, to minimize the G loads on the passengers. And the ballistic coefficient was better for the Roton and could be better tailored. When the Soyuz trim system failed and it went full ballistic, the G levels did rise significantly but without incident to the passengers. The vehicle was also unique in planning to use its helicopter-style rotors for landing, rather than wings or parachutes. This concept allowed controlled landings (unlike parachutes), and it was 1/5 the weight of fixed wings. Another advantage was that a helicopter could land almost anywhere, whereas winged spaceplanes such as the Space Shuttle had to make it back to the runway. The rotor blades were to be powered by peroxide tip rockets. The rotor blades were to be deployed before reentry; some questions were raised about whether the blades would survive until landing. The initial plan was to have them almost vertical, but that was found to be unstable as they needed to drop lower and lower and spin faster for stability, the heating rates went up dramatically and the air flow became more head on. The implication of that was that the blades went from a lightly heated piece of hardware to one that either had to be actively cooled or made of SiC or other refractory material. The idea of popping out the blades became much more attractive at this point, and initial studies were made for that option. This rotor design concept was not without precedent. In 1955, one of five Soviet designs for planned suborbital piloted missions was to include rocket-tipped rotors as its landing system. On May 1, 1958 these plans were dropped as a decision was made to proceed directly to orbital flights. Rotary Rocket designed and pressure-tested an exceptionally lightweight but strong composite LOX tank. It survived a test program which involved it being pressure cycled and ultimately deliberately shot to test its ignition sensitivity. = A new engine = In June 1999, Rotary Rocket announced that it would use a derivative of the Fastrac engine under development at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, instead of the company's own unconventional spinning engine design. Reportedly, the company had been unable to convince investors that its engine design was viable; the composite structure and gyrocopter reentry was an easier sell. At the same time as this change, the company laid off about a third of its employees, lowering approximate headcount from 60 to 40. At this point, the company planned to begin its commercial launch service sometime in 2001.Dornheim, Michael A., \\"Rotary Cuts Staff, Changes Engine.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, June 28, 1999, p. 44. Although the company had raised $30 million, it still needed to raise an additional $120 million before entering service.  The Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV)  The ATV's cockpit was nicknamed the 'Batcave' by its pilots because of its restricted field of view. A full size, 63 ft (19 m) tall, Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) was built under contract by Scaled Composites for use in hover test flights. The $2.8 million ATV was not intended as an all-up test article, since it had no rocket engine and no heat shielding. The ATV was rolled out of its Mojave hangar on March 1, 1999, bearing an FAA registry of N990RR. The rotor head was salvaged from a crashed Sikorsky S-58, at a price of $50,000 ‚Äìas opposed to as much as $1 million for a new head. Each rotor was powered by a 350-lbf (1,560 N) hydrogen peroxide jet, as intended for the orbital vehicle.Dornheim, Michael A., \\"Roton Test Craft Rolled Out.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 8, 1999, p. 40. The rotor assemblage was tested in a rock quarry before installation on the ATV. The ATV flew three successful test flights in 1999. The pilot for these three flights was Marti Sarigul-Klijn and the copilot was Brian Binnie (who later gained fame as pilot of Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne on its second X-Prize flight). The ATV made its first flight on July 28. This flight consisted of three vertical hops totaling 4 min 40 sec in duration and reaching a maximum altitude of 8 ft (2.4 m). The pilots found the flying extremely challenging for a number of reasons. Visibility in the cockpit was so restricted that the pilots nicknamed it the Batcave. The view of the ground was entirely obstructed, so the pilots had to rely on a sonar altimeter to judge ground proximity. The entire craft had a low rotational inertia, and torque from the spinning rotor blades made the body spin, unless counteracted by yaw thrust in the opposite direction.Dornheim, Michael A., \\"Roton Hops Off Ground.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, August 12, 1999, p. 36. The second flight, on September 16, was a continuous hover flight lasting 2 min 30 sec, reaching a maximum altitude of 20 ft (6.1 m). The sustained flight was made possible by the installation of more powerful rotor tip thrusters and an autothrottle.Smith, Bruce A., \\"Roton Test.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, October 11, 1999, p. 21. The third and last flight was made on October 12. The ATV flew down the flightline at Mojave Air and Space Port, covering 4,300 ft (1,310 m) in its flight and rising to a maximum altitude of 75 ft (23 m). The speed was as high as 53 mph (85 km/h). This test revealed some instability in translational flight. A fourth test was planned to simulate a full autorotative descent. The ATV would climb to an altitude 10,000 ft (3,050 m) under its own power, before throttling back and returning for a soft landing.\\"Roton Achieves Forward Flight.\\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, October 25, 1999, p. 40. At this point, given that further funding was then unlikely, safety considerations prevented the test being attempted.  Criticism of the design  Rotary Rocket failed due to lack of funding, but some have suggested that the design itself was inherently flawed. The Rotary Rocket did fly three test flights and a composite propellant tank survived a full test program, however these tests revealed problems. For instance, the ATV demonstrated that landing the Rotary Rocket was tricky, even dangerous. Test pilots have a rating system, the Cooper-Harper rating scale, for vehicles between 1 and 10 that relates to difficulty to pilot. The Roton ATV scored a 10 ‚Äî the vehicle simulator was found to be almost unflyable by anyone except the Rotary test pilots, and even then there were short periods where the vehicle was out of control. Other aspects of the flight plan remained unproven and it is unknown whether Roton could have developed sufficient performance to reach orbit with a single stage, and return ‚Äì although on paper this might have been possible.  The venture's last days  The Rotary Rocket Hangars at Mojave Air and Space Port, as seen in 2005. The taller hangar on the left was the Rotary Rocket Assembly Building. Engine development ceased in 2000, reportedly two weeks before a full-scale test was due. The vehicle failed to secure launch contracts and Rotary Rocket closed its doors in 2001. The timing of the venture was unfortunate: the Iridium Communications venture was nearing bankruptcy, and the space industry in general was experiencing financial stress. Ultimately, the company did not attract sufficient funding ‚Äì even though numerous individuals provided a total of $33 million of support, including writer Tom Clancy.Rotary Rocket Unveils New RLV Design Major Investor Tom Clancy Becomes a Director Some of the engineers that worked there have since set up other rocketry ventures, notably XCOR Aerospace, t/Space and Space Launch. The Atmospheric Test Vehicle was to be displayed at Classic Rotors Museum, a helicopter museum near San Diego, California, but an attempt to move it there on May 9, 2003 via a short-line sling-load under an Army Reserve CH-47 Chinook failed when the Roton began to oscillate at airspeeds above . Instead, the Mojave Airport administration worked to keep this historic vehicle at Mojave, and on November 10, 2006, the Roton was moved to its permanent display location at the intersection of Airport Blvd and Sabovich Road. To many, the Roton represents the program that launched Mojave into the Space Age, and this theme was echoed during the dedication ceremony that took place during the Veterans' Day celebration on November 11, at which Brian Binnie was the keynote speaker. The Rotary Rocket hangars are now occupied by the National Test Pilot School. = Roton C-9 specifications =  See also * Hiller Hornet, a helicopter with ramjets mounted on the rotor blade tips.

The party seated 66 MPs in the 2009 Albanian parliament (out of a total of 140). It achieved power in 1997 following a political crisis and governmental realignment. At the 2001 parliamentary election the party secured 73 seats, which enabled it to form a government. At the general election of 3 July 2005, the Socialist Party lost its majority and the Democratic Party of Albania (PD) formed the new government, having secured, with its allies, a majority of 81 seats. The Socialist Party of Albania is an associate of the Party of European Socialists (PES) and a member of the Socialist International. The official party newspaper is Z√´ri i Popullit, which had been the organ of its predecessor, the Communist Party of Labour of Albania. History Socialist Party Headquarters in Tirana The party, formed in November 1941, has been known as the Socialist Party since 1991, when it survived in the wake of the dramatic changes that had taken place in Albania since 1989. The Communist Party of Labour of Albania (PPSh), the only ruling party since the end of World War II, was the most rigid Stalinist party in Europe under its founder and longtime leader, Enver Hoxha. However, Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, was forced to introduce limited reforms in the late 1980s. Finally, on 11 December 1990, Alia announced that the PPSh had given up its monopoly of power. The PPSh won the Constitutional Assembly elections of March 1991‚Äîthe first free elections held in the country in almost 80 years. By this time, however, it was no longer a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party. At an extraordinary congress on 10‚Äì13 June 1991, in its efforts to survive in the new system, the PPSh voted to change its name to PS.Elsie, pxliii Old party logo Fatos Nano, a man from the intelligentsia, was elected the new chairman.Nano, Rexhina. \\"Te jetosh kohen\\", pp. 230.

He was governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1757 to 1760, and afterwards sat in the House of Commons from 1767 to 1780. He travelled widely in the North American colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War, opposed Parliamentary attempts to tax the colonies, and was a minority advocate of colonial positions until the Revolution. Classically educated and well-connected to the colonial administration in London, Pownall first travelled to North America in 1753, and spent two years exploring the colonies before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 1755. He became governor of Massachusetts in 1757 after helping engineer the recall of longtime Governor William Shirley. His administration was dominated by the French and Indian War (called the \\"Seven Years War\\" in England) in which Pownall was instrumental in raising Massachusetts provincial militia for the war effort. He opposed military interference in colonial administration, including attempts to quarter British troops in private homes, and had a generally positive relationship with the colonial assembly. Returning to England in 1760, he continued to be interested in colonial affairs, publishing widely read materials on conditions in the colonies, including several editions of The Administration of the Colonies. As a Member of Parliament he regularly advocated for colonial positions without much success, but supported the war effort once the Revolutionary War began. In the early 19th century he became an early advocate of the reduction or removal of trade barriers, and the establishment of a solid relationship between Britain and the United States. Several writers have proposed that Pownall was Junius, a pseudonymous writer of letters critical of British governmental practices. John Adams wrote, \\"Pownall was the most constitutional and national Governor, in my opinion, who ever represented the crown in this province.\\"Adams, p. 243 Early life Thomas Pownall was the eldest son of William and Sarah (Burniston) Pownall, daughter of John Burniston. His father was a country gentleman and soldier whose poor health and early death in 1735 caused the family to fall upon hard times.Schutz, pp. 18‚Äì19 Baptised 4 September 1722 (New Style) in Lincoln, England, Thomas was educated at Lincoln Grammar School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1743. His education exposed him to classic and current philosophers, and the sciences. His first publication, a treatise on the origins of government published in 1752, began as notes developed at Cambridge.Schutz, pp. 26‚Äì28 During his years at Cambridge, his younger brother John acquired a job at the Board of Trade, which oversaw British colonial affairs, and rapidly rose in the bureaucracy. The brothers were influential supporters of each other in their efforts to advance.Schutz, p. 20 John secured a job for Thomas in the colonial office, where he was exposed to the possibilities for advancement and influence in colonial postings.Schutz, pp. 21‚Äì22 In 1753 he went to America as private secretary to Sir Danvers Osborne, just appointed governor of New York. Osborne committed suicide several days after reaching New York, leaving Pownall without a job and a sponsor.Pownall, pp. 5, 41‚Äì42 Pownall chose to remain in America, devoting himself to studying the condition of the American colonies. In the following months he travelled widely, from Maryland to Massachusetts. He was introduced into the highest circles of leadership and society in the colonies, and established relationships with a number of influential people, including Benjamin Franklin and Massachusetts Governor William Shirley.Schutz, pp. 34‚Äì35 The Evans-Pownall map of 1755 Governor Osborne had been instructed particularly to deal with the rising discontent among the six Iroquois nations whose territory abutted New York (and is encompassed by central and western Upstate New York and part of Pennsylvania). Pownall had studied the matter, and he was consequently invited by his Pennsylvania connections to attend the 1754 Albany Congress as an observer.Schutz, pp. 37‚Äì38 His observations on the nature of colonial dealings with the Indians (including political infighting for control of the Indian trade, and the corrupt and fraudulent acquisition of Indian lands) led him to draft a number of proposals related to colonial administration. He proposed the establishment of a crown-appointed superintendent of Indian affairs, specifically William Johnson, New York's commissioner for Indian affairs who was highly influential with the Iroquois nations.Rogers, p. 24 He also articulated visions for managing the expansion of the colonies to the west.Schutz, pp. 41‚Äì48 After the conference Pownall returned to Philadelphia. In this time he apparently deepened a close friendship with Franklin, with whom he began to invest in business ventures.Schutz, pp. 43‚Äì44 Franklin, who had unsuccessfully proposed colonial union at the Albany conference, may have contributed to Pownall's writings, although the exact nature of his influence is unclear.Schutz, p. 49 While in Philadelphia Pownall also established a close collaboration with cartographer Lewis Evans, both of whom recognized the need for accurate maps of the inland regions of North America then being disputed with New France in the French and Indian War.Schutz, p. 51 The map Evans published in 1755 was dedicated to Pownall, and brought the latter wide publicity.Schutz, p. 53 Pownall's recommendation of William Johnson as superintendent of Indian affairs was implemented by the crown in 1755.Rogers, p. 25 Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey William Shirley was unseated as Massachusetts governor in part by Pownall's actions. Pownall had been living at his own expense, in the hopes that a posting would eventually come his way. In May 1755 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, with little responsibility beyond anticipating the death of the aging governor, Jonathan Belcher,Schutz, p. 55 and attending military conferences concerning the ongoing war. Belcher, however, proved to be longer lived than expected (he died in 1757), and Pownall was restless.Schutz, p. 58 The military conferences drew him into an ongoing power struggle between Johnson and Shirley (who rose to become military commander-in-chief upon the death of General Edward Braddock in July 1755) over the management of Indian affairs. Johnson capitalized on Pownall's concern over frontier security to draw him into his camp.Schutz, p. 60 Pownall already harboured some dislike of Shirley over an earlier snub, and his reports to New York Governor Sir Charles Hardy, combined with damaging allegations provided by other Johnson supporters, led to Shirley's dismissal as commander-in-chief.Schutz, pp. 60‚Äì67 Pownall returned to England in early 1756, where he confirmed the Johnson allegations, and was rewarded with a post as \\"Secretary Extraordinary\\" (a title of Pownall's creation) to the new commander-in-chief, Lord Loudoun.Schutz, pp. 68‚Äì69 While Pownall was in England, Shirley's reputation was further damaged by allegations (not apparently furthered by Pownall's action) that he had let military information fall into enemy hands, and the Board of Trade decided to recall him.Schutz, pp. 69‚Äì70 Pownall was also offered the governorship of Pennsylvania by its proprietors; however, his demands for wide-ranging powers in the post led them to retract the offer. Pownall turned this to his own advantage, widely publicizing the fact that he had turned down the offer because of the \\"unreasonable, unenlightened attitude of the proprietors.\\"Schutz, p. 71 Pownall's drawing of the Passaic River's Great Falls He accompanied Loudoun back to America in July 1756, but again returned to England to represent Loudoun in hearings on Shirley's military leadership.Schutz, pp. 74‚Äì78 Loudoun also instructed him on his military plans and objectives.Schutz, p. 78 In London he became closely involved in informing members of the new Pitt-Newcastle Ministry of the state of affairs in North America. His performance in these matters resulted in his appointment as governor of Massachusetts in March 1757.Schutz, pp. 78‚Äì83 Although he was admired for his competence in colonial affairs, he was also criticised for his vanity and temper, as well as his role in bringing about Shirley's fall.Schutz, p. 84 Governor of Massachusetts Bay Pownall arrived in Boston in early August. He was well received, and assumed his duties on 3 August.Schutz, pp. 85‚Äì87 He was immediately thrust into a war-related crisis: a French force was reported to be moving toward Fort William Henry in northern New York, and the military commander there had made an urgent call for militia. Pownall was energetic in organizing the militia, but the call to arms came too late: Fort William Henry fell after a brief siege that was followed by some of the worst Indian atrocities of the war.Schutz, pp. 89‚Äì96 Pownall had a sometimes contentious relationship with John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun In September 1757 Pownall travelled to New Jersey to attend the funeral of Governor Jonathan Belcher, and stopped in New York to meet with Loudoun. The commander-in-chief was upset that the Massachusetts General Court had not fully implemented a variety of demands he had made, and he held Pownall responsible. Pownall objected to the interference of the military in civilian affairs, the threat of which Loudoun used to implement his agenda, maintaining that it was necessary for the governor to lead, not drive, the provincial assembly.Schutz, pp. 105‚Äì108 The meeting was acrimonious, and Loudoun afterward wrote a letter to London harshly criticising Pownall's position, calling his ideas on governance \\"high-handed\\".Schutz, pp. 109‚Äì110 Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court (the provincial assembly) to a demand that British troops be billeted with civilians in Boston, and threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force.Schutz, p. 115 Pownall requested that the General Court accede in some way to Loudoun's demands, eventually signing a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces. This bill was unpopular, and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies.Rogers, pp. 86‚Äì87 Pownall's exchanges with Loudoun, however, show that he was keenly aware of the colonists' position: \\"the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects ... the enjoyment of these rights ... will animate and encourage them to resist ... a cruel, invading enemy\\".Schutz, p. 116 He was equally clear on the relationship between the royal governor and his assembly: \\"a governor must endeavour to lead those people for he cannot drive them and must lead them step by step as he can gett [sic] footing.\\"Schutz, pp. 116‚Äì117 He was so committed to these ideas that he offered to resign; however Loudoun encouraged him to remain in the post.Schutz, p. 117 Pownall would later author portions of the 1765 Quartering Act, a Parliamentary bill whose implementation was widely resisted in the colonies.Rogers, p. 88 In January 1758 Pownall wrote several letters to William Pitt, outlining the difficult issues surrounding relations between the colonial government and both the military and civil administrations of the British establishment.Schutz, pp. 118‚Äì119 He specifically recommended that London offer to pay more of the colonial expenses of the war; the implementation of this idea led to significantly increased militia recruitment in the remaining years of the war, including 7,000 men from Massachusetts for the 1758 campaign.Schutz, p. 128 Pownall was able to move a bill through the General Court implementing reforms of the militia system. The bill did not include all of the changes Pownall sought in order to achieve a more flexible and less costly organization, and its terms also centered more power over the militia in the hands of local officials (reducing the governor's control).Schutz, pp. 121‚Äì123 Order by Pownall authorizing Lieut. Col. John Hawke to beat his drum for enlistments for regiment for the invasion of Canada, 1758 Despite these reforms, recruiting for the militia proved difficult, and recruiting parties were often harassed and stoned, leading to rioting on several occasions.Schutz, p. 130 Pownall was, however, successful in recruiting the province's full quota of militia, and his energetic assistance in the war effort earned him approbation from William Pitt, the Board of Trade, and the new commander-in-chief, James Abercrombie.Schutz, p. 151 Flush with success, Pownall proposed to General Jeffery Amherst the idea of establishing a fort on Penobscot Bay to contest potential French movements in the area.Schutz, p. 152 The area had been the site of periodic frontier raids since 1755, including a major attack on St. George in spring 1758.Bourque, pp. 200‚Äì203 This idea developed into a major expedition to the area, which received not only Amherst's approval but that of the assembly. Pownall led the expedition, oversaw the construction of Fort Pownall, and counted it as a major success of the year.Schutz, p. 166‚Äì172 Its success kicked off a minor land rush in the area.Schutz, p. 174 Although Pownall's start in power was a little rocky, his popularity in the province grew as his term progressed. He assiduously saw to the needs of its many fishermen, successfully convincing military authorities to eliminate burdensome red tape, and courted local merchants. He invested in ventures managed by Thomas and John Hancock, and was lauded by a group of Massachusetts merchants upon his departure.Schutz, pp. 155‚Äì156 A bachelor, he was reported to be a ladies' man and highly engaged in the social scene.Schutz, p. 154 Although he was not strongly religious, he regularly attended Anglican services, but was also a frequent visitor to local Congregational services.Schutz, p. 157 He successfully finessed contentious issues surrounding the recruitment, deployment, and provisioning of militia, negotiating compromises between military and provincial demands.Schutz, pp. 162‚Äì166 He did, however, have a strained relationship with his lieutenant governor, Thomas Hutchinson. The two men never trusted each other, and Pownall regularly excluded Hutchinson from his inner council meetings, instead sending him on missions, for example to deal with militia recruitment issues.Waters and Schutz, p. 556 One of Pownall's last acts before leaving the colony was to approve the appointment of James Otis Sr., a longtime Hutchinson adversary, as speaker of the assembly.Waters and Schutz, p. 557 In the later months of 1759, Pownall wrote a letter to William Pitt requesting leave to return to England because \\"I might be of some service\\" there. Biographer John Schutz speculates that the underlying reason for Pownall's request were related to frustration with his exclusion from the major military actions of the later war years, and possibly his desire to acquire a more significant post, such as a governor-generalship of conquered New France. Historian Bernard Bailyn is of the opinion that Pownall's divisive dislike and distrust of Shirley supporters like Thomas Hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to the request, as did his difficult relationships with the military commanders.Bailyn, p. 44 Whatever the reason, the Board of Trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after King George II died, and Pownall was given the governorship of South Carolina, and permission to first take leave in England. His departure from Boston was delayed by militia recruiting issues and the need to deal with the aftermath of a major fire in the city, and he did not leave until June 1760.Schutz, p. 175 The Administration of the Colonies Although he held the governorship of South Carolina, he never actually went there. He characterised his term in Massachusetts as \\"arduous\\", and informed the colonial office in November 1760 that he would only accept another governorship if the recently acceded King George III directly ordered it.Schutz, pp. 182, 197 Pitt appointed him to the military commissary's office in the Electorate of Hanover, where he served until the Seven Years' War ended in 1763. The position did not further his career ambitions in colonial administration, however, and led to allegations of financial irregularities (of which he was cleared).Schutz, p. 197 Upon his return to England he prepared for publication a treatise entitled The Administration of the Colonies. First published anonymously in 1764, Pownall revised the work and republished the work several times between 1765 and 1777.Schutz, pp. 181, 194, 293 The work, a dry and complex treatise on the situation in North America that included commentary on the burgeoning tensions in the Thirteen Colonies, was intended by Pownall to explore how the colonies could properly be incorporated into a larger empire.Schutz, pp. 182‚Äì194 Pownall's work identified him as supportive of American liberty. Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies, he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England, Scotland, and Wales. At the same time, he insisted that the military protection that the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations to help pay for some of the cost. He was also convinced of the need for a strong, central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire, including the fractious provinces in North America. Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating an imperial parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies.Pownall, Administration of the Colonies, 4th edn, 1768, p. 174 Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of an imperial parliament, most Americans found it anathema, so much so that John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in his influential Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (1768).http://www.bernardoconnor.org.uk/Everton/Thomas%20Pownall.htm Colonial supporter Pownall continued to communicate with political allies in Massachusetts, and was on several occasions called to appear before Parliamentary committees to comment on colonial affairs.Schutz, p. 198 He considered returning to Massachusetts if a post could be found, and began investing in property in Nova Scotia, extending his colonial property interests beyond those he had been granted in Maine during his governorship. In 1765 he married Harriet Fawkener, widow of Everard Fawkener and daughter to Lieutenant General Charles Churchill, giving him a connection to the aristocratic Dukes of Marlborough.Schutz, p. 199 Pownall raised her four children as his own. A gracious and intelligent woman, she became a partner in advancing his political career, hosting social events and encouraging his intellectual pursuits. She may have encouraged him to stand for Parliament in 1767, when he won a seat representing Tregony.Schutz, p. 200 Benjamin Franklin was a friend and frequent correspondent of Pownall's. He renewed correspondence with officials in Massachusetts in the hopes of winning appointment as an agent representing the province's interests, but was unsuccessful.Schutz, p. 202 He regularly received visitors from the colonies, and Benjamin Franklin, his old friend from Pennsylvania, was a frequent guest.Schutz, p. 203 He observed with alarm the rise in tension in the colonies and the missteps of Parliamentary leadership and colonial administration that exacerbated rather than reduced them.Schutz, p. 213 He used his position in Parliament to highlight the colonial objections to the Quartering Act of 1765 and other unpopular legislation. When troops were sent to Boston in 1768 after protests against the Townshend Acts turned violent, he took to the floor of Parliament, warning that the connections between Britain and the colonies were unraveling, and that the end result could be a permanent breach.Schutz, pp. 219‚Äì220 Pownall was opposed to Lord North's partial repeal in 1770 of the hated Townshend Acts, in which the tax on tea was retained as a symbol of Parliamentary power. In debate on the act, Pownall pointed out that retention of the tax would be a \\"millstone\\" around English necks rather than a yoke on American ones, and that it would lead to civil war. His speech was delivered 5 March 1770, the day of the Boston Massacre.Schutz, p. 226 Dispirited by his view that Parliament failed to understand the American colonial issues, he urged his colonial correspondents to continue to press constitutional issues and avoid violence.Schutz, pp. 228‚Äì229 Colonial American issues then briefly subsided from the stage. In 1772 Pownall introduced legislation reforming food production and distribution in Great Britain. It passed the House of Commons, but was amended by the Lords, leading the Commons to reject the amended bill as a violation of its prerogatives. The bill passed the next year, and was called \\"Governor Pownall's Bill\\". It received much praise, including some from influential figures such as Adam Smith. Pownall was also honoured with membership in the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society.Schutz, pp. 230‚Äì232 Revolution Following the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, Parliament passed a series of bills designed to punish Massachusetts. Pownall was unable to sway opinion toward more conciliatory measures. He was also implicated in the Hutchinson Letters Affair as someone who may have delivered private letters of Thomas Hutchinson to Benjamin Franklin, although Franklin never identified his source for the letters. Pownall was unable to retain his seat: in 1774 he was voted out of office.Schutz, pp. 234‚Äì236 Seeking to remain active, Pownall ended up appealing to Lord North, who secured a seat for him in a by-election, representing Minehead. This apparent turn towards Toryism alarmed a number of Pownall's colonial supporters; there is also some evidence that North may have engineered Pownall's defeat in order to gain his support.Schutz, p. 237Pownall, p. 264 Lord North, portrait by Nathaniel Dance Pownall supported North's attempts at reconciliation in debates leading to the start the War of Independence. However, once hostilities began in April 1775, his conciliatory views were dismissed by war-supporting Tories (who opposed them) as well as by Whigs (who saw his proposals as attempts to undercut their positions).Schutz, p. 241 Pownall remained nominally in support of North until 1777, when he openly made declarations in support of the peace party.Schutz, p. 242 The entry of France into the war on the American side returned him firmly to the pro-war Tory position.Schutz, p. 254 His support was, however, nuanced: he continued to argue for some sort of conciliation with the Americans, while remaining resolutely patriotic with respect to the French. He was not alone among British politicians in being unable reconcile these positions, and refused to stand for reelection in 1780.Schutz, pp. 255‚Äì256 During the war years he published several revisions to The Administration of the Colonies, updating and expanding the work to reflect changing conditions. He also worked to update and revise the Evans map, soliciting data and updated maps from colonial correspondents.Schutz, p. 244 He withdrew to some extent in the later years following the death of his wife in 1777, but continued to appear in Parliament.Schutz, p. 252 Post-war years Francisco de Miranda, activist for Latin American independence (portrait by Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar) In July 1780, Pownall anonymously published an essay titled A Memorial Most Humbly Addressed to the Sovereigns of Europe. This widely published document gained Pownall attention throughout Europe; the anonymity of its author was compromised by the use of extended passages from Administration of the Colonies. The essay propounded instructions to Europe's leaders on how to deal with a newly independent United States, pointing out that America's independence and rapid population growth would have a transformative effect on world trade. He proposed that European leaders meet to establish worldwide regulations for what was essentially free trade.Schutz, pp. 257‚Äì260 Pownall continued to maintain an interest in the United States after the war ended, although he never returned.Schutz, p. 264 He sought without success a commission in the Massachusetts militia, mostly as a formality so that he could present it during his European travels. He continued to write essays (new ones and revisions to older ones), and published an updated version of his 1755 map.Schutz, p. 265 In his later years, Pownall was introduced to Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan colonial general who favored Latin American independence from Spain. According to historian William Spence Robertson, significant arguments advanced by Miranda in his later efforts are traceable to Pownall's influence. Pownall also assisted Miranda explicitly, cultivating connections in the British government as he attempted to advance the independence agenda.Schutz, pp. 282‚Äì283 Pownall's last major work was a treatise again arguing for free trade, and explicitly calling for British support of Latin American independence as a way to open those markets to British and American trade.Schutz, pp. 284‚Äì285 Pownall died at Bath on 25 February 1805, and was interred in the church at Walcot.Schutz, p. 286 Thomas Pownall as an Antiquary Monument to William and Sarah Pownall in Lincoln Cathedral, erected by Thomas's brother John in 1790. While Thomas Pownall is well known as an American colonial Governor and English politician, he was also an important figure in later 18th century antiquarian and archaeological studies. In her study of Governor Pownall, Bryony Orme remarks that he is perhaps one of the most neglected of our early antiquaries , and undeservedly so.Orme B., (1974) Governor Pownall, Antiquity, Vol 48, 116-25 He inherited these interests from his father Captain William Pownall, who lived at No. 5 Pottergate in the Minster Yard, which surrounds Lincoln Cathedral. His father had corresponded with William Stukeley about ancient finds in and around Lincoln, and Thomas Pownall's brother John was also a writer on archaeological subjects.Hunt R.W. (1962), William Pownall, Antiquarian Lincolnshire Architectural and Archaeological Society Vol.9 pt2, 158-163 Pownall was already demonstrating his interest in archaeology before he left for America, when, in 1752, he recorded evidence for a Roman villa at Glentworth in LincolnshireEverson P., (1980), Thomas 'Governor' Pownall and the Roman Villa at Glentworth, Lincolnshire, Lincolnshire History and Archaeology, Vol.15. 9-14 After his return from America, he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770, and he contributed extensively to early issues of the journal Archaeologia. Some of his writings describe discoveries around Lincoln. But more importantly he wrote more widely on New Grange in Ireland in 1773\\"Archaeologia\\", Vol. 2, 236-75 and Braich-y-Dinas at Penmaenmawr, on the North Wales coast. He was to follow this with descriptions of Roman remains in France when he was living there, and, on moving to Bath he again provided descriptions of Roman discoveries. Family and legacy Pownall married twice. His first wife was Harriet Churchill, widow of Sir Everard Fawkener and illegitimate daughter of Lieutenant General Charles Churchill. In 1784 Pownall married Hannah (Kennet) Astell, acquiring in the process significant estates and the trappings of landed gentry.Stewart Baldwin, \\"The English Ancestry of George1 Pownall of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, with Notes on Thomas1 Pownall, Governor of Massachusetts Bay and South Carolina\\", The American Genealogist, 76(2001):81‚Äì93, 217‚Äì26; Edward J. Davies, \\"Further Notes on Governor Thomas1 Pownall\\", The American Genealogist, 77(2002):190‚Äì94.Schutz, pp. 265‚Äì268 The towns of Pownal, Maine and Pownal, Vermont are named after Thomas Pownall. Dresden, Maine was once named Pownalborough in his honour; p. 265 this recognition survives in the Pownalborough Courthouse, an historic property built there in 1761., reference #70000052 The remains of Fort Pownall, named for him, survive in Maine's Fort Point State Park. Junius Between 1769 and 1772, a series of letters was published in London's Public Advertiser, written by someone using the pseudonym Junius. Many of the letters contained accusations of corruption and abuse of power on the part of British government officials, subjects Pownall also spoke and wrote about.Pownall, pp. 336‚Äì337 The identity of Junius has since been the subject of contemporary and historical debate. In 1854 Frederick Griffin wrote Junius Uncovered, in which he advanced the argument that Pownall was Junius; this argument was again raised by Pownall descendant Charles A. W. Pownall in his 1908 biography of Pownall.Pownall, p. 324; Charles Pownall advances his case that Thomas Pownall is Junius in chapter 12 of his biography (pp. 308ff). Modern scholars dispute the notion, currently favouring Philip Francis as the writer of the letters based on several lines of evidence.

The first American edition was published by Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York. Plot summary Plaque in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, noting it as the model for St. Ogg's: one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation and outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the winding galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree, and has sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside, and the long- haired sea-kings came up the river and looked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness of the land.. Spanning a period of 10 to 15 years, the novel details the lives of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, siblings who grow up at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. The mill is situated at the junction of the River Floss and the more minor River Ripple, near the village of St Ogg's in Lincolnshire, England. Both the river and the village are fictional. The novel begins in the late 1820s or early 1830s ‚Äì several historical references place the events in the book after the Napoleonic Wars but before the Reform Act of 1832.Byatt, A.S. Introduction to the Penguin Classics Edition, 1985. (In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an \\"auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago\\", placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel's composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss the Duke of Wellington and his \\"conduct in the Catholic Question\\", a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington became Prime Minister and supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, George Henry Lewes. Bintry Watermill, which depicted Dorlcote Mill in the 1997 TV series. Maggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents' marriage. Her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg's and assumed fianc√© of Maggie's cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads. Tom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie's desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom's pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie's idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver's rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem's father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver's untimely death, intensify Tom's and Maggie's differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to enter a life of the business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family's former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading of Thomas √† Kempis's The Imitation of Christ. This renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets with Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie's heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip's and Maggie's attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip, and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents. Several years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg's resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem's friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip's love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip's place. When Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg's, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he roughly sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively. Maggie's brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace, thus giving the book its Biblical epigraph: \\"In their death, they were not divided\\".2 Samuel I:23 Characters Tom and Maggie Tulliver * Maggie Tulliver ‚Äì a dark-complexioned miller's daughter.

A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's grossly imprudent inability to keep himself from \\"going to law\\", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will. Critics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout The Mill on the Floss, claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel invariably stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that \\"[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.\\" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, \\"[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.\\" Adaptations The story was adapted as a film, The Mill on the Floss, in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring Christopher Blake, Pippa Guard, Judy Cornwell, Ray Smith and Anton Lesser. A single-episode television adaptation of the novel was first aired on 1 January 1997. Maggie Tulliver is portrayed by Emily Watson and Mr Tulliver by Bernard Hill. The production was filmed at the historic Chatham Dockyard in Kent for exterior street scenes. In 1994, Helen Edmundson adapted the book for the stage, in a production performed by Shared Experience. A radio dramatisation in five one-hour parts was broadcast on BBC7 in 2009. In the Kiran Rao and Aamir Khan 2011 film Delhi Belly, one of the protagonists makes a sarcastic reference to \\"Mill on the floss\\" when he finds his friends in completely different appearances and surreal whimsical situations.

War bonds are either retail bonds marketed directly to the public or wholesale bonds traded on a stock market. Exhortations to buy war bonds are often accompanied by appeals to patriotism and conscience. Retail war bonds, like other retail bonds, tend to have a yield which is below that offered by the market and are often made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable for all citizens. Before World War I U.S. Government Loan for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Governments throughout history have needed to borrow money to fight wars. Traditionally they dealt with a small group of rich financiers such as Jakob Fugger and Nathan Rothschild, but no particular distinction was made between debt incurred in war or peace. An early use of the term \\"war bond\\" was for the $ raised by the US Congress in an Act of 14 March 1812, to fund the War of 1812, but this was not aimed at the general public. Until July 2015, perhaps the oldest bonds still outstanding as a result of war were the British Consols, some of which were the result of the refinancing of incurring debts during the Napoleonic Wars, but these were redeemed following the passing of the Finance Act 2015.Finance Act 2015 s. 124 World War I =Austria and Hungary= The government of Austria-Hungary knew from the early days of the First World War that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany:Bogart, p. 240 in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest bond denomination available was 100 kronen.Bogart, p. 239 Hungary issued loans separately from Austria in 1919, after the war and after it had separated from Austria, in the form of stocks that permitted the subscriber to demand repayment after a year's notice. Interest was fixed at 6%, and the smallest denomination was 50 korona. Subscriptions to the first Austrian bond issue amounted to $; those of the first Hungarian issue were amounted to $. The limited financial resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian bond denomination of 100 kronen still exceeded the means of most children,Healy, p. 244 so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount and take out a bank loan to cover the rest of the 100 kronen. The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro- Hungarian youth. Over kronen was collected in the first three \\"child bond\\" issues. =Canada= Canada's involvement in the First World War began in 1914, with Canadian war bonds called \\"Victory Bonds\\" after 1917. The first domestic war loan was raised in November 1915, but not until the fourth campaign of November 1917 was the term Victory Loan applied. The First Victory Loan was a 5.5% issue of 5, 10 and 20 year gold bonds in denominations as small as $50. It was quickly oversubscribed, collecting $ or about $50 per capita. The Second and Third Victory Loans were floated in 1918 and 1919, bringing another $. For those who could not afford to buy Victory Bonds, the government also issued War Savings Certificates. The government awarded communities who bought large amounts of bonds Victory Loan Honour Flags. =Germany= German war bonds by Lucian Bernhard Unlike France and Britain, at the outbreak of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets.Chickering (2004), p. 104 This became most apparent after an attempt to float a major loan on Wall Street failed in 1914. As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the Reichstag. This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised were the public war bond () drives. Nine bond drives were conducted over the length of the war and, as in Austria-Hungary, the loans were issued at six-month intervals. The drives themselves would often last several weeks, during which there was extensive use of propaganda via all possible media.Chickering (2007), p. 196 Most bonds had a rate of return of 5% and were redeemable over a ten-year period, in semi-annual payments. Like war bonds in other countries, the German war bonds drives were designed to be extravagant displays of patriotism and the bonds were sold through banks, post offices and other financial institutions. As in other countries, the majority investors were not individuals but institutions and large corporations.Chickering (2007), p. 198 Industries, university endowments, local banks and even city governments were the prime investors in the war bonds. In part because of intense public pressure and in part due to patriotic commitment the bond drives proved extremely successful, raising approximately marks in funds.Chickering (2004), p. 105 Although extremely successful the war bond drives only covered two-thirds of war-related expenditures. Meanwhile, the interest payable on the bonds represented a growing expense which required further resources to pay it. =United Kingdom= The British Sovereign Will Win / Invest in the War Loan To-Day. A British publicity label from World War One. In August 1914 the gold reserves of the Bank of England, and effectively of all banking institutions in Great Britain, amounted to ¬£ (equivalent to ¬£ in 2015). The banks feared the declaration of war would trigger a run on the banks, so the Chancellor David Lloyd George extended the August bank holiday for three days to allow time for the passing of the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914, by which Britain left the gold standard. Under this Act the Treasury issued ¬£ (equivalent to ¬£ in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations. Leading banker Walter Leaf described these Treasury notes as \\"essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient from the point of view of the Government\\". The first interest-bearing War Loan was issued in November 1914 at an interest rate of 3.5%, to be redeemed at par value in 1925‚Äì28. It raised ¬£; ¬£ at face value as it was issued at a 5% discount. It was revealed in 2017 that public subscriptions amounted to ¬£91m, and the balance had been subscribed by the Bank of England, under the names of then governor, John Gordon Nairne, and his deputy Ernest Harvey. It was followed by ¬£ of a second War Loan in June 1915, at 4.5%. ¬£ of this was accounted for by conversion of the 3.5% issue, and a further ¬£ by holders of 2.5% and 2.75% Consols, who were also allowed to transfer to the higher interest rate. The government also pledged that if they issued War Loans at even higher interest, holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. In his memoirs Lloyd George stated his regret that his successor Reginald McKenna increased the interest rate at a time when investors had few alternatives. Not only did it directly increase the nation's annual interest payments by ¬£ but it meant interest rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression. Compared to France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: \\"Lend Your Money to Your Country. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your money, capital and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world.\\" Policy changed when Asquith's government fell in December 1916 and Bonar Law became Chancellor in the new coalition government. The third War Loan was launched in January 1917 at a 5% discount to face value and paying 5% interest (or 4% tax-free for 25 years), a rate Lloyd George described as \\"penal\\". Holders of existing War Loans, Treasury Bills and War Expenditure Certificates could convert to the 5% issue. Of the ¬£ raised by the 5% War Loan,Another ¬£ was raised from the 4% tax-free issue in 1917. only ¬£ was new money; the rest was conversions of ¬£ of 4.5% Loan, ¬£ of Exchequer Bonds and ¬£ of Treasury Bills. Labour politician Tom Johnston would later write of the 1917 War Loan \\"No foreign conqueror could have devised a more complete robbery and enslavement of the British Nation\\". On 30 June 1932 Neville Chamberlain announced that the Government would exercise its right to call in the 5% War Loan, offering a choice of taking cash or continuing the loan at 3.5%. Although they were obliged to give 90 days' notice of such a change, a 1% tax-free cash bonus was offered to holders who acted by 31 July. This conversion saved the government about ¬£ net per year. On 3 December 2014 the UK Government announced it would redeem the outstanding war loans on 9 March 2015. =United States= Advertising poster for World War I Liberty Bonds In 1917 and 1918, the United States government issued Liberty Bonds to raise money for its involvement in World War I. An aggressive campaign was created by Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo to popularize the bonds, grounded largely as patriotic appeals.Kimble, p.15 The Treasury Department worked closely with the Committee on Public Information in developing Liberty Bond campaigns.Kimble, p.16 The resulting propaganda messages often borrowed heavily from military colloquial speech. The government used famous artists to make posters, and used movie and stage stars to host bond rallies. Al Jolson, Ethel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, Elsie Janis, Theda Bara, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin were among the celebrities who made public appearances promoting the patriotic element of purchasing Liberty Bonds.Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History Chaplin also made a short film, The Bond, at his own expense for the drive. Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts sold bonds under the slogan \\"Every Scout to Save a Soldier\\". The campaign spurred community efforts across the country to sell the bonds and was a great success resulting in over-subscriptions to the second, third and fourth bond issues.New York Times, March 27, 1918, page 4. According to the Massachusetts Historical Society, \\"Because the first World War cost the federal government more than $ (by way of comparison, total federal expenditures in 1913 were only $), these programs became vital as a way to raise funds.\\" World War II =Canada= A. J. Casson's Canadian Victory Bonds poster Give Us The Tools 1941 Victory Bond sales in Montreal in 1943 Canada's involvement in the Second World War began when Canada declared war on Nazi Germany on September 10, 1939, one week after the United Kingdom. Approximately half of the Canadian war cost was covered by War Savings Certificates and war bonds known as \\"Victory Bonds\\" as in World War I.Keshen, p. 31 War Savings Certificates began selling in May 1940 and were sold door-to-door by volunteers as well as at banks, post offices, trust companies and other authorised dealers. They matured after seven years and paid $5 for every $4 invested but individuals could not own more than $600 each in certificates. Although the effort raised $ in funds and was successful in financially involving millions of Canadians in the war effort, it only provided the Government of Canada with a fraction of what was needed. The sale of Victory Bonds proved far more successful financially. There were ten wartime and one postwar Victory Bond drives. Unlike the War Savings Certificates, there was no purchase limit to Victory Bonds. The bonds were issued with maturities of between six and fourteen years with interest rates ranging from 1.5% for short-term bonds and 3% for long-term bonds and were issued in denominations of between $50 and $100,000. Canadians bought $ worth of Victory Bonds or some $550 per capita with businesses accounting for half of all Victory Bond sales. The first Victory Bond issue in February 1940 met its goal of $ in less than 48 hours, the second issue in September 1940 reaching its goal of $ almost as quickly.Keshen, p. 32 When it became apparent that the war would last a number of years the war bond and certificate programs were organised more formally under the National War Finance Committee in December 1941, directed initially by the president of the Bank of Montreal and subsequently by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. Under the more honed direction the committee developed strategies, propaganda and the wide recruitment of volunteers for bonds drives. Bond drives took place every six months during which no other organization was permitted to solicit the public for money. The government spent over $ on marketing which employed posters, direct mailing, movie trailers (including some by Walt Disney), radio commercials and full page advertisement in most major daily newspaper and weekly magazine.Keshen, p.33 Realistic staged military invasions, such as the If Day scenario in Winnipeg, Manitoba, were even employed to raise awareness and shock citizens into purchasing bonds.Keshen, p. 34 =Germany= The Nazi regime never attempted to convince the general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War.Aly & Chase, p. 294 The Reich government did not want to present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly.Aly & Chase, p. 298 Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral. German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking state bonds into their portfolios. Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money.Aly & Chase, p. 295 Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by Czechoslovakian banks. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the National Savings Movement was instrumental in raising funds for the war effort during both world wars. During World War II a War Savings Campaign was set up by the War Office to support the war effort. Local savings weeks were held which were promoted with posters with titles such as \\"Lend to Defend the Right to Be Free\\", \\"Save Your Way to Victory\\" and \\"War Savings Are Warships\\". =United States= President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduces the Series E Bond. By the summer of 1940, the victories of Nazi Germany against Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Luxembourg brought urgency to the government, which was discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in World War II.Kimble, p. 19 Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. however preferred a voluntary loan system and began planning a national defense bond program in the fall of 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the baby bonds that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the Liberty Bonds from the First World War.Kimble, p. 20 A poster designed to encourage war bond purchases. Henry Morgenthau Jr. sought the aid of Peter Odegard, a political scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program.Kimble, p. 23 On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful baby bonds as \\"defense bonds\\". Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which Series E would be targeted at individuals as \\"defense bonds\\". Like the baby bonds, they were sold for as little as $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25. Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds. For those that found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10-cent savings stamps could be purchased and collected in Treasury-approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase.Kimble, p. 24 The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war. The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Popular contemporary art was used to help promote the bonds such as Any Bonds Today?, a 1942 Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon. More than a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture.

Bond rallies were held throughout the country with famous celebrities, usually Hollywood film stars, to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness. Many motion pictures during the time, especially war dramas (a form of propaganda itself), included a graphic shown during the closing credits advising patrons to \\"Buy War Bonds and Stamps\\", which were sometimes sold in the lobby of the theater. The Music Publishers Protective Association encouraged its members to include patriotic messages on the front of their sheet music like \\"Buy U.S. Bonds and Stamps\\". Over the course of the war 85 million Americans purchased bonds totalling approximately $.

Many of her story plots have strong supernatural elements but her writing concentrates on the themes of human relationships and growing up. She wrote more than 100 picture books, 40 novels and 20 collections of short stories. At her death she was one of thirty writers to win the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her \\"lasting contribution to children's literature\\". Mahy won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject, both for The Haunting (1982) and for The Changeover (1984). (As of 2012 seven writers have won two Carnegies, none three.) She was also a highly commended runner up for Memory (1987). Among her children's books, A Lion in the Meadow and The Seven Chinese Brothers and The Man Whose Mother was a Pirate are considered national classics. Her novels have been translated into German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Italian, Japanese, Catalan and Afrikaans. In addition, some stories have been translated into Russian, Chinese and Icelandic. Early life Mahy was born in 1936, the eldest of five children. She was raised in her birthplace of Whakatane. Her father, Frances George Mahy, was a bridge builder and often told his children adventure stories which later influenced Mahy's writing. Her mother Helen Penlington was a teacher. She was regarded as a 'slow learner', and particularly hated mathematics. Her first published story was \\"Harry is Bad\\", written at age seven (published in the children's page of the Bay of Plenty Beacon). She showed it to her class to let them know that they could write stories at any age. She went to the local high school, where she was acknowledged as a talented swimmer. Education Mahy completed her B.A. at Auckland University College (1952‚Äì1954) and Canterbury University College, graduating in 1955. In 1956 she trained at the New Zealand Library School, Wellington as a librarian. Personal life From around 1965, Mahy lived at Governors Bay on the Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, in the South Island of New Zealand. She was a solo mother and raised two daughters there. At age 62, Mahy had her right shoulder tattooed with the picture of a skull with a rose in its teeth. She was writing about a person being tattooed and considered the tattoo research to enable her to describe the experience convincingly. In 2007, Mahy adopted a cavoodle puppy she named Honey, because of her colour. Mahy died at the Nurse Maude Hospice in St Albans, Christchurch on 23 July 2012, aged 76. She had been diagnosed with an inoperable cancerous jaw tumour in April 2012 and had been moved to a hospice about nine days before her death. Her final book Tail of a Tale, published posthumously in 2014, was commissioned by Polish photographer Tomasz Gudzowaty. Career Bronze bust of Margaret Mahy, part of the Twelve Local Heroes sculpture She worked as a librarian in Petone, the School Library Service in Christchurch, and in 1976 was appointed Children's Librarian at Canterbury Public Library.Catherine Butler \\"Margaret Mahy: Librarian of Babel\\". The Lion and the Unicorn; number 2, 2015 During this time many of her stories were published in the New Zealand Department of Education School Journal and her first book saw her become known internationally. A Lion in the Meadow was a School Journal story from 1965. It was published in 1969 by J.M. Dent in the U.K. and Franklin Watts in the U.S., as a large-format picture book illustrated by Jenny Williams. Also in 1969, William Heinemann Ltd and Watts published another large-format picture book, The Dragon of an Ordinary Family with illustrations by Helen Oxenbury, who won the Greenaway Medal from the British librarians recognising the year's best illustrated children's book. There were three others in that same year. Mahy wrote several fantasy novels, including The Haunting and The Changeover.Mary Corran, \\"Mahy, Margaret\\" in St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers, ed. David Pringle, London, St. James Press, 1996, , (pp. 383-5). Mahy became a full-time writer in 1980. She went on to win numerous book awards and honours for her contributions to New Zealand and to children's literature. One was an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Canterbury. In 1985 she established the Margaret Mahy Fees Scholarship at the University of Canterbury. The Margaret Mahy Medal Award was established by the New Zealand Children's Book Foundation in 1991 to provide recognition of excellence in children's literature, publishing and literacy in New Zealand. On 6 February 1993, Mahy was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand, for her contributions to children's literature. In March 2009 she was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes and a bronze bust of her was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre. In 2010 the adaptation of her book Kaitangata Twitch as a television series aired on Maori Television. Directed by Yvonne Mackay and produced by The Production Shed.TV, the series includes a cameo appearance by Margaret Mahy in a library scene.\\"Kaitangata Twitch\\".

In 1984 she won the medal again for The Changeover. In 2005 she won the Phoenix Prize for The Catalogue of the Universe. The Margaret Mahy Award, named for Mahy, is presented annually to \\"a person who has made a significant contribution to the broad field of children's literature and literacy\\". Mahy was the first recipient of the award in 1991. Lectures by the winners are published, the standard of which was set by Mahy's inaugural lecture, Surprising Moments. In 2013, the top prize for young adult fiction at the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards was renamed the Margaret Mahy Book of the Year award. Also in 2013, a playground based on her work was commissioned to be built in Christchurch's East Frame.

It aims to achieve \\"Fellowship, Goodwill and Community Service\\". The local clubs are autonomous from the national organization. Many Ruritan clubs sponsor local clubs or chapters of 4-H, the National FFA Organization, or a Boy Scouts of America troop. Unlike most community service organizations, Ruritan rarely has national programs. Rather, each club surveys the needs of its own community and then works to meet some of those needs. Many clubs provide and supervise community recreational centers, sponsor little league and other athletic programs, sponsor anti-litter campaigns, help the sick and needy and provide a wide range of other activities to help improve their communities.  History  The first Ruritan Club was chartered May 21, 1928, in Holland, Virginia, now part of Suffolk, Virginia. Since that first club, Ruritan has grown throughout the United States of America, and in doing so, has become \\"America's Leading Community Service Organization,\\" with over 30,000 members in more than 1,200 clubs.

Shadow volume is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add shadows to a rendered scene. They were first proposed by Frank Crow in 1977Crow, Franklin C: \\"Shadow Algorithms for Computer Graphics\\", Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH '77 Proceedings), vol. 11, no. 2, 242-248. as the geometry describing the 3D shape of the region occluded from a light source. A shadow volume divides the virtual world in two: areas that are in shadow and areas that are not. The stencil buffer implementation of shadow volumes is generally considered among the most practical general purpose real-time shadowing techniques for use on modern 3D graphics hardware. It has been popularised by the video game Doom 3, and a particular variation of the technique used in this game has become known as Carmack's Reverse. Shadow volumes have become a popular tool for real-time shadowing, alongside the more venerable shadow mapping. The main advantage of shadow volumes is that they are accurate to the pixel (though many implementations have a minor self-shadowing problem along the silhouette edge, see construction below), whereas the accuracy of a shadow map depends on the texture memory allotted to it as well as the angle at which the shadows are cast (at some angles, the accuracy of a shadow map unavoidably suffers). However, the shadow volume technique requires the creation of shadow geometry, which can be CPU intensive (depending on the implementation). The advantage of shadow mapping is that it is often faster, because shadow volume polygons are often very large in terms of screen space and require a lot of fill time (especially for convex objects), whereas shadow maps do not have this limitation.  Construction  In order to construct a shadow volume, project a ray from the light source through each vertex in the shadow casting object to some point (generally at infinity). These projections will together form a volume; any point inside that volume is in shadow, everything outside is lit by the light. For a polygonal model, the volume is usually formed by classifying each face in the model as either facing toward the light source or facing away from the light source. The set of all edges that connect a toward-face to an away-face form the silhouette with respect to the light source. The edges forming the silhouette are extruded away from the light to construct the faces of the shadow volume. This volume must extend over the range of the entire visible scene; often the dimensions of the shadow volume are extended to infinity to accomplish this (see optimization below.) To form a closed volume, the front and back end of this extrusion must be covered. These coverings are called \\"caps\\". Depending on the method used for the shadow volume, the front end may be covered by the object itself, and the rear end may sometimes be omitted (see depth pass below). There is also a problem with the shadow where the faces along the silhouette edge are relatively shallow. In this case, the shadow an object casts on itself will be sharp, revealing its polygonal facets, whereas the usual lighting model will have a gradual change in the lighting along the facet. This leaves a rough shadow artifact near the silhouette edge which is difficult to correct. Increasing the polygonal density will minimize the problem, but not eliminate it. If the front of the shadow volume is capped, the entire shadow volume may be offset slightly away from the light to remove any shadow self-intersections within the offset distance of the silhouette edge (this solution is more commonly used in shadow mapping). The basic steps for forming a shadow volume are: # Find all silhouette edges (edges which separate front-facing faces from back-facing faces) # Extend all silhouette edges in the direction away from the light- source # Add a front-cap and/or back-cap to each surface to form a closed volume (may not be necessary, depending on the implementation used) Illustration of shadow volumes. The image above at left shows a scene shadowed using shadow volumes. At right, the shadow volumes are shown in wireframe. Note how the shadows form a large conical area pointing away from the light source (the bright white point).  Stencil buffer implementations  After Crow, in 1991 Tim Heidmann showed how to use the stencil buffer to render shadows with shadow volumes quickly enough for use in real time applications. There are three common variations to this technique, depth pass, depth fail, and exclusive-or, but all of them use the same process: # Render the scene as if it were completely in shadow. # For each light source: ## Using the depth information from that scene, construct a mask in the stencil buffer that has holes only where the visible surface is not in shadow. ## Render the scene again as if it were completely lit, using the stencil buffer to mask the shadowed areas. Use additive blending to add this render to the scene. The difference between these three methods occurs in the generation of the mask in the second step. Some involve two passes, and some only one; some require less precision in the stencil buffer. Shadow volumes tend to cover large portions of the visible scene, and as a result consume valuable rasterization time (fill time) on 3D graphics hardware. This problem is compounded by the complexity of the shadow casting objects, as each object can cast its own shadow volume of any potential size onscreen. See optimization below for a discussion of techniques used to combat the fill time problem. = Depth pass = Heidmann proposed that if the front surfaces and back surfaces of the shadows were rendered in separate passes, the number of front faces and back faces in front of an object can be counted using the stencil buffer. If an object's surface is in shadow, there will be more front facing shadow surfaces between it and the eye than back facing shadow surfaces. If their numbers are equal, however, the surface of the object is not in shadow. The generation of the stencil mask works as follows: # Disable writes to the depth and color buffers. # Use back-face culling. # Set the stencil operation to increment on depth pass (only count shadows in front of the object). # Render the shadow volumes (because of culling, only their front faces are rendered). # Use front-face culling. # Set the stencil operation to decrement on depth pass. # Render the shadow volumes (only their back faces are rendered). After this is accomplished, all lit surfaces will correspond to a 0 in the stencil buffer, where the numbers of front and back surfaces of all shadow volumes between the eye and that surface are equal. This approach has problems when the eye itself is inside a shadow volume (for example, when the light source moves behind an object). From this point of view, the eye sees the back face of this shadow volume before anything else, and this adds a ‚àí1 bias to the entire stencil buffer, effectively inverting the shadows. This can be remedied by adding a \\"cap\\" surface to the front of the shadow volume facing the eye, such as at the front clipping plane. There is another situation where the eye may be in the shadow of a volume cast by an object behind the camera, which also has to be capped somehow to prevent a similar problem. In most common implementations, because properly capping for depth-pass can be difficult to accomplish, the depth-fail method (see below) may be licensed for these special situations. Alternatively one can give the stencil buffer a +1 bias for every shadow volume the camera is inside, though doing the detection can be slow. There is another potential problem if the stencil buffer does not have enough bits to accommodate the number of shadows visible between the eye and the object surface, because it uses saturation arithmetic. (If they used arithmetic overflow instead, the problem would be insignificant.) Depth pass testing is also known as z-pass testing, as the depth buffer is often referred to as the z-buffer. = Depth fail = Around the year 2000, several people discovered that Heidmann's method can be made to work for all camera positions by reversing the depth. Instead of counting the shadow surfaces in front of the object's surface, the surfaces behind it can be counted just as easily, with the same end result. This solves the problem of the eye being in shadow, since shadow volumes between the eye and the object are not counted, but introduces the condition that the rear end of the shadow volume must be capped, or shadows will end up missing where the volume points backward to infinity. # Disable writes to the depth and color buffers. # Use front-face culling. # Set the stencil operation to increment on depth fail (only count shadows behind the object). # Render the shadow volumes. # Use back-face culling. # Set the stencil operation to decrement on depth fail. # Render the shadow volumes. The depth fail method has the same considerations regarding the stencil buffer's precision as the depth pass method. Also, similar to depth pass, it is sometimes referred to as the z-fail method. William Bilodeau and Michael Songy discovered this technique in October 1998, and presented the technique at Creativity, a Creative Labs developer's conference, in 1999. Sim Dietrich presented this technique at both GDC in March 1999, and at Creativity in late 1999. A few months later, William Bilodeau and Michael Songy filed a US patent application for the technique the same year, , entitled \\"Method for rendering shadows using a shadow volume and a stencil buffer\\" issued in 2002 and which expired in October 2019. John Carmack of id Software independently discovered the algorithm in 2000 during the development of Doom 3. = Exclusive-or = Either of the above types may be approximated with an exclusive-or variation, which does not deal properly with intersecting shadow volumes, but saves one rendering pass (if not fill time), and only requires a 1-bit stencil buffer. The following steps are for the depth pass version: # Disable writes to the depth and color buffers. # Set the stencil operation to XOR on depth pass (flip on any shadow surface). # Render the shadow volumes.  Optimization  * One method of speeding up the shadow volume geometry calculations is to utilize existing parts of the rendering pipeline to do some of the calculation. For instance, by using homogeneous coordinates, the w-coordinate may be set to zero to extend a point to infinity. This should be accompanied by a viewing frustum that has a far clipping plane that extends to infinity in order to accommodate those points, accomplished by using a specialized projection matrix. This technique reduces the accuracy of the depth buffer slightly, but the difference is usually negligible. See 2002 paper \\"Practical and Robust Stenciled Shadow Volumes for Hardware-Accelerated Rendering\\", C. Everitt and M. Kilgard, for a detailed implementation. * Rasterization time of the shadow volumes can be reduced by using an in-hardware scissor test to limit the shadows to a specific onscreen rectangle. * NVIDIA has implemented a hardware capability called the depth bounds test that is designed to remove parts of shadow volumes that do not affect the visible scene. (This has been available since the GeForce FX 5900 model.) A discussion of this capability and its use with shadow volumes was presented at the Game Developers Conference in 2005. * Since the depth-fail method only offers an advantage over depth-pass in the special case where the eye is within a shadow volume, it is preferable to check for this case, and use depth-pass wherever possible. This avoids both the unnecessary back-capping (and the associated rasterization) for cases where depth-fail is unnecessary, as well as the problem of appropriately front-capping for special cases of depth-pass. * On more recent GPU pipelines, geometry shaders can be used to generate the shadow volumes.https://web.archive.org/web/20110516024500/http://developer.nvidia.com/node/168 * On systems that do not support geometry shaders, vertex shaders can also be used to create shadow volumes by selectively extruding vertices that already reside within GPU memory.

His accusations against the latter led to the impeachment of Warren Hastings and Elijah Impey by Parliament. He belonged to the Whig party. Early life Born in Dublin, he was the only son of Dr Philip Francis (c. 1708‚Äì1773), a man of some literary celebrity in his time, known by his translations of Horace, Aeschines and Demosthenes. He received the rudiments of an excellent education at a free school in Dublin, and afterwards spent a year or two (1751‚Äì1752) under his father's roof at Skeyton Rectory, Norfolk, and elsewhere, and for a short time he had Edward Gibbon as a fellow-pupil. In March 1753, he entered St Paul's school, London, where he remained for three and a half years, becoming a proficient classical scholar. In 1756, immediately on his leaving school, he was appointed to a junior clerkship in the secretary of state's office by Henry Fox (afterwards Lord Holland), with whose family Dr Francis was at that time on intimate terms; and this post he retained under the succeeding administration. In 1758 he was employed as secretary to General Bligh in the expedition against Cherbourg; and in the same capacity he accompanied the Earl of Kinnoull on his special embassy to the court of Portugal in 1760. Entry into politics In 1761, he became personally known to William Pitt the Elder who, recognising his ability and discretion, made use of his services as private amanuensis from time to time. In 1762 he was appointed to a principal clerkship in the war office, where he formed a warm friendship with Christopher D'Oyly, Deputy-Secretary at War, whose dismissal from office in 1772 was hotly resented by Junius. On 27 February 1762 he married Elizabeth Macrabie, the daughter of a retired London merchant. His daughter, Catherine Francis (d. 11 Sep 1823) married George James Cholmondeley (b. 22 Feb 1752, d. 5 Nov 1830).Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. His official duties brought him into direct relations with many who were well versed in the politics of the time. In 1763 the great constitutional questions arising out of the arrest of Wilkes began to be sharply canvassed. It was natural that Francis, who from a very early age had been in the habit of writing occasionally to the newspapers, should be eager to take an active part in the discussion, though his position as a government official made it necessary that his intervention should be carefully disguised. Political career Duel between Warren Hastings and Philip Francis. He is known to have written to the Public Ledger and Public Advertiser, as an advocate of the popular cause, on many occasions about and after the year 1763; he frequently attended debates in both Houses of Parliament, especially when American questions were being discussed; and between 1769 and 1771 he is also known to have been favourable to the scheme for the overthrow of the Grafton government and afterwards of that of Lord North, and for persuading or forcing Lord Chatham into power. In January 1769 the first of the Letters of Junius appeared, and the series continued till 21 January 1772. They had been preceded by others under signatures such as \\"Candor\\", \\"Father of Candor\\", \\"Anti-Sejanus\\", \\"Lucius\\", and \\"Nemesis\\". The authorship of the letters has been assigned to Francis on a variety of grounds, including a computer-aided analysis of the Junius texts in the 1960s. Comparing stylistic patterns from the letters with attributed writings of the period allowed a reasonable statistical conclusion to be drawn that Francis was by far the most likely author. Some evidence to support the claim of Sir Philip Francis is given in Macaulay's History of EnglandMacaulay, Thomas Babbington. A History of England 2,17,pp. 849,Dent Dutton 1906 in which Macaulay mentions the likely reference to Henry Luttrell, who although obscure to the British of the 1770s, would have been well known to the Irish and particularly to Sir Philip Francis who spent the early part of his life near Luttrellstown. In March 1772 Francis finally left the war office, and in July of the same year he left England for a tour through France, Germany and Italy, which lasted until the following December. On his return he was contemplating emigration to New England, when in June 1773 Lord North, on the recommendation of Lord Barrington, appointed him a member of the newly constituted supreme council of Bengal at a salary of 10,000 pounds per annum. Along with his colleagues Monson and Clavering he reached Calcutta in October 1774, and a long struggle with Warren Hastings, the governor-general, immediately began. These three, actuated probably by petty personal motives, combined to form a majority of the council in harassing opposition to the governor-general's policy; and they even accused him of corruption, mainly on the evidence of Nuncomar. The death of Monson in 1776, and of Clavering in the following year, made Hastings again supreme in the council. But a dispute with Francis, more than usually embittered, led in August 1780 to a minute being delivered to the council board by Hastings, in which he stated that he judged of the public conduct of Mr Francis by his experience of his private, which he had found to be \\"void of truth and honor\\"; such an opinion was aggravated by the various affairs Francis had during his stay in Calcutta, including one with Catherine Grand. A duel was the consequence, in which Francis received a dangerous wound. Though his recovery was rapid and complete, he did not choose to prolong his stay abroad. He arrived in England in October 1781, and was received with little favour. Little is known of the nature of his occupations during the next two years, except that he was untiring in his efforts to procure first the recall, and afterwards the impeachment, of his hitherto triumphant adversary. In 1783 Fox produced his India Bill, which led to the overthrow of the coalition government. In 1784 Francis was returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Yarmouth, Isle of Wight; and although he took an opportunity to disclaim every feeling of personal animosity towards Hastings, this did not prevent him, on the return of the latter in 1785, from doing all in his power to bring forward and support the charges which ultimately led to the impeachment resolutions of 1787. Although excluded by a majority of the House of Commons from the list of the managers of that impeachment, Francis was nonetheless its most energetic promoter, supplying his friends Edmund Burke and Richard Sheridan with all the materials for their eloquent orations and burning invectives. At the general election of 1790 he was returned member for Bletchingley. He sympathised warmly and actively with the French revolutionary doctrines, expostulating with Burke on his vehement denunciation of the same. In 1793 he supported Earl Grey's motion for a return to the old constitutional system of representation, and so earned the title to be regarded as one of the earliest promoters of the cause of parliamentary reform; and he was one of the founders of the Society of the Friends of the People. Later life The acquittal of Hastings in April 1795 disappointed Francis of the governor-generalship, and in 1798 he had to submit to the additional mortification of a defeat in the general election. He was once more successful, however, in 1802, when he sat for Appleby, and it seemed as if the great ambitions of his life were about to be realised when the Whig party came into power in 1806. His disappointment was great when the governor-generalship was, owing to party exigencies, conferred on Sir Gilbert Elliot (Lord Minto); he declined, it is said, soon afterwards the government of the Cape, but accepted a KB. Though re-elected for Appleby in 1806, he failed to secure a seat in the following year; and the remainder of his life was spent in comparative privacy. Among the later productions of his pen were, besides the Plan of a Reform in the Election of the House of Commons, pamphlets entitled: *Proceedings in the House of Commons on the Slave Trade (1796), *Reflections on the Abundance of Paper in Circulation and the Scarcity of Specie (1810), *Historical Questions Exhibited (1818), and a *Letter to Earl Grey on the Policy of Great Britain and the Allies towards Norway (1814). His first wife, by whom he had six children, died in 1806, and in 1814 he married his second wife, Emma Watkins, who long survived him, and who left voluminous manuscripts relating to his biography. In his domestic relations he was exemplary, and he lived on terms of mutual affection with a wide circle of friends. =Bibliography= For the evidence identifying Francis with Junius see the article Identity of Junius, and the authorities there cited. *Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis, with Correspondence and Journals, by Joseph Parkes and Herman Merivale (2 vols., London, 1867); *The Francis Letters, edited by Beata Francis and Eliza Keary (2 vols., London, 1901); *James Fitzjames Stephen, The Story of Nuncomar and the Impeachment of Sir Elijah Impey (2 vols., London, 1885); *Lord Macaulay's Essay on Warren Hastings; *George Bruce Malleson, Life of Warren Hastings (London, 1894); *G.

Styled Marquess of Granby from 1711, he succeeded to the title in 1721, cutting short a brief career in the House of Commons, where he had represented Rutland as a Whig. Biography He held a variety of government and court positions including Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire 1721‚Äì1779, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1727‚Äì1736, Lord Steward of the Household 1755‚Äì1761, and Master of the Horse 1761‚Äì1766. He represented Rutland in the British Parliament from January 1719 to February 1721. He was one of the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel, Bononcini and others.Thomas McGeary. The Politics of Opera in Handel's Britain. Cambridge University Press, 2013. p.268 In 1722 he became a Knight of the Order of the Garter and in 1727 was sworn of the Privy Council. He supported the creation of London's Foundling Hospital and was one of its founding governors when it received its royal charter in 1739. The city of Rutland, Vermont is named after him. Art collection John Manners, the 3rd Duke, was a collector of art. He started buying in 1742 and for two decades bought paintings, drawings and prints at the London art auctions. Agents bought for him at other auctions and he bought privately too, through dealers. On the death of his father, John, the 2nd Duke of Rutland, in 1721, the 3rd Duke had inherited the family collection of paintings acquired by his forebears including Old Masters and an uninterrupted run of ancestral portraits. He liked small pictures and was reported to have said that \\"A man did not deserve a good picture that would not carry it home himself\\". As a result, he spent less on his collection than other collectors who preferred bigger, more expensive paintings. For example, he did not buy on a par with his grandson, Charles, the 4th Duke of Rutland, friend and patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Nevertheless, he was a serious collector whose eye and temperament led him to buy smaller works of all the major European painters including Raphael, Titian, Bassano, Veronese, Guido Reni, and the Italianate northerners, especially Claude and the two Poussins. He is known to have spent some ¬£3,210 for paintings but this figure must be taken as approximate and open to revision if new records come to light. By way of comparison, the building of his London townhouse in the same period, cost some ¬£4,432. For an unknown reason, the Duke sold 200 paintings in 1758‚Äì1759. Family He died in 1779 at the age 82 at Rutland House, Knightsbridge, London and was buried in the Belvoir Castle mausoleum. In 1717 he had married Bridget Sutton, the 17-year-old heiress of Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton. They had eleven children, most of whom died young: *Lady Catherine Rachel Manners (b. 1718), died young *Lady Caroline Manners (b. spring 1719), died young *Lady Frances and Lady Bridget Manners (d. 30 December 1719), twins died young *John Manners, Marquess of Granby (1721‚Äì1770) *Lord Robert Manners-Sutton (1722‚Äì1762) *Lord George Manners-Sutton (1723‚Äì1783) *Lord William Manners (29 July 1724 ‚Äì 11 March 1730), died young *Lady Leonora Manners (d.

History The Balli Komb√´tar was revived in Albania as a political party in the early 1990s . Founded under the leadership of Abas Ermenji, a surviving Ballist, who escaped from Albania when the communists declared victory in 1945. In 1996 it won 5 percent of the popular vote and two seats in parliament. It has since declined. In the 2001 elections it was part of the Union for Victory (Bashkimi p√´r Fitoren) coalition which received 37.1% of the vote and 46 members of parliament. The National Front has chapters in Kosovo, led by Sylejman Daka & in North Macedonia, led by Vebi Xhemaili. Ideology The National Front bear a strong resemblance to their predecessors of the same name, the Balli Komb√´tar. The National Front is an independent political formation, whose goals are to unite the Albanian people residing within and outside the borders of Albania regardless of gender, religion and social status. The party strives to create the conditions of spiritual, cultural and political unity of the Albanian people within and outside of Albania. The National Front advocate high economic and educational development of Albanians as well as strengthening the legal basis of the Albanian state, institutions, and for the prosperity of the country and improvement of the material culture of the Albanian people. Branches =Kosovo= The Kosovo branch of the National Front was formed in 1997 by Naser Husaj. Prior to the National Front in Kosovo, the Albanian National Front Strongly advocated for an independent Kosovo from Yugoslavia prior to the break up. On 6 August 1998, the National Front in Albania demanded that Albania must declare war on Serbia to help fight for Kosovo in the Kosovo War. However, the request was denied by all parties in the Albanian assembly at the time. =North Macedonia= The North Macedonia branch of the National front was formed in Tetovo in 2004. Reports circulated that leaflets were spreading in Tetovo stating that the general headquarters of the National Front invites the Albanian population to join this organization in the ≈†ar Mountains in order to \\"resolve the Albanian question\\" once and for all. They strongly opposed the autonomy referendum in 2004, calling the referendum anti- Albanian. The National Front are at odds with the Macedonian Albanian political parties, Democratic Union for Integration and Democratic Party of Albanians. The National Front implore all Albanians of Macedonia to not take into account any promises or statements by Menduh Tha√ßi or Ali Ahmeti, claiming they do not represent the Albanians of North Macedonia and consider them as 'puppets' controlled by the government. Menduh Tha√ßi has claimed that as long as there is the Democratic Party of Albanians in North Macedonia, there will be no formation of the National Front party. Ali Ahmeti, a former socialist and one time Guerrilla fighter (many KLA commanders and soldiers dispute his glorified representation) is also against the National Front as he believes they are against preserving the integrity and sovereignty of North Macedonia. Membership There are prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to become a member of the party. Not accepted to join the party are: *Those who propagate views and ideas that are unconstitutional & anti-national. *Former members of the Party of Labour of Albania and Communist Party of Albania, communists, fascists, anti-nationalists, & former agents of the Sigurimi. *Thieves, criminals and members of organised crime. *Those who belong to another party.

Ninety-one units were built in 1943 under the name Ferdinand, after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls produced for the Tiger I tank design abandoned in favour of a Henschel design. In January to April 1944, Ferdinands received modifications and upgrades. They were renamed Elefant in May 1944. The official German designation was Panzerj√§ger Tiger (P)Not to be confused with either the Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. H\\" or \\"Ausf. E\\" versions of the (Tiger I), or the Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B (Tiger II) and the ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 184. Development history Porsche's pre-Elefant, turreted Tiger I prototype Porsche GmbH had manufactured about 100 chassis for their unsuccessful proposal for the Tiger tank, the \\"Porsche Tiger\\", in the Nibelungenwerk factory in Sankt Valentin, Austria. Both the successful Henschel proposal and the Porsche design used the same Krupp-designed turret‚Äîthe Henschel design had its turret more-or-less centrally located on its hull, while the Porsche design placed the turret much closer to the front of the superstructure. Since the competing Henschel Tiger design was chosen for production, the Porsche chassis were no longer required for the Tiger tank project. It was therefore decided that the Porsche chassis were to be used as the basis of a new heavy panzerj√§ger, Ferdinand, mounting Krupp's newly developed Panzerj√§gerkanone 43/2 (PaK 43)D 2030 ‚Äì 8,8 cm Panzerj√§gerkanone 43/2 (L/71), Beschreibung, 28.1.1944. Berlin.D97/1+ Ger√§tliste, Oberkommando des Heeres Heereswaffenamt, s.45, Berlin 1.7.43 anti-tank gun. This precise long-range weapon was intended to destroy enemy tanks before they came within their own range of effective fire. The Ferdinand was intended to supplant previous light panzerj√§gers, such as the Marder II and Marder III, in the offensive role. A similar gun was used in the lightly armored Hornisse (later known as Nashorn) tank destroyer, built at the same time. Design =Chassis= The petrol-electric transmission made it much easier to relocate the engines than would be the case on a mechanical-transmission vehicle (the engines can be mounted anywhere, and only the length of the power cables needs to be altered, as opposed to re-designing the driveshafts and locating the engines for the easiest routing of powershafts to the gearbox), so without the forward-mounted turret of the Porsche Tiger prototype, the twin engines were relocated to the front, where the turret had been, leaving room ahead of them for the now-isolated driver and assistant-driver only. The now empty rear half of the hull was covered with a heavily armored, full five-sided casemate with slightly-sloped upper faces and armored solid roof, and turned into a crew compartment, mounting a single 8.8 cm Pak 43 cannon in the forward face of the casemate. The initial Ferdinand conversions were thus among the first physical examples of what became known as the dedicated Jagdpanzer tank destroyers, all of which had completely enclosed casemates, but which were all designed to have their casemate-form armored enclosures designed as a much more integral component of the vehicle's hull armor from the start; the Ferdinand was more of a cross between the earlier, thinly armored, high-profile, \\"three-side\\" (open-top/rear) Panzerj√§ger and the later, more heavily armored, lower- profile, rear-engined Jagdpanzer. The driver and assistant driver were in a separate compartment at the front. As the engines were placed in the middle, the assistant driver and the driver were isolated from the rest of the crew and could be addressed only by intercom. Add-on armor of 100 mm was bolted to the front plates, increasing the plate's thickness to 200 mm and adding another 5 tonnes of weight. =Drive= The preserved American-captured Elefant, showing the suspension it shared with the VK 4501 (P) chassis. The two Porsche air-cooled engines in each vehicle were replaced by two 300 PS (296 hp; 221 kW) Maybach HL120 TRM engines. The engines drove a single Siemens-Schuckert 500 kVA generator each, which powered two Siemens 230 kW (312.7 PS) individual-output electric motors, one each connected to each of the rear sprockets. The electric motors also acted as the vehicle's steering unit. This \\"petrol-electrical\\" drive delivered 0.11 km/l (909 litres/100 km or 0.26 MPG) off-road and 0.15 km/l (667 litres/100 km or 0.35 MPG) on road at a maximum speed of 10 km/h off-road and 30 km/h on road. In addition to this high fuel consumption and poor performance, the vehicle was maintenance- intensive; the sprockets needed to be changed every 500 \\\\- 900km.Ferdinand and Elefant Tank Destroyer by Thomas Anderson p.43 and p.158 Porsche had experience of this form of petrol-electric transmission extending back to 1901, when he designed a car that used it. Suspension for the \\"slack track\\" equipped Ferdinand consisted of six twin bogies (three per side) with longitudinal torsion bars, without any overlapping wheels or return rollers. There are sprockets at both ends of the vehicle. The drive sprockets are at the rear, while the front pair contain a drum brake system. =Armament= The vehicle was fitted with an 88 mm Panzerj√§gerkanone 43/2 gun (early designation 8,8 cm Stu.K. 43/1). This 71 caliber-long gun had originally been developed as a replacement for the 88 mm anti-aircraft gun that had been used against Allied tanks in the Western Desert Campaign and on the Eastern Front. It had a much longer barrel than the L/56 guns, which gave it a higher muzzle velocity, and fired a different, longer cartridge. These improvements gave the 88 mm L/71 significantly improved armor penetration ability over the earlier 88 mm. Although it lost the competition to the 8.8 cm Flak 41 and never became an anti-aircraft weapon, it was turned into the very successful Pak 43 anti-tank gun. As fitted, the gun was capable of 28¬∞ traverse and -8¬∞ and +14¬∞ depression/elevation. Production Ninety-one existing \\"Porsche Tiger\\" chassis were converted (chassis number 150010 to 150100). The work was completed in just a few months from March to May 1943. Three Bergepanzer Ferdinands (the recovery vehicle variant of the Ferdinand tank destroyer) were produced at the Nibelungenwerke in summer 1943. Combat history A disabled Elefant in Italy, 1944. =Kursk= Ferdinands first saw combat in the Battle of Kursk, where eighty-nine were committed, the largest deployment of the vehicle during its service. The Ferdinand was optimized for destroying Soviet T-34 tanks and 76.2 mm anti-tank guns from behind the front lines with its 88 mm Pak 43/2 L/71 at a range of over 3 kilometres, a role which it performed well. Its most significant problem at Kursk was mine damage and mechanical failure. Any damage to the tracks or suspension negated the protection of the armor, as crews were forced to dismount and attempt repairs. The extreme weight of the Ferdinand made towing difficult: the standard armored recovery vehicle in German service at the time was the Bergepanzer IV, a variant of the Panzer IV that could tow a single Panzer IV without assistance. It was insufficient for larger vehicles, with a Tiger I heavy tank requiring three Bergepanzer IVs to be towed, and the Ferdinand requiring five linked in tandem to pull the vehicle off the field. In addition, the Ferdinand was hampered by flaws such as the lack of peripheral vision blocks, or a machine gun as secondary defensive armament. Apocryphal reports say that Soviet infantry, quickly recognizing this flaw, could easily hide in their trenches until the Ferdinand advanced through their lines, then swarm the vehicle with grenades and Molotov cocktails from the sides. However, losses to Soviet infantry are disputed in after-action reports. On the other hand, Heinz Guderian himself complained that the Elefant, much as other failed designs, suffered from lack of close-range protection against infantry assaults.Guderian, H., \\"Panzer Leader\\", Smolensk, 1999, chapter 10, page 426-427 In the initial stages of the Kursk battle, when the Germans were on the offensive, heavy vehicles could be recovered and repaired with relative peace at night; this at first allowed the majority of knocked-out Ferdinands to be rescued, repaired and returned to duty. However, once the tides had turned against the Germans and they fell back on the defensive, with fewer vehicles to spare, functional Ferdinands with minor damage to their tracks or suspensions had little hope of recovery, and crews were usually forced to destroy the vehicle to prevent a mostly intact Jagdpanzer from falling into the hands of the Soviets. On the Anzio front, March 1944 The units were deployed at a company level, sometimes sub- divided into platoons, with infantry or tanks in accompaniment to protect the flanks and rear of the vehicles. On the attack, this Jagdpanzer was a first- strike vehicle; while in defence, they often comprised a mobile reserve used to blunt enemy tank assaults =Post-Kursk modifications= The surviving Ferdinands fought various rear-guard actions in 1943 until they were recalled to be modified and overhauled, partially based on battle experience gained in the Battle of Kursk. Returned to the Nibelungenwerke factory in Austria, on 2 January 1944, upgrades commenced on 48 of the 50 surviving vehicles. The most visible exterior upgrades were 1) the addition of a ball-mounted MG 34 in the hull front, 2) a new commander's cupola (modified from the standard StuG III cupola) for improved vision, 3) re-designed armored engine grates (for better bullet and shrapnel protection) and 4) the application of Zimmerit anti- magnetic mine paste. Due to the Allied landing in Anzio-Nettuno, Italy, the first eleven complete and updated Ferdinands were issued to the 1st company of 653rd Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (German: schwere Panzerj√§ger-Abteilung, sPzJgrAbt) and were deployed at the end of February 1944. The remaining 37 vehicles were completed in April and were issued to the 2nd and 3rd companies of sPzJgrAbt 653 which boarded trains and sent to the Tarnopol battles in Ukraine. On 1 May 1944, German Army High Command, Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) issued an order to formally change the panzerj√§ger's name from \\"Ferdinand\\" to \\"Elefant\\". This order forbade future use of Ferdinand and even directed units in the field to edit their records. This is contrary to popular belief that the name change was linked to the January‚ÄìApril mechanical upgrades to the Ferdinand panzerj√§ger; the name change was purely administrative in nature. Three Bergepanzer Elefant or armoured recovery vehicles were converted from Ferdinand/Elefant hulls and issued with the 2nd and 3rd companies of sPzJgrAbt 653 to the East in the summer of 1944. Although the Elefant modifications improved the vehicles, some problems could never be fully fixed. In 1944, the Ferdinand/Elefants served on the Italian front, but were rather ineffective as their weight of nearly 70 tonnes did not allow them to use most Italian roads and bridges. As at Kursk, most Elefant losses were not as a direct result from combat, but resulted when mechanical breakdowns and lack of spare parts compelled their crews to destroy and abandon them. One company of Elefants saw action during the Soviets' January 1945 Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in Poland, and the very last surviving vehicles were in combat at Zossen during the Battle of Berlin. Conclusions The Ferdinand/Elefant may have been the most successful mass produced German tank destroyer employed during the war in kills per loss, reaching an average claimed ratio of approximately 10:1. During the Battle of Kursk, sPzJgrAbt 653 claimed to have knocked out 320 enemy tanks, for the loss of 13 Ferdinands. This impressive average ratio was due to its extreme firepower and protection, which gave it an enormous advantage when used in head-on combat or a static defensive role (however note that claimed tank kills are well-proven to invariably greatly exceed actual kills, and different organizations have different standards of defining a 'kill'). However, poor mobility and mechanical unreliability greatly diminished its operational capability. The Elefant and Nashorn were both superseded by the Jagdpanther. All three vehicles mounted the same gun, with only some minor differences between them. The Jagdpanther - a true jagdpanzer - was a successor to the other two, combining acceptable mobility and good, sloped armour while retaining the excellent gun, mostly solving the reliability, mobility, and/or protection problems that the earlier vehicles had. Survivors Only two of these vehicles survived the war. One Ferdinand was captured by Soviet forces at Kursk, and is now at the Kubinka Tank Museum outside Moscow. An Elefant, numbered \\"102\\" of sPzJgr Abt 653, was captured at Anzio by the Americans, and is now part of the United States Army Ordnance Training Support Facility's collection at Fort Lee, VA. The example at Fort Lee was restored to display condition in 2007‚Äì2008, as documented on the show Tank Overhaul, but not in its original paint scheme. It was announced in 2016 that the Fort Lee Elefant would be loaned to the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset, UK. The vehicle was displayed as part of the museum's \\"Tiger Collection\\" display from April 2017 until January 2019, when it was returned to the United States. This display brought all the members of the Tiger family together in one place for the first time.

It premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival before being released theatrically on October 23, 2002. Synopsis The film uses interviews shot by the filmmakers, footage of Derrida's lectures and speaking engagements, and personal footage of Derrida at home with his friends and family. In several scenes, Ziering Kofman also reads excerpts from Derrida's work or otherwise describes aspects of his life. Derrida also focuses on Derrida's thesis that scholars tend to ignore important biographical information when discussing philosophers' lives. In one scene, Derrida comments that he would be most interested in hearing about famous philosophers' sex lives because this topic is seldom addressed in their writings. The filmmakers respond to many of these criticisms by probing Derrida on various aspects of his own personal life, though he usually refuses to answer directly questions about himself. The film also follows Derrida during a trip to South Africa where he visits Nelson Mandela's former prison cell and discusses forgiveness with university students. Derrida states that his own childhood experiences with anti-Semitism have heightened his sensitivity to racial issues. Analysis At several points, Derrida shows the philosopher applying his theory of deconstruction to the film itself. Derrida often challenges the filmmaking process and argues against the capability of any film to portray him accurately. The film also includes metacinematic scenes in which Derrida analyzes previously recorded footage of himself. In one such scene, Derrida telescopically watches a video of himself analyzing footage of himself. Nicholas Royle argues that the film's labyrinthine, Ouroboros-like structure reinforces several key Derridean tenets: :\\"If Dick and Ziering Kofman follow Derrida, Derrida is also following them. Derrida is a film about following, about the compulsiveness and ghostliness of following, of following the camera, of following the story, of following a film. But Derrida is also a film about the impossibility of following, about the consequences and effects of Derrida's work vis-√†-vis the 'story of a life', about the idea that Derrida cannot tell a story.\\" Reception Film critics generally gave Derrida positive reviews; the film has an 82% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/derrida/ Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times praised the film for its sophisticated style and said it was \\"the cinematic equivalent of a mind-expanding drug\\" while Film Threat Tim Merrill described it as \\"a priceless historical record.\\" Other critics, like The Guardian Peter Bradshaw, found the film whimsical and entertaining but lamented Derrida's evasive and mysterious demeanor. Derrida received the Golden Gate Award at the 2002 San Francisco Film Festival and screened in competition for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Post-Release Derrida enjoyed the film and appeared at several promotional events to discuss the film and answer questions about the project. Derrida died in October 2004. In 2005, Routledge published a companion book, Derrida, which includes the film's screenplay, several essays on the film, and interviews with Derrida, Dick, and Ziering Kofman. The book describes many of the events that followed the film's release, including Derrida's unexpected celebrity status on the streets of New York City. This phenomenon prompted Derrida's wife to remark to the filmmakers, \\"I hear you've made him into Clint Eastwood.\\" See also * D'ailleurs, Derrida References External links * Official website New York Times review * Guardian reviews * Village Voice review * San Francisco Chronicle review Category:2002 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:2002 documentary films Category:Documentary films about philosophers Category: Films about philosophy Category:Works about Jacques Derrida Category:Films directed by Kirby Dick ","title":"Derrida (film)"},{"id":"401530","text":"National Democratic Party may refer to: A‚ÄìL * National Democratic Party (Argentina), 1931‚Äì1955 * National Democratic Party (Austria, 1967‚Äì88) * National Democratic Party (Barbados) * National Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina) * National Democratic Party (British Guiana), led by Rudy Kendall * National Democratic Party (British Virgin Islands) * National Democratic Party (Bulgaria) * National Democratic Party (Cayman Islands) * National Democratic Party (Chile) * National Democratic Party (Czechoslovakia) * National Democratic Party (Djibouti) * National Democratic Party (Egypt), founded by President Anwar El Sadat in 1978 - dissolved in 2011 * National Democratic Party (Fiji, 1960s) * National Democratic Party (Fiji, 2006) * National Democratic Party (Georgia) * National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany) * National Democratic Party of Germany * National Democratic Party (Ghana) * National Democratic Party (Gold Coast), active from 1950 to 1952 * National Democratic Party (Greece), in the 1920s led by Georgios Kondylis * National Democratic Party (Hungary) * National Democratic Party (India) * National Democratic Party (Kerala), in Kerala, India from 1974 to 1996 * National Democratic Party (Iraq, 1946) * National Democratic Party (Iraq) * National Democratic Party (Ireland) * National Democratic Party (Japan, 1929), led by Miyazaki Ryusuke * National Democratic Party (Japan), from 1950 until 1952 * National Democratic Party of Liberia * National Democratic Party of Lithuania M‚ÄìZ * National Democratic Party (Morocco) * National Democratic Party (Namibia) * National Democratic Party (Nepal) * National Democratic Party (Nigeria) * National Democratic Party (North Macedonia) * National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland) * National Democratic Party (Pakistan) * National-Democratic Party (Poland) * National Democratic Party (Rhodesia), predecessor of the Zimbabwe African People's Union * National Democratic Party (Romania) * National Democratic Party (Sint Maarten) * National-Democratic Party (Slovakia), predecessor of the Democratic Union * National Democratic Party (Slovenia) * National Democratic Party of Spain * National Democratic Party (Suriname) * National Democratic Party of Tibet, the primary political party of the Tibetan government in exile * National Democratic and Labour Party, a British party often known as the National Democratic Party * National Democratic Party (UK, 1966) * National Democratic Party (United States), historic political party, not to be confused with the modern United States Democratic Party * National Democratic Party of Alabama, in U.S., opposed George Wallace * National Democratic Party (Venezuela) See also * Democratic National Party (disambiguation) * National Democrats (disambiguation) * National Party (disambiguation) * NDP (disambiguation) * National Democracy (disambiguation) * Nationalist Democracy Party, a former political party in Turkey ","title":"National Democratic Party"},{"id":"401531","text":"Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev (; c. 1742) was an ataman of the Yaik Cossacks who led a great popular insurrection during the reign of Catherine the Great. Pugachev claimed to be Catherine's late husband, Emperor Peter III. Alexander Pushkin wrote a notable history of the rebellion, The History of Pugachev, and recounted the events of the uprising in his novel The Captain's Daughter (1836). Early life Pugachev, the son of a small Don Cossack landowner, was the youngest son of four children. Born in the stanitsa Zimoveyskaya (in present-day Volgograd Oblast), he signed on to military service at the age of 17. One year later, he married a Cossack girl, Sofya Nedyuzheva, with whom he had five children, two of whom died in infancy.Emperor of the Cossacks, pp 43‚Äì45 Shortly after his marriage, he joined the Russian Second Army in Prussia during the Seven Years' War under the command of Count Zakhar Chernyshov. He returned home in 1762, and for the next seven years divided his time between his home village and several service assignments.Emperor of the Cossacks, p. 45 During this period, he was recognized for his military skill and achieved the Cossack rank of khorunzhiy, which would be roughly equivalent to the post of company commander. It was also during this period, in 1770 at the siege of Bender during the Russo-Turkish War, that he first displayed a flair for impersonation, boasting to his comrades that his sword was given to him by his \\"godfather\\", Peter I. Life as a fugitive In 1770, Pugachev requested leave to return home to recover from a severe illness, later seeking permanent discharge. Despite urging from military commanders, Pugachev refused to be treated in a military infirmary or return to the front. Convinced by his brother-in-law, Simon Pavlov, he joined a dissatisfied Cossack group who were fleeing eastward for an independent Cossack community on the Terek River.Emperor of the Cossacks, p. 46 After they were safely across the Don River, he returned home to Zimoveyskaya. The fleeing Cossacks were caught soon after by the authorities, and Pavlov implicated Pugachev in the desertion, causing his arrest. He was held for 48 hours before he managed to escape, beginning his fugitive career.Emperor of the Cossacks, pp 46‚Äì47 Fleeing for the Cossack community on the Terek River, he arrived in early January 1772. During his six weeks in the area, he joined a protest group and was elected their official representative. On his way to St. Petersburg to make an official complaint, his fugitive status was discovered in Mozdok, and he was again arrested. He escaped on 13 February and returned home, only to be arrested once again. Dispatched to Cherkassk for investigation, he met Lukyan Ivanovich Khudiakov, whom he tricked into releasing him, after which he fled to Vetka, a Polish border settlement, with the help of many raskol'niki.Emperor of the Cossacks, p. 48 He returned to Russia in the autumn of 1772 by pretending to be an Old Believer wishing to return home. He received a visa to settle in the Malykovka district (present day Vol'sk), where he most likely first heard of the Yaik Cossacks rebellion.Emperor of the Cossacks, p. 49 Insurrection 1773‚Äì1774 The idea of impersonating the late Emperor Peter III occurred to Pugachev early on, even before he reached the Yaik Cossacks. It is of no surprise, given another recent peasant impersonator, Fedot Bogmolov, and Russia's history of impersonators.Autocratic Politics in a National Crisis, p. 142 Pugachev, posing as a wealthy merchant, reportedly tested the feelings of the Cossacks at the Yaitsk by suggesting that he led a mass exodus into Turkey. When the majority seemed to agree with his plan, he deemed it the right time to begin his rebellion.Emperor of the Cossacks, pp 53‚Äì55 Though he was arrested shortly after once again, and this time held for five months at Kazan, he escaped once more and returned to the Yaitsk to start his revolt.Emperor of the Cossacks, p. 55 By promising to return several privileges to the Cossacks and to restore the Old Belief, he was able to gain the support he needed to promote his identity as Peter III.Autocratic Politics in a National Crisis The story of Pugachev's strong resemblance to the tsar Peter III, who in 1762 was overthrown and murdered by his wife's supporters, the future empress Catherine II, comes from a later legend. Pugachev told the story that he and his principal adherents had escaped from the clutches of Catherine. Having amassed an army through propaganda, recruitment and promise of reform, Pugachev and his generals were able to overrun much of the region stretching between the Volga River and the Urals. Pugachev's greatest victory of the insurgency was the taking of Kazan. As well as amassing large numbers of Cossacks and peasants, Pugachev also acquired artillery and arms and was able to supply his force better than the Russian army would have predicted.Autocratic Politics in a National Crisis, pp 144‚Äì145 & 175 Pugachev Administering Justice to the Population. Painting by Vasily Perov. In response, General Peter Panin set out against the rebels with a large army, but difficulty of transport, lack of discipline, and the gross insubordination of his ill-paid soldiers paralyzed all his efforts for months, while Pugachev's innumerable and ubiquitous bands gained victories in nearly every engagement. Not until August 1774 did General Michelsohn inflict a crushing defeat upon the rebels near Tsaritsyn, when they lost ten thousand killed or taken prisoner. Panin's savage reprisals, after the capture of Penza, completed their discomfiture. On 14 September 1774, Pugachev's own Cossacks delivered him to Yaitsk. Alexander Suvorov had him placed in a metal cage and sent first to Simbirsk and then to Moscow for a public execution, which took place on .B.H.

Legacy The Pugachev rebellion had a long-lasting effect on Russia for years to come. While Catherine II tried to reform the provincial administration, the horrors of the revolt caused her to drop other reforms, particularly attempts to emancipate the peasant serfs of Russia. Uralsk, 2015 The Russian writer Alexander Radishchev, in his Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow, attacked the Russian government, in particular the institution of serfdom. In the book, he refers to Pugachev and the rebellion as a warning. The term \\"Pugachevs of the University\\" was frequently used to describe the generation of the Russian Nihilist movement. The village (stanitsa) in which Pugachev was born, whose original name \\"Zimoveyskaya\\" was changed after his defeat to Potemkinskaya, was renamed Pugachevskaya in his honor in 1917, following the October Revolution. The central square in the Kazakh town of Uralsk is named Pugachev Square. Yemelyan Pugachev's House Museum in Uralsk. Was established in 1991. Authors such as Boris Akunin have referred to Pugachevshchina as a tendency in the Russian culture toward rebellious discontent. A fictionalized account of the rebellion is presented in Alexander Pushkin's 1836 novella The Captain's Daughter.

He was educated at Harrow School. In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College. He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance. From 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at Oxford in this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands. The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary. In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB. In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Besides his Lectures on Colonization and Colonies (1841), he published Historical Studies (1865), and completed the Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis (1867); he wrote the second volume of the Life of Sir Henry Lawrence (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes's work.

Crew Mission objective =Tethered Satellite System= The primary objective of STS-75 was to carry the Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS-1R) into orbit and to deploy it spaceward on a conducting tether. The mission also flew the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3) designed to investigate materials science and condensed matter physics. The TSS-1R mission was a reflight of TSS-1 which was flown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-46 in July/August 1992. The Tether Satellite System circled the Earth at an altitude of 296 kilometers, placing the tether system within the rarefied electrically charged layer of the atmosphere known as the ionosphere. STS-75 mission scientists hoped to deploy the tether to a distance of . Over 19 kilometers of the tether were deployed (over a period of 5 hours) before the tether broke. Many pieces of floating debris were produced by the plasma discharge and rupture of the tether, and some collided with it. The satellite remained in orbit for a number of weeks and was easily visible from the ground. TSS-1R tether composition [NASA]. The electric conductor of the tether was a copper braid wound around a nylon (Nomex) string. It was encased in teflon-like insulation, with an outer cover of kevlar, inside a nylon (Nomex) sheath. The culprit turned out to be the innermost core, made of a porous material which, during its manufacture, trapped many bubbles of air, at atmospheric pressure. Later vacuum-chamber experiments suggested that the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, under normal circumstance, was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As it bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a plasma (in a way similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), a relatively dense one and therefore a much better conductor of electricity. This plasma diverted to the metal of the shuttle and from there to the ionospheric return circuit. That current was enough to melt the cable. The specific TSS-1R mission objectives were: characterize the current-voltage response of the TSS-orbiter system, characterize the satellite's high-voltage sheath structure and current collection process, demonstrate electric power generation, verify tether control laws and basic tether dynamics, demonstrate the effect of neutral gas on the plasma sheath and current collection, characterize the TSS radio frequency and plasma wave emissions and characterize the TSS dynamic-electrodynamic coupling. TSS-1R Science Investigations included: TSS Deployer Core Equipment and Satellite Core Equipment (DCORE/SCORE), Research on Orbital Plasma Electrodynamics (ROPE), Research on Electrodynamic Tether Effects (RETE), Magnetic Field Experiment for TSS Missions (TEMAG), Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether System (SETS), Shuttle Potential and Return Electron Experiment (SPREE), Tether Optical Phenomena Experiment (TOP), Investigation of Electromagnetic Emissions by the Electrodynamic Tether (EMET), Observations at the Earth's Surface of Electromagnetic Emissions by TSS (OESSE), Investigation and Measurement of Dynamic Noise in the TSS (IMDN), Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of TSS Dynamics (TEID) and the Theory and Modeling in Support of Tethered Satellite Applications (TMST). =Other mission objectives= The USMP-3 payload consisted of four major experiments mounted on two Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structures (MPESS) and three Shuttle Mid-deck experiments. The experiments were: Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF), Material pour l'Etude des Phenomenes Interessant la Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite (MEPHISTO), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment (ZENO) and Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE).

An older Digital Unix program, originally on a DEC AlphaServer, was ported to run Linux on a laptop. The next use of Linux was a year later, on STS-83. Fictional STS-75 mission STS-75 was the shuttle mission described in the fictional NASA Document 12-571-3570, although this document was disseminated several years before STS-75 was launched. The document purports to report on experiments to determine effective sexual positions in microgravity. Astronomer and scientific writer Pierre Kohler mistook this document for fact and is responsible for a major increase in its redistribution in the early 21st century. Conspiracy theories first made in the early beginnings of the Shuttle era of sex in space were suddenly made rampant again, causing a minor press debacle among tabloids.

The eldest son of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, who ruled Spain as dictator from 1923 to 1930, Primo de Rivera worked as lawyer before entering politics, an enterprise he initially engaged into vowing to defend his deceased father's memory. He founded Falange Espa√±ola in October 1933, shortly before the 1933 general election, in which he was elected member of the Republican Cortes, running as candidate within a wider right-wing platform. A figure with a trajectory not free from contradictions, he assumed the role of messianic leader charged with the task of saving Spain while he was unable to track support during his whole political life. A founder of a Fascist party, he critically fascistised afterwards, as he progressively radicalised in an anti- conservative direction. By 1936 he endorsed a conservative and reactionary military coup seeking to destroy the Republic that led to a civil war that he tried to stop later. Imprisoned before the start of the Spanish Civil War, he was accused of conspiracy and military rebellion against the Government of the Second Spanish Republic and was sentenced to death and executed during the first months of the war. In life, he held the nobiliary title of 3rd Marquess of Estella, Grandee of Spain. In 1948, he was posthumously bestowed the title of Duke of Primo de Rivera, which was subsequently passed to his brother Miguel. The image of Jos√© Antonio was revered during the war by the Nationalist faction and, after the establishment of Francoist Spain, he was regarded as a martyr, his figure being a tool of the Francoist propaganda apparatus. The inscription of \\"Jos√© Antonio ¬°Presente!\\" could be found in many churches all across Spain.  Biography  = Early life = Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera was born at the G√©nova Street (Madrid) on April 24, 1903, the eldest son of the military officer Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja (who would later govern Spain as dictator from 1923 to 1930) and Casilda S√°enz de Heredia y Su√°rez de Argud√≠n. From his father he inherited the title of Marquess of Estella. He never married. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera can be seen at the left of the picture as member of the boy scouts during a visit of Alfonso XIII in 1918. His mother died when he was five years old, and he was subsequently raised by his father's sister. He was privately taught at home, and learned English and French...

He helped to organize the student union there, Federaci√≥n Universitaria Escolar, which opposed the higher-education policies of his father. He took undergraduate and graduate courses simultaneously and he obtained both his Bachelor and Doctor degrees in the same year, 1923.Juan Velarde Fuertes: \\"Jos√© Antonio, en la Universidad.\\" Fundaci√≥n Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera.

A relatively successful lawyer not involved nor expected to be involved in politics before 1930, the impetuous Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera decided to do so after the death of his father in his Parisian self-exile in 1930; this was for him the best way to defend the memory of his father, whose work at government had often been derided.

On October 29, 1933, Primo de Rivera launched the Falange Espa√±ola (\\"Spanish Phalanx\\"), a nationalist party, inspired in part with some ideas, such as the necessity of authority, hierarchical order of society, and grassroots populism, that were being expounded in Italy in the Fascist movement. The foundational convention was held in the Teatro de la Comedia of Madrid. He was the keynote speaker and his first address was a criticism of liberal democracy. > Since the liberal state was a servant of [Rousseau] it became not just the > trustee of a nation's destiny but also the spectator of electoral contests. > What alone mattered to the liberal state was that a certain number of > gentlemen be sitting at the polling station, that the voting start at eight > o'clock and end at four, that the ballot boxes not get smashed--when being > smashed is the noblest aspiration of all ballot boxes--and then to respect > the outcome of the voting, as if the outcome was a matter of complete > indifference to it.

Stanley Payne argues that Rivera's view that violence was acceptable if done for a just cause was paralleled by that of the Spanish Left, who held similar views on the use of violence; unlike the Italian fascists, the Falange never developed a sophisticated theory for their doctrine of violence. Payne argues that because his father had ruled as a dictator with relatively minimal violence during the quieter 1920s, Rivera naively assumed he could impose a new authoritarian system with relatively limited violence, but he would eventually find himself caught in a spiral of killing that he could not control.Payne, Stanley G. Spain: A unique history. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2011, p.204 When he founded the Falange, Antonio was more reluctant to use violence than other leading members of the party; he did not seem to expect violence from the political Left to be directed against the party. However, after Juan Cu√©llar's death, he seemed to overcome his reluctance and thus intermittent killings on both sides would continue.Thom√†s, Joan Maria. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera: The Reality and Myth of a Spanish Fascist Leader. Vol. 3. Berghahn Books, 2019, p.136, 143 Rivera's closing words made explicit his Romantic nationalism: > In a poetic sweep we will raise this fervent devotion to Spain; we will make > sacrifices, we will renounce the easy life and we will triumph, triumph that > --you know this well--we shall not obtain in the upcoming elections.

He was a candidate in the general election of November 19 for the umbrella organization \\"Uni√≥n Agraria y Ciudadana,\\" part of the broad conservative coalition Confederaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Derechas Aut√≥nomas (CEDA). He was elected to the Parliament as a representative of C√°diz. In his first parliamentary intervention he answered Gil-Robles--the founder of CEDA--who had just spoken out against all totalitarian forms of government for arrogating to themselves the attributes of God and crushing the personality of the individual: > We believe that the state does not have to justify its behaviour at every > turn, just as no individual or social class does, in so far as it holds to a > guiding principle all the time.

Rumbos. On February 11, 1934, Falange merged with Ramiro Ledesma's Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista to create the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS under Jos√© Antonio's leadership. The antisemitic positions within FE de las JONS were mainly led by On√©simo Redondo, with Ledesma and Primo de Rivera largely indifferent to the issue; however Falangists attacked the Jewish-owned SEPU department stores in the spring of 1935;√Ålvarez Chillida, Antisemitismo, pp. 342‚Äì3 In the view of Gonzalo √Ålvarez Chillida, both Jos√© Antonio and Ledesma probably thought that such antisemitic raids could enhance mobilization within the purportedly threatened small-business sector. He shared with other rightists the belief that violence was legitimate against a Republic that he perceived as influenced by communists, Jews and Freemasons.Sancho D√°vila and Juli√°n Pemart√≠n, Hacia la historia de la Falange: primera contribuci√≥n de Sevilla (Jerez: Jerez Industrial, 1938) pp. 24‚Äì7. Photographed during a political rally (c. 1935‚Äì36). The Falangist blue shirt was an emblematic uniform embodying the idea of the Falangist discipline, hierarchy and violence, as well as, often dressed with the top button unbuttoned, it contributed to the discourse of masculine \\"virility\\". The upper-class Jos√© Antonio abandoned the tie and suit and took on the new blue-shirt Falange uniform (despite later mocking JAP militants because of this, the Falangists were originally dressed in suit and tie); the uniform, adopted in October 1935, was deliberately chosen as reference to Italian Fascism. In 1935 Primo de Rivera collaborated in editing the lyrics of the Falangist anthem, \\"Cara al Sol\\" (Face to the Sun).C√©sar Vidal: \\"¬øQui√©n redact√≥ el \\"Cara al sol\\"?.\\" Libertad Digital.

In the general election of February 16, 1936, Falange won only 0.7% of the vote; but the wave of instability which greeted the victory of the Popular Front--a left-wing coalition of anarchists, communists, socialists, liberal republicans like the radicals, and others--caused an influx of new members, and the minuscule party grew to more than 40,000 members by July. = Imprisonment and death = On March 14, 1936, he was arrested in Madrid and charged with illegal possession of firearms (at a time that Spain was awash in privately held weapons held by all political factions).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ31rIUTDBo Nine weeks later he was transferred to the prison in Alicante. In both Madrid and in Alicante, he was able to maintain intermittent secret contact with the Falange leadership and, several times, with General Emilio Mola. On October 3 he was charged with conspiracy against the Republic and military insurrection, both capital offences, even though he had been imprisoned long before the insurrection of July 18. Primo de Rivera conducted his own defence.\\"Interrogatorio de Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera y Sa√©nz de Heredia,en el proceso celebrado en Alicante, el 16 de Noviembre de 1936.\\" Obras Completas de Jos√© Antonio. Rumbos. On November 18 he was found guilty by a people's tribunal and sentenced to death by firing squad. The three career judges who participated in the trial, along with the popular tribunal, asked for the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment but this was rejected by the majority of government ministers (the two ministers from Izquierda Republicana voted against the death sentence).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ-_tYNh3Fc The sentence was carried out on November 20 by local authorities in Alicante. It is said by some that the Republic offered the Nationalists a prisoner exchange involving Primo de Rivera and a son of the Republic's head of government Francisco Largo Caballero\\"Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera y Falange Espa√±ola.\\" Turismo y Arte. and that Franco turned down the offer. Others contend that it was the Republican government who rejected the deal of the Nationalists and that General Franco approved several failed commando raids on the Alicante prison to try to rescue Jos√© Antonio. Either way the death of the founder of Falange rid the general of a formidable rival. Perhaps tellingly, it was well known that the two men disliked each other.Eduardo Palomar Bar√≥: \\"Jos√© Antonio visto por Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er.\\" General√≠simo Francisco Franco.

During the course of the war the marginal party gained ascendancy partly as a result of its prominent role in the brutal repression that took place behind Nationalist lines.Floren Dimas, 2003: \\"El papel de la Falange en la represi√≥n franquista.\\" Art√≠culos y Documentos. Foro por la Memoria. Nevertheless, the party lost autonomy and was made wholly subservient to the will of General Franco in 1937 when he had Primo de Rivera's temporary replacement, Manuel Hedilla Larrey, thrown in jail, tried and sentenced to death (although his sentence was commuted),\\"Manuel Hedilla Larrey.\\" Biograf√≠as y Vidas. decreed the merging of the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS with the Carlist traditionalists through the Unification Decree, and became the national chief of the new party, FET y de las JONS. The reign of Francisco Franco nurtured a convenient cult of personality around the dead figure of Primo de Rivera whom Falangists dubbed \\"El Ausente\\" (The Missing One).Diccionario de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola . Rojo y Azul. This name was created during the period after de Rivera's execution but before this was officially confirmed to the Nationalist public at large by its leadership on 18th July 1938. While the Falangist leadership knew the truth, they chose to keep it a secret for fear of the impact it would have on morale, though rumours of his death would continue to circulate for the period. Thus until this date many Falangists had lived in hope that de Rivera would still return (commonly saying \\"when Jos√© Antonio comes back\\") and began referring to him as \\"The Absent One\\", a reference to the Falange's tradition of calling \\"present!\\" when the names of the fallen were read out.Thom√†s, Joan Maria. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera: The Reality and Myth of a Spanish Fascist Leader. Vol. 3. Berghahn Books, 2019, p.317 The founder of Falange was anointed a martyr of the \\"crusade against Marxism.\\" Notwithstanding the apparent veneration by the Francoist State, it remains true that the Missing One's demise had removed a dangerous opponent: Primo de Rivera had been Marquess, a doctor of civil law, a political thinker; Franco owned no comparable pedigree, no comparable education and no personal ideology. At the end of the war in 1939, the mortal remains of Primo de Rivera were carried on the shoulders of Falangist relay teams from Alicante to Madrid (a three- hundred kilometre journey) and provisionally interred at El Escorial. The church had contained the pantheon of Spanish monarchs but Primo de Rivera was buried directly in front of the altar...Payne, Stanley G., and Jes√∫s Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.218 In 1959, they were exhumed and re-interred in the gargantuan basilica of the Valley of the Fallen, located in the Guadarrama mountain range, not far from El Escorial.. The postwar cult of personality had two ubiquitous icons. The first, a funereal slab placed on the external wall of many churches and cathedrals which bore the crowning inscription, Ca√≠dos por Dios y por Espa√±a (\\"Fallen for God and for Spain\\"), followed by a list of local Nationalists killed during the war; Primo de Rivera's name headed every list.Agencias. \\"\\"El Ca√≠dos por Dios y por la patria seguir√° presente en Pedro Bernardo.\\" Diario P√∫blico. Madrid. June 24, 2009. The second was the rallying cry, \\"Jos√© Antonio--¬°Presente!,\\" a figurative reply to an imaginary roll call invoking his ghostly attendance or immanence. With the arrival of democratic rule, the legacy of Primo de Rivera and the cult of personality created by the Spanish state started to wane circumspectly. In 1981, the Madrid City Council moved to reinstate the original name of its grand avenue, the Gran V√≠a, which Franco had renamed \\"Avenida Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera\\" in 1939. However, as late as March 2005, the Guadalajara City Council removed a memorial to the founder of Falange under cover of darkness.'El Ayuntamiento de Guadalajara retir√≥ esta madrugada las estatuas de Franco y Jos√© Antonio que hab√≠a en la ciudad .\\" Lukor. March 23, 2005. Ideology He espoused an elitist understanding of politics, influenced by the ideas of Ortega y Gasset. His political thought fascistised as he progressively radicalised in an anti- conservative direction. Primo de Rivera put much faith on corporativism, one of the few early Falangist tenets framed in positive terms, adopted from Italian Fascism. Regarding political violence, he early alluded to what he famously termed as the \\"dialectics of fists and guns\\", already stating during the Falange foundation event at the Teatro de la Comedia, that in order to fulfill the desired cultural and historical regeneration of Spain, \\"if this has to be achieved through violence, we shall not be stopped by violence\\". Willing to offer an alternative to the most basic fundamentals behind liberal democracy, he also non-accidentally addressed some words of scorn to \\"that terrible man who was called Juan Jacobo Rousseau\\" during the foundational meeting of the Falange. Just as other Falangists, Primo de Rivera partially embraced the sense of Castilianist essentialism from the Generation of '98, but, conversely, he was also distinctly aware of the cultural plurality of the peoples in Spain, and thus the Falangist national project for Spain was framed following the orteguian legacy as one of \\"unity of destiny in the universal\\". It has been noted that at some point he benignly put his hopes on politicians far from his own Fascist stances such as republican Manuel Aza√±a (in this case for a very brief time) or socialist Indalecio Prieto as potential candidates to alleviate his self-imposed burden for \\"saving\\" the country. According to √Ålvarez Chillida, Primo de Rivera's written works did not feature a marked antisemitism when compared to other Falangist leaders.

The hamlet is approached using the avenue that links Buckingham with Stowe Park. History The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Ceacca's moor'. It has been suggested though that the first part of the name could stem from the ancient word ceacce, meaning 'hill'. The hamlet was first recorded in manorial rolls in 1241 as Chakemore. It has also occasionally been recorded as Chalkmore. Main Street in Chackmore was originally flanked by thatched cottages, only two of which retain thatched roofs following a fire that swept the entire length of the village some one hundred and fifty years ago. The main thoroughfare was dissected by a huge tree known as the Cross Tree, which served as a moot or meeting place for the villagers. This was removed some time during the last 20 years and replaced by a roundabout. A lane running off of the main street eventually becomes a cul- de-sac called The Maltings. This suggests there was once a brewery somewhere nearby though no records exist to that effect. Opposite the primary school a cobbler named Billy Ayers used to work from a small shed in his garden and his clientele included not only the local residents but also the pupils and staff of Stowe School. This provided an extremely busy and important cottage industry and was operational up until the mid-1970s. There are several listed buildings located on Main Street, some dating from the 17th and 18th century.British Listed Buildings website Education And Amenities The village is home to St James and St John Church of England Primary School which was formed in September 2006 by merging Akeley Church of England School and Chackmore Church of England School, and by extending the merged school from a first school to a combined school. Chackmore also has a playschool situated within the grounds of St. James and St. John Primary School. The playschool is run by a voluntary committee and takes children from 2 years old to 4 years old. The playschool was founded in 2002 with the help of Lottery funding. The village also has a pub called the Queens Head and a parish hall, which was re- done in 2010 with a sum of money from the will of Mr T.Clinton. The parish hall is also used for polling stations. Parish Chackmore is located in the civil parish of Radclive-cum-Chackmore, in the district of Aylesbury Vale. Chackmore is the larger of the two villages and is estimated to have a population of around 180 out of a combined parish total of 236.

Background Lawrence was born in June 1806 into an Ulster-Scots family at Matara, Ceylon. Both his parents were from Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. His mother Letitia was the daughter of The Rev. George Knox from County Donegal, while his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander William Lawrence, was born the son of a mill owner from Coleraine, County Londonderry, entered the service of the British Army and achieved distinction at the Siege of Seringapatnam.James Wills, The Irish Nation: Its History and Its Biography, Volume 4, A. Fullarton, 1876, p96 The Lawrences had seven sons, the first died in infancy and the fifth at the age of eighteen. The remaining five all achieved distinction in India, of which Sir George Lawrence and Lord Lawrence would achieve particular fame. In 1812, Lawrence, along with his elder brothers Alexander and George, was sent to Foyle College in Derry, a city in Ulster, where their uncle Rev. James Knox was headmaster. In 1818 he rejoined his parents in Bristol where they had since settled, and completed his schooling there.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M.

He soon saw action in the First Anglo-Burmese War, and at the age of 18 Lawrence commanded a battery forming part of the Chittagong column which General Joseph Morrison led over the jungle-covered hills of Arakan. He served for two years in Burma, until the expedition was decimated by fever, and Lawrence nearly perished to the illness.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p392 He returned to Dum Dum, before being sent first to Penang and then Canton to convalesce. As these changes in climate failed to affect his health for the better, he was invalided back to England.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p392 During his furlough in England, he resided with his family in Bristol, where he would first meet his future wife Honoria Marshall, until the opportunity arose in the autumn of 1828 to assist in the trigonometrical survey in Ireland.Buckland, Charles Edward, Dictionary of Indian Biography, 1906, London : S. Sonnenschein, p246 Lawrence set sail for India on 2 September 1829 with his brother John, who had recently completed his studies at the East India Company College.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.22 The brothers parted company in Calcutta, and Lawrence rejoined his regiment in Karnal on the Sikh frontier, where his elder brother George was now stationed.Buckland, Charles Edward, Dictionary of Indian Biography, 1906, London : S. Sonnenschein, p246 In 1831 he was transferred to the horse artillery in Cawnpore and the following year he passed examinations in Hindustani and Persian with the aim of earning a civil service posting.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p393 =Revenue Survey of India= Henry Montgomery Lawrence, engraving after unknown photographer. NPG D5026 In 1833 he was appointed an assistant to the Revenue Survey of India by Lord William Bentinck based at Gorakhpur. He was tasked with mapping out and marking the boundaries of villages and fields in certain large districts, classifying them in accordance with the quality of soil and extent of holdings and to investigate and record the rights of claimants.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.40 He soon perceived the urgent need for more canals, and more and better roads, urging that \\"the farmer, the soldier, the policeman, the traveller, the merchant, all want more roads. Cut roads in every direction.\\"Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.40 During his time with the Survey, Lawrence was known for his zeal, discouragement of cheating and at times harsh treatment of bribe taking. In 1837, the secretary to the Board of Revenue remarked to the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Provinces:Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.43 Lawrence went on to successfully accomplish this guarantee, and earned the nickname \\"Gunpowder\\" from James Thomason for his \\"explosive force which shattered all obstacles\\". In 1835 his father died, and as such his military pension also ceased, leaving his mother Letitia penniless. Lawrence, along with his brothers, took on the responsibility of remitting allowances for their mother. In July 1837, his sweetheart Honoria Marshall arrived in Hooghly and they married at the Mission Church in Calcutta on 21 August. Honoria accompanied Lawrence to Gorakpur where she became an enthusiastic assistant in his work.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, pp-48-50 By the close of 1837, Lawrence had completed his work in Gorakpur and set out for Allahabad the next district on his list. He continued with the survey until August 1838 when he was ordered to stand ready to rejoin his troop amid talk of war with Afghanistan. =Ferozepore= In October 1838, in the run up to the First Anglo-Afghan War, Lawrence departed Allahabad to join Alexander Burnes's Horse Artillery, part of an 'Army of the Indus.'John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p402 At the time he received an offer of a hundred rupees a month from a Calcutta paper to act as a correspondent during the war, agreeing on the condition of anonymity, that he would not supply any information that was not above board, and that the money would be divided between the Calcutta Orphan Asylum and the Benevolent Institution.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, pp-63 When the army was ordered to stand fast, he instead became assistant to Sir George Russell Clerk, adding to his political experience in the management of the district of Ferozepore.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p402 At Ferozepore, Lawrence was collector, magistrate, civil and military engineer, universal provider and paymaster to troops that passed through the district. He was called upon to settle a boundary dispute on the British side of the Sutlej, and so impressed where neighbouring chiefs of his sagacity and fairness a number of barons across the border and in the Cis-Sutlej states sought his assistance to settle their own boundary disputes.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, pp-65 In June 1839 Maharaja Ranjit Singh died and talk of war with the Sikh Empire began. Lawrence, spent much of the period acquainting himself with knowledge of the history and culture of the Sikh Empire, and penned a romance of the Punjab to aid those who cared to learn more about the region.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.66 =Peshawar= When news of disaster came from Kabul in November 1841 he was at first tasked with pushing up supports for the relief of Sir Robert Sale and the garrison of Jalalabad. He was to prepare the way for a relief force through the four hundred miles between Ferozepur and the Khyber. He requested the assistance of guns from the Sikh authorities, who agreed on the condition of the willingness of the gunners themselves, who at first proved unwilling. He relocated to Peshawar where he was responsible for getting the Sikh allies in hand, and helping to prepare the army of Sir George Pollock. He had hoped to accompany Pollock in the Kabul Expedition in 1842, however his fellow agent Frederick Mackeson was preferred. Instead he was allowed to remain with his old corps until the Khyber Pass was won.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p404 At the conclusion of the war, he returned to Ferozepur where the Governor General of India met the victorious armies of Pollock, Sale and Nott. In January 1843, Lawrence left Ferozepur when he was appointed superintendent of Dehradun. It soon emerged that military officers were barred from this post, and so he was instead transferred to Ambala as the assistant to the envoy at Lahore. Soon after taking charge, he was instructed to lead a military expedition in Khytul and was thereafter ordered to administer the region. Despite his short time in Khytul, Lawrence introduced a number of reforms including reduced taxes, the abolition of forced labour, a prompt system of justice and punishing bribery and corruption. In addition where required he remitted the land tax owed by a cultivator until he could improve his condition, and made the cultivator undertake public works such as digging wells in lieu of payment.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, pp.85-86 Lawrence soon became somewhat disappointed by his lack of recognition for his contribution in the war and constant moving between jobsJohn William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p404 Later that year however he was elevated to the rank of Major and appointed to the well- salaried and prestigious post of the Resident of Nepal.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p404 Resident at Nepal Lawrence arrived in Kathmandu in November 1843, leaving his wife behind as European women were not allowed to enter the Kingdom at that present time.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.89 Shortly after arriving, as a gesture of goodwill, Honoria was granted a rare exception to join her husband. During his time in Nepal, under instruction not to interfere in the internal administration of the Kingdom, Lawrence devoted much of his time to literary pursuits, ably assisted by his wife.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p408 He wrote a defence of Sir William Macnaghten which included passages foreshadowing the later mutiny of 1857, in which he lamented the blind self- confidence of British policy in India, the unpreparedness for disaffection, a lack of supplies, and the weakness of British garrisons. He also became a contributor to the Calcutta Review edited by Sir John Kaye. In an article titled the Military Defence of our Indian Empire, he insisted on the need for the Government to be ready for war at all times, a view which was challenged by his editor. It was whilst in Kathmandu that Lawrence and his wife first proposed the idea of homes in the cooler hills for the children of serving British officers.Gibbon, Frederick P, The Lawrences of the Punjab, London, J.M. Dent & co., 1908, p.100-104 Punjab Henry Montgomery Lawrence, after photograph by Ahmed Ali Khan, 1857. NPG In 1845, instability in the Sikh Empire led to growing tensions with neighbouring provinces. Lawrence's articles in the Calcutta Review had caught the attention of Henry Hardinge, the new Governor-General of India, who was impressed by his knowledge of the region.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p409 Hardinge appointed Lawrence as his political assistant following the death of Major George Broadfoot at the start of the First Anglo-Sikh War.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p411 He was present at the decisive Battle of Sobraon which brought the war to a conclusion. As political agent, he responded to allegations that leading Sikh chiefs had betrayed their countrymen at Sobraon and sold the battle to the British, denying any knowledge of treachery on the part of the Sikh chiefs and interference by British officials.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p409 =Lahore Durbar= Following Sobraon, Lawrence counselled the Governor-General not to annex the Punjab but instead reconstruct the Sikh Empire, fenced in and fortified by British bayonets.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p409 This was provided for in the Treaty of Lahore, whereby a British garrison was to be based in Lahore to further this purpose. Lawrence spent the next three months as the agent in Lahore. In his diaries, Lawrence would later write of his intentions in his role:John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p418 During this time, he assisted in the sale of Kashmir to Gulab Singh, the Raja of Jammu as war indemnity, a move which caused considerable unrest in Lahore. When a rebellion broke out, presumed to have been instigated by Lal Singh in support of the existing Sikh governor, Lawrence personally accompanied a body of Sikh troops to Kashmir in support of Gulab Singh.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p416 Through his support of Gulab Singh, Lawrence was able to wield significant power over the new Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir, inducing the leader to abolish sati, female infanticide and child slavery throughout his dominions, and attracting considerable financial support for his later philanthropic endeavours.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p416 The terms of the initial treaty had permitted British troops to remain until the end of 1846. However at the request of the Lahore Durbar that troops remain until the new Maharajah reached 16, the Treaty of Bhairowal was signed. A key condition of the Treaty was that a Resident British officer, with an efficient establishment of assistants, was to be appointed by the Governor-General to remain at Lahore, with \\"full authority to direct and control all matters in every Department of the State. Maulvi Sayed Rajab Ali of Jagraon (Ludhiana Dist) a close confidant of Sir Henry Lawrence played an important role in these negotiations\\".Article 2 of the Treaty of Bhyroval Lawrence was appointed to the role of Resident, and began assembling a team of officer assistants, who would become known as Henry Lawrence's \\"Young Men\\". =Interlude= In 1848, following a year of relative peace in the Punjab, Lawrence was granted sick leave and accompanied Henry Hardinge to England where he was made a Knight Commander of the Bath on Hardinge's recommendation.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p422 In March, Lawrence was officially replaced as the British Resident at Lahore by Sir Frederick Currie. The murder of two of his assistants, Patrick Vans Agnew and W.A. Anderson in Multan, and the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War hastened his return to India.Colonel George Bruce Malleson, The Decisive Battles Of India From 1746 To 1849 Inclusive, Pickle Partners Publishing, 15 Aug 2014 He was present at the Battle of Chillianwala, and although lacking an official capacity, he played a key role in persuading Lord Gough not to withdraw his troops after the battle. The war was won by the East India Company and the Punjab became a province of the Bengal Presidency. =Board of Administration= The new Punjab province was to be administered under the superintendence of a Board of Administration and Lawrence was made its president. He was assisted on the Board by his brother John and Charles Grenville Mansel, under whom he retained his troop of hand picked assistants. As President, Lawrence travelled extensively in the province, each year travelling three or four months, each day riding usually thirty to forty miles. At each station he would visit public offices, gaols, bazaars, receive visitors of all ranks, inspect the Punjab regiments and police, and receive daily petitions sometimes numbering in the hundreds.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p431 In his diary he noted that under his administration they had raised five regiments of fine cavalry and infantry, six regiments of very good military police and 2,700 cavalry police, planted thousands of trees, ensured serais were ever-present on main roads, police posts every two or three miles, and steps were taken in education. Despite the success of the Board of Administration, internal tensions had arisen and the new Governor General, Lord Dalhousie, preferred to invest power in the hands of single administrator. Part of the reason for this was Lawrence's insistence on compensating the Sikh nobility and aristocracy who had suffered ruin following defeat in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Lawrence, mindful of the potential for discontent to be sewn by disgruntled aristocrats, liberally offered financial assistance, a policy opposed by both his brother John and DalhousieJohn William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p431 Both Lawrence and his brother John tendered their resignation, however Dalhousie chose John as his new Lieutenant-Governor. Dalhousie explained his decision by stating that after some years of military administration in the Punjab, there was now a need for a civil administration to which John Lawrence would be more suited. The decision deeply hurt Henry who felt he had proved his self-taught civil administrative abilities over the course of the previous twenty years. Oude and Rajputana Lawrence began his new role as the Governor-General's Agent in Rajputana in 1853. Much of his energy was devoted to two principal causes, the abolition of widow-burning in Rajputana and reforming the prison system.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p437 Whilst in Rajputana his wife Honoria died and his health began to fail, prompting first a desire to succeed Sir James Outram as Resident at Lucknow, for which he was overlooked for a civilian, and thereafter a desire to undertake leave to England. In 1856, Oudh had been annexed by the East India Company on the grounds of internal maladministration. The following March, Lawrence was appointed to the prestigious post of Chief Commissioner of Oudh. Under his predecessor Colville Coverley Jackson, much of the local aristocracy had fallen from grace and widespread unrest had come to the fore. An added concern was growing discontent amongst the Sepoys of the Bengal Army, a large proportion of whom were drawn from Oudh, and thus able to command support in the province.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p450 Lawrence had long taken an interest in the sepoy army, noting its defects, and advising successive Governor-Generals of the need to listen to concerns of the soldiery and implement reform, and as such was weary that any insurrection amongst the sepoys could instigate a wider civil unrest.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p452 Siege of Lucknow In May 1857, two months after assuming his post in Oudh, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 commenced. Lawrence earned praise for the prompt and decisive handling of an insurrection of an irregular native regiment near Lucknow, and was in turn awarded full military and civil authority by the Governor-General, Lord Canning. He arranged for a garrison in Lucknow of some 1700 men, and took refuge in the British residency. Such was his assured handling of the crisis, that the British government and Board of Directors of the East India Company found it necessary to nominate him as provisional Governor-General of India in the event of the death or resignation of Lord Canning.John William Kaye, Lives of Indian Officers, 1899, W. H. Allen, p474 On the morning of 30 June, despite being weak and exhausted with illness, he led a march towards Nawabgunj to confront some mutinous regiments approaching Lucknow. Around six or seven miles from Lucknow he encountered 15,000 soldiers with thirty guns and soon after the artillery of the Oude irregular force deserted his command and joined the mutineers. Significantly outnumbered Lawrence was forced into a retreat, suffering heavy losses. On their return, the Residency was soon besieged by mutineers and the Siege of Lucknow commenced. On 1 July, a shell burst into his quarters in the upper part of the Residency, and despite pleas from his officers he refused to move his quarters to a safer area. The following day, whilst lying on a couch, a shell burst beside him and shattered his thigh. Dr Joseph Fayrer was summoned to provide consultation, and decided that amputation would only increase his suffering, and was likely to shorten his life. Fayrer gave him three days to live. Lawrence lingered until the second day, and died at approximately eight in the morning on 4 July 1857. He was buried that same evening in a soldier's grave, and it is said that not a single officer saw the lowering of his body into the ground so furious was the fighting raging at the time. When Lawrence was critically injured, he is supposed to have said to those around him: \\"Put on my tomb only this; Here lies Henry Lawrence who tried to do his duty.\\" This epitaph appears on his tombstone at the Residency graveyard. Educational institutions High cross Sir Henry Lawrence Memorial in The Residency, Lucknow Lawrence established institutions for the education of the children of British soldiers, known as the Lawrence Military Asylums, at four places in British India. Three of these institutions survive today as the prestigious Lawrence School, Sanawar (HP, India), Lawrence School, Lovedale (TN, India) and Lawrence College, Ghora Gali (Murree, Pakistan): the fourth, which does not survive, was at Mount Abu, in present-day Rajasthan. Following the Disruption of 1843, along with Sir James Outram, Lawrence supported Reverend Alexander Duff in establishing the Free Church Institution in Calcutta, as a rival institution to the General Assembly's Institution, which had been founded by Duff in 1830.Pitlochry Church of Scotland's obituary of Alexander Duff The missionary‚Äôs mission in Calcutta These two institutions would later be merged to form the Scottish Churches College, known since 1929 (when the Church of Scotland was unified) as Scottish Church College.

The highly popular children's cartoon first emerged as a series of television short films as well as a weekly half-page Sunday strip in 1966, before being published periodically in its own comic magazine since 1973. Andr√©asson did all the artwork himself until 1975 and wrote all the comics until 1990. Francisco Tora did all the illustrations from 1976 until he was joined by Bo Michanek in 1983. Several new writers and illustrators were hired in the early 1990s, including Claes Reimerthi, Anna Friberger and Tony Cronstam. Andr√©asson continued to do the magazine cover illustrations until 1992. The series somewhat changed direction when Bamse had children, specifically triplets, in 1982. He had a fourth child in 1986, and his friend Lille Skutt had one at the same time; this saw the series focus more on family, while also discussing other values such as gender equality. In 1989, the character Skalman noticed that Bamse's fourth child Brumma had some intellectual disability, later defined as Asperger's syndrome, which again brought up the subject of equality. The children did develop in real time within the magazine, but seem to have been fixed in age since around 1990. They are now around nine years old, in a narratively advantageous eternal state as third-graders. Both the early Sunday strips and the early magazines have since been reprinted as glossy hardbound volumes. In 1998, the theme park 'Bamses V√§rld' (\\"Bamse's World\\") started as an attraction at the Kolm√•rden Zoo, with theater performances, restaurant and houses from the comic.  Characters  = Protagonists = * Bamse, the main character, is a brown bear who becomes the world's strongest bear by eating a type of honey called dunderhonung (lit. \\"thunder-honey\\"), specially prepared for him by his grandmother. (Almost) anyone else who eats it, apart from Bamse's pet bee and his daughter Brumma, ends up with three days of stomach ache. Bamse is also the kindest bear in the world (according to the comic), and is often seen helping those in need. The name Bamse comes from a Scandinavian word for \\"bear\\" or \\"teddy bear\\". \\"Bamse\\" can also translate to \\"giant\\" or \\"big one\\", though that would be something of a misnomer, as Bamse is rather diminutive in size compared to many of the other characters. * Brummelisa (\\"Growlelisa\\") is the daughter of a forester who could always rely on Bamse helping out; soon they fell in love. In 1981, they all went on a boat trip to the north of Scandinavia (financed by individual odd jobs), climaxing in a view of the midnight sun (an anti-climax to grandma's cat and mouse who expected it to look different). Back home, Brummelisa and Bamse staged a secret wedding and became parents to triplets: Brum (\\"Growl\\"), Teddy, Nalle-Maja (\\"Teddy-Maja\\"). Brum is artistically gifted, but somewhat shy. Teddy spends a lot of time by himself, and loves reading and learning. Nalle-Maja is the most extrovert kid, and loves sports and activities. Once their personalities began to shine through Teddy gravitated towards Skalman who noticed what the others failed to; Teddy's clumsiness stems from his eyesight and only needed a pair of glasses. Nalle-Maja has inherited more than just her father's looks; she also inherited his ability to get strong from the dunderhonung. To prevent her from injuring herself or her brothers, Bamse's grandmother attempted a new dunderhonung recipe to avoid making her strong. She partially succeeded; Nalle-Maja draws strength from it, but also winds up with the stomach ache. Late 1985 the triplets were informed on the arrival of another sibling; Brumma (\\"Growla\\"), who - when eating Dunderhonung - neither gets strong nor is affected by the stomach ache. * Lille Skutt (\\"Little Hop\\") is Bamse's and Skalman's best friend. He is a very fast but notoriously frightened white rabbit with a red bow tie. However, his ability to run quick and jump far (not to mention braving his fears whenever someone he cares about is in danger) has saved his friends' skins on more than one occasion. Lille Skutt is the village postman, albeit on a part-time basis. He also works part-time as the head chef of the local restaurant. Like Bamse, Skutt ended up marrying his girlfriend; Nina Kanin (\\"Nina Rabbit\\"), best friend with Brummelisa. Nina and Skutt became parents to a son Mini-Hopp (\\"Mini-Hop\\"), a hyperactive kid with an apparent lack of fear. He has eight siblings including Happ. Happ is a gay rabbit. He and his life-partner Lille Sixten have adopted a little girl named Suddan who is around Mini-Hopp's age.http://www.nytid.fi/2013/10/varldens-mest-politiska- bjorn/https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-ar-det-forsta-lesbiska-paret-i- bamse/ * Skalman (\\"Shellman\\" / \\"Shellback\\") is an ingenious tortoise who invents all sorts of things, including spacecraft and time machines. He stores just about anything in his carapace except for locomotives, spaceships or atlantic steamboats (and also firewood, due to him getting splinters in the back). Skalman seems to be a polyphasic sleeper, and according to himself, his best invention is the food-and-sleep clock, whose calls he follows slavishly, even at times when sleep seems highly inappropriate. To this date, he has only ignored the alarm call a few times, including the discovery of a dinosaur's egg, the birth of Bamse's children, and a state of deep depression due to the false belief that his carelessness had caused the death of Bamse's children. None of the other characters come close to Skalman's intellectual level and he is sometimes seen playing chess with himself (he has stated that he has met and beaten the chess world champion). Rune Andr√©asson has stated that he brought the food-and-sleep clock into the series for much the same reason as the dunderhonung; during a dangerous adventure, Skalman could just pull something out of his carapace to save them, or help the trio with his intellect. That's when the food-and-sleep clock calls Skalman to sleep, forcing Bamse and Lille Skutt to think on their own. * Vargen (\\"The Wolf\\") is a black wolf who was the original main villain (later anti-hero) of the comic; a criminal and a bully who at one point was named \\"World Champion of Evil\\" by his colleagues, but who later on proved to not be such a bad person if given a chance. Vargen grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and was introduced to a life of crime by his villainous stepfathers. When they eventually ended up in prison he knew that it was time to make a fresh start but his past turned against him as nobody wanted to give him the chance to better his life. Bamse, however, did, and eventually managed to reform the wolf by consistently treating him with kindness. Vargen occasionally slips back into his old ways, but as far as the other wolves are concerned he blew it by joining Bamse's club. = Antagonists = * Kr√∂sus Sork (\\"Croesus Vole\\") is an often cruel capitalist and secondary villain of the comic; born as a banker's son he was forced to play second fiddle to his brother Sl√∂sus (rough translation \\"Wasteus\\") who couldn't put a foot wrong. After Sl√∂sus later won a lottery (ticket no 88), Kr√∂sus forged his own ticket (no 89), switched the tickets, claimed Sl√∂sus' prize and let the unknowing Sl√∂sus get detained for forgery while coming to pick up his prize. Sl√∂sus was devastated to discover the truth after his release and they had a falling-out. Meanwhile, Kr√∂sus built up his fortune with blood money and let other voles do the dirty jobs. While Kr√∂sus has on occasion showed some small shred of conscience, he is still by far the most amoral and ruthless of the comic's villains; willing to do just about anything for profit. * Kapten Buster (\\"Captain Buster\\") and his three clumsy sideman pirates, Rusken, Slusken and Stollen. (Approximate translation: \\"Rover, Sloven and Silly\\".) They are largely incompetent and unsuccessful, and have mostly given up their life at sea thanks to a tendency towards seasickness. * Knocke & Smocke, (\\"Knocker & Socker\\") two large thugs with flat caps who have performed several unsuccessful criminal attempts. They usually rely mainly on brute force and are generally outwitted by Skalman or others. * Reinard is a sly fox and the newest main villain of the comic; who became an addition to the crew in 2006. He is shown to engage in all kinds of villainy, from shoplifting to explicit attempts on Bamse's life (which, curiously, has resulted in no retribution, or even rebuking, from Bamse's side).  Moral values and criticism  The magazine has educational goals. On special \\"school\\" pages, the characters educate the reader about animals, cultures, the Universe, and other subjects. They often deal with superstition, and Skalman's sceptical views (\\"I only believe in what I know\\") wins over those of his more naive friends. On the other hand, beings like trolls, tomtar and dragons exist on a very real plane in most of the stories. As the series have evolved, the values expressed have become more general and less ideological. A fact sheet written and published by Andreasson in 1983 following a trip to the People's Republic of China became very controversial as it seemed to praise Mao Zedong's dictatorial rule as a \\"liberation\\" and claimed that \\"nobody's starving anymore\\" in China under Communist single-party rule. It was later edited heavily when the adventure was reprinted in 2004. Bamse and his friends are very clear about their views. They are strongly opposed to racism, bullying and violence. Bamse is not only the strongest bear in the world, but also the kindest, often repeating his slogan \\"Nobody gets better from being beaten\\". Bamse's own world seems to have strong implications of anarchism or libertarian socialism, combining private ownership with communitarian solidarity (from most of the characters), though a single policeman, Pontus Kask (named for his classic-style policeman's helmet, or \\"kask\\" in Swedish) and a small prison exists. The original villain, a black wolf simply called Vargen (\\"The Wolf\\"), became a friend of Bamse after consistently being treated kindly. The only villain that is depicted as unredeemable is Kr√∂sus Sork (\\"Croesus Vole\\"), a crude capitalist who will do practically anything for money.  Films and other media  Six animated black-and-white short films were produced for television in 1966. In 1972, seven more animated shorts were shown in colour. Another two shorts were released in 1981, and a direct-to- video movie became available in 1991. The later colour films have aired frequently on TV in Sweden, and have been released on VHS and DVD. The black and white films had been unavailable to the general public for a long time, but were released on DVD by late 2006. The colour movies were low-budget productions with actor Olof Thunberg narrating and voicing all characters, but are considered to be classics. The musical theme, composed by Sten Carlberg, is easily recognised by most Swedes. In 1993, a Game Boy game (in Swedish) was published loosely based on the Bamse characters. The game received generally poor reviews; it was in fact little more than a sprite replacement of Beam Software's Baby T-Rex, which explains the game's setting. The \\"Bamse version\\" is not the only time this happened; the game went through the same procedure for other regions featuring other characters. The \\"Bamse version\\" has not been officially released outside Sweden. In October 2006, forty years after Bamse was created, Ola Andr√©asson, the son of creator Rune Andr√©asson announced that an animated feature film would be made, featuring better animation, a full voice cast, and a budget of SEK 25 million. An estimated release date of 2012 for the film was proposed. It was finally released in 2014 as Bamse and the Thief City. The film was followed by Bamse and the Witch's Daughter in 2016.http://www.sluggerfilm.com/bamse-and-the-witchs-daughter  Translations  In the 1960s, there were a few translations of the series \\"Bamses skola\\" (\\"Bamse's school\\"), where the characters were given English names: *Bamse - Bamsy *Skalman - Professor Shellback *Lille Skutt - Little Frisky *Vargen - Willie *Farmor - Granny *Katten Janson (literally Janson the Cat) - Sooty In this translation, the dunderhonung was given the name magic honey. However, in the 1980s, Andr√©asson referred to it in English as thunder-honey, which is the literal translation also used in the Netherlands and Belgium (donderhoning). In the cancelled movie Bamse and the Time-Travel Machine from 2009, the names were translated differently: *Bamse - Bamse *Skalman - Shellman *Lille Skutt - Little Skip *Kr√∂sus Sork - Victor Vole *Dunderhonung - Superhoney  References   External links  *Bamse - Official site *Official site for Bamses v√§rld Category:1966 establishments in Sweden Category:Animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1966 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966 Category:Comics about bears Category:Comics about animals Category:Fictional anthropomorphic characters Category:Fictional bears Category:Fictional Swedish people Category:1966 Swedish television series debuts Category:Animated television series about bears Category:Children's television characters Category:Television shows adapted into comics Category:1966 comics debuts Category:Comics adapted into animated films Category:Comics adapted into video games Category:Comics based on television series Category:Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Swedish comic strips Category:Swedish comics adapted into films Category:Swedish comics characters Category:Male characters in television Category:Male characters in animation Category:Male characters in comics ","title":"Bamse"},{"id":"401564","text":"Charndon is a hamlet and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England.

It is the third largest general- interest newspaper in Spain, and the oldest newspaper still operating in Madrid. History and profile ABC was first published in Madrid on 1 January 1903 by Torcuato Luca de Tena y √Ålvarez-Ossorio. The founding publishing house was Prensa Espa√±ola, which was led by the founder of the paper, Luca de Tena. The paper started as a weekly newspaper, turning daily in June 1905. In 1928 ABC had two editions, one for Madrid and the other for Seville. The latter was named ABC de Sevilla. On 20 July 1936, shortly after the Spanish Civil War began, ABC in Madrid was seized by the republican government, which changed the paper's politics to support the Republicans. The same year Blanco y Negro, a magazine, became its supplement. The ABC printed in Seville was supportive of the Nationalists. In 1939 ABC in Madrid was given back to its original owners by Francisco Franco. During this period the paper was one of two major dailies in the country together with La Vanguardia. In the 1990s the publisher of ABC was Editorial Espa√±ola. The paper later moved from its historic landmark offices in Madrid by Paseo de la Castellana, which is now a shopping mall. The paper is part of Grupo Vocento, which also owns El Correo Espa√±ol, El Diario Vasco, La Verdad and Las Provincias, among the others. In the late 1970s and 1980s ABC had close connections with first Popular Alliance and later Popular Party. ABC publishes in compact-sized stapled sheets, noticeably smaller than the loose tabloid format favoured by most Spanish dailies, including El Pa√≠s and El Mundo. Its cover distinctively features a full-size picture. ABC is known for generally supporting conservative political views and defending the Spanish monarchy. The paper has also a right-wing stance. Its director since 1983, Luis Mar√≠a Ans√≥n, left the paper in 1997 to found another daily, La Raz√≥n, which initially catered to even more conservative readers. Historically, it was noted in its heavy use of photography, and the front page is typically a large photo taking up to one third of the area. Recently, it has been recognized for its coverage of Spanish culture and arts. =Archives= On 25 September 2009, ABC made its complete archives, dating back to 1903, available online, giving modern readers a chance to see contemporaneous news about the Spanish Civil War or Francisco Franco's death. Circulation and readership In February 1970 ABC had a circulation of 212,536 copies. It was 178,979 copies in February 1975, 171,382 copies in 1976, 145,162 copies in 1977 and 126,952 copies in 1978. The circulation of the paper was 135,380 copies in February 1980. The 1993 circulation of ABC was 334,317 copies, making it the second best selling newspaper in Spain. In 1994 it was again the second best selling newspaper in the country with a circulation of 321,571 copies. In the period of 1995‚Äì1996 the paper had a circulation of 321,573 copies, making again it the second best-selling paper in the country. The circulation of ABC was 292,000 copies in 2001 and 262,874 copies in 2002. The paper had a circulation of 263,000 copies in 2003, being the fourth best-selling newspaper in the country. Based on the findings of the European Business Readership Survey ABC had 5,685 readers per issue in 2006. Between June 2006 and July 2007 the daily had a circulation of 230,422 copies.

Fleeing south from the invading Mongols, in 1277 the imperial court sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (at that time known as Mei Yu or Ê¢ÖËîö). In March 1278, whilst attempting a further escape from the Mongols, the penultimate Song Dynasty Emperor Duanzong fell from a boat and almost drowned. After his rescue, he became ill and died a few months later at Mui Wo.

Chartridge is also the name of a civil parish in Chiltern District which also includes the village of Bellingdon and the hamlets of Pednor, Hundridge and Asheridge. It was created in 1899 having previously been part of the parish of Chesham. The village is 34 miles northwest of London and the closest town is Chesham to the south with which it is closely associated. Until 1899 Chartridge was part of Chesham parish and post-Second World War residential housing has resulted in ribbon development stretching out along the Chartridge Road from the town to the village. 11 miles to the northwest is the county town of Buckinghamshire, Aylesbury. History The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, 'C√¶rdan-hrycg' means Caerda's ridge, referring to the fact that the settlement sits on the top of a hill. There is no specific mention of Chartridge in the Domesday Book. In manorial rolls of 1191 it is recorded as 'Charderuge' presumed linked to the purchase of lands by Robert de Charderugge. By the late 12th century parts of Chartridge were owned by the Sifrewast family. By the 13th century it has become incorporated into the names of local landowners and is referred to in conveyances.Victoria County History Chesham British History online Accessed 23 February 2012 There was no church in Chartridge village as it was historically part of the ecclesiastical parish of Chesham. However, as early as 1311 a private house, Great Hundridge Manor, was recorded as providing a chapel dedicated to King Edward the Martyr. There has been a Baptist Chapel in the village since the 18th century. In 1811 a house was registered for meetings of the Lower Baptist Church in Chesham, now known as the Trinity Baptist Church. Today the Baptist Chapel in the village is a branch of Broadway Baptist Church in Chesham. Services commenced in the early 19th century and in 1844 land close to the Bell pub was given for a chapel which was subsequently replaced by a new chapel in 1885 that was financed by public subscription.Chesham Town Talk Winter 2011 - referenced from Bucks Free Press published 21 August 1885 , Accessed 23 February 2012 Chartridge Lodge was greatly extended by the Franklin family who lived there from 1899.

The Franklin family were also responsible for the building of several cottages within the village and conversion of a blacksmith's shop into a Reading Room in 1903 to mark the coronation of King Edward VII. Subsequently, it was given by the family to the village and on becoming the village hall was used as a concert room, clubhouse and lending library and has been overseen from that time until the present by the Trustees of Chartridge Reading Room. Due to the absence of a parish church, from its earliest days the Reading Room was also used for religious services and a Sunday School associated with St. Mary's Church, Chesham. Regular services ran from 1964 until 1974 during which it was known as St Christopher's. During the 19th century the vast majority of employment was provided by agriculture.

Income earned would have been spent in the licensed public houses, the Bell and Portobello Arms, the latter now a private house. In the early part of the 20th century there were four pheasant breeding farms due to the popularity of game shooting and convenience of improved travel by railway from London to Chesham.

He is best known as the \\"Hero of Multan\\" for his pivotal role in securing British victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Background and early life Edwardes was born at Frodesley in Shropshire on 12 November 1819, the 2nd son of the Rev. Benjamin Edwardes (1790/1-1823), rector of Frodesley, a younger son of Sir John Thomas Cholmondeley Edwardes, 8th Baronet, of Shrewsbury (1764‚Äì1816). The Edwardes Baronetcy of Shropshire had been conferred on his ancestor Sir Thomas Edwardes by King Charles I in 1644/5. Edwardes's mother died during his infancy, and from the age of four, following his father's death in 1823, he was brought up in the household of a deeply religious aunt, from whom he developed his own strongly Protestant Christian faith. At the age of ten, he was sent to a boarding school at Richmond, Surrey, where he did not early distinguish himself. He went on to study Classics and Mathematics at King's College, London, and developed there a great interest in modern literature, composing poetry and drawing. He played a prominent role in the debating society. Early service in India Having been prevented from going up to Oxford by pressure from his guardians, Edwardes determined himself on a career in India. He applied directly to Sir Richard Jenkins GCB (1785‚Äì1853), of Bicton Hall, Salop.thePeerage.com a deputy chairman of the East India Company,India Lists & India Office List, at Google books formerly of the Bombay Civil Service,http://www.glosters.tripod.com (funerary inscriptions of Indian Service officers) Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in 1837, and family friend, for a cadetship in the Bengal Infantry. He landed at Calcutta early in 1841, aged 22, and from July 1842 served as a Second Lieutenant in the 1st Bengal European Regiment, first at Dinapore and then at Karnal, a frontier station. He remained with this regiment about five years, during which time he obtained a good knowledge of the Hindustani, Urdu and Persian languages, passing exams in all 3 subjects, which qualified him for the position of interpreter, which he obtained in November 1845, aged 26. He developed a deep understanding of military, political and social affairs in India, which showed itself in his many literary contributions to the Delhi Gazette entitled \\"Brahminee Bull's letters to his Cousin John Bull\\", expressing bold political opinions often critical of British Indian policy. His essays became well-read throughout British India and particularly impressed the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army himself, Sir Hugh Gough, who appointed Edwardes a member of his personal staff. First Anglo-Sikh War Edwardes served as aide-de-camp to Gough during the First Anglo-Sikh War and fought at Mudki on 18 December 1845, where he was wounded, and at the final bloody rout of the Sikhs at Sobraon on 10 February 1846. Following the British victory, the Punjab came to be ruled by a British Resident seated at the historic capital of Lahore, supported by a Regency Council acting for the infant Maharaja Duleep Singh. In 1846, aged 27, Edwardes was appointed by the new British Resident Sir Henry Lawrence, as Assistant Resident. After three months at Lahore he was posted to the court of the Maharaja of Jammu, recently established by the British as ruler of Kashmir, divested from Punjab territorial lands following the Treaty of Lahore in 1846. Here he helped to suppress a local rebellion against the Maharaja, Gulab Singh. Founding of Edwardesabad In February 1847, aged 28, Edwardes was detached on special duty as Political Agent to the remote trans-Indus district of Bannu, where he was to improve the district's tax-revenue yield to Lahore, much lessened of late by evasion and non-payment. Here backed by a small force of Sikh troops, but largely on the strength of his own personality, he completely reformed the administration. He settled local feuds and demolished local fortresses, built roads and canals and encouraged agriculture. The town established by him was named after his death in his honour Edwardesabad, a name which gave way after independence to Bannu, unlike the surviving name of Abbottabad, which commemorates Edwardes's contemporary, General Sir James Abbott.In fact, after Abbott was posted away in April 1853 from Hazara region, Edwardes became the second/next Deputy Commissioner of this district and was responsible for formally naming the region's newly founded town after his predecessor. See Harold Lee, Brothers in the Raj: The Lives of John and Henry Lawrence, Karachi: Oxford UP, 2002, p.320, ; and Charles Allen, Soldier-Sahibs: The Men who made the North-West Frontier, London: Abacus/Time Warner UK, 2002 ed, p.206, Second Anglo-Sikh War Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes by Alfred Crowquill, c.1850. Etching, National Portrait Gallery, London (NPG D36073) The events and disturbances which grew into the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848‚Äì49 started at Multan, in southern Punjab, under the governorship of Dewan Mulraj, near which fortified town Edwardes found himself at the time, devoid of military support. Sensing that time was of the essence to prevent the rebellion spreading rapidly to the whole of the Punjab, and having no senior officer to consult, Edwardes made his response at first on his own initiative. He immediately raised a body of Pathan Irregulars and on 18 June 1848, having been joined by a force of Sikh troops, at Kineyri he routed a rebel force loyal to Dewan Mulraj. Subsequently, on 3 July, with reinforcements from his neighbouring District Officer Lt. Lake, and with troops sent by the Nawab of Bahawalpur from south of Multan, he defeated the rebels a second time at Sadusam, near Multan. Here he permanently injured his right hand in an accident with his pistol. Edwardes then forced the rebels to retreat to the fort of Multan, where they remained contained until the arrival of General William Sampson Whish and the Bombay column, whereupon, assisted by the further action of Edwardes's force, a siege was established. On 22 January 1849 Dewan Mulraj surrendered, following negotiations directed by Edwardes. Sir Henry Lawrence praised Edwardes's pivotal role in the war, stating that \\"Since the days of Clive no man had done as Edwardes\\". All had been achieved by personal initiative, without formal military training. He was commended by Gough and the Government, promoted brevet major in September 1848 and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), in October 1849. The East India Company awarded him a specially struck gold medal for services in the Punjab.Medal illustrated in Puddester, R.P. Medals of British India with Rarities and Valuations, vol.1 He returned to a hero's welcome in England and Shropshire, was thanked by both Houses of Parliament and on 12 June 1850 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) by Oxford University. He was entertained at civic banquets in London and Liverpool, and made many well- received public speeches. Whilst in England, on 9 July 1850, aged 31, he married Emma Sidney, da. of James Sidney of Richmond, Surrey. It was most probably at this time his portrait was painted by Henry Moseley, showing him dressed as an Indian nobleman, which was presented by his widow in 1905 to the National Portrait Gallery.NPG 1391 He published in 1851 an account in 2 vols. of his experiences during the war entitled A Year on the Punjab Frontier. Treaty with Afghanistan Edwardes believed that the security of British India against the designs of Russia would be improved on the North-Western Frontier by the existence of a strong and independent Afghanistan and he urged the signing of a British Treaty of Friendship with the Amir Dost Mohammad Khan. Although opposed by Sir John Lawrence, then Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, as the new ruling magistrate was known following the 1849 British annexation of Punjab, Edwardes's suggestion received the approval of the Governor General of India Lord Dalhousie. The treaty was signed by Lawrence and the Amir on 30 March 1855. It contained a strict non-interference clause which turned out to be vital in maintaining calm in the Punjab during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 2 years later, thus allowing Punjab troops to be sent away to assist in the relief of Delhi and in subsequent operations. A second treaty was signed in January 1857. Indian Rebellion of 1857 On the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at far away Meerut and Delhi, Edwardes received the sanction of Sir John Lawrence, the successor in the chief magistracy of the Punjab to his elder brother Sir Henry Lawrence, to raise native troops in the Punjab to form a moveable column to maintain order in the Punjab. Lawrence later sent the large part of these troops and other units previously raised by his brother and new units raised by himself to assist in the Siege of Delhi. It was this decisive action of Sir John Lawrence's, in taking the risk to leave the Punjab undefended, a policy opposed by Edwardes, which earned for him the sobriquet \\"The Saviour of India\\". Interlude in England Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes by William Edward Kilburn. Carte-de-Visite, 1860s. National Portrait Gallery, London (NPG x45342) Aged 40, in mid-1859 Edwardes once more returned to England, his health so greatly impaired by the continual strain of arduous work that it was doubtful whether he could ever return to India. During his stay he was created KCB, with the rank of brevet colonel; and the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Cambridge. In 1860, he was invited to speak at the Wenlock Olympian Games, when he praised their founder William Penny Brookes and the local Olympian Society's work but showed disagreement with the Greek influence of the name by publicly suggesting the games be called \\"'The Shropshire Class of British Work and Play', or anything else you will; but let it tell of English men and women.\\" Commissioner of Ambala Early in 1862, aged 43, with improved health he again returned to the Punjab, and was appointed to the prestigious Commissionership of Ambala and as agent for the Cis-Sutlej states. After holding the posts for 3 years, the health of both himself and his wife deteriorated and on 1 January 1865, aged 46, he left India for the last time. Later life and death Following his final return to England he was made Knight Commander of the Star of India (KCSI) on 24 May 1866 and promoted Major-General on 22 February 1868. He received a \\"good conduct\\" pension of ¬£100. He had been engaged for some time on writing a biography of his old chief Sir Henry Lawrence, and high expectations were held for the work, which he did not, however, live to complete, which task was performed by Herman Merivale. He suffered a bad attack of pleurisy in March 1868 from which he temporarily recovered, upon which he was offered the post of Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in March 1868. His recovery however relapsed and he died in London on 23 December 1868, aged 49, after a severe haemorrhage. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery and is commemorated by a mural tablet in Westminster Abbey and a stained glass window in the chapel of King's College London. He was survived by his wife. Christian Evangelism Edwardes was a devout Christian of the Protestant anti-ritualist variety. Perhaps one of the major criticisms of his career could be stated to be his propensity to evangelise amongst the indigenous populations of India.He rather saw himself as a 'pioneer of Christian civilisation', Allen, p.11 After the Indian Rebellion of 1857‚Äì8, caused in some measure by the sepoys' belief that their ancient religions were under attack with the sanction of the British-Indian regime, he continued, on his return to India in 1862, to enthusiastically urge the Government of India to publicly support the propagation of Christianity in India.Indeed, it is said that the 'triumphant outcome of the Rebellion' further convinced him of the righteousness of his cause and that 'the Giver of Empires is indeed God'; Allen, p.340 Reputable biographers have gone so far as to call this attitude of his \\"a considerable lack of common sense\\",.Moreman, T. R., Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He shared his strong evangelical Christian attitudes with his brother officer and close friend Brigadier-General John Nicholson.Allen, p.221 During his final period in England, he served as vice-president of the Church Missionary Society. On 19 December 1853, a meeting was arranged under the Commissioner of Peshawar, Sir Herbert Edwardes, to discuss a Christian Mission to the city.

A right-handed pitcher, McDowell played for the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and Anaheim Angels of the Major League Baseball(MLB). Nicknamed \\"Black Jack\\", he was a three time All-Star and won the American League Cy Young Award in 1993. McDowell has also been a professional musician, most notably with the rock band, Stickfigure. Baseball career =Amateur career= McDowell attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 20th round of the 1984 MLB draft, but did not sign. He chose to attend Stanford University, where he was the co-Freshman of the Year in 1985, a second-team All-American in 1986 and a third-team All-American in 1987. He led the Cardinal to the 1987 College World Series championship. =Chicago White Sox= McDowell was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the first round (fifth pick) of the 1987 amateur draft. After only six games in the minor leagues, he made his Major League debut on September 15, 1987. He pitched seven shutout innings against the Minnesota Twins that day to pick up the win. In four starts, he was 3-0 with a 1.93 ERA. In 1988, he was 5-10 with a 3.97 ERA in 26 starts for the White Sox, but in 1989, while dealing with various injuries he did not pitch in the Majors, making 16 starts for the AAA Vancouver Canadians, where he was 5-6 with a 6.13 ERA. By the early 1990s, he had established himself as one of the most dependable pitchers in the game, pitching effectively and recording over 250 innings each season from 1991 to 1993, he was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game each of those years. He won 20 games in 1992 and 22 in 1993, when he won the American League Cy Young Award and led the White Sox to the postseason (they lost in the 1993 American League Championship Series to the Toronto Blue Jays). From 1988 until 1995, his season ERA was consistently between 3.00 and 4.00, well below the league average.https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcdowja01.shtml In 1993, he set a modern (post-1950) record by recording a decision in each of his first 27 starts. =New York Yankees= After the 1994 season McDowell was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Keith Heberling and outfielder Lyle Mouton. McDowell spent one rocky season in New York with the Yankees was 15-10 with a 3.93 ERA in 30 starts. He was perhaps best known for giving the finger to the fans at Yankee Stadium while being booed off the field after getting bombed by the White Sox on July 18, 1995 in the second game of a doubleheader. McDowell was also the pitcher who gave up the walk- off, series-winning hit to Edgar Mart√≠nez in Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, scoring Joey Cora and Ken Griffey, Jr. to eliminate the Yankees from the playoffs and send the Seattle Mariners to the American League Championship Series. This, coupled with the emergence of Andy Pettite who became the Yankees' ace the following season, resulted in McDowell becoming a free agent in the offseason. =Cleveland Indians= McDowell spent 1996‚Äì1997 with the Cleveland Indians. In 1996 he was 13-9 with a 5.11 ERA in 30 starts, but in 1997 he made only six starts due to an injury, which may have been made worse by his trying to pitch through it. McDowell's injury resulted in the emergence of rookie Jaret Wright. =Anaheim Angels= He signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels in 1998 but was hampered with injuries during his time with the team. He was 5-7 with a 5.68 ERA in 18 starts over two seasons with Anaheim. He was released by the Angels after the 1999 season and retired from baseball. =Coaching career= On January 29, 2014, McDowell announced on his Facebook page that he had been hired to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers Rookie League affiliate, the Ogden Raptors, in the Pioneer League (baseball). In 2015, he was named manager of the Arizona League Dodgers. The Dodgers dismissed him after the season. On March 2, 2017, Queens University of Charlotte, in Charlotte, North Carolina, announced that McDowell would be the head coach of its new baseball team. The team competed in its first season in 2018 as a club sport before entering Division II competition in 2019. On March 27, 2020, Queens University announced that McDowell stepped down as the head coach. Music career Even during his baseball career, McDowell played guitar in various groups in the alternative rock genre, usually performing during the baseball off-season. McDowell's first band, V.I.E.W., which consisted of him and fellow baseball players Lee Plemel and Wayne Edwards, had two albums, \\"Extendagenda\\" and \\"Replace The Mind.\\" The band was formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1992. Their most notable accomplishment was touring with The Smithereens in 1992. His second band, stickfigure, consisted of McDowell, Michael Hamilton, Mike Mesaros and Frank Funaro. They produced the albums Just a Thought, Feedbag, Ape of the Kings and Memonto Mori, before the group disbanded in 2003.Stickfigure discographystickfigure bio =Discography= *Extendagenda (1991) ‚Äì V.I.E.W. *Replace the Mind (1992) ‚Äì V.I.E.W. *Just a Thought (1995) ‚Äì stickfigure *Feedbag (2001) ‚Äì stickfigure *Ape of the Kings (2002) ‚Äì stickfigure *Memonto Mori (2003) ‚Äì stickfigure In popular culture In 2008, musicians Scott McCaughey (of The Minus 5), Steve Wynn, Linda Pitmon, and Peter Buck formed The Baseball Project to pay homage to America 's greatest pastime. Their album Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails contains the song The Yankee Flipper, a tribute to their friend Jack McDowell and a confession that a long night of drinking with the musicians may have led to the infamous finger to the crowd.

It is situated about seven miles south west of Aylesbury, and about four miles north of Thame, in Oxfordshire. History The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Cerdeslai. It was originally a hamlet in the nearby parish of Crendon.It was established as a parish in its own right by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1458. Etymology The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Cerdic's clearing' or 'Cerdic's lea'. =Elite personal names= The incidence of Brittonic personal names in the royal genealogies of a number of \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" dynasties is significant. The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Brittonic name ultimately derived from Caratacus. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time.Koch, J.T., (2006) Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, , pp. 392‚Äì393.Myres, J.N.L.

He led several voyages to discover the Northwest Passage and served as pilot and captain on both Dutch and English voyages to the East Indies. He discovered the Falkland Islands in August 1592. Life and career Davis was born in the parish of Stoke Gabriel in Devon circa 1550, and spent his childhood in Sandridge Barton nearby. It has been suggested that he learned much of his seamanship as a child while plying boats along the river Dart, and went to sea at an early age. His childhood neighbours included Adrian Gilbert and Humphrey Gilbert and their half-brother Walter Raleigh. From early on, he also became friends with John Dee. Map showing Davis's northern voyages. From A life of John Davis, the navigator He began pitching a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage to the queen's secretary Francis Walsingham in 1583. Two years later, in 1585, the secretary relented and funded the expedition, which traced Frobisher's route to Greenland's east coast, around Cape Farewell, and west towards Baffin Island. In 1586 he returned to the Arctic with four ships, two of which were sent to Greenland's iceberg-calving eastern shore; the other two penetrated the strait which came to bear his name as far as 67¬∞N before being blocked by the Arctic ice cap. Sunshine attempted (and failed) to circumnavigate the island from the east.Gosch, C.C.A. Danish Arctic Expeditions, 1605 to 1620. Book I.‚ÄîThe Danish Expeditions to Greenland in 1605, 1606, and 1607; to which is added Captain James Hall's Voyage to Greenland in 1612. Hakluyt Society (London), 1897. The initially amiable approach Davis adopted to the Inuit bringing musicians and having the crew dance and play with them changed after they stole one of his anchors; they were likely irate at having been interrupted during one of their religious ceremonies. Inuit also attacked his ships in Hamilton Inlet (Labrador). A third expedition in 1587 reached 72¬∞12'N and Disko Island before unfavorable winds forced it back. On his return, Davis charted the Davis Inlet in the coast of Labrador. The log of this trip remained a textbook model for later captains for centuries. In 1588 he seems to have commanded Black Dog against the Spanish Armada. In 1589 he joined the Earl of Cumberland as part of the Azores Voyage of 1589. In 1591 he accompanied Thomas Cavendish on Cavendish's last voyage, which sought to discover the Northwest Passage \\"upon the back parts of America\\" (i.e., from the western entrance). After the rest of Cavendish's expedition returned unsuccessful, Davis continued to attempt on his own account the passage of the Strait of Magellan; though defeated by foul weather, he apparently discovered the Falkland Islands in August 1592 aboard Desire. His crew was forced to kill hundreds of penguins for food on the islands, but the stored meat spoiled in the tropics and only fourteen of his 76 men made it home alive. From 1596 to 1597 Davis seems to have sailed with Sir Walter Raleigh to C√°diz and the Azores as master of Raleigh's ship; from 1598 to 1600 he accompanied a Dutch expedition to the East Indies as pilot, sailing from Flushing and returning to Middleburg, while carefully charting and recording geographical details. He narrowly escaped destruction from treachery at Achin on Sumatra. From 1601 to 1603 he accompanied Sir James Lancaster as Pilot-Major on the first voyage of the English East India Company. For his part Davis was to receive ¬£500 (around ¬£1.5 million at 2015 values) if the voyage doubled its original investment, ¬£1,000 if three times, ¬£1,500 if four times and ¬£2,000 if five times. Before departure, Davis had told London merchants that pepper could be obtained in Aceh at a price of four reals of eight per hundredweight - whereas it actually cost 20. When the voyage returned, Lancaster complained that Davis had been wrong about both the price and availability of pepper. Unhappy at being made a scapegoat for the situation, on 5 December 1604 Davis sailed again for the East Indies as pilot to Sir Edward Michelborne, an \\"interloper\\" who had been granted a charter by James I\\"East Indies: June 1604.\\" Calendar of State Papers Colonial, East Indies, China and Japan, Volume 2, 1513-1616. Ed. W Noel Sainsbury. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1864. 141. British History Online Retrieved 16 July 2019. despite the supposed East India Company monopoly on trade with the East. On this journey he was killed off Bintan Island near Singapore by one of his captive \\"Japanese\\" pirates whose disabled vessel he had just seized. The pirates had taken the English in through several days of friendly discourse prior to the surprise attack in which the subject was 'dragged back, hacked and slashed, and thrust out again'. He died almost immediately after the attack. The Dartmouth Town Council blue plaque erected in memory of Davis In the centuries after his death, the importance of Dutch whalers actually led the settlements along Greenland's western coast to be called \\"Straat Davis\\" after their name for the Strait, while the name \\"Greenland\\" was used to refer to the eastern shore, erroneously presumed to be the site of the Norse Eastern Settlement. Inter alia, cf. Permanent Court of International Justice. \\"Legal Status of Eastern Greenland: Judgment \\". 5 April 1933. Accessed 10 May 2012. Publications Davis's explorations in the Arctic were published by Richard Hakluyt and appeared on his world map. Davis himself published a valuable treatise on practical navigation called The Seaman's Secrets in 1594 and a more theoretical work called The World's Hydrographical Description in 1595. The account of Davis's last voyage was written by Michelborne on his return to England in 1606. Inventions His invention of the backstaff and double quadrant (called the Davis quadrant after him) remained popular among English seamen until long after Hadley's reflecting quadrant had been introduced. Personal life On 29 September 1582, Davis married Mistress Faith Fulford, daughter of Sir John Fulford (the High Sheriff of Devon) and Dorothy Bourchier, the daughter of the Earl of Bath.The Voyages and Works of John Davis, the Navigator, ed. Albert Hastings Markham, Burt Franklin Publishers, 1880, p. iv They had four sons and a daughter.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/davis_john_1605_1E.html On his return from the 1592 voyage, Davis

Biography Statue of Aeschines, from Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum. National Archaeological Museum, Naples. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1969 Although it is known he was born in Athens, the records regarding his parentage and early life are conflicting; but it seems probable that his parents, though poor, were respectable. Aeschines' father was Atrometus, an elementary school teacher of letters. His mother Glaukothea assisted in the religious rites of initiation for the poor. After assisting his father in his school, he tried his hand at acting with indifferent success, served with distinction in the army, and held several clerkships, amongst them the office of clerk to the Boule. This references: *Rudolf Hirzel, Der Dialog. i. 129-140 *Theodor Gomperz, Greek Thinkers, vol. iii. p. 342 (Eng. trans. G. G. Berry, London, 1905) Among the campaigns that Aeschines participated in were Phlius in the Peloponnese (368 BC), Battle of Mantinea (362 BC), and Phokion's campaign in Euboea (349 BC). The fall of Olynthus (348 BC) brought Aeschines into the political arena, and he was sent on an embassy to rouse the Peloponnese against Philip II of Macedon. In spring of 347 BC, Aeschines addressed the assembly of Ten Thousand in Megalopolis, Arcadia urging them to unite and defend their independence against Philip. In the summer 347 BC, he was a member of the peace embassy to Philip, where he found it necessary, in order to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents, to defend Philip and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian popular assembly as being entirely Greek. His dilatoriness during the second embassy (346 BC) sent to ratify the terms of peace led to him being accused by Demosthenes and Timarchus on a charge of high treason. Aeschines counterattacked by claiming that Timarchus had forfeited the right to speak before the people as a consequence of youthful debauches which had left him with the reputation of being a whore and prostituting himself to many men in the port city of Piraeus. The suit succeeded and Timarchus was sentenced to atimia and politically destroyed, according to Demosthenes. This comment was later interpreted by Pseudo-Plutarch in his Lives of the Ten Orators as meaning that Timarchos hanged himself upon leaving the assembly, a suggestion contested by some modern historians.Nick Fisher, Aeschines: Against Timarchos, \\"Introduction,\\" p.22 n.71; Oxford University Press, 2001 This oration, Against Timarchus, is considered important because of the bulk of Athenian laws it cites. As a consequence of his successful attack on Timarchus, Aeschines was cleared of the charge of treason.Nick Fisher, Aeschines: Against Timarchos, \\"Introduction,\\" p.22 n.71, passim; Oxford University Press, 2001 In 343 BC the attack on Aeschines was renewed by Demosthenes in his speech On the False Embassy. Aeschines replied in a speech with the same title and was again acquitted. In 339 BC, as one of the Athenian deputies (pylagorae) in the Amphictyonic Council, he made a speech which brought about the Fourth Sacred War. By way of revenge, Aeschines endeavoured to fix the blame for these disasters upon Demosthenes. In 336 BC, when Ctesiphon proposed that his friend Demosthenes should be rewarded with a golden crown for his distinguished services to the state, Aeschines accused him of having violated the law in bringing forward the motion. The matter remained in abeyance till 330 BC, when the two rivals delivered their speeches Against Ctesiphon and On the Crown. The result was a complete and overwhelming victory for Demosthenes. Aeschines went into voluntary exile at Rhodes (to avoid the judgement of the jury, which was likely a large sum of money), where he opened a school of rhetoric. He afterwards removed to Samos, where he died aged seventy-five. His three speeches, called by the ancients \\"the Three Graces,\\" rank next to those of Demosthenes. Photius knew of nine letters by him which he called The Nine Muses; the twelve published under his name (Hercher, Epistolographi Graeci) are not genuine.

Biography Ravikovitch was born in Ramat Gan on November 27, 1936. She learned to read and write at the age of three. Her father, Levi, was a Jewish engineer originally from Russia who arrived in Mandatory Palestine from China. Her mother, Michal, was a teacher who came from a religious household. When Dahlia was six, her father was run over and killed by a drunken driver. She moved to Kibbutz Geva with her mother but did not fit into the collectivist mentality and at 13 moved to a foster home in Haifa, the first of several foster homes. Ravikovitch married at 18, but divorced after 3 months. Her subsequent marriages also ended in divorce. She has one son, Ido Kalir.Maya Sela (September 13, 2010) \\"A living souvenir\\", Haaretz After completing her service in the Israel Defense Forces, she studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She worked as a journalist and high school teacher. She translated works of WB Yeats, TS Eliot and Edgar Allan Poe, and the book Mary Poppins into Hebrew. Ravikovitch was active in the Israeli peace movement. From her home in central Tel Aviv she collaborated with artists, musicians and public figures seeking peace, equality and social justice. During the last years of her life, she suffered from severe bouts of depression. On August 21, 2005, Ravikovitch was found dead in her apartment. Initial reports speculated the cause of death to be suicide, but the autopsy determined the cause to be sudden heart irregularities. Literary career Ravikovitch's first poems appeared in the Hebrew language poetry journal Orlogin (Hourglass), edited by Avraham Shlonsky, and it was Shlonsky who encouraged her to pursue writing as a career. Her first book of poetry, The Love of an Orange, published in 1959, established her as one of Israel's leading young native-born poets.The Modern Hebrew Poem Itself (2003) Her earlier poetry shows her command of formal technique without sacrificing the sensitivity of her always distinct voice. Although never totally abandoning traditional poetic devices, she developed a more prosaic style in the latter decades of her work. Her popular poem published in 1987, \\"The End of a Fall\\" (also called \\"The Reason for Falling\\") is from this period. Like many of Ravikovitch's poems, it may strike the reader as, at once, poignant, metaphysical, disturbing, and even political: \\"If a man falls from a plane in the middle of the night / only God can lift him up...\\".Born to Dream on Ivrit.org. In all, Ravikovitch published ten volumes of poetry in her native Hebrew. In addition to poetry, she contributed prose works (including three collections of short stories) and children's literature, and translated poetry into Hebrew. Many of her poems were set to music. Her best known poem is Booba Memukenet ().Rabikovitch on the Drunken Boat. Her poems are taught in schools and universities. Scholars at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia sponsored a \\"Memorial in Piano, Poetry, and Song\\" in her honor on March 21, 2006; one of the performers at this event was the late Moroccan poet and performer, Fatema Chebchoub. Several of Ravikovitch's poems were turned into popular songs. Her poetry has been translated into 23 languages.Dahlia Ravikovitch, Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature Awards * In 1987, Ravikovitch was a co-recipient (jointly with Moshe Dor) of the Bialik Prize for literature. * In 1998, she was awarded the Israel Prize for poetry. * In 2005, she won the Prime Minister's Prize. * Other awards include the Brenner Prize and the Shlonsky Prize.

The population of any residents in the area is included in the civil parish of Misterton with Walcote.  History Ancestral home of the Cave family from c. 1430,Simon Jenkins, England's Thousand Best Houses, Penguin, 2009, p. 467. the hall was built in the 1690s for Sir Roger Cave, 2nd Baronet. Described by Simon Jenkins as the \\"perfect William and Mary house\\", the architect was William Smith of Warwick. The Hall, west side In 1792 Sarah, daughter of Sir Thomas Cave Bt, inherited the Cave estate on the death of her nephew Sir Thomas Cave, 7th Baronet. She had married Henry Otway in 1790 and was created Baroness Braye in 1839. Her descendants remain in residence. (Henry Otway was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1804). The River Avon flows through the grounds, with a weir downstream, so a small lake is formed. The aviation pioneer Percy Pilcher built some of his early gliders here in the 1890s; he also built a powered flying machine here that many historians believe was capable of flight, but he was killed nearby in an accident in 1899 before he could try it. An exact replica of Pilcher's \\"The Hawk\\" glider is exhibited at the hall. During World War II the nuns and pupils from the Sacred Heart Convent and School in Roehampton, London, were evacuated to the Hall. Their premises were so badly damaged that when war ended they had to relocate to Woldingham School near London. From 1947 until 1949 it was the country branch of St. Mary's Town and Country School. By that time the roof was uncared for and in serious need of repair, but the Historic Buildings Council recommended a large grant for restoration and the hall was opened to the public in 1958.  Attractions  Today the hall is a tourist attraction open to the public on limited days in the year. Among the attractions are guided tours of the hall and its grounds, a forge, a beautiful rose garden, a shop and tea rooms. The house has a significant collection of antique furnishings; for example, the hall has one room with original 17th-century furnishings including a refectory table and set of Charles II chairs.The Ordnance Survey Guide to Historic Houses in Britain, Peter Furtado, Great Britain Ordnance Survey, 1987 The grounds of the hall are used for concerts and classic car shows, including the Wartburg/Trabant/IFA Club Rally and since 1983 has hosted the annual National Mini Day for owners of Mini cars.http://www.miniownersclub.co.uk/clubnews.htm, accessed 06/12/2016. The grounds hosted the first Stanford Hall Half Marathon and 10k running race in March 2014. Since 2003 Stanford Hall has been host to Firework Champions - the UK's leading firework competition. Some of the parkland is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Stanford Park due to the diversity of lichen species on the trees.Natural England SSSI notification Line notes External links *Stanford Hall's official website *Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Leicestershire and Rutland, 1960 edition.

It premiered on September 23, 2000, on the WB Television Network's Kids' WB programming block. Static Shock ran for four seasons, with 52 half-hour episodes in total. The show revolves around Virgil Hawkins, an African-American boy, who uses the secret identity of 'Static' after exposure to a mutagen gas during a gang fight which gave him electromagnetic powers. It was one of the few times that an American superhero was the titular character of their own broadcast animation series. Part of the DC animated universe, the series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation from a crew composed mostly of people from the company's past shows, but also with the involvement of two of the comic's creators, Dwayne McDuffie and Denys Cowan. Static Shock had some alterations from the original comic book because it was oriented to a pre-teen audience. Nevertheless, the show approached several social issues, which was positively received by most television critics. Static Shock was nominated for numerous awards, including the Daytime Emmy. Some criticism was directed towards its jokes‚Äîwhich were said to be stale and too similar to the Spider-Man style‚Äîand animation, which was said to be unnatural and outdated. The series also produced some related merchandise, which sold poorly; McDuffie cited the low sales as one of the main factors behind the series' cancellation. In spite of this, its popularity revived interest in the original Milestone comic and introduced McDuffie to the animation industry. Plot Virgil Hawkins is a 14-year-old who lives with his older sister Sharon, and his widowed father Robert in Dakota City. He attends high school with his best friend Richie Foley, and has a crush on a girl named Frieda. He also has a dispute with a bully named Francis Stone, nicknamed \\"F-Stop.\\" A gang leader named Wade recently helped Virgil, hoping to recruit him, but Virgil is hesitant, as he knows his mother died in an exchange of gunfire between gangs. Wade eventually leads Virgil to a restricted area for a fight against F-Stop's crew, but it was interrupted by police helicopters. During the dispute with the police, chemical containers explode, releasing a gas that causes mutations among the people in the vicinity (this event was later known as \\"The Big Bang\\"). As a result, Virgil obtains the ability to create, generate, absorb, and control electricity and magnetism‚Äîhe takes up the alter-ego of \\"Static\\". The gas also gives others in the area their own powers, and several of them become supervillains. The mutated people become meta-humans known as \\"Bang Babies\\" and their mutations apparently spread to other people around them. Characters *Virgil Ovid Hawkins / Static (voiced by Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì A high school student in Dakota City. As a result of accidental exposure to an experimental mutagen in an event known as the Big Bang, he gained the ability to control and manipulate electromagnetism, and uses these powers to become the superhero \\"Static\\". Countless others who were also exposed also gained a wide variety of mutations and abilities, and Static spends much of his time dealing with these \\"Bang Babies\\", many of whom use their abilities in selfish, harmful, and even criminal ways. *Richard \\"Richie\\" Osgood Foley / Gear (voiced by Jason Marsden) ‚Äì Virgil's best friend and confidant. At first, he merely provides support for his friend, making gadgets for him and helping to cover for Virgil to protect his secret identity. In the third season, it is revealed Richie's passive exposure to the Bang Gas gave him super-intelligence, which enabled him to easily invent rocket-powered boots and \\"Backpack\\", a highly intelligent multipurpose device worn on the back capable of surveillance and other semi- independent activities. With this equipment, he became a superhero named \\"Gear\\" and becomes Static's full-time partner in crime-fighting. *Robert Hawkins (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì A social worker who runs the Freeman Community Center as head counselor. He is a widower and the single father of two teenagers‚ÄîVirgil and Sharon. A strict but caring and genuinely understanding parent, he dislikes gangs and the destructive attitudes of most Bang Babies, and his work at the community center is motivated by a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people. *Sharon Hawkins (voiced by Michele Morgan) ‚Äì Virgil's older sister, Sharon attends college, but she still lives at home. She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center. While they do argue frequently, Sharon and Virgil really do care about each other and are quick to come to the other's defense if one of them is in danger. After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house, including when it comes to allocating chores between her and her brother, not least of all the cooking (which, at least according to Virgil, Sharon is not all that good at). *Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man (voiced by Kadeem Hardison) ‚Äì A meta-human transmorph, whose body structure consists of shapeable rubber. He is the younger brother of Static's archenemy, Ebon. Rubber-Band Man first appears as a tragic villain when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who stole one of his songs. He subsequently breaks out of prison but decides not to pursue a criminal career, however. He and Sharon eventually start dating, with Sharon helping Adam turn over a new leaf. He and Virgil initially clash, but Virgil comes to accept Adam's relationship with his sister and they become allies in crime-fighting, with Adam even becoming like an older-brother figure to Virgil. *Ivan Evans/Ebon (voiced by Gary Anthony Sturgis) ‚Äì The head of a large group of Bang Babies called \\"The Meta-Breed\\" and the series' main antagonist. Ebon is an unusually powerful meta-human. As a living shadow, he is able to create inter-dimensional portals and can manipulate pure darkness and shadows, as well as transport others to various locations of his choice. Production The series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation based on the Milestone Media/DC Comics character Static. Its supervising producer was Alan Burnett and Scott Jeralds was the main producer under the executive production of Jean MacCurdy and Sander Schwartz. The production team was mostly consisted of people who were involved with Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series, but also included Static's co-creator Denys Cowan. Although the show hired the comic series' co-creator Dwayne McDuffie as story editor and writer, McDuffie had no direct involvement on the development of Static Shock. The idea of a Static cartoon first emerged with DC's editor-in-chief Jenette Kahn during the time McDuffie was working for Milestone under Kahn. In 1993, Kahn proposed to adapt some Milestone comics; Burnett was hired to write a pilot episode for an X-Men-esque series with Milestone superheroes called The New Guard. After attempts to produce several other Milestone projects, Static was eventually the series \\"they went for\\". By the time Milestone and DC drafted their contract over DC distributing Milestone comics, the characters were from separate fictional universes. However, when crossovers between Static Shock and other DC animated series were suggested, it was established that they were from the same DC animated universe‚Äî\\"rather than having to muck around with multiple dimensions, or whatever.\\" Although McDuffie stressed that the show remains loyal to \\"the spirit and the tone\\" of the comic book, some changes were done because of its timeslot and target audience of pre-teens. For example, guns appeared less frequently, Richie is not explicitly portrayed as homosexual, and he is Virgil's confidant instead of Frieda. Virgil is also younger in the animated series, his costumes and use of his powers are different than the original, and his mother is dead in the show despite the fact that she is alive in the comics. The latter change was done because producers had the intention \\"to focus on a strong, complex relationship between an African-American father and son.\\" Nevertheless, McDuffie was concerned by the change because he originally intended to oppose the stereotype of black people not having a complete nuclear family. However, McDuffie said \\"that [it] worked out okay\\" as the crew could use the absence of Virgil's mother to create a \\"couple of great stories\\". Virgil's father, Robert, \\"for all intents and purposes, is a new character\\", as he was reconceptualized as a social worker. The same goes for Richie, who is described as an amalgam of different characters from the original comic. For the villains, Hotstreak was reused from the Static comics, Edwin Alva was brought from another Milestone's series‚ÄîHardware‚Äî, and the group Meta-Breed was created for the TV series. The third season of the show saw some of the biggest changes; in addition to Richie's superhero powers and a new opening, Static changed his costume. Cowan stated that the change was done to give his clothes a \\"feel of the comic book\\", while McDuffie said it represented a growth that Virgil was passing through. This maturation made possible to \\"explore some of the darker places in his world,\\" and to have more varied conflicts, as the villains have also become more mature. He described it is as \\"a natural outgrowth of all that, as is the new, more naturalistic look of the show.\\" This change followed the second-season premiere‚Äî\\"The Big Leagues\\"‚Äîwhen Static meets Batman and Robin. Burnett said, \\"after that show, everybody went, 'Let's go in that direction.'\\" Writer John Semper, Jr. commented, \\"of course, I always lean toward the dramatic ... But the same old light-hearted Static spirit is still there.\\" Richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into the story and the producers wanted to keep the \\"chemistry\\" between voice actors LaMarr and Marsden. There was also a positive response from children in focus groups so \\"[t]he answer seemed pretty obvious.\\" The series' music director was Richard Wolf, while he, Stanley Clarke and Max Gousse were the composers, and Kennard Ramsey was the orchestrator. For action sequences, Wolf wanted to use \\"real adrenaline- pumping beat\\" of 125 beats per minute; however, hip hop music usually only reached 110 beats. The predominant score was electronica with some hip hop- type and DMX-type vocals. R&B; and old school hip hop melodies were also used depending on the scenes, and each character had a specific theme. Wolf composed the opening theme for the first two seasons. Starting from the third season, the show had a new opening theme, written by Master P and Lil' Romeo (and performed by the latter). Release Static Shock aired on the Kids' WB programming block of The WB from September 23, 2000, until May 22, 2004. The first African American superhero-centered television series, it ran a total of 52 episodes. Reruns of the series were shown on Cartoon Network, starting on December 2001, and on Disney XD on February 2009. The first six episodes were released to DVD on September 28, 2004, in a single volume entitled \\"The New Kid\\". The complete first season was made available for download on iTunes on July 4, 2011. In 2017, Warner Bros. started to release Static Shock complete seasons on manufacture on demand DVDs as a part of the Warner Archive Collection. The first season was published on March 28; the second season on May 23; the third on January 30, 2018; and the fourth on April 13, 2018. Starting in September 2018, all episodes of the series have been made available on the DC Universe digital streaming service. Static Shocks episodes handle different issues, including gangs, gun violence, homelessness, bullying,racism, mental illness, bigotry, and drugs. Other episodes also featured the subject of Chanukah and Christmas celebrations. The series was also marked by several crossover episodes with characters from the DC animated universe like Superman, Green Lantern, the Justice League, and the Batman Beyond cast. Several episodes also featured guest voice actors, including basketballers (like Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone, Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and Steve Nash) and musicians, such as the B2K group, Lil' Romeo and the Backstreet Boys' A. J. McLean. Guest crew was also featured, including cartoonist Rick Hoberg as storyboard artist, and Paul Dini and John Ridley as writers. Static Shock was an extremely popular show, granting its new renewal for a second season just a month after its debut. As of December 2000, it was the highest-rated preteen show from 2 to 11 years old, the show among all networks on its timeslot, and the third best on the Kids' WB! lineup. From its debut to July 2003, the show secured the second post among boys aged 6 to 11 years. Ratings increased after Richie's character obtained superhero powers; McDuffie affirmed that this is what secured the renewal for a new season. Indeed, the show's third season was its most popular and was the second best- rated Saturday morning program among boys aged 6 to 11 years, and tweens and male tweens aged 9 to 14. From February to April 2003, ratings regularly performed over the 4.0 stake among the public aged 9 to 14 years; it even reached the 6.4 mark in May. Static Shocks last season was only surpassed by the children's anime Pok√©mon, and the show's reruns on Cartoon Network were only surpassed by the adult animated sitcom Family Guy. Static Shock was the only program on Cartoon Network to be among the top 30 most watched kids shows in a week of October 2004. It was also the best rated program of the channel among kids on a week of January 2005, and the best rated show on Cartoon Network's Miguzi block as of March 2005. For the 2004‚Äì05 season, it was the 18th most watched Saturday morning children's show of all networks. Static Shock was ultimately cancelled due to the low production of associated merchandising products. Reception =Accolades= Static Shocks episode \\"The Big Leagues\\" earned director Dave Chlystek a nomination for Outstanding Achievement for Directing in an Animated Television Production at the 2002 Annie Awards. This episode was also nominated for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing in Television Animation in 2003. That same year, for the episode \\"Jimmy\\", McDuffie and Burnett were awarded the Humanitas Prize in the Children's Animation Category in 2003. At the 30th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2003, the show was nominated for Special Class Animated Program and Richard Wolf was nominated for Achievement in Music Direction and Composition. At the 31st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2004, both the animated series and Wolf were again nominated for the same categories‚Äîthis time, Wolf won the award. =Reviews= Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club described it as \\"a surprising and sometimes rewarding success\\". October 2001 issue of Wizard listed the 100 best cartoon shows ever as selected by their readers, with Static Shock ranked at number 88. Jonathon Dornbush, in a 2014 Entertainment Weekly article, included it among the nine best comics-based animated TV series. He asserted, \\"Static Shock didn't have quite the name recognition of its DC brethren when it debuted, but the show proved it could stand alongside the greats.\\" Charlie Jane Anders, for io9, ranked it 91st on a list of the best science fiction and fantasy shows; she commented, \\"amidst a glut of superhero cartoons, this is one of the most memorable.\\" In The Superhero Book, Andy Mangels praised Static Shocks multicultural approach, while Emily Ashby from Common Sense Media lauded it for encouraging diversity. Mangels declared that \\"Static Shock provides solid superheroic entertainment and a role model and promotion of diversity for not only African-American viewers, but for audiences of all colors and ages.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Monique Jones praised the series for a positive depiction not only of an African American superhero but of an African country‚ÄîGhana. Jones also commended how the series incorporated social issues in \\"an easily digestible\\" way without having to \\"sugarcoat\\" them. Lynne Heffley of Los Angeles Times commented it \\"isn't your typical Saturday-morning cartoon series\\", praising its themes and electing the episode \\"Jimmy\\"‚Äîabout gun violence‚Äîas an example. Evan Levine, writing for Rome News- Tribune, asserted that \\"the series is at its best when it confronts issues actually facing kids.\\" Jones commended Virgil's portrayal as an everyman teenager, while Ashby appreciated Virgil's \\"relatable\\" character. Colby Lanham of Comic Book Resources said Virgil \\"was perhaps the most human of many superheroes on television at the time\\" and considered the series was canceled too soon. Ashby was also positive to the fact that Virgil usually counted on dialogues before going into action; this action was also praised by John Sinnott of DVD Talk, who said it is \\"something that most animated heroes never think to do.\\" Ashby also applauded Virgil's \\"surprising depth of character\\" to not follow a gang but to use his powers for good. While Levine praised \\"its bright, cartoony visuals [that] are a notch above those of many other animated series,\\" Sinnott considered some of the animation to be \\"a little stilted.\\" Sinnott called it \\"a fun series overall\\", but considered some jokes to be \\"a little stale\\". Neil Dorsett of DVD Verdict was generally disappointed; he called voice acting \\"very standard\\", and said that \\"artwork and animation are also both behind the times\\". Dorsett also criticized Virgil's one-lines, which \\"invites, like many other elements of the series, comparison to Spider-Man.\\" He, however, pondered that his opinion may come from a bad first impression: \\"Although there are lots of things to nitpick about the show, there's not really anything wrong with it.\\" Both Sinnott and Dorsett compared it unfavorably to the original comic book. Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker questioned why The WB made a TV show based on a cancelled, poorly-sold comic and criticized the \\"uttering tired, condescending lines\\" professed by Virgil. Nancy Imperiale Wellons from the Orlando Sentinel said \\"Virgil has a believable relationship with his family -- including a strong father figure -- but the show's pacing lags.\\" Paul Schultz wrote for the New York Daily News that \\"Many of the characters -- the conservative, the annoying sister -- are cliches.\\" Thelma Adams criticized the show in the New York Post; first she called it \\"formulaic but appealing\\" and ultimately dubbed it \\"lame\\". Legacy Static Shock led its characters to be incorporated in the DC animated universe. In the picture, a future Static appears in a Justice League Unlimited episode aired half a year after the ending of Static Shock. The show's popularity led to new demand for Milestone's Static comics: the first four issues of it were reissued as Static Shock: Trial by Fire in 2000 and a miniseries, Static Shock!: Rebirth of the Cool, was released between January and September 2001. It also led to the production of an unreleased video game, toys, and books. In May 2003, Midway Games announced the production of a platformer video game based on the show for the Game Boy Advance. Although it was displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game was later cancelled. For a period starting on July 4, 2004, Subway Restaurants released a series of toys based on the TV series to be offered in the United States and Canada. On September 1, 2004, Scholastic Corporation published two tie-in children's books written by Tracey West. McDuffie's work on Static Shock placed him in the circles of animated series, and he became a writer and producer for shows like Justice League, Teen Titans, Justice League Unlimited, and Ben 10: Alien Force. McDuffie was responsible for diversifying the DC animated universe's Justice League by including black and female characters. Moreover, Arie Kaplan credits McDuffie and his co-writers for giving \\"a depth and complexity\\" the group was lacking since the 1970s. A future, older version of Virgil appeared in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time, Warped\\" in January 2005.

He played for the New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Astros, Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles between 1986 and 1998. Drabek batted and threw right-handed. He is the pitching coach for the Double A Jackson Generals. Known for his fluid pitching motion and sound mechanics, he won the National League Cy Young Award in 1990. Early life Drabek was born in Victoria, Texas. He attended St. Joseph High School in Victoria, where he played football and baseball. Drabek was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 4th round of the June 1980 MLB Draft, but did not sign. He then attended the University of Houston and played three seasons for the Cougars baseball team. Following his junior year, Drabek was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 11th round of the June 1983 MLB Draft and signed on June 11. Career After signing with the White Sox, Drabek was assigned to the Niagara Falls Sox in the short-season New York-Penn League where he finished 6‚Äì7 with a 3.67 ERA in 16 games with 103 strikeouts in 103 2/3 innings. After pitching one game for the Class A Appleton, Drabek was promoted to the AA Glens Falls White Sox and was 12‚Äì5 with a 2.24 ERA. On 13 August, he was traded to the New York Yankees along with Kevin Hickey to complete an earlier deal made on July 18 for Roy Smalley. Drabek then spent the rest of the 1984 season at AA Nashville. In 1985, Drabek returned to AA and spent the entire season at Albany-Colonie in the Eastern League and finished with a 13‚Äì7 record with a 2.99 ERA with 153 strikeouts in 192 2/3 innings. After starting the 1986 season at AAA Columbus, Drabek made his Major League debut on May 30, coming in relief for starter Joe Niekro in a 6‚Äì3 loss to the Oakland Athletics. He would spend the rest of the season with the Yankees, appearing in 27 games (21 starts) and go 7‚Äì8 with a 4.10 ERA. Following the season, he was traded with Logan Easley and Brian Fisher to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Rick Rhoden, Cecilio Guante and Pat Clements. Drabek enjoyed his best years with Pittsburgh, from 1987 to 1992, during which time he regularly pitched over 230 innings and consistently finished in the top 10 in the National League ERA race. He went 22‚Äì6 with a 2.76 ERA in 1990 en route to winning the National League Cy Young Award and leading the Pirates to the postseason (where they lost in the NLCS to the Cincinnati Reds). His 22 wins that year were a league high; it was also 7 more wins than his previous single-season mark. On August 3, 1990, while with the Pirates, Drabek had a no-hitter broken up by a Sil Campusano single with two out in the ninth. The hit was the only one Drabek would allow in defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0. Drabek signed as a free agent after the 1992 season with the Houston Astros. Despite a solid 3.79 ERA and playing for a rising team, he posted a 9‚Äì18 record. He improved in the strike-shortened 1994 season to 12‚Äì6 with a 2.84 ERA, and was named an All-Star for the first and only time in his career. When play resumed after the players' strike in 1995, however, he was unable to maintain his success and retired after the 1998 season, having compiled a 35‚Äì40 record over his final four seasons. Retirement and personal life After retiring, Drabek coached his son's Little League and select league teams, often teaching them how to bat at a faster pitch, with their personal pitching machine so as to gain an advantage over the other little league teams. Drabek returned to professional baseball in 2010, accepting a position in the Arizona Diamondbacks system as the pitching coach for the Yakima Bears in the short-season Class A Northwest League. On 13 December 2010 the D-backs announced that Drabek was promoted to the pitching coach for the Visalia Rawhide in the Class A California League.

Kyle is a starting pitcher who played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox and Toronto Blue Jays during his major league career. In February 2018, Drabek was named as the Pitching coach for the AA Jackson Generals.

It is on the border with Hertfordshire, east of Amersham and north of Chorleywood. History Until the 13th century, the village name was Isenhampstead. There were two villages here, called Isenhampstead Chenies and Isenhampstead Latimers, distinguished by the lords of the manors of those two places. In the 19th century the prefix was dropped and the two villages became known as Chenies and Latimer. Near this village there was once a royal hunting-box, where both King Edward I and King Edward II were known to have resided. It was the owner of this lodge, Edward III's shield bearer, Thomas Cheyne, who first gave his name to the village and his descendant, Sir John Cheyne, who built Chenies Manor House in around 1460 on the site. Several paper mills were once established in Chenies, operated by the River Chess, which flowed here from further west in Buckinghamshire.

The operation was named after the 1984 film Red Dawn. The mission was executed by joint operations Task Force 121‚Äîan elite and covert joint special operations team, supported by the 1st Brigade Combat Team (led by Col. James Hickey) of the 4th Infantry Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno. They searched two sites, \\"Wolverine 1\\" and \\"Wolverine 2\\", outside the town of ad-Dawr, but did not find Hussein. A continued search between the two sites found Hussein hiding in a \\"spider hole\\" at 20:30 hrs local Iraqi time. Hussein did not resist capture. Background Hussein disappeared from public view soon after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The American military labelled him \\"High Value Target Number One\\" (HVT1) and began one of the largest manhunts in history. Between July and December 2003, JSOC's Task Force 121 carried out twelve unsuccessful raids to find Saddam Hussein, together with 600 other operations against targets, including 300 interrogations. On 1 December 2003, a former driver divulged the name Muhammed Ibrahim Omar al-Musslit, Saddam's right-hand man, known to TF 121 as \\"the source\\" or \\"the fatman.\\" Over the next two weeks, nearly 40 members of his family were interrogated to ascertain his location. On 12 December 2003, a raid on a house in Baghdad that was being used as an insurgent headquarters captured al-Musslit. Early the next morning he revealed where Saddam may be found. This intelligence and other intelligence from detained former members of the Ba'ath Party, supported by signals intelligence from the ISA, finally pinpointed Hussein at a remote farm compound south of Tikrit. Operation Operation Red Dawn was launched after gaining actionable intelligence identifying two likely locations of Saddam's whereabouts code-named Wolverine 1 and Wolverine 2, near the town of ad-Dawr. C squadron Delta Force, ISA operators under Task Force 121 and the First Brigade Combat team of the 4th ID, conducted the operation. The operation was named after the 1984 film of the same name starring Patrick Swayze. The site names of \\"Wolverine 1\\" and \\"Wolverine 2\\" are also a reference to the American insurgent group in the movie, The Wolverines. The Forces involved in the operation consisted of approximately 600 soldiers including cavalry, artillery, aviation, engineer and special operations forces. The forces cleared the two objectives but initially did not find the target. Then, as the operators were finishing and the helicopters called in to extract them, one assaulter kicked a piece of flooring to one side, exposing a spider hole; he prepared to throw a fragmentation grenade into it ‚Äì in case it led to an insurgent tunnel system, when suddenly Hussein appeared. The Delta operator struck him with the stock of his M4 Carbine and disarmed him of a Glock 18C. Hussein surrendered and offered no real resistance; he was exfiltrated by a MH-6 Little Bird from the 160th SOAR to the Tikrit Mission Support Site where he was properly identified. After proper identification, he was then taken by an MH-60K Blackhawk helicopter from 160th SOAR from Tikrit to Baghdad and into custody at Baghdad International Airport. Along with the Glock, an AK-47 and $750,000 in US bank notes were recovered from the spider hole. Two other individuals were also detained. There were no casualties in the operation. Reactions =International reactions= Middle East Hamid Karzai, shown during his inauguration, welcomed the news. : The Afghan government welcomed news of the capture of Saddam Hussein, deeming it a warning to opposition leaders such as Osama Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. : The official Bahrain News Agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman who said [his capture] should restore unity and cohesion to the Iraqis, to build \\"a promising future in a prosperous Iraq enjoying security and co-operating with its neighbors to promote stability and development\\" in the region. : Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said, \\"I don't think anyone will be sad over Saddam Hussein. His arrest does not change the fact that his regime was finished, and it is the natural consequence of the regime's fall. The Iraqi regime had harmed the Iraqi people, and had pulled the Arab region into several storms.\\" : Vice President Mohammad-Ali Abtahi expressed satisfaction, stating, \\"I am happy they have arrested a criminal, whoever it may be, and I am even more happy, because it is a criminal who committed so many crimes against Iranians.\\" Iran joined the call for justice, adding, \\"Iranians have suffered much, because of him, and [the] mass graves in Iraq prove the crimes he has committed against the Iraqi people\\". : The government spokeswoman said they hoped that a page has been turned and that the Iraqi people would be able to assume their responsibilities as soon as possible and build their future according to their will. The first and last word concerning the capture of Saddam Hussein or his fate must be given to the Iraqi people. : The country was tense at news of the U.S. capture of Saddam Hussein at the weekend; people were surprised by how easily he was captured, however, it did not equal a U.S. military victory. \\"The capture of Saddam will not save the U.S. from the world's condemnation for supporting the greater enemy, Israeli P.M. Ariel Sharon\\", said Selim Al-Hoss, ex-Lebanese Prime Minister. : Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's government had no comment, however Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, a senior Hamas leader, said the U.S. would \\"pay a very high price for the mistake\\" of capturing Saddam Hussein. Following Saddam's capture, the climate among Palestinians was disbelief and gloom. : Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the United States, stated that \\"Saddam Hussein was a menace to the Arab world.\\" : Syrian Information Minister Ahmad al-Hassan advised Syria's position on Iraq was not based on the fate of individuals. We want an Iraq that preserves its territorial integrity, its unity and its sovereignty. Asia : Foreign Minister Morshed Khan was quoted as saying, \\"We hope this will pave the way for the Iraqi people to have a government of their own, a government by the people and for the people of Iraq.\\" : Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao hoped that the latest development of the situation in Iraq was conducive to the Iraqi people taking their destiny into their own hands, and to realising peace and stability in Iraq. : Sing Tao Daily editorialized: \\"The desperate capture of Iraqi former president Saddam symbolizes the bad fate of a corrupt dictator and also the best Christmas present this year for US President George Bush, but for the Iraqis who have undergone a baptism of fire in the war, the days of peace are still far away, and the road of reconstruction is as long and arduous as before.\\" South China Morning Post editorialized: \\"With Hussein's capture, Iraqis can at last begin to close this brutal and tragic chapter in their history.\\" bring more peace to the situation. : The Indian government's response to the capture of Saddam Hussein was measured and guarded. When Secretary of State Colin Powell called Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday to discuss the capture of Saddam, whom Washington had named a tyrant, Sinha is said to have reacted in a manner that did not echo the effusion flowing from the rest of the world. In the words of an official with the foreign ministry, Sinha \\"maintained a stiff upper lip\\". Sinha, in his brief conversation with Powell, merely expressed hope that such developments would contribute to the stabilization of Iraq. Powell told Sinha that the capture would bring \\"a change in the existing situation and lead to greater respect for the Iraqi Governing Council.\\" : In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, the reaction was muted. Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says the arrest of the former Iraqi president had not changed how Indonesia felt about the situation in Iraq. Indonesia's leaders strongly opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq. Indonesian leaders also said they hoped the capture of Saddam Hussein would help bring peace to Iraq and return control of the country back to its citizens. : Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Monday said he hoped that Saddam Hussein's capture would lead to improvements in Iraq. He said the capture would be positive if it brings major steps toward the stability and reconstruction of Iraq. Prime Minister Koizumi's cabinet had approved a controversial plan to send troops to Iraq. He said he would continue to assess the security situation in Iraq before dispatching the soldiers. In Japan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda agreed the arrest was \\"great news,\\" but cautioned it would not necessarily lead to peace. \\"The problem, however, is terrorism. I don't think the arrest of Saddam Hussein can stop all terror attacks,\\" Fukuda said. : The Malaysian government said the Iraqi people should decide how Saddam would be brought to justice on accusations of gross human rights violations. Iraqis should \\"be given the right to decide on the manner and procedure of bringing Saddam Hussein to face justice,\\" said Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, head of the Non-Aligned Movement. Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar expressed hope that the capture of Saddam Hussein would contribute towards bringing peace and stability in Iraq and the surrounding region and stated that the United Nations should now play a bigger role in achieving this objective. \\"With peace and stability in Iraq, we hope that an Iraqi government representing the free and independent Iraqi people could be set up to start the reconstruction process of that nationfor the benefit of its people,\\" he said. He said the views and inputs of the Iraqis should be taken into account in deciding whatever action would be initiated against Saddam. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed urged a fair trial for Saddam Hussein. : The response in Pakistan also was low-key. Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan called the capture an important development. : South Korea welcomed the news, which came hours after its government made a final decision to send 3,000 troops to Iraq. : More than 46 Sri Lankan lawyers planned to defend the former Iraqi President at his trial. The inhabitants of Saddam Hussein Nagar, Sri Lanka expressed great disappointment at the news of Hussein's capture. : An hour after U.S. announced the captured, President Chen Shui Bian congratulated the U.S. for what he called \\"a big victory\\". =Europe= : The Flemish-language De Standaard newspaper editorialized that \\"Showing degrading pictures of a prisoner, even if he was a cruel tyrant, does not increase the moral authority of those who overpowered him.\\" : A statement from President Jacques Chirac said, \\"The president is delighted with Saddam Hussein's arrest.\\" : Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der greeted the development \\"with much happiness.\\" In a telegram to George W. Bush, he called for intensified efforts to rebuild Iraq. : Top Curia official Renato Martino, a cardinal deacon and President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, attacked the way Saddam Hussein was treated by his captors, saying he had been dealt with like an animal. Martino said he had felt pity watching video of \\"this man destroyed, [the military] looking at his teeth as if he were a beast.\\" The cardinal, a leading critic of the US-led war in Iraq, said he hoped the capture would not make matters \\"worse.\\" Pope John Paul II did not comment. : Poland at the time commanded thousands of international troops in Iraq. Defence Minister Jerzy Szmajdzi≈Ñski welcomed the news, but said the arrest could prompt retaliation from Saddam's supporters. \\"The coming days could be equally dangerous as these past days,\\" he said. : Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said, \\"We think the arrest of Saddam Hussein will contribute to the strengthening of security in Iraq and to the process of political regulation in the country with the active participation of the United Nations.\\" : Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Bush's strongest Iraq War ally, called the capture good news for Iraqis, saying: \\"It removes the shadow that has been hanging over them for too long of the nightmare of a return to the Saddam regime.\\" =North America= : Prime Minister Paul Martin congratulated U.S. troops Sunday and sent telegrams of congratulations to U.S. President George Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He would state that he was confident that the deposed Iraqi leader will be prosecuted fairly. \\"What's important is that he be tried before a tribunal that is just, that is credible and that has international recognition,\\" said Martin. \\"I'm sure that will be the case.\\" Martin spoke to reporters from his Montreal riding, said Saddam's capture will bolster reconstruction efforts in Iraq. \\"Now that he has been captured there's no doubt in my mind that we will now be able to move to a very very different level of reconstruction,\\" he said. \\"This is a great victory to the coalition forces but the biggest winners of all of this will be the people of Iraq,\\" he said. : *President George W. Bush said that Saddam would \\"face the justice he denied to millions. For the Ba'athist holdouts responsible for the violence, there will be no return to the corrupt power and privilege they once held\\". *Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated, \\"Here was a man who was photographed hundreds of times shooting off rifles and showing how tough he was, and in fact, he wasn't very tough, he was cowering in a hole in the ground, and had a pistol and didn't use it, and certainly did not put up any fight at all. I think that ... he resulted in the death of an awful lot of Iraqi people, In the last analysis, he seemed not terribly brave.\\" Rumsfeld said the U.S. has not decided whether to classify Saddam Hussein as a prisoner of war, but that the U.S. would abide the Geneva Conventions. More than 24 hours after his capture, the uncooperative Saddam Hussein had said little in his interrogation. =Oceania= Australia Australian Prime Minister John Howard urged the trial of Saddam. Australia's Prime Minister John Howard reacted to the news happily. He said the Iraqi people could breathe a sigh of relief now that the former dictator was no longer at large. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed him. New Zealand New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark reiterated the New Zealand legislature's opposition to capital punishment, with such opposition extending to the treatment of Saddam Hussein. =Africa= Kenya People Daily newspaper :The capture of deposed Iraq leader Saddam Hussein is, no doubt, a major victory for the United States and the coalition of the willing, chief among which is Britain. The curtain has now fallen on one of the world's most ruthless and intriguing leaders. =International organizations= Arab League Secretary General Amr Mussa said the Iraqi people should \\"decide the fate of the old regime and its old leaders,\\" alluding to the discovery of mass graves after Saddam's fall during the US invasion in April. International Committee of the Red Cross The International Committee of the Red Cross says the US-led coalition in Iraq had given the agency the \\"green light\\" to visit Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader. Red Cross spokesman Florian Westphal confirmed that ICRC visits to the captured Iraqi leader would go ahead according to international rules governing the detention of all prisoners of war. He said discussions are under way as to how and where those visits would take place. United Nations A spokesman for Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General, said the capture \\"offers an opportunity to give fresh impetus to the search for peace and stability in Iraq\\". Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations. Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix said the Allied Coalition might ask Saddam Hussein meaningful questions about Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programmes, \\"He ought to know quite a lot, and be able to tell the story; we all want to get to the bottom of the barrel\\". POW status A Pentagon spokesman said he was given the status as he was the leader of the \\"old regime's military forces.\\" The spokesman, Major Michael Shavers, said Saddam, captured by US troops in December, was entitled to all the rights under the Geneva Conventions. The International Committee of the Red Cross had asked to visit the former Iraqi leader as soon as possible. The US spokesman did not give further details about Saddam Hussein's conditions of detention. POW status for Saddam Hussein meant that the former Iraqi leader would be eligible to stand trial for war crimes. There was controversy over TV pictures which showed Saddam Hussein undergoing a medical examination after his capture - footage regarded by some as a failure to protect him from public curiosity. A leading Vatican clergyman described the scenes as Saddam being \\"treated like a cow,\\" and some sections of the Arab world were deeply offended by them. The US maintains that the pictures were shown to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that they no longer had anything to fear. A senior British official said Saddam - who was being held at an undisclosed location and interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - was still refusing to co-operate with his captors, but the former president's capture the previous month was yielding results \\"far greater than we expected,\\" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The US- led coalition had used documents found with the ex-leader to mount operations against Saddam loyalists, the official said.

It won the 2003 Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award, and was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel in 2002. Plot summary Newspaper reporter Carl Streator has been assigned to write articles on a series of cases of sudden infant death syndrome, from which his own child had died. Carl discovers that his wife and child had died immediately after he read them a \\"culling song\\", or African chant, from a book entitled Poems and Rhymes Around the World. During his investigations into other SIDS cases, he finds that a copy of the book was at the scene of each death. In every case, the book was open to a page that contained the culling song. As Carl learns, the rhyme has the power to kill anyone it is spoken to. Because of the stress of Carl's life, the deadly rhyme becomes unusually powerful, allowing him to kill by only thinking the poem. Carl unintentionally memorizes the rhyme and semi-voluntarily becomes a serial killer who makes people die over minor annoyances. Carl turns to Helen Hoover Boyle, a real estate agent who has also found the rhyme in the same book and knows of its destructive power. While she is unable to help him stop using the rhyme, she is willing to help him stop anyone else from being able to use it again. The two of them decide to go on a road trip across the country to find all remaining copies of the book and destroy the page containing the rhyme. They are joined by Helen's hippie assistant, Mona \\"Mulberry\\" Sabbat, and Mona's boyfriend, a nihilistic environmentalist named Oyster. Carl now must not only deal with the dangers of the rhyme, but with the risk of it falling into the hands of Oyster, who may want to use it for sinister purposes. In addition to tracking down and destroying any copy of the rhyme, the foursome hope to find a \\"grimoire\\", a hypothesized spellbook which also contains the rhyme. Carl wants to destroy it, believing that the knowledge contained in it is too dangerous, while the others in his group want to learn what other spells it contains‚Äîpartly in the hope that there is a spell to resurrect the dead. The group eventually abandons Oyster on the side of the highway after he assaults Helen in an attempt to learn the rhyme. Mona eventually realizes that the datebook Helen had been carrying throughout the trip is the grimoire they had been looking for, written in invisible ink. Helen had acquired it years earlier in the estate of the publisher of Poems and Rhymes Around the World, whom she had killed with the rhyme as revenge for the deaths of her husband and child. Initially, Mona attempts to persuade Helen and Carl to allow her to translate the grimoire, but they are distrustful of her relationship with Oyster, leaving Mona infuriated. Helen, utilizing the resources she obtained from the publisher's estate, translates the book. In addition to the culling song, the grimoire is found to contain other spells. Carl and Helen have a romantic moment where they declare their love for each other, but Carl later is left skeptical of the relationship after Mona convinces him that Helen was using a love spell from the grimoire to control him. After confronting Helen about the accusation, Carl decides to kill Nash, a paramedic who he inadvertently gave knowledge of the rhyme to. Nash uses the rhyme to kill beautiful models in order to have sex with their corpses. After his confrontation with Nash, Carl surrenders himself to the police and is placed in a maximum security prison. During a rectal exam, the police sergeant asks him if \\"he is up for a quickie\\"; to Carl's astonishment Helen has used the grimoire to possess the officer's body and helps Carl escape. During this time Oyster steals the grimoire (with the exception of the culling song) with the help of Mona and uses it to possess Helen and commit suicide. With her last amount of energy Helen possesses the police sergeant and joins Carl to kill Mona and Oyster, who have been using the spells to advance their extremist views. =Structure= Lullaby uses a framing device, alternating between the normal, linear narrative and the temporal end after every few chapters. Palahniuk often uses this format alongside a major plot twist near the end of the book which relates in some way to this temporal end (what Palahniuk refers to as \\"the hidden gun\\"). Lullaby starts with Mr. Streator talking to the reader, narrating where he is today and why he is going to tell us the backstory that will give us perspective on his current situation. \\"Still, this isn't a story about here and now. Me, the Sarge, the Flying Virgin. Helen Hoover Boyle. What I'm writing is the story of how we met. How we got here\\".Page 9 This present tense information that makes this book a frame story is incorporated every few chapters as its own chapter, entirely italicized. Palahniuk uses these segments as a way to set up his \\"hidden gun\\" and as a means to foreshadow where the story is going. His present seems disconnected from the past that he narrates throughout the rest of the novel. The final chapter concludes in the present, providing the puzzle-piece that strings together all the events and makes sense out of the backstory and their current workings searching for \\"phenomenons\\". Background In 1999, Chuck's father, Fred Palahniuk, began dating an Idaho woman named Donna Fontaine. Fontaine had recently put her ex- husband Dale Shackleford in prison for sexual abuse. Shackleford had vowed to kill Fontaine as soon as he was released. After his release, Shackleford followed Fred Palahniuk and Fontaine home from a date to her apartment in Kendrick, Idaho. After shooting Fred Palahniuk in the abdomen and Fontaine in the back of the neck, Shackleford left them to die, though he allegedly returned to the scene multiple times to attempt to start a fire large enough to destroy the evidence. After Shackleford's arrest, Chuck Palahniuk was asked to be part of the decision as to whether Shackleford would receive the death sentence. Palahniuk had worked in a hospital and as a crime reporter and struggled with his stance on capital punishment. Over the next few months he began working on Lullaby. According to him it was a way to cope with the decision he had to make regarding Shackleford's death. In the spring of 2001 Shackleford was found guilty for two counts of murder in the first degree. A month after Palahniuk finished Lullaby, Shackleford was sentenced to death. Film adaptation Kickstarter campaign On May 17, 2016, a Kickstarter campaign was launched aimed at adapting the novel Lullaby into a feature film. The film will be directed by Andy Mingo, who previously directed the short film Romance, based on Palahniuk's short story of the same name originally published in Playboy Magazine. The adaptation is Palahniuk's first screenwriting endeavor, as he and Mingo have co-written the script together. In May 2020, Chuck Palahniuk disavowed the project in a tweet that he went on to delete: \\"Chuck, here. I've lost faith in Andy Mingo's ability to create a film from LULLABY (@LullabyMov), and I call for him to explain where he's spent the money given by project supporters to date. I regret supporting his efforts and hope he can restore everyone's trust.\\" Despite raising more than $405,000, no action on the project has occurred as of August 2020. In September 2020, the Kickstarter organizers insisted \\"Chuck is still in ... According to his manager, there was a miscommunication between him and his manager. Another book that Chuck optioned expired. For some reason, he thought it was our project and posted the tweet in response. Realizing his mistake, he deleted the tweet.\\" https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/footsteps/chuck- palahniuks-lullaby/comments In popular culture American punk rock band Lagwagon's song \\"Lullaby\\" was inspired by this novel.

History  Olynthus, son of Heracles, or the river god Strymon, was considered the mythological founder of the town. The South Hill bore a small Neolithic settlement; was abandoned during the Bronze Age; and was resettled in the 7th century BC. Subsequently, the town was captured by the Bottiaeans, a Thracian tribe ejected from Macedon by Alexander I. Following the Persian defeat at Salamis (480 BC) and with Xerxes having been escorted to the Hellespont by his general Artabazus, the Persian army spent the winter of the same year in Thessaly and Macedonia. The Persian authority in the Balkans must have significantly decreased at the time, which encouraged the inhabitants of the Pallene peninsula to break away. Suspecting that a revolt against the Great King was meditated, in order to control the situation, Artabazus captured Olynthus, which was thought to be disloyal, and killed its inhabitants. The town had priorly been given to Kritovoulos from Toroni and to a fresh population consisting of Greeks from the neighboring region of Chalcidice, who had been exiled by the Macedonians (Herod. viii. 127). Though Herodotus reports that Artabazus slaughtered them, Boetiaeans continued to live in the area. Olynthus became a Greek polis, but it remained insignificant (in the quota-lists of the Delian League it appears as paying on the average 2 talents, as compared with 6 to 15 paid by Scione, 6 to 15 by Mende, 6 to 12 by Toroni, and 3 to 6 by Sermylia from 454 to 432). In 432 King Perdiccas II of Macedon encouraged several nearby coastal towns to disband and remove their population to Olynthus, preparatory to a revolt to be led by Potidaea against Athens (Thuc. 1.58). This synoecism (œÉœÖŒΩŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ) was effected, though against Perdiccas's wishes the contributing cities were preserved. This increase in population led to the settlement of the North Hill, which was developed on a Hippodamian grid plan. In 423 Olynthus became the head of a formal Chalkidian League, occasioned by the synoecism or by the beginning of the Peloponnesian War and fear of Athenian attack. During the Peloponnesian war it formed a base for Brasidas in his expedition of 424 and refuge for the citizens of Mende and Poteidaea that had rebelled against the Athenians (Thu. ii, 70). After the end of the Peloponnesian War the development of the league was rapid and ended consisting of 32 cities. About 393 we find it concluding an important treaty with Amyntas III of Macedon (the father of Philip II), and by 382 it had absorbed most of the Greek cities west of the Strymon, and had even got possession of Pella, the chief city in Macedon. (Xenophon, Hell. V. 2, 12). In this year Sparta was induced by an embassy from Acanthus and Apollonia, which anticipated conquest by the league, to send an expedition against Olynthus. After three years of indecisive warfare Olynthus consented to dissolve the confederacy (379). It is clear, however, that the dissolution was little more than formal, as the Chalcidians (\\"ŒßŒ±ŒªŒ∫ŒπŒ¥·øÜœÇ ·ºÄœÄ√≤ ŒòœÅ·æ¥Œ∫Œ∑œÇ\\") appear, only a year or two later, among the members of the Athenian naval confederacy of 378‚Äì377. Twenty years later, in the reign of Philip, the power of Olynthus is asserted by Demosthenes to have been much greater than before the Spartan expedition. The town itself at this period is spoken of as a city of the first rank (œÄ√≥ŒªŒπœÇ ŒºuœÅ·º∞Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ), and the league included thirty-two cities. When the Social War broke out between Athens and its allies (357), Olynthus was at first in alliance with Philip. Subsequently, in alarm at the growth of his power, it concluded an alliance with Athens. Olynthus made three embassies to Athens, the occasions of Demosthenes's three Olynthiac Orations. On the third, the Athenians sent soldiers from among its citizens. After Philip had deprived Olynthus of the rest of the League, by force and by the treachery of sympathetic factions, he besieged Olynthus in 348. The siege was short; he bought Olynthus's two principal citizens, Euthycrates and Lasthenes, who betrayed the city to him. He then looted and razed the city and sold its population--including the Athenian garrison--into slavery. According to the latest researches only a small area of the North Hill was ever re-occupied, up to 318, before Cassander forced the population to move in his new city of Cassandreia. Though the city was extinguished, through subsequent centuries there would be men scattered through the Hellenistic world who were called Olynthians. Topography and archaeology Floor mosaic depicting Bellerophon scene in a house of ancient city of Olynthos. The city of Olynthus lies in the hill named Megale Toumba near the village of Myriophyto. The probable site of Olynthus was identified as early as 1902. Between 1914 and 1916 plans were made for an excavation by the British School at Athens, but these fell through. The ancient city extends over two hills that detach from a small coulee and possess an area ca. 1500 m long and 400 m in width. Excavations began in 1928. Prof. David Moore Robinson of Johns Hopkins University, under the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, conducted four seasons of work: in 1928, 1931, 1934, and 1939. The results of the excavations were digested into fourteen folio volumes, that were ultimately found to be the plagiarized work of another excavator, Mary Ross Ellingson. The excavation had uncovered more than five hectares of Olynthus and a portion of Mecyberna (the harbor of Olynthus). On the North Hill this hurried pace proved relatively harmless due to the simple stratigraphy of an area of the city occupied only for 84 years and subjected to a sudden, final destruction; but the data from the South Hill was badly muddled. Nonetheless the work was excellent for its time, and remains supremely valuable. Much of the stratigraphy of the North Hill has been reconstructed by Nicholas Cahill (University of Wisconsin). The site is now in the charge of Dr. Julia Vokotopoulou, and the XVI Ephorate of Classical Antiquities. The Neolithic settlement is located in the edge of the southern hill and was dated in the 3rd millennium BC. The houses were built by stone blocks and had one or two rooms. The pottery that was found was the typical of that period comprising monochrome ceramic vases. The end of this rural settlement was abrupt and is placed around the 1st millennium. The archaic city was built under a provincially urban plan and extended throughout the whole south hill. Two avenues were revealed along the eastern and western edges of the hill that intersected with crossing streets. Along the south avenue shops and small houses were found while the administrative part was located in the north part of the hill, where the agora and a deanery were found. Tombstone in Olynthus The classical city was established on the much larger north hill and to its eastern slope. The excavations, which cover only 1/10 of the city's total area, have revealed a Hippodamian grid plan. Two large avenues were discovered, with an amplitude of 7 meters, along with vertical and horizontal streets that divided the urban area into city blocks. Each one had ten houses with two floors and a paved yard. Very important for the archaeological research are considered the rich villas that were excavated in the aristocratic suburb of the city located in the eastern part of the north hill since there was found some of the earliest floor mosaics in Greek art. Both the archaic and classical city were protected by an extended land wall. Parts of the foundations of the wall were revealed in the north hill and elsewhere, but they are not enlightening on which method was followed for their construction. Archaeologists suppose that it was built with sun-dried bricks with a stone base, but it's difficult to tell, since the city was literally leveled by Phillip. As it concerns the public buildings, the agora is placed in the south edge of the north hill, near the eastern gate, along with a public fountain, an arsenal and the city's parliament building (ŒíŒøœÖŒªŒµœÖœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ). There is a small museum featuring artifacts recovered from Olynthus, and the whole archaeological site is open to public tours during daylight hours.

M. W. Turner The Rye House Plot of 1683 was a plan to assassinate King Charles II of England and his brother (and heir to the throne) James, Duke of York. The royal party went from Westminster to Newmarket to see horse races and were expected to make the return journey on 1 April 1683, but because there was a major fire in Newmarket on 22 March (which destroyed half the town), the races were cancelled, and the King and the Duke returned to London early. As a result, the planned attack never took place. Historians vary in their assessment of the degree to which details of the conspiracy were finalised. Whatever the state of the assassination plot, plans to mount a rebellion against the Stuart monarchy were being entertained by some opposition leaders in England. The government cracked down hard on those in a series of state trials, accompanied with repressive measures and widespread searches for arms. The Plot presaged, and may have hastened, the rebellions of 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion and Argyll's Rising. Background After the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660 there was concern among some members of Parliament, former republicans and sections of the Protestant population of England that the King's relationship with France under Louis XIV and the other Catholic rulers of Europe was too close. Anti-Catholic sentiment, which associated Roman Catholicism with absolutism, was widespread, and focused particular attention on the succession to the English throne. While Charles was publicly Anglican, he and his brother were known to have Catholic sympathies. These suspicions were confirmed in 1673 when James was discovered to have converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1681, triggered by the opposition-invented Popish Plot, the Exclusion Bill was introduced in the House of Commons, which would have excluded James from the succession. Charles outmanoeuvred his opponents and dissolved the Oxford Parliament. This left his opponents with no lawful method of preventing James's succession, and rumours of plots and conspiracies abounded. With the \\"country party\\" in disarray, Lord Melville, Lord Leven, and Lord Shaftesbury, leader of the opposition to Charles's rule, fled to Holland where Shaftesbury soon died. Many well-known members of Parliament and noblemen of the \\"country party\\" would soon be known as Whigs, a faction name that stuck. The plot Route from Newmarket to London in 1683, past Rye House. Rye House, located north-east of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, was a fortified mediaeval mansion surrounded by a moat.. The house was leased by a republican and Civil War veteran, Richard Rumbold. The plan was to conceal a force of men in the grounds of the house and ambush the King and the Duke as they passed by on their way back to London from the horse races at Newmarket. The \\"Rye House plotters\\", an extremist Whig group who are now named for this plot, allegedly adopted the plan out of a number of possibilities, having decided that it gave tactical advantages and could be carried out with a relatively small force operating with guns from good cover. The royal party were expected to make the journey on 1 April 1683, but there was a major fire in Newmarket on 22 March, which destroyed half of the town. The races were cancelled, and the King and the Duke returned to London early. As a result, the planned attack never took place. Rye House in an engraving from 1777. The gate across the road signifies the toll payable for use of the route. There were miscellaneous buildings on the large site, to the right of the road. The crenellated brick gatehouse dates from the 15th century. The Rye House and other plotters The conspirators of this period were numerous, and the resort to some sort of armed resistance was widely debated from the early 1680s, on what was becoming the Whig side of the factional division of British politics. The form it should take was uncertain, and discussions of the seizing of control of cities other than London, such as Bristol, and a Scottish uprising, were in the air. The subsequent historiography of the Plot was largely partisan, and scholars are still clarifying who was closely involved in the planning of violent and revolutionary measures. =The West cabal= The assassination plot centred on a group that was convened in 1682‚Äì1683 by Robert West of the Middle Temple, a Green Ribbon Club member: it is now often called the Rye House cabal. West had participated in one of the cases that wound up the Popish Plot allegations, that of the false witness Stephen College. Through that association he made contact with Aaron Smith and William Hone, both to be plotters though aside from the main group. John Locke had arranged accommodation for West in Oxford at that time and had other associations in the group of revolutionary activists (Smith, John Ayloffe, Christopher Battiscombe and Israel Hayes), of whom Ayloffe was certainly implicated in the Rye House Plot, leaving Locke vulnerable. Account of Rye House, from the official history of the Plot by Thomas Sprat (2nd edition, 1685). Rumbold was introduced to West's group by John Wildman, but when the plot was discovered, both had distanced themselves, Wildman by refusing to finance Rumbold in the purchase of arms and Rumbold by losing his earlier enthusiasm.; =The uprising plans= Cabal members such as Richard Nelthorpe favoured a rebellion rather than an assassination, aligning much of the West group's discussion with the plans of Algernon Sidney, in particular, and the more aristocratic country party members making up the so-called Monmouth cabal. There were discussions in the group around Monmouth in September 1682 of an uprising, having participants in common with the group around West. The \\"cabal\\" was later named as the \\"council of six\\", which took form after the Tory successes in summer 1682 in the struggle to control the City of London. A significant aspect was the intention to employ Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll for a military rebellion in Scotland.The \\"council of six\\" comprised Monmouth, Sidney, Lord Russell, the Earl of Essex, Howard of Escrick, and John Hampden . Smith in January 1683 was sent to contact supporters in Scotland, for the \\"six\\", with a view to summoning them to London; but apparently botched the mission by indiscretions. In fact West's contacts with the Monmouth cabal, and knowledge of their intentions, were in part quite indirect. Thomas Walcot and Robert Ferguson had accompanied Shaftesbury to the Netherlands in his self- imposed exile of November 1682. They then both returned to London and associated with West, who learned from Walcott of Shaftesbury's own plan for a general rebellion. Walcott went on to say that he would lead the attack on the royal guards, but he was another of the plotters who drew the line at assassination. During the spring of 1683 there were further contacts between the Monmouth cabal and West's group about drafting a manifesto, through Sir Thomas Armstrong in particular, there being disagreements about whether a republican or monarchical constitution should result from revolutionary measures. In May 1683 West and Walcott discussed with a larger groupIncluding Francis Goodenough, Richard Goodenough, James Holloway, Edward Norton, John Rumsey, and Nathaniel Wade. the prospects for raising a force of several thousand men around London. =Scottish and American connections= The interpretation of actual Whig intentions at this time is complicated by colonial schemes in America. West had a stake in East Jersey. Shaftesbury was heavily involved in the Province of Carolina. In April 1683, some Scottish contacts of the Whigs arrived in London, as briefed by Smith, meeting Essex and Russell of the Monmouth cabal. They were under the impression that the matter concerned Carolina, or they gave that out as a pretext for their presence. They included Sir George Campbell of Cessnock, John Cochrane, and William Carstares. The Earl of Argyll had left London for the Netherlands in August 1682 but kept in touch with Whig notables through couriers and ciphered correspondence. Two of them, William Spence (alias Butler) and Abraham Holmes, were arrested in June 1683.; Informers and arrests John Savage, and comprising seven portraits of figures of the Plot all of whom were dead by 1685 (Sir Thomas Armstrong, the Earl of Argyll, the Earl of Essex, Henry Cornish, William Russell, Lord Russell, the Duke of Monmouth, and Algernon Sidney), with one of Edmund Berry Godfrey, whose unexplained death triggered the Popish Plot allegations against Catholics. Title page of Thomas Sprat's official account of the Plot. News of the plot leaked when Josiah Keeling gave information on it to Sir Leoline Jenkins; and the plot was publicly discovered 12 June 1683. Keeling had contacted a courtier, who put him in touch with George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, and Dartmouth had brought him to Jenkins, Secretary of State. Keeling's testimony was used at the trials of Walcott, Hone, Sidney, and Charles Bateman; and it earned him a pardon. It also started a lengthy process of incriminated persons confessing, in the hope of clemency. Using his brother, Keeling was able to get further direct evidence of conspiracy, and Jenkins brought in Rumsey and West, who told him what they knew, from 23 June;. West had volunteered information via Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, on the 22nd. Over several days West explained the Rye House plot and his part in purchasing arms, supposed to be for America. He did little to incriminate the Monmouth group; his testimony was later used against Walcott and Sidney. West received a pardon in December 1684. Thomas Walcott was arrested on 8 July, and was the first conspirator to go to trial. A meeting of the plotters had been held at his house on 18 June; but rather than escape, he chose to write to Jenkins, with the offer of a full confession in return for a pardon. Among the plotters, John Row from Bristol was considered particularly unreliable, and he had a direct connection to the Monmouth household to offer as information; a number of steps were taken to silence him, and his life was under threat more than once. After the meeting Nelthorpe and Edward Norton called on William Russell, Lord Russell, with an appeal to take up arms immediately; when Russell was unwilling, Nelthorpe left the country. Walcott named Henry Care, publisher of the Weekly Pacquet which was a leading anti-Catholic and Whig paper of the time; Care ceased publishing the Pacquet on 13 July, and began co-operating with the court. Among those later informing against Walcott was Zachary Bourne. Bourne was a conspirator, arrested trying to leave the country with the nonconformist ministers Matthew Meade, for whom an arrest warrant was issued on 27 June, and Walter Cross; he informed against another minister, Stephen Lobb, who was prepared to help recruiting for an uprising. On 6 July the arrest of Lobb was ordered, and he was picked up in August. A royal declaration of the heinous nature of the plot was issued on 27 July. Many more were arrested. Although the principal conspirators were minor figures, and not directly concerned in the \\"Monmouth cabal\\", the court party made no distinction between the groups. The ministers involved may have known Ferguson but not West; Meade had sheltered the Covenanter John Nisbet, and may well have known of the plans for a rebellion. William Carstares, a Church of Scotland minister and intermediary with the Whig grandees, was found in Kent on 23 July.

Having fled abroad the previous year, Sir William Waller moved to Bremen in 1683. While he was there he became a central figure in a group of the erstwhile conspirators who were in political exile. Lord Preston, the English ambassador at Paris, called him \\"the governor\\" and wrote that \\"They style Waller, by way of commendation, a second Cromwell\\". Waller would accompany William of Orange to England in 1688 but William chose to overlook him when his government was formed. cites: Hist. MSS. Comm. 7th Rep. pp. 296, 311, 347, 386. Evaluations Historians have suggested the story of the plot may have been largely manufactured by Charles or his supporters to allow the removal of most of his strongest political opponents. Richard Greaves cites as proof that there was a plot in 1683, the 1685 armed rebellions of the fugitive Earl of Argyll and Charles' Protestant illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. Doreen Milne asserts that its importance lies less in what was actually plotted than in the public perception of it and the uses made of it by the government. Popular reaction to the Tories' reactive excesses, sometimes known as the \\"Stuart Revenge\\" though that term is contested, led to the discontent expressed decisively in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

John Good's parents were the Nonconformist minister Revd Peter Good and Sarah Good, the daughter of another Nonconformist minister, Revd Henry Peyto of Great Coggeshall. John Mason Good was named after the Puritan clergyman and hymn writer John Mason (1645-1694), of whom his mother Sarah was a descendant. Good attended a school at Romsey kept by his father. At about the age of 15 John Good was apprenticed to a surgeon-apothecary at Gosport. In 1783 he went to London to practice his medical studies. In the autumn of 1784, he began to practice as a surgeon at Sudbury in Suffolk. There he was an acquaintance of Nathan Drake, a fellow writer and student of Shakespeare. In 1793 Good removed to London, where he entered into partnership with a surgeon and apothecary. But the partnership was soon dissolved, and to increase his income, he began to devote attention to literary pursuits. Besides contributing both in prose and verse to the Analytical and Critical Reviews and the British and Monthly Magazines, and other periodicals, he wrote a large number of works relating chiefly to medical and religious subjects. In 1794 John Good became a member of the British Pharmaceutical Society, and in that connection, and especially by the publication of his work, A History of Medicine (1795), he did much to effect a greatly needed reform in the profession of the apothecary. In 1795 the London Medical Society awarded him their Fothergillian gold medal. In 1820, he took the diploma of M.D. at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen. He died at Shepperton, Middlesex, on 2 January 1827. Good was not only well versed in classical literature, but was acquainted with the principal European languages, and also with Persian, Arabic and Hebrew. His prose works display wide erudition, but their style is dull and tedious. His poetry never rises above pleasant and well-versified commonplace. His translation of Lucretius, The Nature of Things (1805-1807), contains elaborate philological and explanatory notes, together with parallel passages and quotations from European and Asiatic authors.

A leading conspirator in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler,Exponat: Photo: Witzleben, Erwin von, 1941‚Äì1944 at www.dhm.de he was designated to become Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht in a post-Nazi regime had the plot succeeded. Early years Erwin von Witzleben was born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) in the Prussian province of Silesia, the son of Georg von Witzleben (1838‚Äì1898), a Hauptmann (captain) in the Prussian Army, and his wife, Therese n√©e Brandenburg. The Witzleben dynasty was an Uradel family of old nobility and many officers, descending from Witzleben in Thuringia. He completed the Prussian Cadet Corps program in Wahlstatt, Silesia and in Lichterfelde near Berlin, and on 22 June 1901 joined the Grenadier Regiment K√∂nig Wilhelm I No. 7 in Liegnitz, Silesia (now Legnica, Poland) as a Leutnant (lieutenant). In 1910, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant). He was married to Else Kleeberg from Chemnitz, Saxony. The couple had a son and a daughter. First World War At the beginning of the First World War, Witzleben served as brigade adjutant in the 19th Reserve Infantry Brigade before being promoted to Hauptmann and company chief in the Reserve Infantry Regiment No.6 in October 1914. Later, in the same regiment, he became battalion commander. His unit fought in Verdun, the Champagne region and Flanders, among other places. He was seriously wounded and was awarded the Iron Cross, both first and second classes. Afterwards, he was sent to General Staff training and witnessed the war end as First General Staff Officer of the 121st Division. Between the wars Witzleben (r.) with Reichswehr Generaloberst Wilhelm Heye, c. 1930 In the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic, Witzleben was promoted to company commander. In 1923, he found himself on the Fourth Division staff in Dresden as a Major. In 1928, he became battalion commander in Infantry Regiment No. 6 and retained that position as Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) the following year. After being promoted to full Oberst (colonel) in 1931, he took over as commanding officer of the (Prussian) Infantry Regiment No. 8 in Frankfurt on the Oder. Early in 1933, shortly before Adolf Hitler seized autocratic control of the German state via a paramilitary backed revolution with the passage in the Reichstag of the Enabling Act of 1933, Witzleben was transferred to the post of Infantry Leader VI in Hanover. He was promoted to Generalmajor (major general) on 1 February 1934 and moved to Potsdam as the new commander of the 3rd Infantry Division. He succeeded General Werner von Fritsch as commander of Military District (Wehrkreis) III - Berlin (including Brandenburg and part of Neumark). In this position, he was promoted to Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) and in the newly established Wehrmacht forces became commanding general of Army Corps III in Berlin in September 1935. In 1936, he was promoted to a General of the Infantry (General der Infanterie). As early as 1934, Witzleben indicated opposition against the Nazi regime when he and Manstein, Leeb, and Rundstedt demanded an inquiry into Schleicher's and Bredow's deaths in the Night of the Long Knives. As a result of that and his criticism of Hitler's persecution of Fritsch in the Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch Affair, Witzleben was temporarily forced into early retirement. His \\"retirement\\" did not last, however, as Hitler soon needed him in the preparations for the Second World War. Hitler, Witzleben and SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Sepp Dietrich at the 1936 Summer Olympics By 1938, Witzleben was a member of the Oster Conspiracy, a group of plotters including Generaloberst (Colonel General) Ludwig Beck, Generals Erich Hoepner and Carl- Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel, Admiral and Chief of the Abwehr Wilhelm Canaris and Abwehr Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) Hans Oster. The men planned to overthrow Hitler in a military coup d'√©tat, which seemed feasible at the time of the 1938 Sudeten Crisis, until the Munich Agreement defused the crisis, temporarily averting war. Witzleben's command, including the key Berlin Defense District, was to have played a decisive role in the planned coup. In November 1938, Witzleben had been installed as commander-in-chief of Army Group 2 in Frankfurt. He was also involved in Generaloberst Hammerstein- Equord's conspiracy plans of 1939. The latter planned to seize Hitler outright in a kind of frontal assault while the former would shut down the Nazi headquarters, but the plan also fell through. Second World War Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt and Witzleben in France, March 1941 In September 1939, Witzleben, then a Generaloberst (Colonel General), took command of the 1st Army, stationed at the Western Front. When Germany attacked France on 10 May 1940, the First Army was part of Army Group C. On 14 June it broke through the Maginot line, and within three days had forced several French divisions to surrender. For this, Witzleben was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross; and on 19 July, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall (General Field Marshal) during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. Witzleben as the commander of OB West with Generaloberst Curt Haase, commander of the 15th Army, May 1941 In 1941 he was even appointed Commander-in-Chief OB West, succeeding Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, but only a year later, he took leave from that position for health reasons. Some sources, however, claim that he was again forcibly retired at this time after he had criticised the regime for its invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 in Operation Barbarossa. =20 July 1944= In 1944, the conspirators around Stauffenberg saw Witzleben as the key man in their plans. Whereas Generaloberst (Colonel General) Beck was seen as a prospective provisional head of state, and Generaloberst Hoepner was in line to command the inner Ersatzheer (\\"Replacement Army\\") forces, Witzleben was to take over supreme command of the whole Wehrmacht as the highest-ranking German officer. However, on 20 July 1944, the day of Stauffenberg's attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia, Witzleben did not arrive at the Bendlerblock in Berlin from the OKH-HQ (Oberkommando des Heeres Headquarters) at Zossen to assume command of the coup forces until 8 p.m., when it was already clear that the coup attempt had failed. He then protested angrily that it had been bungled and left after 45 minutes to return to Zossen, where he reported the situation to General of the Artillery (General der Artillerie) Eduard Wagner and then drove back to his country estate, 30 mi away, where he was arrested the next day by Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Viktor Linnarz of the OKH personnel office. He was then cast out of the Wehrmacht by the so-called Ehrenhof der Wehrmacht (\\"The Regular Army's Court of Honor\\"), a conclave of officers set up after the attempted assassination to remove officers from the Wehrmacht who had been involved in the plot, mainly so that they were no longer subject to German military law and could be arraigned to a show trial before the infamous Nazi \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof). =Trial and death= Witzleben at the Volksgerichtshof On 7 August 1944, Witzleben was in the first group of accused conspirators to be brought before the Volksgerichtshof. Ravaged by the conditions of his Gestapo arrest, he surprisingly approached the bench giving the Nazi salute,In the Name of the Volk: Political Justice in Hitler's Germany Hannsjoachim Wolfgang Koch & I. B. Tauris (November 15, 1997), p. 198 for which he was rebuked by the presiding judge Roland Freisler. Witzleben was sentenced to death on the same day. Witzleben's gave these closing words in court, addressed to Freisler: Much of the Volksgerichtshof, including scenes of Witzleben's show trial, was filmed for the German weekly newsreel Die Deutsche Wochenschau; however, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels decided against releasing the footage, firstly because Freisler's vituperative, insulting verbiage in the courtroom might draw sympathy for the accused and secondly because the regime wanted to quell public discussion of the event. The material was classified as secret (Geheime Reichssache). Witzleben was put to death the same day at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. By Hitler's direct orders, he was hanged with a thin hemp rope, which people who were not from the prison staff called a piano wire, wound around a meat hook, and the execution was filmed.\\"His execution on 8 August 1944 was a particularly grisly affair. The 63-year-old field marshal was pushed into a cellar at Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee prison, placed under a meat hook and, half-naked with a running noose around his head, he was lifted and slowly strangled.\\" Robert Solomon Wistrich, \\"Witzleben, Erwin von (1881‚Äì1944) General Field Marshal of the Wehrmacht\\", Who's Who in Nazi Germany, (Routledge, 2001), p. 279‚Äì80\\"SS men were filming....

However, members of the families of the former nobility got around the law by making the title a part of the person's legal name. Schenk was a role-title (\\"Butler\\" or \\"Cup-bearer\\"); Graf was the title, meaning \\"Count\\". * Likewise, the term Freiherr in \\"Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord\\" is now also a name element, and not a title.

Discovery Some of the Mirador basin was surveyed in 1885 by Claudio Urrutia, who noted the presence of ruins. But El Mirador had little attention paid to it until Ian Graham spent some time there making the first map of the area in 1962. A detailed investigation was begun in 1978 with an archaeological project under the direction of Bruce Dahlin (The Catholic University of America) and Ray Matheny (Brigham Young University). Dahlin's work focused primarily on the bajo swamps and mapping, while Matheny's team focused primarily on excavations in the site center and architecture. This project ended in 1983. To the surprise of the archaeologists, it was found that a large amount of construction was not contemporary with the large Maya classic cities in the area, like Tikal and Uaxactun, but rather from centuries earlier in the pre-classic era (see: Mesoamerican chronology). In 2003, Richard D. Hansen, a Senior Scientist from Idaho State University, initiated major investigation, stabilization, and conservation programs at El Mirador with a multi-disciplinary approach, including staff and technical personnel from 52 universities and research institutions from throughout the world. By August 2008, the team had published 168 scientific papers,Mirador Basin Project, The Cradle of Maya Civilization, 2010 and produced many technical reports and scientific presentations as well as documentary films in the History Channel, National Geographic, the Learning Channel, BBC, ABC's 20/20 and Good Morning America, 60 Minutes (Australia), and the Discovery Channel. In 2019, Yes Theory released The Lost Pyramid, a feature-length documentary about their adventure through the Guatemalan jungle to climb The La Danta pyramid. History Stela 2 at El Mirador.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 257. El Mirador flourished from about the 6th century BCE to the 1st century CE, reaching its height from the 3rd century BCE. Then it experienced a hiatus of construction and perhaps abandonment for generations, followed by re- occupation and further construction in the Late Classic era, and a final abandonment about the end of the 9th century. The civic center of the site covers some with several thousand structures, including monumental architecture from 10 to 72 meters high. One of the key elements for this tremendous rise in human population was the many bajos, seasonal swamps, in the region. Tropical-forest soil contains hardly any nutrients and most of the nutrients present get washed away by rain. Yet the Maya developed a system that was highly productive. In the Mirador basin, the swamps provided the solution. By importing mud from the swamps by the thousands of tonnes, the Maya created mud-covered terraces ready for agriculture. By adding lime to the soil, they elevated the pH, making it suitable for a variety of crops: corn, squash, beans, cacao, cotton and palm. When the ground was depleted of nutrients, adding another layer of mud reinvigorates the fields. There is a number of \\"triadic\\" structures (around 35 structures), consisting of large artificial platforms topped with a set of 3 summit pyramids. The most notable of such structures are three huge complexes; one is nicknamed \\"El Tigre\\", with height ; the other is called \\"La Danta\\" (or Danta) temple. The La Danta temple measures approximately tall from the forest floor,Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 253. and considering its total volume (2,800,000 cubic meters) is one of the largest pyramids in the world.National Geographic Channel ‚Äì Dawn of the Maya When the large man-made platform that the temple is built upon (some 180,000 square meters) is included in calculations, La Danta is considered by some archeologists to be one of the most massive ancient structures in the world. Also the \\"Los Monos\\" complex is very large (48 meters high) although not as well known. Most of the structures were originally faced with cut stone which was then decorated with large stucco masks depicting the deities of Maya mythology. According to Carlos Morales-Aguilar, a Guatemalan archaeologist from Pantheon-Sorbonne University, the city appears to have been planned from its foundation, as extraordinary alignments have been found between the architectural groups and main temples, which were possibly related to solar alignments.≈†prajc et al. 2009 The study reflects an importance of urban planning and sacred spaces since the first settlers. Stucco friezes at El Mirador that adorned the banks of a water-collecting system. An additional feature of El Mirador is the quantity and size of causeways, internally linking important architectural compounds, and externally linking the numerous major ancient cities within the Mirador Basin during the latter part of the Middle and Late Preclassic periods. The causeways are commonly referred to as sacbeob (the plural form of sacbe, meaning \\"white road\\" in Mayan, from sac \\"white\\" and be \\"road\\"). These are raised stone causeways raising 2 to 6 meters above the level of the surrounding landscape and measuring from 20 to 50 meters wide. One sacbe links El Mirador to the neighbouring site of Nakbe, approximately 12 km away, while another joined El Mirador to El Tintal, 20 km away. While the city and the sister centers of the Mirador Basin thrived between 300 BCE and the Common Era (CE), apparently, the site was abandoned, as were nearly all other major sites in the area, by about 150 CE. A large wall, which must have been as high as 3 to 8 meters, had been constructed on the entire northern, eastern, and southern portions of the West Group of the city prior to its abandonment in the terminal Preclassic period, suggesting a possible threat that had been perceived by this time.World Library, El Mirador Another aspect that may have led to the downfall of the system, was soil erosion due to deforestation. The Maya were fond of plastering buildings, houses, floors and even ceramics with layers of lime plaster called stucco. This plaster created a nice smooth surface which facilitated painting. With this stucco, the Maya created many astonishingly beautiful artifacts, as well as smooth-walled pyramids and 'paved' roads. But a darker side to this production became evident when consumption started to evolve into conspicuous consumption. The production of lime needs a large amount of wood. Archeologists have calculated that for the production of 1 ton of lime cement, 5 tonnes of limestone and 5 tonnes of wood were needed. Also, dry wood was not suitable due to the large fluctuations in temperature, as a stable temperature was needed to properly burn the limestone. To accomplish this, green wood was needed. So the Maya cut down every available green tree in the area. Excavations in and around the bajos (swamps) revealed the effects of deforestation. When trees vanish, the soil becomes loose and is easily transported by water (e.g. rain). Also, water flows downhill, and the only places in the Basin where it could flow to, were these bajos. The nutrient- rich muck that was so vigorously imported from the bajos was now buried under a 2 to 3-metre thick layer of sterile clay. This cut-off the driving force behind the sustainable agricultural fields. When you cannot replenish your crop fields, more and more harvests start to fail. In the end the failing crop fields led to starvation and collapse of society. In the Late Classic period, c. 700 CE, portions of the site were reoccupied on a more modest scale, with small structures nestled among the ruins of the great preclassic center. The largest structure from this time period is scarcely more than 8 meters high, and many of the preclassic building were plundered for stone materials for construction and lime making. The Late Classic occupants however, were noted scribes and artists. The area of the Mirador Basin is the only known source of the \\"codex-style ceramics\\", a particularly fine polychrome ceramic consisting of black line drawings on a cream colored background. The Late Classic occupation was brief, and by about 900 CE, the area was again nearly completely abandoned, and remains so until the present time. Today Richard D. Hansen, an archaeologist from Idaho State University, is the current director of the Mirador Basin Project, and according to his discoveries here, he thinks that the more than 45 mapped sites in the Mirador Basin may have formed the earliest well-defined political state in Mesoamerica.Smithsonian Magazine, El Mirador, the Lost City of the Maya, May 2011 Exposed stonework at El Mirador in 2000 Although containing striking examples of Preclassic Maya civilization, the remote location of El Mirador has prevented it from becoming a popular tourist site. Major plans by the current government of Guatemala include El Mirador as an important center of the Cuatro Balam Conservation and Development project. Threats to Mirador This large concentration of Preclassic Maya cities in Mesoamerica is threatened by massive deforestation, looting, and destruction caused by equipment used in logging road construction, which itself facilitates intrusive settlements.Archaeology Magazine ‚Äì Under Threat, January/February 2009 The Mirador Basin in the far northern Pet√©n region of Guatemala is known for its abundance of sites, many of which are among the largest and earliest in the Maya world.

The programs first met in 1904 or 1915 (the status of the first game is disputed) and have played every season since 1926 except for a war- time interruption in 1943. It is one of the most prominent rivalry games in college football, and it has been held in Jacksonville, Florida since 1933, with only two exceptions, making it one of the few remaining neutral-site rivalries in college football. The game attracts huge crowds to Jacksonville, and the associated tailgating and other events earned it the nickname of the \\"World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\\", although that name is no longer used officially. Though highly contested on both sides, the series has gone through several periods in which one team has been dominant for over a decade. Georgia won at least twenty-two out of the first twenty-seven games while Florida held a clear advantage in the 1950s and 1960s. Georgia again dominated in the 1970s and 80s under coach Vince Dooley, while Florida dominated the 1990s and 2000s under coaches Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer. More recently, the series has been more evenly balanced than it had ever been before. In the dozen games since 2008 (inclusive), the schools have earned six victories each, with the fierce rivals enjoying and then suffering through alternating pairs of three game win streaks.  Series history  =Disputed beginnings= The two universities do not agree on when the rivalry began. The University of Georgia's athletic department counts a 1904 match its football squad played against a team from a school known as the University of Florida.2011 Georgia Football Media Guide , University of Georgia Athletic Department, Athens, Georgia, pp. 157 & 158 (2011). Retrieved August 19, 2011. The game was held in Macon, Georgia, and Georgia won 52‚Äì0. However, this was not the modern University of Florida in Gainesville, but one of its four predecessor institutions: a school previously known as Florida Agricultural College, based in Lake City.Florida Agricultural College was founded as the state's land- grant college in 1884, and pursuant to an act of the Florida Legislature was known as the \\"University of Florida\\" from 1903 until it was abolished by the legislature's passage of the Buckman Act in 1905, which merged it and three other schools into the modern University of Florida. See Carl Van Ness & Kevin McCarthy, Honoring the Past, Shaping the Future: The University of Florida, 1853‚Äì2003, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 6‚Äì10, 12‚Äì13 (2003).

UGA sports historian Dan Magill sums up Georgia's attitude: \\"That's where Florida was back then. We can't help it if they got run out of Lake City.\\" =Series trends= While the two universities agree that Georgia leads the overall series, they disagree as to the overall series record due to the disputed 1904 game. As of the 2019 contest, Georgia leads with a 53‚Äì43‚Äì2 record by its reckoning and 52‚Äì43‚Äì2 by Florida's count. The first game acknowledged by both schools was held in Jacksonville in 1915. The rivalry has been renewed annually since 1926, except for the 1943 season when Florida did not field a team due to World War II.\\"The rivalry: Florida vs. Georgia\\", CBS Sports (undated 2001). Retrieved August 20, 2011. Georgia dominated the early rivalry; Florida's teams did not score a single point against the Bulldogs until their fifth (or sixth) meeting. The Gators won their first two games against Georgia in 1928 and 1929, when coach Charlie Bachman's squads briefly brought Florida's football program to national prominence. However, after a scoreless tie in 1930, Georgia resumed its dominance in the border rivalry, winning fifteen out of the next seventeen games in the series as coach Wally Butts led the Bulldogs to several SEC championships while the Gators suffered through a period of mediocrity. Florida finally enjoyed longer-term success in the rivalry in the 1950s under coach Bob Woodruff, a trend that continued into the 1960s under coach Ray Graves. The hiring of new Georgia coach Vince Dooley in 1964 evened the rivalry for the remainder of the decade, and in the 1970s and 1980s, his Bulldog squads usually won the game in Jacksonville while winning their last national championship to date in 1980 along the way. Coach Steve Spurrier's arrival in Gainesville turned the rivalry back around beginning in 1990, and his Gator squads went 11-1 against the Bulldogs. Coach Urban Meyer continued Florida's winning trend through the mid-2000s, but the rivalry has been unusually even since 2008. Florida began a three game series win streak in that season, which was followed by a three game Georgia streak, then another three game streak for Florida, which was answered by three Georgia wins, marking the longest evenly-divided dozen years in series history. Since the 1960s, the Florida‚ÄìGeorgia rivalry often held conference or national championship implications for one or both teams, and both schools have had title hopes dashed in the game, sometimes in a surprising upset. In 1966, the Bulldogs intercepted 3 passes by eventual Heisman Trophy winner Steve Spurrier, derailing the Gators' title hopes in a 27-10 upset. On the other hand, Florida's upset win over Georgia in 2002 was the Bulldogs' only loss of the season and likely cost them a chance to play for a national championship. The rivalry has taken on even more importance since the SEC split into divisions in 1992. Both teams were placed in the SEC East, meaning that the contest has often decided who will play in the SEC Championship Game. To date, Florida has fourteen Eastern Division titles while Georgia has ten. = Site of game = The Florida‚ÄìGeorgia game has often been held at off-campus sites since the very beginning of the rivalry. Before Florida Field was constructed in 1930, Florida's on-campus home at Fleming Field was quite small, so Gator squads usually played \\"home\\" games against major college opposition somewhere other than Gainesville. Early Florida-Georgia contests were held in Jacksonville (3 times), Savannah (twice), and Tampa (once), along with several Georgia home games in Athens. (The disputed 1904 game was played in Macon, Georgia, another neutral site.) The teams met in Gainesville for the first time in 1931, then returned to Athens in 1932. From 1933 onward, the game has been played in Jacksonville except for a home and home set in 1994 and 1995 when the old Gator Bowl was being rebuilt as Everbank Field for the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL. In almost 100 meetings, the game has been played in Athens or Gainesville a total of only seven times, and there are currently no plans to do so in the future. Playing the game at a neutral site rather than on their respective campuses provides the universities' athletic programs with more revenue from the game than if the site rotated on a \\"home- and-away\\" basis.Stewart Verney, \\"Money, not tradition keeps Florida‚ÄìGeorgia game in Jacksonville\\", Jacksonville Business Journal (October 5, 2010). Retrieved August 20, 2011. As of the 2018 contest, the universities made $3.3 million every year, or $6.6 million every two years, which is far more than the schools would earn if the game were played at their respective home stadiums. In addition, the city of Jacksonville agreed in 2019 to compensate the schools for the loss of a home game by paying each university $1 million per year plus travel expenses beginning in 2020. There have been occasional calls to move the game from Jacksonville, usually when either Georgia or Florida is dominating the rivalry. In 2018, Georgia coach Kirby Smart pointed out that the neutral site game cost both programs a valuable recruiting weekend every other year, a view that Florida coach Dan Mullen said that he \\"respected\\". However, the schools have continued to renew their contract since it makes financial sense for both schools to keep the game in Jacksonville.Tim Tucker, \\"UGA weighs moving Florida game . . . but where?\\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (May 17, 2009). Retrieved August 20, 2011. For example, despite vocal calls to move the game to Atlanta or make it a home-and-home contest after Florida went on a 16-3 run in the series, Georgia's athletic board unanimously agreed in 2009 to a six-year contract to keep the game in Jacksonville through 2016.Tim Tucker, \\"UGA‚ÄìUF game to stay in Jacksonville\\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (September 23, 1009). Retrieved August 20, 2011. The most recent contract extension keeps the game in Jacksonville until at least 2023 with an option for two more years. The game weekend is extremely lucrative for Jacksonville businesses, particularly in the downtown area, with many reporting that it is their busiest weekend of the year. In addition to being important to the city of Jacksonville, the Georgia Golden Isles also depend on the game to sustain businesses through the winter season as many Georgia students and alumni elect to spend the weekend on the Georgia Coast, particularly on Saint Simons Island, where thousands of Georgia students gather each year at the aptly named \\"Frat Beach\\" on Friday before commuting to Jacksonville the next day.

Beginning in the late 1980s, fans from Florida and Georgia were assigned seats grouped in alternating sections of the stadium to minimize incidents, and the contrasting colors worn by the fans (red and black for Georgia, orange and blue for Florida) created a \\"beach ball\\" visual effect in the stands. More recently, the seating arrangement has split the stadium lengthwise and fans sit on the side corresponding to the sideline their team occupies. The teams take turns serving as the \\"home\\" team, with the \\"hosts\\" usually wearing their home uniforms and the visitors wearing white road jerseys. However, the Bulldogs and Gators have faced off with both squads wearing their regular home uniforms on several occasions.  Rivalry traditions  =\\"World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\\"= The game is one of the busiest annual events in downtown Jacksonville, and attracts huge crowds that congregate around the stadium for tailgating and other happenings, particularly at the Jacksonville Landing, a riverfront plaza facing the St. Johns River. As a result the game and associated revelry have been known as \\"the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\\", a nickname first coined in the 1950s by Bill Kastelz, sports editor for The Florida Times-Union.Michael DiRocco, \\"Georgia‚ÄìFlorida game needs a name and a trophy\\", The Florida Times- Union (October 28, 2010). Retrieved February 21, 2012. Kastelz claimed he came up with the name after seeing a drunk, stumbling fan offer an alcoholic beverage to an on-duty police officer. The \\"Cocktail Party\\" nickname proved so popular that the City of Jacksonville used it for many years. However, the city dropped it from most official usage in 1988 following a series of alcohol-fueled outbursts. In 1984, Florida fans stormed the field and tore down the goal posts after a 27‚Äì0 victory; the following year, a 24‚Äì3 Georgia win led Bulldogs fans to do the same, ultimately resulting in 65 arrests. Thereafter, the city cracked down on excessive drinking and soon dropped its use of the name. In 2006 both schools and the Southeastern Conference asked CBS and the city to abandon the name in promotions due to concerns about alcohol abuse by students and other attendees. Since 2006, the rivalry has lacked an official name. It is generally called the \\"Florida‚ÄìGeorgia game\\" or \\"FLA/GA\\" in Florida, or \\"Georgia‚ÄìFlorida game\\" in Georgia; some entities, including the Jacksonville newspaper The Florida Times-Union, rotate the name each year to list the designated home team first.Mike Clark, \\"Dear reader advocate\\", The Florida Times-Union (October 28, 2001).

The city of Jacksonville announced that it would award the winning teams the goalposts from the game in 1986, in order to persuade fans not to storm the field and destroy them as they had the previous two years.

No trophy is presented at the game, however.  Notable games  As with most rivalries, there have been a number of close games over the years, often generating controversy and anguish over how the game ended for one of the teams involved. Like the series itself, most of the early memorable games favored the Bulldogs, with more recent ones favoring the Gators. Among the most memorable: = 1928: Ending the drought = When Charlie Bachman became the 1928 Gators' new head coach, he inherited a team loaded with talent recruited by his predecessor, Harold Sebring.Tom McEwen, The Gators: The Story of Florida Football, The Strode Publishers, Huntsville, Alabama, pp. 82‚Äì103 (1974). However, he also inherited a program which had never come close to beating the Georgia Bulldogs, their Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association rival. Georgia was 6‚Äì0 against Florida with five shutouts and a scoring advantage of 190‚Äì9 in their meetings so far. The teams met again in Savannah, Georgia on November 10, and Bachman's Gators finally beat the Bulldogs through the efforts of Florida's \\"Phantom Four\\" backfield of Dale Van Sickle, Carl Brumbaugh, Rainey Cawthon, Clyde Crabtree and Royce Goodbread. With Florida holding a commanding lead in fourth quarter, jubilant Gator fans prematurely rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, resulting in fist fights breaking out between supporters of the two schools. Order was restored, the game was completed, and Florida earned its first victory in the series by the score of 26‚Äì6. = 1941: Sinkwich beats Florida with a broken jaw = Georgia's All-American back Frank Sinkwich had broken his jaw in a game earlier in the season, but that didn't keep him off the field. Wearing a custom-made chinstrap attached to his helmet, Sinkwich ran 31 times for 142 and two touchdowns and kicked Georgia's first field goal since 1924 in the Bulldogs' 19‚Äì3 victory over the Gators. When speaking about the loss after the game, Florida coach Tom Lieb simply said \\"Too much Sinkwich.\\" = 1942: 75 and oh! = Having lost most upper-class players and several members of the coaching staff to service in World War II, the 1942 Florida Gators brought an inexperienced 3‚Äì4 squad into Jacksonville for the 1942 contest with Georgia.Ryan Ferguson, \\" It's Still Important to Hate Georgia: A History Lesson\\", AolNews.com (October 27, 2006).

The Bulldogs, on the other hand, still had the services of many key contributors thanks to draft deferments issued to players enrolled in the University of Georgia's ROTC program, and brought a 7‚Äì0 record and No. 1 ranking to Jacksonville.

Given little chance by anyone to beat coach Wally Butts' Georgia Bulldogs in Jacksonville, Kynes inspired his two-way linemen to their outstanding effort of the season, stopping the Bulldogs' running game on defense, and blocking for Hunsinger on offense.F.

Hunsinger rushed eighteen times for 174 yards and three touchdowns, and the Gators won 28‚Äì7, breaking a seven-game Georgia winning streak. Wolf's overall coaching record doomed his four-year tenure in Gainesville, but on that day he was carried from the field by his players. = 1952: 30‚Äì0 = The Florida- Georgia rivalry was almost half a century old by the 1950s, and by any measure, Georgia had dominated. As of the 1951 contest, the Bulldogs were 23‚Äì5‚Äì1 against the Gators. They'd shut out Florida twelve times and won by an average score of 23‚Äì5. More recent history was no better for the 1952 Gators. Georgia had won nine of the previous ten games in the series, and Florida coach Bob Woodruff was 0‚Äì2 against his arch-rivals. The Gators arrived in Jacksonville with a 3‚Äì2 record and an offense which had not performed well against good defenses. To jump start the Gators' attack, Coach Woodruff moved quarterback Rick Casares to fullback and inserted running back Doug Dickey into the quarterback position for the game. Casares had been recruited by Georgia but thought that Bulldog Coach Wally Butts was too rough with his players during a recruiting visit, so he opted to attend Florida instead.Golenbock, Go Gators!, p. 64 Led by Casares on offense and All- American Charlie LaPradd on defense, the Gators dominated the Bulldogs 30‚Äì0 in Jacksonville, which would remain the Gators' largest victory over the Bulldogs for almost forty years and was the first shutout over the Bulldogs since 1937. Casares scored two touchdowns, three extra points, and a field goal; and halfback Buford Long ran for 116 yards on 10 carries. Florida finished the season 8‚Äì3 and were invited to their first major bowl game, the 1953 Gator Bowl. Georgia finished 7‚Äì4 and went on to suffer through several sub-par seasons in the 1950s, helping Florida gain an advantage (5‚Äì4) during the decade for the first time in the rivalry. = 1964: Vince Dooley arrives = While Georgia still held an overall advantage in the series, Florida enjoyed a 10‚Äì2 streak from 1952 to 1963 under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves. That changed with the arrival of Vince Dooley as the new head coach of the underdog 1964 Georgia Bulldogs. In a game where the Bulldogs' quarterback failed to complete a single pass and was intercepted twice, Dooleys' 'Dogs relied on their running game, a staunch second-half defense, and a little bit of luck to beat Graves' tenth-ranked Florida Gators.United Press International, \\"Kicking Specialist Gets Winning Score\\", The Post and Courier, p. 4-D (November 8, 1964).

Instead, in a wild broken play, the Bulldogs' center and placeholder mishandled the snap, but Etter picked up the bobbled ball and ran it for a touchdown to win the game 14‚Äì7. Dooley's teams would split their first seven games 3‚Äì3‚Äì1 against Graves' Gators. Thereafter, Dooley's 'Dogs would go on to dominate the rivalry, winning fourteen of the nineteen games from 1971 to 1989. = 1966: Heisman curse? = Spurrier under center The seventh-ranked 1966 Florida Gators entered the game with a 7‚Äì0 record and the opportunity to clinch a share of their first-ever SEC title.Associated Press, \\"Georgia on Florida's SEC Mind\\", The Evening Independent, p. 18-A (November 4, 1966).

It was initially launched as Collier's Once a Week, then changed in 1895 to Collier's Weekly: An Illustrated Journal, and finally shortened in 1905 to Collier's: The National Weekly and eventually to simply Collier's. The magazine ceased publication with the issue dated for the week ending January 4, 1957, though a brief, failed attempt was made to revive the Collier's name with a new magazine in 2012. As a result of Peter Collier's pioneering investigative journalism, Collier's established a reputation as a proponent of social reform. When attempts by various companies to sue Collier ended in failure, other magazines became involved in what Theodore Roosevelt described as \\"muckraking journalism.\\" Sponsored by Nathan S. Collier (a descendant of Peter Collier), the Collier Prize for State Government Accountability was created in 2019. The annual US$25,000 prize is one of the largest Amercan journalism prizes, and it was established to honor Peter Collier‚Äôs legacy and contributions in the field of investigative reporting. History Peter F. Collier (1849‚Äì1909) left Ireland for the U.S. at age 17. Although he went to a seminary to become a priest, he instead started work as a salesman for P. J. Kenedy, publisher of books for the Roman Catholic market. When Collier wanted to boost sales by offering books on a subscription plan, it led to a disagreement with Kenedy, so Collier left to start his own subscription service. P. F. Collier & Son began in 1875, expanding into the largest subscription house in America with sales of 30 million books during the 1900‚Äì1910 decade.\\"Collier's Rise and Fall\\". collectingoldmagazines.com. Also The American Magazine by Janello & Jones, 1991. With the issued dated April 28, 1888, Collier's Once a Week was launched as a magazine of \\"fiction, fact, sensation, wit, humor, news\\". It was sold with the biweekly Collier's Library of novels and popular books at bargain rates and as a stand-alone priced at seven cents. By 1892, with a circulation climbing past the 250,000 mark, Collier's Once a Week was one of the largest selling magazines in the United States. The name was changed to Collier's Weekly: An Illustrated Journal in 1895 or the longer title Collier's Weekly: An Illustrated Journal of Art, Literature & Current Events. With an emphasis on news, the magazine became a leading exponent of the halftone news picture. To fully exploit the new technology, Collier recruited James H. Hare, one of the pioneers of photojournalism. Collier's only son, Robert J. Collier, became a full partner in 1898. By 1904, the magazine was known as Collier's: The National Weekly. Peter Collier died in 1909. When Robert Collier died in 1918, he left a will that turned the magazine over to three of his friends, Samuel Dunn, Harry Payne Whitney and Francis Patrick Garvan. Robert J. Collier won a lawsuit against Postum Cereal Company and was awarded $50,000 in damages, but in 1912 an appeals court then handed down a majority decision that Postum deserved a new trial. The Postum Company believed that Collier's weekly used magazine coverage to attack their company's products in retaliation for not advertising in Collier's after Collier's wrote against a Grape-Nuts's claim that it was an \\"A Food for Brain and Nerves.\\" Postum then bought advertising pages in major newspapers in retaliation. The magazine was sold in 1919 to the Crowell Publishing Company, which in 1939 was renamed as Crowell-Collier Publishing Company. In 1924, Crowell moved the printing operations from New York to Springfield, Ohio, but kept the editorial and business departments in New York. Reasons given for moving print operations included conditions imposed by unions in the printing trade, expansion of the Gansevoort Market into the property occupied by the Collier plant, and \\"excessive postage involved in mailing from a seaboard city under wartime postal rates. After 1924, printing of the magazine was done at the Crowell-Collier printing plant on West High Street in Springfield, Ohio. The factory complex, much of which is no longer standing (finally razed in 2020), was built between 1899 and 1946, and incorporated seven buildings that together had more than ‚Äî‚Äîof floor space. Fiction Collier's popularized the short-short story which was often planned to fit on a single page. Knox Burger was Collier's fiction editor from 1948 to 1951 when he left to edit books for Dell and Fawcett Publications; he was replaced by Eleanor Stierhem Rawson. The numerous authors who contributed fiction to Collier's included Ray Bradbury, Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd, Willa Cather, Roald Dahl, Jack Finney, Erle Stanley Gardner, Zane Grey, Ring Lardner, Sinclair Lewis, E. Phillips Oppenheim, J. D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, Albert Payson Terhune and Walter Tevis. Humor writers included Parke Cummings and H. Allen Smith.Collier's Issues in Detail Serializing novels during the late 1920s, Collier's sometimes simultaneously ran two ten-part novels, and non-fiction was also serialized. Between 1913 and 1949, Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu serials, illustrated by Joseph Clement Coll and others, were hugely popular. The first three Fu Manchu novels by Rohmer were actually compilations of 29 short stories that Rohmer wrote for Collier‚Äôs. The Mask of Fu Manchu, which was adapted into a 1932 film and a 1951 Wally Wood comic book, was first published as a 12-part Collier's serial, running from May 7 to July 23, 1932. The May 7 issue displayed a memorable cover illustration by famed maskmaker W≈Çadys≈Çaw T. Benda, and his mask design for that cover was repeated by many other illustrators in subsequent adaptations and reprints. A 1951 condensed version of the book Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham also appeared.Wyndham, John. The Day of the Triffids, Fawcett Crest #449-01322-075, sixth printing, April 1970. Illustrators Leading illustrators contributed to the covers of Collier's. They included C. C. Beall, W.T. Benda, Chesley Bonestell, Charles R. Chickering,Lerner, 2010, p.10.

They included Harold Mathews Brett, Richard V. Culter, Robert Fawcett, Denver Gillen and Quentin Reynolds. In 1903, Gibson signed a $100,000 contract, agreeing to deliver 100 pictures (at $1000 each) during the next four years. From 1904 to 1910, Parrish was under exclusive contract to Collier's, which published his famed Arabian Nights paintings in 1906-07. Investigative journalism The Great American Fraud\\" Collier's poster (1906) When Norman Hapgood became editor of Collier's in 1903, he attracted many leading writers. In May 1906, he commissioned Jack London to cover the San Francisco earthquake, a report accompanied by 16 pages of pictures. Under Hapgood's guidance, Collier's began publishing the work of investigative journalists such as Samuel Hopkins Adams, Ray Stannard Baker, C.P. Connolly and Ida Tarbell. Hapgood's approach had great impact, resulting in such changes as the reform of the child labor laws, slum clearance and women's suffrage. In April 1905, an article by Upton Sinclair, \\"Is Chicago Meat Clean?\\", persuaded the Senate to pass the 1906 Meat Inspection Act. Starting October 7, 1905, Adams startled readers with \\"The Great American Fraud\\", an 11-part Collier's series. Analyzing the contents of popular patent medicines, Adams pointed out that the companies producing these medicines were making false claims about their products and some were health hazards. Hapgood launched the series with the following editorial: \\"The Great American Fraud\\" had a powerful impact and led to the first Pure Food and Drug Act (1906). The entire series was reprinted by the American Medical Association in a book, The Great American Fraud, which sold 500,000 copies at 50 cents each. Hapgood had a huge influence on public opinion, and between 1909 and 1912, he succeeded in doubling the circulation of Collier's from a half million to a million. When he moved on to Harper's Weekly in 1912, he was replaced as editor for the next couple years by Robert J. Collier, the son of the founder. Arthur H. Vandenberg, later to become a prominent Senator, had a brief stint as a Collier's editor during the 1900s. H. C. Witwer was a war correspondent in France during World War I. Rob Wagner covered the film industry for Collier's during the 1920s. They reversed their position on prohibition in 1925. This was due to the difficulty in enforcing the referendum, and people's unwillingness to stay away from alcohol. The new law brought about bribing, thieving, corruption and other ills, which far exceeded their expectations. This new alignment gained favor with the public and helped to rebuild circulation. Writers such as Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway, who reported on the Spanish Civil War, helped boost the circulation. Winston Churchill, who wrote an account of the First World War, was a regular contributor during the 1930s, but his series of articles ended in 1939 when he became a minister in the British government. Carl Fick was a Collier's staff writer prior to World War II. Cartoonists The magazine's roster of top cartoonists included Charles Addams, Carl Anderson, Stan and Jan Berenstain, Sam Berman, Sam Cobean, Jack Cole, A. B. Frost, Ralph Fuller, Dave Gerard, Vernon Grant, Jay Irving, Crockett Johnson, E. W. Kemble, Hank Ketcham, George Lichty, David Low, Bill Mauldin, Virgil Partch, Mischa Richter, William Steig, Charles Henry \\"Bill\\" Sykes, Richard Taylor, Gluyas Williams, Gahan Wilson and Rowland B. Wilson. Irving's association with Collier's began in 1932, and his \\"Collier's Cops\\" became a mainstay of the magazine during his 13-year association with it. Kate Osann's Tizzy cartoons first appeared in Collier's. The redheaded Tizzy was a teenage American girl who wore horn-rimmed glasses with triangular lenses. Tizzy was syndicated by NEA after Collier's folded. The cartoons were in color in Collier's but black-and-white in syndication and paperback reprints. After World War II, Harry Devlin became the top editorial cartoonist at Collier's, one of the few publications then displaying editorial cartoons in full color. During the 1940s, Gurney Williams was the cartoon editor for Collier's, American Magazine and Woman's Home Companion, paying $40 to $150 for each cartoon. From a staggering stack of some 2000 submissions each week, Williams made a weekly selection of 30 to 50 cartoons, lamenting: Joseph Barbera, before he found fame in animation, had several cartoons published in Collier's in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Radio The uncredited ensemble presenting The Collier Hour in a feature story by John B. Kennedy, associate editor of Collier's (1930) The circulation battle with The Saturday Evening Post led to the creation of The Collier Hour, broadcast 1927‚Äì32 on the NBC Blue Network. It was radio's first major dramatic anthology series, adapting stories and serials from Collier's. The hour-long program initially aired on the Wednesday before weekly publication, but switched to Sundays to avoid spoilers with stories that appeared simultaneously in the magazine. In 1929 the program began to incorporate music, news, sports and comedy with the dramatic content of the show. Later years During World War II with William L. Chenery as editor (1941),Letter to Eric de Bisschop, October 10th, 1941 (Archives diplomatiques, Nantes) Collier's readership reached 2.5 million. In the October 14, 1944 issue, the magazine published one of the first articles about concentration camps. It was Jan Karski's \\"Polish Death Camp,\\" a harrowing account of his visit to Belzec. The now problematic title is explored in \\"Polish death camp controversy\\" (under heading \\"use and reactions\\"). Karski's book Story of a Secret State (which contained the Collier's excerpt), was published later that year by Houghton Mifflin. It became a Book of the Month Club selection, and bestseller with 400,000 copies sold in 1944-45. The Collier's selection was reprinted in Robert H. Abzug's America Views the Holocaust: 1933-1945 (Palgrave, 1999). Collier's had a circulation of 2,846,052 when Walter Davenport took over as editor in 1946, but the magazine began to lose readers during the post-World War II years. Collier's published a regular men's fashion feature contributed by Esquire co- founder Henry L. Jackson and also published long-awaited images from the 200-inch (5.08 m) Hale telescope's first light in 1949. In the early 1950s, Collier's ran a groundbreaking series of science-based articles speculating on space flight, Man Will Conquer Space Soon!, which prompted the general public to seriously consider the possibility of a trip to the moon, with the percentage of Americans who believed a manned lunar trip could happen within 50 years changing from 15% to 38% by 1955. In 1951, an entire issue described the events and outcome of a hypothetical war between the United States and the Soviet Union, entitled Preview of the War We Do Not Want. Collier's changed from a weekly to a biweekly in August 1953, but it continued to lose money. In 1954, John O'Hara became a columnist with his \\"Appointment with O'Hara\\" column. The magazine ceased publication with the issue for the week ending January 4, 1957.Crowell-Collier Publishing Company , Abandoned. Retrieved 2013-10-16. Princess Grace of Monaco was featured on the cover, pregnant with her first child Caroline. Books The company also published the Collier's Encyclopedia, Collier Books and the Collier's Year Book. Patricia Fulford edited Over 100 Best Cartoons from Collier's, Ladies Home Journal, Redbook, The American Magazine, Saturday Evening Post, The New Yorker, Argosy, Sport (Checkerbooks, 1949), and Collier's cartoon editor Gurney Williams edited Collier's Kids: Cartoons from Collier's About Your Children, Holt, 1952. Collier's fiction editor Knox Burger chose 19 stories for Collier's Best (Harper & Bros., 1951), and he also selected Best Stories from Collier's (William Kimber, 1952). A huge history and collection appeared with the publication of the 558-page A Cavalcade of Collier's, edited by Kenneth McArdle (Barnes, 1959). Cornelius Ryan's 1957 book One Minute to Ditch!, about the successful ocean ditching of a Pan American Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, was an expansion of his Collier's article in the December 21, 1956.

Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn, PC, KC (3 February 1733 ‚Äì 2 January 1805) was a Scottish lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1761 and 1780 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Loughborough. He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1793 to 1801. Life Wedderburn was the eldest son of Peter Wedderburn, Lord Chesterhall (a lord of session), and was born in East Lothian. He received his basic education at Dalkeith and at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and matriculated at the University of Edinburgh aged 14. Though he wanted to practise at the English bar, in deference to his father's wishes he qualified as an advocate at Edinburgh, in 1754. His father was called to the bench in 1755, and for the next three years Wedderburn stuck to his practice in Edinburgh, when he employed his oratorical powers in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and passed his evenings in social and argumentative clubs. In 1755 the precursor of the later Edinburgh Review was started, and Wedderburn edited two of its issues. The dean of faculty at this time, Alexander Lockhart (later Lord Covington), a lawyer notorious for his harsh demeanour, in the autumn of 1757 assailed Wedderburn with more than ordinary insolence. Wedderburn retorted with extraordinary powers of invective, and, on being rebuked by the bench, declined to retract or apologize. Instead, he left the court forever. Legal career Wedderburn was called to the English bar at the Inner Temple in 1757. To shake off his Scottish accent and to improve his oratory, he engaged the services of Thomas Sheridan and Charles Macklin. He studied the forms of English law in order to secure business and to conduct his cases with adequate knowledge. He solicited William Strahan, a printer, to get him employed in city causes, and he entered into social intercourse with busy London solicitors. His local connections and the incidents of his previous career brought him to the notice of his countrymen Lord Bute and Lord Mansfield. When Lord Bute was prime minister, Wedderburn used to go on errands for him, and it is to Wedderburn's credit that he first suggested to the premier the propriety of granting Samuel Johnson a pension. Through the favor of Lord Bute, he was returned to parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1761. In 1763 he became king's counsel and bencher of Lincoln's Inn, and for a short time went the northern circuits, but was more successful in obtaining business in the Court of Chancery. In 1767, he married Betty Anne Dawson, only child and heiress of John Dawson of Marly, Yorkshire who brought him considerable wealth in addition to his own. (Carlyle puts the amount at ¬£10,000) Political career Arms of Alexander Wedderburn (as Baron Loughborough). When George Grenville, whose principles leaned to Toryism, quarrelled with the court, Wedderburn affected to regard him as his leader in politics. At the dissolution in the spring of 1768 he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for Richmond as a Tory, but in the questions that arose over John Wilkes he took the popular side of Wilkes and liberty, and resigned his seat in May 1769. In the opinion of the people he was now regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health was toasted at the dinners of the Whigs amid rounds of applause, and, in recompense for the loss of his seat in parliament, he was returned by Lord Clive for his pocket-borough of Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire, in January 1770. During the next session he acted vigorously in opposition, but his conduct was always viewed with distrust by his new associates, and his attacks on the ministry of Lord North grew less and less animated in proportion to its apparent fixity of tenure. In January 1771 he was offered and accepted the post of solicitor-general. The high road to the woolsack was now open, but his defection from his former path has stamped his character with general infamy. Junius wrote of him, \\"As for Mr Wedderburn, there is something about him which even treachery cannot trust,\\" and Colonel Barr attacked him in the House of Commons. The new law officer defended his conduct with the assertion that his alliance in politics had been with George Grenville, and that the connection had been severed on his death. Lord Loughborough, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas All through the American War of Independence he consistently declaimed against the colonies, and he was bitter (and, some historians say, downright slanderous) in his attack on Benjamin Franklin before the Privy Council. In June 1778 Wedderburn was promoted to the post of attorney-general, and in the same year he refused the dignity of chief baron of the exchequer because the offer was not accompanied by the promise of a peerage. At the dissolution in 1774 he had been returned for Okehampton in Devon, and for Castle Rising in Norfolk, and selected the former constituency; on his promotion as leading law officer of the crown he returned to Bishops Castle. The coveted peerage was not long delayed. In June 1780 he was created Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, with the title of Baron Loughborough. During the existence of the coalition ministry of North and Fox, the great seal was in commission (April to December 1783), and Lord Loughborough held the leading place among the commissioners. For some time after that ministry's fall he was considered the leader of the Whig party in the House of Lords, and, had the illness of the King George III brought about the return of the Whigs to power, the great seal would have been placed in his hands. The king's restoration to health secured William Pitt The Younger's continuance in office, and disappointed the Whigs. In 1792, during the period of the French Revolution, Lord Loughborough seceded from Fox, and on 28 January 1793 he received the great seal in the Tory cabinet of Pitt. The resignation of Pitt on the question of Catholic emancipation (1801) put an end to Wedderburn's tenure of the Lord Chancellorship, for, much to his surprise, no place was found for him in Addington's cabinet. Pitt's friends believed he had been guilty of treachery over the Emancipation issue; and even the King, who used Loughborough as a spy in Cabinet, later commented that his death removed \\"the greatest knave in the Kingdom\\". His first wife died childless in 1781, and the following year he married Charlotte, youngest daughter of William, Viscount Courtenay; but her only son died in childhood. Lord Loughborough accordingly obtained in 1795 a re-grant of his barony with remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair Erskine. The end of his tenure as Lord Chancellor in 1801 was softened by the grant of an earldom (he was created Earl of Rosslyn on 21 April 1801, also with remainder to his nephew), and by a pension of ¬£4000 per annum. After this date he rarely appeared in public, but he was a constant figure at all the royal festivities. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1787 and accepted an honorary vice presidency at London's charitable Foundling Hospital in 1799. He attended a festive gathering, quite typical for this time in his life, at Frogmore, in December 1804. On the following day he was seized with an attack of gout in the stomach, and on 2 January 1805 he died at his seat, Baylis, near Salt Hill, Windsor. His remains were buried in St Paul's Cathedral on 11 January. Assessment At the bar Wedderburn was the most elegant speaker of his time, and, although his knowledge of the principles and precedents of law was deficient, his skill in marshalling facts and his clearness of diction were marvellous; on the bench his judgments were remarkable for their perspicuity, particularly in the appeal cases to the House of Lords. For cool and sustained declamation he stood unrivalled in parliament, and his readiness in debate was universally acknowledged. In social life, in the company of the wits and writers of his day, his faculties seemed to desert him. He was not only dull, but the cause of dullness in others, and even Alexander Carlyle confesses that in conversation his illustrious countryman was stiff and pompous. In Wedderburn's character ambition banished all rectitude of principle, but the love of money for money's sake was not among his faults.

He served as the ninth Governor of Virginia and as the Virginia Representative to the United States Congress. Lee's service during the American Revolution as a cavalry officer in the Continental Army earned him the nickname by which he is best known, \\"Light-Horse Harry\\".In the military parlance of the time, the term \\"Light-horse\\" had a hyphen between the two words \\"light\\" and \\"horse\\". See the title page of The Discipline of the Light-Horse. By Captain Hinde, of the Royal Regiment of Foresters, (Light- Dragoons.) published in London in 1778, a cavalry tactics classic which was used as a manual. He was the father of Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate armies in the American Civil War. Biography Lee was born on Leesylvania Plantation in Prince William County in the Colony of Virginia. He was the son of Col. Henry Lee II (1730‚Äì1787) of \\"Leesylvania\\" and Lucy Grymes (1734‚Äì1792). His father was the first cousin of Richard Henry Lee, twelfth President of the Continental Congress. His mother was an aunt of the wife of Virginia Governor Thomas Nelson, Jr. His great-grandmother Mary Bland was also a grand-aunt of President Thomas Jefferson. Lee was the grandson of Henry Lee I, a great-grandson of Richard Bland, and a great-great-grandson of William Randolph. He was also a descendant of Theodorick Bland of Westover and Governor Richard Bennett. =Military career= Colonel Shreve, Burlington, May 12, 1780 Lee graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1773, and began pursuing a legal career. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he instead became a captain in a Virginia dragoon detachment, which was attached to the 1st Continental Light Dragoons. In 1778, Lee was promoted to major and given the command of a mixed corps of cavalry and infantry known as Lee's Legion, with which he won a great reputation as a capable leader of light troops. At the time, highly mobile groups of light cavalry provided valuable service not only during major battles, but also by conducting reconnaissance and surveillance, engaging the enemy during troop movements, disrupting delivery of supplies, raiding and skirmishing, and organizing expeditions behind enemy lines;Haythornthwaite, Philip J, and Adam Hook. Napoleonic Light Cavalry Tactics. Botley, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2013. part of such tactics now are known as guerrilla warfare and maneuver warfare. In September of the same year, Lee commanded a unit of dragoons which defeated a Hessian regiment at the Battle of Edgar's Lane. It was during his time as commander of the Legion that Lee earned the sobriquet of \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" for his horsemanship. On September 22, 1779 the Continental Congress voted to present Lee with a gold medal‚Äîa reward given to no other officer below a general's rank‚Äîfor the Legion's actions during the Battle of Paulus Hook in New Jersey, on August 19 of that year.The medal (which is actually silver) finally presented to Lee is in Princeton University's Numismatic Collection. Also included are a signed letter of Lee's to the New Jersey quartermaster from 1780 and a signed letter of the same year from George Washington to Lee approving Lee's plan to capture Benedict Arnold.Discovery of medal that Congress granted to Lee Lee was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was assigned with his Legion to the southern theater of war. Lee's Legion raided the British outpost of Georgetown, South Carolina, with General Francis Marion in January 1781 and helped screen the American army in their Race to the Dan River the following month. Lee united with General Francis Marion and General Andrew Pickens in the spring of 1781 to capture numerous British outposts in South Carolina and Georgia including Fort Watson, Fort Motte, Fort Granby, Fort Galphin, Fort Grierson, and Fort Cornwallis, Augusta, Georgia.Boyd, Thomas. Light-horse Harry Lee. New York: C. Scribner's Sons, 1931. They conducted a campaign of terror and intimidation against Loyalists in the region, highlighted in Pyle's Massacre. Lee and his legion also served at the Battle of Guilford Court House, the Siege of Ninety-Six, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs. He was present at Charles Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown, but left the Army shortly after, claiming fatigue and disappointment with his treatment from fellow officers. In 1794, Lee was summoned by President George Washington to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. Lee commanded the 12,950 militiamen sent to quash the rebels; because of a peaceful surrender, there was no fighting. In 1798, in anticipation of a war with France, Henry Lee was appointed a major general in the U.S. Army. In 1808, he was recommissioned by President Thomas Jefferson as major-general when war with Great Britain was imminent; Lee organized the Virginia militia. He asked President James Madison for a commission at the onset of the War of 1812 but without success. In 1812 he published his Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States, where he summarized his military experiences during the Revolutionary War. =Political career= From 1786 to 1788, Lee was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation, and in 1788 at the Virginia convention; he favored the adoption of the United States Constitution. From 1789 to 1791, he served in the General Assembly and, from 1791 to 1794, was Governor of Virginia; a new county of Virginia was named after him during his governorship.Templin, Thomas E. Henry Light Horse Harry Lee: A Biography. Ph.D. dissertation. Lexington, Ky: University of Kentucky, 1975. From 1799 to 1801, he served in the United States House of Representatives of the Congress. He famously eulogized Washington to a crowd of 4,000 at the first President's funeral on December 26, 1799 as \\"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\\". =Family= Between April 8 and 13, 1782, at Stratford Hall, Lee married his second cousin, Matilda Ludwell Lee (1764‚Äì1790), who was known as \\"the Divine Matilda\\". She was the daughter of Philip Ludwell Lee, Sr., and Elizabeth Steptoe.

The Panic of 1796‚Äì1797 and bankruptcy of Robert Morris reduced Lee's fortune. In 1809, he became bankrupt and served one year in debtors' prison in Montross, Virginia; his son, Robert Lee was two years old at the time. After release, Lee moved his family to Alexandria, Virginia, During the civil unrest in Baltimore, Maryland in 1812, Lee received grave injuries while helping to resist an attack on his friend, Alexander Contee Hanson, editor of the Baltimore newspaper, The Federal Republican on July 27, 1812. Hanson was attacked by a Democratic- Republican mob because his paper opposed the War of 1812. Lee and Hanson and two dozen other Federalists had taken refuge in the offices of the paper. The group surrendered to Baltimore city officials the next day and were jailed. Laborer George Woolslager led a mob that forced its way into the jail and removed the Federalists, beating and torturing them over the next three hours.

Lee suffered extensive internal injuries as well as head and face wounds, and even his speech was affected. His observed symptoms were consistent with what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. After unsuccessful convalescence at home, he sailed to the West Indies in an effort to recuperate from his injuries.

Their style became known as jit, and is quite popular across Africa, with some international success, and has influenced later groups like Nehoreka and Mokoomba. British world music DJ Andy Kershaw said that at the height of their magical powers they were \\"...the single most natural, effortless, catchy pop band I've ever heard\\"; the BBC's John Peel famously broke down in tears the first time, when he saw the band perform live. The name came from bhundu (meaning \\"Bush\\" or \\"jungle\\"), in reference to the young boys who used to aid the nationalist guerrilla fighters in the 1970s war against the white minority government of what was then Rhodesia. Lead singer Biggie Tembo (Biggie Rodwell Tembo Marasha) was a Bhundu boy. History =Beginnings= The Bhundu Boys recorded their first 7\\" vinyl single at Shed Studios in Harare on 1 February 1983, as part of the Studio's drive to sponsor more local music. They were one of a number of more adventurous bands that had not been contracted by the two record labels. Shed Studios was a collaboration between Steve Roskilly, Martin Norris and Bothwell Nyamhondera. The Bhundu Boys reached the top of the Zimbabwean music scene on Shed Studio's Rugare Label, with four number one hits (\\"Baba munini Francis\\", \\"Wenhamo Haaneti\\", \\"Hatisitose\\", and \\"Tsvimbodzemoto\\") between 1981 and 1984. =Success in the UK= They attracted the attention of Owen Elias and his colleague, musician Champion Doug Veitch, who released an EP by the band in the UK under licence from Shed Studios in 1985. This attracted the attention of DJ's John Peel and Andy Kershaw who promoted the band. Under further licence from Shed Studios, their first UK album, Shabhini, was released on the Discafrique label in 1986. The band travelled to UK in 1986 for a live tour organised by Elias, and Scottish graphic artist Gordon Muir became their manager. After touring the UK for a year, basing themselves initially in Hawick, Scotland with Muir and travelling relentlessly, the band appeared to be on the brink of a major commercial breakthrough. They were feted by Eric Clapton and Elvis Costello and Madonna asked them to be her support act at Wembley Stadium in 1987. In 1987, just as their second UK album Tsvimbodzemoto was released by Elias, on the Discafrique label, The Bhundu Boys chose not to renew their contract with Shed Studios and Muir signed them to Warner Bros. Records Controversially, much of their ¬£80,000 advance from WEA was spent buying a house in Kensal Rise, West London that is still a source of dispute. The band played in North America, Australia and Hong Kong. But first WEA album True Jit, produced by Robin Millar was considered too far a jump in style from their original Shed Studios' recordings, (produced by Steve Roskilly) and was unfavourably received. =Downfall and breakup= The band began a long period of further live appearances, releasing other independent CDs, but started to fall apart. They were dropped from WEA after the commercial failure of their second album on the label. Leader Biggie Tembo achieved some celebrity on TV and in the press, which irritated the rest of the band, especially guitarist Rise Kagona, and Tembo was asked to leave the band in 1990 following an altercation at Harare airport. The band continued but without the writing and vocal talents of Tembo, the band never again produced the same reception by the music press or by the public. Three members died of complications from AIDS: David Mankaba (d.1991), his replacement Shepherd Munyama (d. 1992) and Shakespear Kangwena (d.1993). Tembo tried a comeback by collaborating with a Bristol band, Startled Insects, without success. Returning to Zimbabwe in the early 1990s, he tried to self-produce some more music at Shed Studios including two albums (Baba of Jit and Out of Africa), neither of which were properly released or published. Tembo became ill with depression, became a practising Christian, eventually hanging himself in a psychiatric hospital in 1995, where he had been sectioned for violent outbursts. Meanwhile, the band soldiered on, recording two more albums. Muir left their management in difficult circumstances as the band's income dried up. In 1996 he sold the band's house in Mortimer Road, Kensal Rise, as part of winding up the band's assets, with surviving band members reporting they received almost nothing from the deal; they suspect that Muir had actually used the band's money to buy it in the first place, using their Warner advance without permission. Muir has countered that there were no profits to divide up. The band finally called it quits in 2000 after bassist Washington Kavhai was jailed in the UK on an aggravated assault conviction. In 2001, Shed Studios issued a compilation album of all the Bhundu Boys recordings made in Zimbabwe, entitled The Shed Sessions, for release in UK on a double CD, under licence to Gordon Muir. =Current whereabouts= Guitarist Rise Kagona is divorced and currently lives in Scotland. He has written a short account of the band's history. He plays in Rise Kagona and the Jit Jive Band, who frequently perform in northern England and Scotland. He co-wrote and sang on \\"She Told You So\\" on Ben Avison's 2013 Good Day Mr. Magpie album. He has also played with Gordon Veitch in recent years, recording an album, Tanzwa Nekutambura in 2007. Kuda Matimba lives in London and plays with Harare, a group he started in 2005 together with Kenny Chitsvatsva, who has lost contact with Rise Kagona. Moyo Tembo formed a group called The Chinhoyi Superstars, who released their debut single \\"Woiteyiko\\". Biggie Tembo Jr., the son of Biggie Tembo, has followed in his father's footsteps and released his debut album, Rwendo, in 2010. He was convicted of assault against a woman in 2015.

The central lam is surrounded by a yellow square. Muladhara Chakra (‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞) Muladhara (, IAST: , lit. \\"root and basis of Existence.\\" Mula means root and adhara means basis.) or the root chakra is one of the seven primary chakras according to Hindu tantrism. It is symbolized by a lotus with four petals and the colour pink or red Description Muladhara is located near the coccygeal plexus beneath the sacrumit,Judith (1996: p.52) while its kshetram, or superficial activation point, is located between the perineum and the coccyx or the pelvic bone. Because of its location and connection with the act of excretion, it is associated with the anus. Muladhara is said to be the base from which the three main psychic channels or nadis emerge: the Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.Swami Sivananda, Kundalini Yoga It is also believed that Muladhara is a subtle abode of the Hindu God Ganapati. In the highest revered prayer for Ganapati, the Ganapati Atharvashirsha, it is mentioned that \\"one who worships Lord Ganapati would easily grasp the concept and realise Brahman\\". =Appearance= It is symbolized by a red, four-petaled lotus with a yellow square at its center. Each petal has one of the Sanskrit syllables ‡§µ‡§Ç va·πÉ, ‡§∂‡§Ç ≈õa·πÉ, ‡§∑‡§Ç ·π£a·πÉ, and ‡§∏‡§Ç sa·πÉ written on it in gold, representing the four vrittis: greatest joy, natural pleasure, delight in controlling passion, and blissfulness in concentration. Alternatively, they may represent dharma (psycho-spiritual longing), artha (psychic longing), kama (physical longing) and moksha (longing for spiritual liberation). Eight spears point out of the sides and corners of the square. The deity Indra is associated with Muladhara. In these depictions, he is yellow, four-armed, and holds a vajra and a blue lotus in his hands. He is mounted upon the white elephant Airavata, who has seven trunks denoting the seven elements necessary for supporting life. Occasionally, Ganesha is also associated with Muladhara. In these depictions, he has orange skin, wears a yellow dhoti, and a green silk scarf draped around his shoulders. In three hands he holds a laddu, a lotus flower, and a hatchet, and the fourth is raised in the mudra of dispelling fear. =Seed mantra= The seed mantra syllable is ‡§≤‡§Ç la·πÉ. Within the bindu, the point that forms a part of the letter, is Brahma. He is deep red, with four faces and four arms, holding a staff, a sacred vase of nectar, and a japa mala, and making the gesture of dispelling fear. Alternatively, instead of the staff and japa mala, he may hold a lotus flower and the sacred scriptures. He is seated on a swan. The goddess Dakini, his shakti, is depicted with him. She is beautiful, with three eyes and four arms. Dakini is usually depicted with red or white skin, holding a trident, a skulled staff, a swan, and a drinking vessel, and is seated on a swan. At times, instead of a swan and drinking vessel, she holds a sword and a shield. =Seat of kundalini= In the center of the square, below the seed syllable, is a deep red inverted triangle. The kundalini shakti is said to sleep here, waiting to be aroused and brought back up to Brahman, the source from which it originated. It is represented by a snake wrapped three and a half times around a smoky grey lingam. Function Muladhara is considered the foundation of the \\"energy body\\". Yogic systems stress the importance of stabilizing this chakra. Kundalini awakening begins here. It is also known as the seat of the \\"red bindu,\\" or subtle drop, which rises up to the \\"white bindu\\" in the head to unite the feminine and masculine energies, the Shakti and Shiva. It is associated with the element of earth, the sense of smell and the action of excretion. \\"By meditating thus on Her who shines within the Muladhara Chakra, with the luster of ten million Suns, a man becomes Lord of speech and King among men, and an Adept in all kinds of learning. He becomes ever free from all diseases, and his inmost Spirit becomes full of great gladness. Pure of disposition by his deep and musical words, he serves the foremost of the Devas.\\" Practices In kundalini yoga there are various yogic practices held to incite the energy in Muladhara: asanas (such as Garudasana, Shashankasana and Siddhasana); nosetip gazing, or Nasikagra Drishti; specific pranayamas; and most importantly the practice of Mula Bandha, involving the contraction of the perineum, which awakens kundalini, and is important for the retention of semen. This chakra can also be activated by chanting the Seed-Mantra. It is said that one who chants the Seed Mantra of Muladhara Chakra for more than 100,000,000 times can attain all the Siddhis of the Muladhara Chakra. There are also special meditation practices for awakening the M≈´lƒÅdhƒÅra Chakra . =Siddhis= # He or she experiences Darduri Siddhi (Frog jump in air at various degrees). # He or she gains knowledge of the Present, Past and Future. # He or she has control over the Elements of the Earth. Comparisons with other systems When compared to the other important Tantric system of Vajrayana in Tibet the Muladhara chakra finds no parallel in the same place, unlike the other six chakras. Instead, the Tibetan system positions two chakras on the sexual organ: the jewel wheel in the middle, near the tip, and the tip of the sexual organ itself. These chakras are extremely important for the generation of great bliss, and play an important role in the highest tantric sexual practices. A unique feature, the red drop, called the red bodhicitta, is not located here, but instead at the navel wheel.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Tantric Grounds and Paths In the Sufi system of Lataif there are two \\"lower\\" Lataif. One is the nafs, which is just below the navel. The nafs incorporates all the elements of a person's \\"lower self\\". The other similar lataif is called the qalab, or mould, which appears in seven lataif systems and corresponds to the physical body, but this is sometimes located at the top of the head.Arthur F. Buehler. Sufi heirs to the Prophet Qalab is usually further divided into the four elements. In the Kabbalah the lowest Sephiroth is known as Malkuth, and performs the same transcendental role as the basis of physical nature. It is associated with the sexual organ, in close contact with Yesod.Leonara Leet. The Universal Kabbalah In astrology Mars is often correlated as being son of Earth, and having to do with the earthly nature of the Muladhara, and it is often referred to as being the ruling planet of the Muladhara by many modern astrologers. In Earth-based spiritualities the Eight Directions are often used to represent the Wheel of the Year. The Eight Directions represent the four seasons (North ‚Äì Winter, South ‚Äì Summer, East ‚Äì Spring, and West ‚Äì Autumn) and the Winter and Summer Solstices, as well as the Spring and Fall Equinoxes. The midpoints between those four times of year are the four lesser directions. This Eight Direction model maps perfectly onto the eight arrows of the root chakra. The four petals of the chakra also map onto the four elements of Earth (North), Air (East), Fire (South) and Water (West). This chakra, being so closely related to the element of Earth, also reflects the earth elements.

Background Adams was born in Dunkirk, New York. Adam was a muckraker, known for exposing public-health injustices. He was the son of Myron Adams, Jr., a minister, and Hester Rose Hopkins. Adams attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York from 1887-1891, he also attended a semester at Union College. In 1907 Adams divorced his wife, Elizabeth Ruffner Noyes, after having two daughters. Eight years later Adams married an actress, Jane Peyton. Adams was a close friend of both the investigative reporter Ray Stannard Baker and District Attorney Benjamin Darrow.Kennedy, Samuel V. \\"Adams, Samuel Hopkins\\" (Kennedy); American National Biography Online Feb. 2000.  Career  December 1905 advertisement for Collier's magazine's expos√© of the patent medicine fraud, culminating in Samuel Hopkins Adams' 11-part series, \\"The Great American Fraud\\" From 1891 to 1900, he was a reporter for the New York Sun where his career began, and then joined McClure's Magazine, where he gained a reputation as a muckraker for his articles on the conditions of public health in the United States. In 1904 Adams became an editorial staffer with McClure's Magazine working with Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, and Ray Stannard Baker. Adams considered himself a freelance writer and used his writings to support himself. In 1905 Adams was hired by Collier's to prepare articles on patent medicines. In a series of 11 articles he wrote for the magazine in 1905, \\"The Great American Fraud\\", Adams exposed many of the false claims made about patent medicines, pointing out that in some cases these medicines were damaging the health of the people using them. The series had a huge impact and led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. In 1911, the Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition of falsifications referred only to the ingredients of the medicine. This meant that companies were again free to make false claims about their products. Adams returned to the attack, and in another series of articles in Collier's Weekly, Adams exposed the misleading advertising that companies were using to sell their products. Linking his knowledge of newspapers with patent medicines, he wrote The Clarion (1914), which was critical of newspaper advertising practices and led to a series of consumer-protection articles in the New York Tribune. His service during World War I for the Committee on Public Information led to Common Cause (1919), a novel on a newspaper's battle against pro-Germans in Wisconsin. Literary works Adams was a prolific writer, who wrote fiction as well. \\"Night Bus\\" (1933), one of Adams's many magazine stories, became the basis for the 1934 film It Happened One Night. Adams's first solo novel was in 1908, Flying Death, which added to his mystery collection. His best-known novel, Revelry (1926), based on the scandals of the Harding administration, was later followed by Incredible Era (1939), a biography of Harding. Among his other works are The Great American Fraud in Collier's (1905‚Äì06), The Mystery (1907), with S. E. White, Average Jones (1911), The Secret of Lonesome Cove (1912), The Health Master (1913), The Clarion (1914), The Unspeakable Perk (1916), Our Square and the People in It (1917), Success (1921), Siege (1924), The Gorgeous Hussy (1934), Maiden Effort (1937), The Harvey Girls (1942; adapted into the 1946 movie musical starring Judy Garland), Canal Town (1944), Plunder (1948), Grandfather Stories (1955), and Tenderloin (1959). The Clarion and Success are studies of modern journalism. Average Jones is a series of stories about a detective investigating fraudulent or unusual advertisements. In addition to his many books, Adams also wrote 415 short stories and articles. Tenderloin described the battle between Charles H. Parkhurst and Tammany Hall. The New York Times reviewer H. I. Brock called the book an \\"outstanding period piece\\" and \\"a finale to a long and varied writing career.\\" Tenderloin was adapted into a 1960 musical with book by George Abbott and Jerome Weidman and songs by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, the team that had created Fiorello! Tenderloin ran for 216 performances. New critic Howard Taubman praised the songs, but complained about a \\"dragging book\\" and said \\"The wages of virtue, alas, are largely dullness.\\" Adams also published a biography of Alexander Woollcott (1945) and three books for the Landmark Series, The Pony Express (1950), The Santa Fe Trail (1952), and The Erie Canal (1953). The printing of his 1947 novel Banner by the Wayside was the subject of an Encyclop√¶dia Britannica documentary on the manufacture of hardback books (see external links). Adams last book, Tenderloin (1959), was published after his death and was later adapted into a Broadway musical. Risqu√© novels In the 1920s and 1930s, Adams, under the pseudonym of Warner Fabian, wrote several novels that at the time were considered highly risqu√©. These titillating works, which mainly featured young women flappers and their trials and tribulations of early adulthood, often became best-sellers avidly read by Jazz Age youth. Flaming Youth, Adams' first novel of this sort, dealt with the sexual urges of young women and had a sexual frankness that was shocking for its time. Because of the nature of the novels, Adams utilized the Fabian pseudonym so that his more standard works would not be tainted by any scandal accruing to these novels. Most of these novels were later brought to the screen, including Flaming Youth starring Colleen Moore; Sailors' Wives, with Mary Astor in the lead; and The Wild Party featuring Clara Bow. Novels published under the pseudonym \\"Warner Fabian\\" include: * Flaming Youth (New York: The Macaulay Company, 1924) * Sailors' Wives (New York: Boni & Liveright, 1924) * Summer Bachelors (New York: Boni & Liveright, 1926; The Macaulay Company, 1927) * Unforbidden Fruit (New York: Boni & Liveright, 1928; Cleveland & New York: International Fiction Library, 1928) * The Men in Her Life (New York: Sears Publishing Co., 1930; Grosset & Dunlap, 1930) * Week-End Girl (New York: The Macaulay Company, 1932) * Widow's Oats (New York: The Macaulay Company, 1935) Later life Adams had a winter residence in Beaufort, South Carolina. He died in Beaufort on November 16, 1958 at the age of 87. Adams's papers are archived in academic libraries, including Syracuse University, Hamilton College, and Harvard University. A significant portion of his collections are located at the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.

The seed sound in the centre is vam. The tattwa for the element of Water is shown as a silver crescent. 'Svadhisthana (, IAST: , \\"Swa means self and \\"adhishthana means established.) or the sacral chakra, is the second primary chakra according to Hindu Tantrism. This chakra is said to be blocked by fear, especially the fear of death. Opening this chakra can boost creativity,manifested desire and confidence. Representation Svadhisthana is illustrated as a white lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). It has six vermilion-colored petals inscribed with syllables: ‡§¨‡§Ç ba·πÉ, ‡§≠‡§Ç bha·πÉ, ‡§Æ‡§Ç ma·πÉ, ‡§Ø‡§Ç ya·πÉ, ‡§∞‡§Ç ra·πÉ and ‡§≤‡§Ç la·πÉ. Inside this lotus is a white crescent moon which represents the water region presided over by the deity Varuna. The seed mantra, located in the innermost circle, is a moon-white ‡§µ‡§Ç va·πÉ. Above the mantra that is within the bindu, or dot, is the deity Vishnu. He is dark blue and wears a yellow dhoti. He holds a conch, a mace, a wheel and a lotus. He wears the shrivatsa mark, and the kaustubha gem. He is seated either on a pink lotus, or on the divine eagle Garuda. His strength is the goddess Rakini. She is black, dressed in red or white and seated on a red lotus. She is commonly depicted with one face and two arms, holding a sword and a shield, or two faced and four armed, and holds a trident, lotus, drum and vajra, or an arrow, skull, drum and axe. Some schools teach that the divinities of the SvƒÅdhishthƒÅna Chakra are BrahmƒÅ and Sarasvatƒ´. BrahmƒÅ is the creator of the Universe and Saraswati personifies knowledge. Characteristics The six petals represent the following modes of consciousness, also known as vrittis: affection, pitilessness, feeling of all- destructiveness, delusion, disdain, and suspicion. Svadishtana is often associated with pleasure, sense of oneself, relationships, sensuality and procreation. Its element is water and its colour is orange. It is blocked by Guilt. Svadhishthana is associated with the unconscious and with emotion. It is closely related to the Muladhara in that Muladhara is where the different samskaras (potential Karmas) lie dormant, and Svadhishthana is where these Samskaras find expression. Svadhishthana contains unconscious desires, especially sexual desire. It is saidSwami Satyananda Saraswati. Kundalini Tantra that to raise the kundalini shakti (energy of consciousness) above Svadhishthana is difficult. Many Hindu saints have had to face sexual temptations associated with this chakra. One who meditates on Svadhishthana is believed to obtain the following siddhis: freedom from enemies, the status of a lord among yogis, eloquence and clarity (\\"words flowing like nectar in well- reasoned discourse\\"), loss of fear of water, awareness of astral entities and the ability to taste anything desired for oneself or others. Association with the body samskara, the moon of bindu chakra, the sky from anahata and the stars. Svadhisthana is located two finger-widths above the Muladhara chakra (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞, IAST: M≈´lƒÅdhƒÅra, English: \\"root support\\") or root chakra which is located in the coccyx (tailbone). Its corresponding kshetram, or, ‚Äúplace,‚Äù in front of the body is barely below the belly button. It is connected with the sense of taste, (the tongue) and with reproduction (the genitals). It is often associated with the testes and ovaries. They produce the hormones testosterone or estrogen, which influence sexual behaviors. They are stored in areas where genetic information lies dormant, in the same way that samskaras lie dormant within Svadhisthana. Practices Practices in kundalini yoga to control and balance the energy in Svadhisthana chakra include vajroli mudra (contraction of the genitals), ashvini mudra (contraction of the anus), and various asanas and pranayamas. Comparisons The equivalent chakra in the Vajrayana tantra systems of Tibet is called the \\"Secret Place\\" four fingers below the navel. It is red in colour, with 32 downward pointing spokes. Meditation on this point produces great bliss. According to certain interpretations of Sufism, the spiritual body of a man is defined as an interconnected system (Lataif-e-sitta), in which there is an energy center called the nafs. According to Lataif-e-sitta, the nafs is just below the navel. The nafs incorporates all the elements of man's \\"lower self\\", which is tamed in order to attain closeness to Allah. Western occultists make the kabbalistic association of Svadhisthana with the Sephirah Yesod. Yesod is also associated with the sexual organs. Its function in the tree of life is to gather the different energies that have been created in the descent of the tree downwards and distribute them to Malkuth, the material world, where the energy can find physical expression.

The spinel is one of the oldest parts of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, with a history dating back to the middle of the 14th century. It has been in the possession of England's rulers since it was given in 1367 to its namesake, Edward of Woodstock (the \\"Black Prince\\"). Spinel All red gemstones used to be referred to as rubies or \\"balas rubies\\". It wasn't until 1783 that spinels were chemically differentiated from rubies. A red spinel is a compound of magnesium, iron, oxygen, and chromium, while a ruby is the mineral corundum. The rarity of this spinel, however, is that it is the biggest uncut spinel in the world, given that it has only been polished slightly, and has never received a proper cut, gemologically speaking. History =Don Pedro of Seville= The Black Prince's Ruby dates back to the middle of the 14th century as the possession of Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d, the Arab Muslim Prince of Granada. At that time, the rule of Castile was being centralized to Seville and the Moorish Kingdom of Granada was being systematically attacked and reverted to Castilian rule as a part of the Christian Reconquest of the Iberian peninsula. Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d in particular was confronted by the belligerency of nascent Castile under the rule of Peter of Castile, also known to history as Don Pedro the Cruel. According to historical accounts, Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d wished to surrender to Don Pedro, but the conditions he offered were unclear. What is clear is that Don Pedro welcomed his coming to Seville. It is recorded that he greatly desired Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d's wealth. When Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d met with Don Pedro, the King had Ab≈´ Sa'ƒ´d's servants killed and may have personally stabbed Sa'ƒ´d to death himself. When Sa'ƒ´d's corpse was searched, the spinel was found and added to Don Pedro's possessions. In 1366, Don Pedro's illegitimate brother, Henry of Trast√°mara, led a revolt against Don Pedro. Lacking the power to put down the revolt unaided, Don Pedro made an alliance with the Black Prince, the son of Edward III of England. The revolt was successfully put down and the Black Prince demanded the ruby in exchange for the services he had rendered. While historians speculate that this was contrary to Don Pedro's desires, he had just suffered a costly civil war and was in no position to decline. It can be assumed that the Black Prince took the Ruby back to England, although it is absent from historical records until 1415. =A wartime adornment= During his campaign in France, Henry V of England wore a gem-encrusted helmet that included the Black Prince's Ruby. In the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, the French Duke of Alen√ßon struck Henry on the head with a battleaxe, and Henry nearly lost both the helmet and his life. The battle was won by Henry's forces and the Black Prince's Ruby was saved. Richard III is supposed to have worn the gemstone in his helmet at the Battle of Bosworth, where he died. Detail of Queen Victoria's Coronation Portrait, showing the Black Prince's Ruby on the crown =Crown Jewels= Henry VIII's inventory of 1521 mentions \\"a great balas ruby\\" set in the Tudor Crown, thought to be the Black Prince's Ruby. It remained there until the time of Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century. With the exception of the Coronation Chair and several other items, Cromwell had the principal symbols of the king's power ‚Äì the Crown Jewels ‚Äì disassembled and sold, and the gold was melted down and made into coins. What happened to the Black Prince's Ruby, then valued at ¬£4(calling the valuation \\"absurdly low\\"). (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), during the Commonwealth of England is not clear, but it came back into the possession of Charles II when the monarchy was restored in 1660. At the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, she was crowned with a new Imperial State Crown made for her by Rundell and Bridge, with 3,093 gems, including the spinel at the front. The Queen can be clearly seen wearing the jewel in the Imperial State Crown in her official coronation portrait by Sir George Hayter. This was remade in 1937 into the current, lighter, crown.

The seed sound in the centre is ram. The tattwa for the element of Fire is shown (here in outline) as a red triangle. 'Manipura (, IAST: ') is the third primary chakra according to Vedic tradition. Description =Location= Located above the navelT. Krishnamacharya, Yoga Makaranda, p.10 and in the solar plexus, Manipura translates from Sanskrit as \\"city of jewels\\" alternatively translated as \\"resplendent gem\\" or \\"lustrous gem\\". Manipura is often associated with the colors yellow, blue in classical tantra, and red in the Nath tradition. Manipura is associated with fire and the power of transformation. It is said to govern digestion and metabolism as the home of Agni and the vital wind Samana Vayu. The energies of Prana Vayu and Apana Vayu (inward and outward flowing energy) meet at the point in a balanced system. Manipura is the home of the coeliac plexus, which innervates most of the digestive system. In chakra-based medicine, practitioners work this area to promote healthier digestion, elimination, pancreas-kidney and Adrenal function. Weak Agni (fire) in the coeliac plexus leads to incompletely digested food, thoughts and emotions, and is a source of ama (toxicity). =Appearance= Manipura is represented with a downward-pointing red triangle, signifying the tattva of fire, within a bright yellow circle, with 10 dark-blue or black petals like heavily laden rain clouds. The fire region is represented by the god Vahnihttps://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vahni, who is shining red, has four arms, holds a rosary and a spear. Vahni is making the gestures of granting boons, or favors, and dispelling fear. He is seated on a ram, the animal that represents Manipura. Agni is later referenced as well as Hinduism altered over time. =Seed mantra= Another representation of manipura. The animal associated to this chakra is the ram. The seed mantra is the syllable 'ram'. Within the bindu, or dot, above this mantra resides the deity Rudra. He is red or white, with three eyes, of ancient aspect with a silver beard, and is smeared with white ashes. Rudra makes the gestures of granting boons and dispelling fear and is seated either on a tiger skin or a bull. Rudra's Shakti is the goddess Lakini. She has a black or dark-blue vermilion color; has three faces, each with three eyes; and is four-armed. Lakini holds a thunderbolt, the arrow shot from the bow of Kama, and fire. She makes the gestures of granting boons and dispelling fear. Lakini is seated on a red lotus. =Petals= The ten petals of Manipura are dark-blue or black, like heavily laden rain clouds, with the syllables ·∏ça·πÅ, ·∏çha·πÅ, ·πáa·πÅ, ta·πÅ, tha·πÅ, da·πÅ, dha·πÅ, na·πÅ, pa·πÅ, and pha·πÅ upon them in a dark-blue color. These petals correspond to the vrittis of spiritual ignorance, thirst, jealousy, treachery, shame, fear, disgust, delusion, foolishness and sadness. The petals represent the ten PrƒÅnas (currents and energy vibrations) that are regulated by the Manip≈´ra Chakra. The five PrƒÅna Vayus are: PrƒÅna, ApƒÅna, UdƒÅna, SamƒÅna And VyƒÅna. The five Upa PrƒÅnas are: NƒÅga, K≈´rma, Devadatta, Krikala and Dhananjaya. Function Manipura is considered the center of dynamism, energy, will power (Iccha (pronounced ik-chh-a) shakti), and achievement, which radiates prana throughout the entire human body. It is associated with the power of fire and digestion, as well as with the sense of sight and the action of movement. Through meditating on Manipura, one is said to attain the power to save, change or destroy the world. Association with the body The position of Manipura is stated as being either behind the navel or the solar plexus. Sometimes, when it is located at the navel, a secondary chakra called Surya (sun) chakra is located at the solar plexus, whose role is to absorb and assimilate Prana from the sun. Being related to the sense of sight, it is associated with the eyes, and being associated with movement, it is associated with the feet. In the endocrine system, Manipura is said to be associated with the pancreas and the outer adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex). These glands create important hormones involved in digestion, converting food into energy for the body, in the same way that Manipura radiates Prana throughout the body. Practices In kundalini and classical hatha yoga, different practices for arousing and balancing the energies of Manipura include various asanas. These include pranayama uddiyana bandha (exhaling and pulling back and up the abdomen and diaphragm, respectively); agnisara kriya (practicing jalandhara bandha, and moving the abdomen in and out); nauli (stomach churning). Other pranayama and mudra encourage the union of prana and apana, where the lower and higher winds are made to unite. Comparisons with other systems =Vajrayana= In Vajrayana traditions, the chakra is triangular, red and has 64 petals or channels that extend upwards. This chakra is important as the seat of the 'red drop'. The short syllable 'Ah' is located inside the 'red drop'. Meditation on 'Ah' is the key component of the practice of tummo, or inner heat. In tummo, a practitioner's 'subtle winds' are made to enter the central channel, and rise up to its top. This is sometimes compared to 'Raising the kundalini' in Hindu terminology, melting the subtle white drop in the crown, and causing an experience of great bliss. 'Raising the kundalini' is considered the first and most important of the six yogas of Naropa.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Kundalini Grounds and Paths =Qigong= In Chinese qigong, there is a degree of correspondence with the term \\"Kua\\" or door. this series of doors connect with three Dantians that act as furnaces to convert different energies in the body. The lower Dantian exists in the stomach region. Its function is to convert sexual jing energy into Qi energy (a concept similar to Hindu prana). This is not the location of the lower Dantian. =Lataif-e- sitta= Within the Sufi Lataif-e-sitta, the torso contains several Lataif. Unlike the chakras, the Lataif are not distributed vertically, instead to the left and the right. The nafs, or lower self, is a centre that is situated below the navel. =Kabbala= Western occultists make different kabbalistic associations with Manipura. For some occultists, it relates to the sephirot of Hod and Netzach. Netzach is the quality of energy to overcome different obstacles. Hod is the tendency to control and break down energy into different forms, the two forms being contending and balancing forces. This is like the forces of anabolism and catabolism in the human body. Hod and Netzach are associated with the left and right legs and feet of the body.Leonara Leet. The universal kabbalah =Yogic= The Manipuraka chakra is said by the 10th century Kubjikamatatantra 11.35 to be at the navel. The Samgitaratnakara 2.125-127 agrees it is at the navel, stating that it has 10 petals, containing deep sleep, desire, envy, slander, shame, fear, compassion, stupor, impurity, and anxiety. The breath (prana) that dwells there is named the sun. It is said in the Hatha Ratnavali 1.63 to be purified by Nauli, one of the Satkarmas. =Neo-pagan= Neo-pagan related to Hindu Yogic guided visualization, is the breathing into the solar plexus, holding our breath and focusing our intent, this is to hold our energy and infuse it with our intent, imagining the build up of moving substance through our nose, into a channel down into the solar plexus, then exhaling is moving the energy out into the world. Balancing the solar plexus may contain self-love, appreciation and/or acceptance. Use occasionally in and between cycles of meditation. \\"Intent is the most powerful force in the universe.\\". \\"... affirmations are simply a statement of intent\\". The positive affirmations re-empower your solar plexus. Statements with \\"I am, I can, I will\\", such as \\"I am enough\\", and \\"I love myself unconditionally\\". Visualize the yellow solar plexus charging with energy and spinning around with the result of affirmations, and spinning with full power. Its charge is our power, the substance we are also of, using the energy in existence we are creating change in the world. Throwing off negative energies that life collects. =Pagan= \\"Our focus, manifestation, ambition, and our critical aspect/ defensiveness come from the Solar Plexus.\\". When we are out of balance here we may have control issues, hypersensitivity, action imbalances, and issues with our health in the form of anxiety, blockages in digestive system, fear and welling up of negative responses that prevent us from moving beyond built up negative space, rather than to keep us safe its to prevent ourselves from healing in our desire, thought and fear. Solar plexus is where the incoming energies from people are received. Attitudes breathing is the flow of decharging emotions in tense situations. \\"The tool combines the power of the heart and gut to enable you to shift emotion and physiology right in the middle of a strong reaction\\". Attitude if its giving us difficulty try choosing the opposite from what you‚Äôve been feeling; \\"love and appreciation if you‚Äôve been feeling animosity and resentment\\". \\"Use your notebook to write down unproductive attitudes you know you have and more positive attitudes you wish you had.\\". Guide yourself with alternative attitudes that you think could help with for example a nemesis in our life that redirect the flow out of our objectivity, let that alternative be with your breath, breath love, breath appreciation, breath compassion or breath excitement (i.e. the most suitable) and feeling (within a few minutes) we will be moving back into coherence (out of noise of anyone's background thought), we will also feel framed in our attitude when sometimes we aren't making that cohesive effort to be. We are guided by our heart when we are more closely feeling and taking the frame of an attitude.

In Sanskrit, anahata means \\"unhurt, unstruck, and unbeaten\\". Anahata Nad refers to the Vedic concept of unstruck sound (the sound of the celestial realm). Anahata is associated with balance, calmness, and serenity.  Etymology  In Sanskrit Anahata means \\"sound produced without touching two parts\\" and at the same time it means \\"pure\\" or \\"clean, stainless\\". The name of this chakra signifies the state of freshness that appears when we are able to become detached and to look at the different and apparently contradictory experiences of life with a state of openness (expansion). Normally we are not used to the effect produced by the confrontation of the two opposite forces. At the level of Anahata chakra appears the possibility to integrate the two opposite forces and obtain the effect (sound, in this case), without the two forces being confronted (without touching of the two parts). This energy is specific to cooperation and integration, which brings peace and a new perspective in a world which, up to this level (considering only the energies specific to the first three centres of force: Muladhara, Swasdhistana and Manipura) was made only of a more or less conscious confrontation between opposite forces. The name Anahata suggests, in fact, the synergetic effect of the interaction of energies at this level.  Description  = Location = The heart chakra is located in the central channel of the spine near the heart, with its kshetram Swami Satyananda Saraswati. Kundalini Tantra = Appearance = Anahata is represented by a lotus flower with twelve petals. Inside there is a smoky region at the intersection of two triangles, creating a shatkona. The shatkona is a symbol used in Hindu Yantra, representing the union of male and female. Specifically, it is meant to represent Purusha (the Supreme Being) and Prakriti (Mother Nature) and is often represented by Shiva and Shakti. The deity of this area is Vayu, who is smoke-like and four-armed, holding a kusha and riding an antelope (this chakra's animal). = Seed mantra = The seed syllable is the dark-grey mantra \\"yam\\". In the bindu (or dot) above the syllable is the deity Isha. Isha is bright white or blue in color. He has either one or five faces, with three eyes on each face. He may have two, four or ten arms. He is clad in a tiger skin, holds a trident and drum, grants blessings, and dispels fear. His shakti is Kakini, who is shining yellow or rose-coloured. She has a number of variations: one, three or six faces; two or four arms; and holds a variety of implements (occasionally a sword, shield, skull or trident). She is seated on a red lotus. = Petals = The twelve petals are inscribed with the following Sanskrit syllables. (Note: In some representations the syllables or else the petals themselves are colored vermillion.) # kam # kham # gam # gham # ngam # cham # chham # jam # jham # nyam # tam #tham The syllables may be thought as matching twelve vrittis or divine qualities of the heart as follows.https://www.yogaindailylife.org/system/en/chakras/anahata-chakra # bliss # peace # harmony # love # understanding # empathy # clarity # purity # unity # compassion # kindness # forgiveness Even more commonly, systems of understanding identify these vrittis as corresponding with various reflexive modifications away from the indifferentiated divine mind, each one considered as arising from spiritual ignorance, as below.http://openanahata.com/en/2018/01/13/the-twelve-petals-of-the-anahata- lotus-flower/ # asha: wish, desire, hope # cinta: thoughtfulness, anxiety # cesta: effort # mamta: possessiveness, fondness # dhamba: arrogance, vanity # viveka: discrimination # vikalata: languor # ahamkara: conceit, egoism, pride # lolata: covetousness, avarice # kapatata: duplicity, hypocrisy # vitarka: indecision, argumentativeness # anutapa: regret, burning misery William Enckhausen defines half of these vrittis as spiritual ignorances and half spiritual developments. \\"Half the 12 vrttis of the Anahata are 'positive', growth promoting vrttis and the other half are 'negative' or at most neutral, self-justifying defense tendencies that perpetuate the ego's limited boundaries instead of expanding and refining them. There is still a limited and bounded sense of self, but with the potential to discriminate between vice and virtue. There is also still the boundary of self and not self to be overcome, although not as marked as in the Manipura and Svadhistana. Harmony, balance, and proportion are key elements in this fulcrum that is the Anahata to help determine what is growth-promoting and virtuous (self, or good for the self) and what is vice, or inappropriate for spiritual self-growth (not self).\\" Enckhausen's translations follow. # hope # worry # endeavor # affection # vanity # discernment # depression # self-identity # selfishness # duplicity # contention # compunction  Function  Anahata is considered to be the seat of the Jivatman and Parashakti. In the Upanishads, this is described as a tiny flame inside the heart. Anahata is named as such because sages were believed to hear the sound (Anahata ‚Äì comes without the striking of two objects together).Woodroffe, J. The Serpent Power ‚Äì Dover Publications, New York, 1974 p. 120 It is associated with air, touch and the actions of the hands. Anahata is associated with the ability to make decisions outside the realm of karma. In Manipura and below, man is bound by the laws of karma and fate. In Anahata one makes decisions (\\"follows one's heart\\") based on one's higher self, not the unfulfilled emotions and desires of lower nature. As such, it is known as the heart chakra. It is also associated with love and compassion, charity to others and psychic healing. Meditation on this chakra is said to bring about the following siddhis (abilities): he becomes a lord of speech, he is dear to women, his presence controls the senses of others, and he can leave and enter the body at will.  Hrit (Hridaya, Surya) chakra  The Hrit chakra (just below Anahata) is the seat of the wish-fulfilling tree. Immediately below Anahata (at the solar plexus or, sometimes, on the near left side of the body) is a minor chakra known as Hrit (or Hridaya, \\"heart\\"), with eight petals. It has three regions: a vermilion sun region, within which is a white moon region, within which is a deep-red fire region. Within this is the red wish-fulfilling tree, kalpa vriksha, which symbolises the ability to manifest what one wishes to happen in the world. Hrit chakra is sometimes known as the Surya (sun) chakra,R. Venugopalam. The Hidden Mysteries of Kundalini which is located slightly to the left below the heart. Its role is to absorb energy from the sun and provide heat to the body and the other chakras (to Manipura in particular, to which it provides Agni' (fire).  Associations with the body  Anahata is said to be near the heart. Because of its connection to touch (sense) and actions, it is associated with the skin and hands. In the endocrine system, Anahata is said to be associated with the thymus.  Practices  In Yogic practices, anahata is awakened and balanced by asanas, pranayamas and the practice of ajapa japa (japa, without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra) and purified by bhakti (devotion). There are also special Concentration practices for awakening the AnƒÅhata Chakra.  Comparisons with other systems  = Tibetan Buddhism = The heart wheel in Tibetan Buddhism is the location of the indestructible red- and-white drop. At death, the winds of the body dissolve and enter this drop, which then leads the body into Bardo (the intermediate stage) and rebirth. The heart wheel in this model is circular, white and has eight petals (or channels) reaching downwards. These channels divide into three wheels (mind, speech and body) and go to 24 places in the body. They again divide into three and then into 1,000, producing 72,000 channels (known as Nadi) throughout the body.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Tantric Grounds and Paths The heart wheel is important in meditation; in the lower tantras, the mantra is recited from the heart. It is recited verbally and then mentally; then, in the heart, a tiny moon disc and flame are imagined from which the mantra rings. In the higher tantras (the Anuttarayoga Tantra of the Sarma schools) or the Inner Tantras of the Nyingma school, the practitioner attempts to dissolve the winds and drops into the central channel at the level of the heart to experience the Yoga of Clear Light; this is a practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa. In Tibetan Buddhism there is a chakra, the Fire Wheel, above the heart and below the throat. = Sufism = Sufis have a system of Lataif-e-sitta at a number of points on the body; at the heart, there are three positioned horizontally. On the left side of the chest is the Qalb (the heart); the Ru·∏• is on the right side of the chest, and the Sirr (innermost heart) is between them.Abu Bakr Siraj ad Din Cook. The Subtle Centres of the Heart The Qalb is called the heart of the mystic; it is caught between the downward pull of the lower nafs, and the upward pull of the spirit of Allah and may be blackened by sin. It may be purified by reciting the names of God. The Ru·∏• is the centre of the spirit, the breath of Allah; when awakened, it counteracts the negative pull of the nafs. The Sirr is the innermost heart, where Allah manifests his mystery to himself. = Qigong = In Qigong, the middle Dantian (one of the three furnaces that transform energy in the body) is in this region. The middle Dantian transforms qi energy into shen (spiritual energy). This is also not a correct location of a Dantian. The Dantian is located on the Anterior of the body, not the posterior, as is this chakra.

It is a part of the brain which can be made more powerful through meditation, yoga and other spiritual practices just as a muscle is. In Hindu tradition, it signifies the subconscious mind, the direct link to the brahman. While a person's two eyes see the physical world, the third eye is believed to reveal insights about the future. The third eye chakra is said to connect people to their intuition, give them the ability to communicate with the world, or help them receive messages from the past and the future. Location The Ajna chakra is located in the center of the forehead between the eyebrows. It is not a part of the physical body but considered to be the part of Pranic system. The location makes it a sacred spot where Hindus apply a vermilion bindi to show reverence for it. The Ajna chakra is correspondent with the pineal gland.  Appearance  Ajna is described as a transparent lotus flower with two white petals, said to represent the nadis (psychic channels) Ida and Pingala, which meet the central Sushumna nadi before rising to the crown chakra, Sahasrara. The letter \\"ham\\" (‡§π‡§Ç) is written in white on the left petal and represents Shiva, while the letter \\"ksham\\" (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ç) is written in white on the right petal and represents Shakti. Inside the pericarp of the flower is the hakini Shakti. It is depicted with a white moon, six faces, and six arms holding a book, a skull, a drum, and a rosary, while making the gestures associated with granting boons and dispelling fears. The downward-pointing triangle above her contains a white lingam. This triangle, along with the lotus flower, can represent wisdom. In some systems the deity Ardhanarishvara, a hermaphrodite form Shiva-Shakti, resides within the lingam and symbolizes the duality of subject and object. This sixth chakra of our energy body is also connected with the sixth layer of our aura, known as the celestial layer in aura science.  Seed syllable  Traditional Hindu diagram of third eye chakra The seed syllable of Ajna is Ksham and the more well known, Om, or \\"Pranava Om\\", which is believed to be the basic sound of the world and contains all other sounds. It is considered the supreme sound of the universe. The Bƒ´ja mantras are monosyllabic seed sounds which, when they are spoken aloud, activate the energy of the chakras in order to purify and balance the mind and body. The energy resonates in the chakra associated with the mantra, helping the speaker become aware of their body's needs.  Function  Ajna translates as \\"authority\\" or \\"command\\" (or \\"perceive\\") and is considered the eye of intuition and intellect. Its associated sense organ is the brain.

Description Image of a Sahasrara Chakra with 1000 petals, in 20 layers of 50 petals each. =Appearance= The Sahasrara (often spelt \\"Sahastrara\\") is described as a lotus flower with 1,000 petals of different colors. These petals are arranged in 20 layers, each layer with approximately 50 petals. The pericarp is golden and within it a circular moon region is inscribed with a luminous triangle, which can be either upward- or downward- pointing. Function Often referred to as a thousand-petaled lotus, it is said to be the most subtle chakra in the system, relating to pure consciousness, and it is from this chakra that all the other chakras emanate. When a yogi is able to raise his/her kundalini (energy of consciousness) up to this point, the state of Nirvikalpa SamƒÅdhi is experienced. Practices Exercises for the SahasrƒÅra Chakra are: * ShirshƒÅsana * VrikshƒÅsana * Khatu Pranam * Singing OM * KriyƒÅ Yoga There are also special Meditations on the SahasrƒÅra Chakra. Associated chakras In some schemes of chakras, there are actually several chakras, which are all closely related, at the top of the head. Rising from Ajna, we have the Manas chakra on the forehead, which is closely associated with Ajna. Above Manas there are Bindu Visarga at the back of the head; Mahanada; Nirvana, which is located on the crown; Guru; and the Sahasrara proper, located above the crown. =Bindu Visarga= Bindu visarga is also connected with ajna. The Bindu Visarga is located at the back of the head, in a place where many Brahmins keep a tuft of hair. It is symbolized by a crescent moon on a moonlit night, with a point or bindu above it. This is the white bindu, with which yogis try to unite the red bindu below. It is said to be the point through which the soul enters the body, creating the chakras as it descends and terminating in the coiled kundalini energy at the base of the spine. It is often described as the source of the divine nectar, or amrita, though this is sometimes said to come from either aj√±a chakra or lalita chakra. This nectar falls down into the digestive fire (samana) where it is burnt up. The preservation of this nectar is known as \\"urdhva retas\\" (literally: upward semen). The white drop is associated with the essence of semen, while the red bindu is associated with menstrual fluid. This chakra is sometimes known as the Indu, Chandra, or Soma Chakra. In other descriptions, it is located on the forehead - white, with 16 petals - corresponding to the vrittis of mercy, gentleness, patience, non-attachment, control, excellent- qualities, joyous mood, deep spiritual love, humility, reflection, restfulness, seriousness, effort, controlled emotion, magnanimity and concentration. =Mahanada= The name of this chakra means \\"Great Sound\\", and it is in the shape of a plough. It represents the primal sound from which emanates all of creation. =Nirvana= This chakra is located on the crown of the head. It is white in color and possesses 100 white petals. It marks the end of the sushumna central channel. It is responsible for different levels of concentration: dharana, dhyana and savikalpa samadhi. =Guru= The Guru Chakra is located above the head, just below Sahasrara proper. It is white, with 12 white petals, upon which is written guru. It contains a circular moon region, within which is a downward pointing triangle containing a jeweled altar, with the crescent moon below and circular bindu above. Inside the bindu is the seat, near which are the gurus footstools, upon which are the gurus feet. This position is considered very important in Tibetan tantric practice of deity yoga, where the guru or deity is often visualized as above the crown, bestowing blessings below (for example in the Vajrasattva purification meditation). Higher levels Within Sahasrara, there are yet more levels of organization.Susan Shumsky. Exploring Chakras:Awaken your untapped energy Within the triangle begins a series of ever higher levels of consciousness: Ama-Kala, the First Ring of Visarga, Nirvana-Kala, and Nirvana Shakti, which contains the Second Ring of Visarga. From here, Kundalini becomes Shankhini, with 3-and-a-half coils. The First Coil of Shankhini wraps around the Supreme Bindu, the Second Coil of Shankhini wraps around the Supreme Nada, the Third Coil of Shankhini wraps around Shakti, and the Half-Coil of Shankhini enters into Sakala Shiva, beyond which is Parama Shiva. =Ama-Kala= Ama-Kala is the experience of samprajnata samadhi. =Visarga= Visarga is symbolized by two small rings, one of which is inside Ama-Kala, and the other of which is below Supreme Bindu, which represents the transition from samprajnata samadhi to the oneness of asamprajnata samadhi. =Nirvana-Kala= Here Kundalini absorbs even the experience of samadhi, through the power of supreme control (Nirodhika-Fire). =Nirvana-Shakti to Parama Shiva= Here Kundalini passes into the supreme void, which is the experience of asamprajnata or nirvikalpa samadhi, and becomes Shankhini. Shankhini wraps around and absorbs the Supreme Bindu, which is the void; then the Supreme Nada; then Shakti; and then unites with and absorbs Sakala Shiva; before finally being absorbed into Parama Shiva, which is the final stage of nirvikalpa samadhi. Association with the body Sahasrara or Sahastrar is related to the crown of the head. It is typically associated with the fontanelle and the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures of the skull. Various sources will relate it to the pineal gland, hypothalamus or the pituitary gland although these are often given instead as locations of Aj√±a Chakra. Comparisons with other systems Sahasrara used as roof-architecture in a Temple in Tamil Nadu The crown wheel is important within the Anuttarayoga Tantra tradition of Buddhist Vajrayana. It is triangular, with 32 petals or channels that point downwards, and within it resides the white drop or white bodhicitta. Through meditation, the yogi attempts to unite this drop with the red bodhicitta in the navel, and to experience the union of emptiness and bliss.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Tantric Grounds and Paths It is very important in the Tantric practice of Phowa, or consciousness transference. At the time of death, a yogi can direct his consciousness up the central channel and out of this wheel in order to be reborn in a Pure Land, where he can carry on his tantric practices, or transfer that consciousness into another body or a corpse, in order to extend life. In the West, it has been noted by many (such as Charles Ponce in his book Kabbalah.) that Sahasrara expresses a similar archetypal idea to that of Kether, in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, which rests at the head of the tree, and represents pure consciousness and union with God. Within the Sufi system of Lataif-e-sitta there is a Lataif called Akhfa, the \\"most arcane subtlety\\", which is located on the crown. It is the point of unity where beatific visions of Allah are directly revealed.

They are often referred to as the \\"founders\\" of hardcore punk along with Black Flag, Bad Brains, Angry Samoans, The Bags, Germs, Negative Trend, and Middle Class. Their second album Hardcore '81 was thought by manyZach Baron, October 25, 2006, Pitchfork Media to have been the first actual reference to the second wave of the American punk sound as hardcore. Singer/guitarist Joey \\"Shithead\\" Keithley is the only founding member to have stayed in the band throughout its entire history, with original bassist Randy Rampage returning to the band twice after his original departure. D.O.A. has often released music on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles Records, and they have released an album with Biafra on vocals titled Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors. D.O.A. is known for its outspoken political opinions and has a history of performing for many causes and benefits. Its slogan is \\"Talk Minus Action Equals Zero.\\" The band's lyrics and imagery frequently advocate anti-racism, anti-globalization, freedom of speech, and environmentalism. Founder Joe Keithley is also the founder of Sudden Death Records which has released music by D.O.A. and several other bands including Pointed Sticks and Young Canadians.  History  =Formation and early years (1977‚Äì1980)= D.O.A. has its origins in The Skulls, an early Vancouver-area punk rock band that included future D.O.A. members Joey \\"Shithead\\" Keithley, Brian \\"Wimpy Roy\\" Goble, and Ken \\"Dimwit\\" Montgomery. When the Skulls broke up after an ill- fated move to Toronto, Keithley moved back to Vancouver and formed D.O.A. in early 1978 with himself on guitar, Dimwit's brother Chuck Biscuits on drums, Randy Rampage on bass, and a lead singer known only as \\"Harry Homo\\", who suggested the band's name. The band's first gig took place at the Japanese Hall in Vancouver on February 20 of that year, after which Harry Homo was sacked for an apparent lack of rhythm; Keithley then became the band's singer. A second guitarist named \\"Randy Romance\\" played briefly with the band in March 1978 before leaving. The band began playing frequently around Vancouver and added guitarist Brad Kent the following June. That summer, they recorded and self-released their first single, the four-song EP Disco Sucks. The single soon topped the charts of the University of San Francisco radio station KUSF, which prompted the band to begin touring down to San Francisco. They played their first shows there in August 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens. It was during this trip that the band first met Dead Kennedys frontman and future collaborator Jello Biafra. Kent was fired from the band in September and later that fall the band recorded and released their second single \\"The Prisoner\\". In May 1979, the band embarked on their first North American tour. Upon its completion they hired Vancouver journalist and activist Ken Lester as their manager. Lester booked another tour for them the following October, in the middle of which they flew back to Vancouver to open for The Clash at the Pacific Coliseum. They soon after released their third single, \\"World War 3\\" / \\"Whatcha Gonna Do?\\". In late 1979, they added second guitarist, Dave Gregg. Soon after, Biscuits and Rampage left the band after a disastrous gig at the University of British Columbia's Student Union Building and were replaced by Andy Graffiti and Simon \\"Stubby Pecker\\" Wilde on drums and bass, respectively. Keithley soon became dissatisfied with the band's performances with the new lineup, however, and Biscuits and Rampage both rejoined the band in March 1980. D.O.A. released their full-length debut Something Better Change on Friends Records in 1980 and continued touring the United States and Canada extensively. =Hardcore 81 and further lineup changes (1981‚Äì1989)= On April 22, 1981 the band released their second album Hardcore '81; the record's title and its extensive North American promotional tour is sometimes credited with popularizing the term \\"hardcore punk\\". Randy Rampage was fired from the band on January 1, 1982 and was replaced by ex-Skulls drummer Dimwit on bass. After a short tour of California, Chuck Biscuits left the band and joined Black Flag. Dimwit switched back to drums and Subhumans singer Wimpy Roy, another ex-Skulls member, was hired as the new bass player and second singer, leaving Keithley as the last remaining original member. This lineup would last from 1982‚Äì1983 and later 1985-1986 and produced several notable releases, including the EP War on 45 (now expanded into a full-length album). War on 45 found the band expanding their sound with touches of funk and reggae, as well as making their anti-war and anti-imperialist political stance more clear. 1985's Let's Wreck The Party and 1987's True (North) Strong And Free saw the band taking on a more mainstream, hard-rock oriented production, but without watering down the band's political lyrical focus. Meanwhile, the band's lineup changes continued after Let's Wreck the Party, with Dimwit replaced by Kerr Belliveau. Belliveau stayed only three weeks with the band but recorded the Expo Hurts Everyone 7\\" as well as two songs for True (North) Strong and Free before being replaced by Jon Card from Personality Crisis. Dave Gregg quit in 1988 after D.O.A. fired their manager Ken Lester, to which he was close. The band hired Chris Prohom from the Dayglo Abortions as a replacement. =First breakup and reunion (1990‚Äì2002)= 1990's Murder featured rawer, almost thrash metal production, rather than their original basic punk sound. The same year also produced a collaboration with Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra with Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors. In August 1990, Joey decided he was breaking up D.O.A. but, at the suggestion of promoter Dirk Dirksen, they did a farewell tour of the West Coast, playing their \\"final\\" show on December 1, 1990 at the Commodore in Vancouver. In 1991, they released a posthumous live album entitled Talk Minus Action = 0 while Keithley pursued an acting career. 19 months after D.O.A. broke up, Joey Shithead and Wimpy Roy had reunited as D.O.A in the summer of 1992. Fellow Canadian punk rock veteran John Wright from NoMeansNo suggested they hire Ken Jensen from Red Tide as the new drummer, which they did. The new lineup released an EP and two albums in the early 1990s, 13 Flavours Of Doom and Loggerheads. These albums found the band replacing the more hard-rock oriented sound of the 1980s with a return to punk rock, although it was a heavier, tighter brand of punk than their earlier work. These albums were produced by Wright, who also played keyboards on the recordings. The band then added Ford Pier on guitar and vocals. Tragedy struck in 1995 when drummer Ken Jensen died in a house fire. The \\"Ken Jensen Memorial Single\\" EP was released on Alternative Tentacles, including two tracks each from D.O.A. and Red Tide. With John Wright filling in on drums, ninth full- length The Black Spot was recorded. The album featured a more basic, sing- along type punk rock sound that was reminiscent of the band's late 1970s and early 1980s output. The late 1990s found the band's lineup in turmoil, with Wimpy Roy leaving the band after a decade and a half of service and Kuba joining to play bass from 1997 until 2001. Keithley experimented with different bassists and drummers and released the album Festival Of Atheists in 1998. By the early 2000s, the band had found a permanent drummer in the form of The Great Baldini. In 2002, Keithley put out his first solo album, Beat Trash, and original bassist Randy Rampage returned to the band after nearly 20 years for the Win The Battle album. However, the reunion did not last, with Rampage leaving the band again after the recording of the album, to be replaced by Dan Yaremko. The Lost Tapes was the first release on Keithley's revived Sudden Death label, followed by Festival Of Atheists. During this period, Keithley also oversaw the re-release of the band's classic early records on Sudden Death, several of which had been out of print for many years. =Later years and second hiatus (2003‚Äì2013)= In 2003, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell declared December 21 to be \\"D.O.A. Day\\" in honour of the band's 25th anniversary. In the same year, the band released a career-spanning retrospective entitled War And Peace. 2004 found the band releasing the ska- flavoured Live Free or Die. In 2006, Randy Rampage rejoined D.O.A. for his 3rd stint in the band. The lineup remained stable until 2008, when The Great Baldini left the band to be replaced by new drummer James Hayden. Also in 2008, it was announced that Bob Rock, of Metallica fame would be producing the band's next album in time for their 30th anniversary. James Hayden quit before D.O.A. started to record to be replaced by Floor Tom Jones In September 2008, D.O.A. released Northern Avenger and embarked on their 30th anniversary tour. On the eve of the tour, it was announced that Randy Rampage was being replaced by Dan Yaremko once again. D.O.A. played several dates in the summer of 2009 as part of the Van's Warped Tour 2009. On May 1, 2010, D.O.A. released their fourteenth full-length album Talk Minus Action = Zero (a similarly titled live album Talk Minus Action Equals Zero had previously been released in 1990). Drummer Jesse Pinner (of the band Raised by Apes) took the place of Floor Tom Jones beginning on D.O.A.'s subsequent August 2010 tour due to Floor Tom Jones' commitments to his job at Canada Post. In 2012, Joe announced that he would be seeking nomination as an NDP candidate in the B.C. provincial election. As a result, D.O.A. announced an indefinite hiatus, and began their farewell tour on January 18, 2013 in celebration of the band's thirty-five year anniversary. =Second reunion and recent activity (2014‚Äìpresent)= On September 22, 2014, Keithley officially announced on the Sudden Death Records website that he had decided to reform the band with Paddy Duddy on drums and Mike \\"Maggot\\" Hodsall on bass, and would be embarking on a Canadian tour in October in support of the recently released live album, Welcome To Chinatown. This lineup recorded and released the studio album Hard Rain Falling in 2015. In April 2016, the band released a new version of \\"Fucked Up Ronnie\\" entitled \\"Fucked Up Donald\\" (referring to the 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump) as a single. =Members= Current lineup *Joe Keithley ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1978‚Äìpresent), bass (1996‚Äì1999, studio only) *Mike Hodsall ‚Äì bass (2014‚Äìpresent) *Paddy Duddy ‚Äì drums (2014‚Äìpresent) Former members *Harry Homo - lead vocals (1978) *Brad Kent - guitar (1978) *Randy Romance - guitar (1978) *Zippy Pinhead - drums (1979; died 2019) *Simon Wilde - bass (1979-1980; died 1994) *Andy Graffiti - drums (1979-1980) *Randy Rampage ‚Äì bass (1978‚Äì1982, 2000‚Äì2002, 2006‚Äì2009; died 2018) *Chuck Biscuits ‚Äì drums (1978‚Äì1982) *Dave Gregg ‚Äì guitar (1979‚Äì1988; died 2014) *Brian Roy Goble ‚Äì bass (1982‚Äì1996; died 2014) *Ken \\"Dimwit\\" Montgomery ‚Äì bass (1982), drums (1982‚Äì1983, 1984-1986; died 1994) *Gregg \\"Ned Peckerwood\\" James - drums (1983-1984) *Kerr Belliveau - drums (1986) *Jon Card ‚Äì drums (1986‚Äì1990) *Chris Prohom ‚Äì guitar (1988‚Äì1990) *Ken Jensen ‚Äì drums (1992‚Äì1995; died 1995) *Jon Wright ‚Äì keyboards (1992‚Äì1995), drums (1995‚Äì1996) *Ford Pier ‚Äì guitar (1994‚Äì1996) *Wycliffe - bass (1997) *Kuba van der Pol - bass (1998-2000, 2002-2003) *Brien O‚ÄôBrien ‚Äì drums (1997‚Äì1999) *The Great Baldini ‚Äì drums (2000‚Äì2008) *Dan Yaremko ‚Äì bass (2003‚Äì2006, 2009‚Äì2013) *Floor Tom Jones ‚Äì drums (2008‚Äì2010) *Jesse Pinner ‚Äì drums (2010‚Äì2013) Timeline  Discography  = Studio albums = * Something Better Change (1980) * Hardcore '81 (1981) * War on 45 (1982) * Let's Wreck The Party (1985) * True (North) Strong And Free (1987) * Murder (1990) * 13 Flavours of Doom (1992) * Loggerheads (1993) * The Black Spot (1995) * Festival Of Atheists (1998) * Win the Battle (2002) * Live Free Or Die (2004) * Northern Avenger (2008) * Kings of Punk, Hockey and Beer (2009) * Talk-Action=0 (2010) * We Come In Peace (2012) * Hard Rain Falling (2015) * Fight Back (2018) * Treason (2020) = Live albums = * Talk Minus Action Equals Zero (1991) * Welcome to Chinatown (2013) = EPs = * War on 45 (1982) * D.O.A. & Thor - Are U Ready (2003) = Collaborations = * Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors (With Jello Biafra) (1989) = Solo albums = * Beat Trash (2002) - Solo Project from Joey \\"Shithead\\" Keithley References External links *The official D.O.A. myspace *CanadianBands.com entry *Sudden Death records *Interview with Joey Shithead *Snot Rag interview with Dimwit (1979) *Robert Christgau's review of five D.O.A. albums * Scanner zine interview with Joey Shithead *Late Night Wallflower interview with Joey Shithead (2007) *Toronto Music Scene Interview with Joey Shithead * The Ruckus - Audio Interview with Joey Keithley from September 2008 Category:Musical groups established in 1978 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2013 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2014 Category:Canadian hardcore punk groups Category:Canadian activists Category:Musical groups from Vancouver Category:Alternative Tentacles artists Category:1978 establishments in British Columbia Category:Music and politics ","title":"D.O.A.

History Initially a hamlet in the parish of Chesham, the manor was assessed at 1¬Ω hides in the reign of King Edward the Confessor. The estate belonged to a brother of King Harold, who was killed with him at the Battle of Hastings and probably William the Conqueror gave this ‚Äòroyal‚Äô land to his own half-brother, Odo Bishop of Bayeux. The village gets its name from the de Bosco family (the French version of which was 'de Bois') and by 1213 in the reign of King John a William du Bois was holding the manor. By about 1430, in the reign of Henry VI, the manor had been acquired by the Cheynes of Chenies who remained for over 300 years, before conveying the manor to the Duke of Bedford in 1735. Chesham Bois House, the site of the manor, was the subject of an archaeological excavation by television programme Time Team, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in March 2007. Famous people born in Chesham Bois were the crime writer and composer Edmund Crispin, Lieutenant Commander Peter Scawen Watkinson Roberts, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in the face of the enemy during World War II and Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England. David Munrow, the Early music pioneer lived in Chesham Bois for a short period of time before his death. Today The village contains two churches: the Anglican church of St. Leonard's (started in the 12th century) and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady (built in 1915 and extended in 1953). Chesham Bois C of E Combined School is located down Bois Lane, a mixed primary school with over 200 pupils. The Beacon School is also located in the village and is an independent preparatory school educating over 400 boys. Also on located in the Village is Our Ladys Roman Catholic Combined School which is opposite the church of the same name. Elangeni School is situated at the end of Woodside Avenue and is a mixed state school. A sycamore and ash wood and common is the site of the local cricket pavilion, as well as being the site for the biennial village fete. Today some of Chesham Bois merges into Amersham-on-the-Hill and remains part of the Chiltern Hills.

It covers about 32,000 square metres and is surrounded by two earth banks separated by a ditch with an entrance in the western end. A second entrance in the eastern end was apparently blocked up a few centuries after it was built. The original defensive ditch was V-shaped with a small box rampart in front and a larger one behind it. Timber posts stood on the ramparts. Later the ditch was deepened and the extra material dumped on top of the ramparts to increase their size. A parapet wall of sarsen stones lined the top of the innermost rampart. It is very close to the Uffington White Horse on White Horse Hill. Uffington White Horse, sketched by William Plenderleath in The White Horses of the West of England (1892) Excavations Excavations have indicated that it was probably built in the 7th or 8th century BC and continued to be occupied throughout the Iron Age. Isolated postholes were found inside the fort but no evidence of buildings. Pottery, loom weights and animal bone finds suggest some form of occupation however. The most activity appears to have been during the Roman period as the artefacts recovered from the upper fills of the ditch attest. The ramparts were remodelled to provide more entrances, and a shrine seems to have been built in the early 4th century AD. Two oblong mounds, one containing 46 Romano-British burials and one containing eight Saxon burials, lie nearby. The Ridgeway An ancient track passes by the northern entrance to the hillfort; it is known as The Ridgeway. It links to the Icknield Way at the Goring Gap, and passes close to Avebury before heading south across Salisbury Plain. It also passes very close to a Neolithic chambered long barrow, Waylands Smithy, about a mile to the west. Protection The hillfort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and was included in the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 as one of the first 68 sites in Britain and Ireland to receive legal protection. Along with the Uffington White Horse on the slopes below the ramparts, it is in the care of English Heritage.

A Church-Turing Machine is a digital computer that encapsulates the symbols in a thread of computation as a chain of protected abstractions by enforcing the dynamic binding laws of Alonzo Church's Lambda Calculus Other Capability Based Computers including CHERI and CAP computer are hybrids. They retain default instructions that can access every word of accessible physical or logical (paged) memory. It is an unavoidable characteristic of the von Neumann Architecture that is founded on shared random access memory and blind trust in the sharing default access rights. For example, every word in every page managed by the virtual memory manager in an operating system using a Memory management unit must be blindly trusted. Using a default privilege among many compiled programs allows corruption to grow without any method of error detection. However, the range of virtual addresses given to the MMU or the range of physical addresses produced by the MMU is shared undetected corruption flows across the shared memory space from one software function to another. PP250 removed not only virtual memory or any centralized, precompiled operating system but also the superuser, removing all default machine privileges. It is default privileges that empower undetected malware and hacking in a computer. Instead, the pure Object-capability model of PP250 always requires a limited capability key to define the authority to operate. PP250 separated binary data from capability data to protect access rights, simplify the computer and speed garbage collection. The Church-Machine encapsulates and context limits the Turing Machine by enforcing the laws of the Lambda Calculus. The typed digital media is program-controlled by distinctly different machine instructions. Mutable binary data is programmed by 28 RISC instruction set for Imperative programming and Procedural programming the binary data using binary data registers confined to a capability limited memory segment. The immutable Capability Keys, exclusive to six Church-Instructions, navigate the computational context of the Turing Machine through the separately programmed structure of the Object-capability model. PP250 was sold commercially circa 1972. Immutable Capability Key represent named Lambda Calculus variables. This Church side is a Lambda Calculus Meta-Machine. The other side is an object- oriented machine of binary objects, programmed functions, capability lists defining function abstractions, storage for threads of computation (Lambda Calculus Applications) or storage for the list of Capability Keys in a namespace. The laws of the Lambda Calculus are implemented by the Church- Instructions with micro-programmed access to the reserved (hidden) capability registers. The software is incrementally assembled as object-oriented machine- code linked by the Capability Keys. The structure of function abstractions, including those for memory management, input, and output, scheduling and communication services are protected as private frames in a Thread. Threads computer inline or as parallel computations activated by program controlled Church-Instruction. Conceptually, the PP250 operates at the dead center of the Church-Turing Thesis as a digitally secure, functional Church-Turing Machine for trusted software. As a real-time controller, PP250 provided fail-safe software applications for computerized telephone and military communication systems with decades of software and hardware reliability. Capability limited addressing detects and recovers from errors on contact without any harmful corruption or information theft. Furthermore, no unfair, default privileges exist for an operating system or a superuser, thereby blocking all hacking and malware. The multiprocessing hardware architecture and the dynamically bound, type limited memory, exclusively accessed through capability limited addressing, replace the statically bound, page based linear compilations with dynamically bound instructions, crosschecked and authorized at run time. By checking all memory references as an offset within the base, limit, and access types specified bugs, errors and attacks are detected by the type limited capability register. The imperative Turing-Commands must bind to binary data objects as defined by the selected capability register. The access rights of the selected capability register must approve data access rights (Read Binary Data, Write Binary Data or Execute Machine Code). On the other hand, functional Church-Instructions are bound dynamically to a capability key in a capability list held in a capability register with capability access rights (Load Capability Key, Save Capability Key or Enter Capability List). In this way, object-oriented machine code is encapsulated as a function abstraction in private execution space. This PP250 is unlike the stretched von Neumann architecture. Instead, a Lambda Calculus Meta-Machine scales a 'single tape' Turing Machine through a DNA network of 'Enter' capability keys representing functional nodes in a Lambda Calculus namespace It is a register-oriented architecture, with 8 program accessible data registers and 8 program accessible capability registers. Data registers are 24-bit; capability registers are 48-bit and contain the base address of the segment to which the capability refers, the size of the segment, and the access rights granted by the capability. Capabilities in memory are 24-bit and contain the access rights and an index into the System Capability Table for the segment to which the capability refers; entries in that table contain the segment base address and length for the segment to which the entry refers. Instructions that access memory have an opcode, a field specifying a data register operand, a field specifying a data register used as an index register containing an offset into a segment, a field specifying a capability register referring to the segment containing the memory location, and a field containing a base offset into the segment. The offset into the segment is the sum of the base offset and the contents of the index register. The software was modular based on the universal model of computation and the Lambda calculus. Six Church- Instructions hide the details of a named function application using capability keys for the typed concepts of variables, functions, abstractions, applications and a namespace. Instead of binding instructions to static linear memory as a default shared privilege used by malware and hackers, instructions are bound to typed and protected, private digital objects using Capability Keys in a Capability-based security system of immutable mathematical symbols. The resulting Object-Oriented Machine Code achieved many decades of trusted software reliably as mathematically pure, Industrial Strength Computer Science.

The parish is bounded to the southwest and southeast by a brook called The Birne, which here also forms part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. Manor There is a manor at Chetwode that stayed in the same family from the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 through to the 1960s. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Robert de Thain held the manor from Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. Priory and parish church In 1244 Sir Ralphe de Norwich founded an Augustinian priory at Chetwode. In 1460, owing to its poverty, the priory was dissolved and annexed to the nearby Nutley Abbey in Long Crendon. This led to the first recognition of Chetwode as a village rather than just a priory. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas and was once part of the Augustinian priory church. However the parish church had become ruinous in the 15th century and this building replaced it as the parish church in 1480. The stonework is a fine example of the work of the 13th century, particularly the sedilia, the east window of five lancets and the triple-lancet window on the south side, with stained glass of the 13th and 14th centuries. The 14th century north chapel later became the manor pew. Economic history The parish's common lands were enclosed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1812. In 1899 the Great Central Railway opened its main line to London through the southwestern part of the parish. The nearest station was Finmere for Buckingham, which was just over the Oxfordshire county boundary on the main road between Buckingham and Bicester and just over from Chetwode. The station was from Buckingham, more than from Finmere and was actually in Shelswell parish next to the village of Newton Purcell. In about 1922 the Great Central renamed the station Finmere. British Railways closed the station in 1963 and the line in 1966.

Death by sawing was a method of execution reportedly used in different parts of the world, but most frequently in Mediaeval Europe. Methods Different methods of death by sawing have been recorded. In cases related to the Roman Emperor Caligula, the sawing is said to be through the middle (transversely).Scott (1995), p.142 In the cases of Morocco, it is stated that the sawing was lengthwise, both from the groin upwards and from the skull downwards (midsagittally).Busnot (1717), pp.167‚Äì70 In only one case, the story about Simon the Zealot, the person is explicitly described as being hung upside-down and sawn apart vertically through the middle, starting at the groin, with no mention of fastenings or support boards around the person, in the manner depicted in illustrations.Geyer (1738) p.631 In other cases where details about the method beyond the mere sawing act are explicitly supplied, the condemned person was apparently fastened to either one or two boards prior to sawing. Ancient history and classical antiquity =Ancient Persia= ;The legend of Jamshid Jamshid was a legendary shah of Persia, whose story is told in the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi. After 300 years of blessed reign, Jamshid forgot the blessings came from God, and began demanding that he be revered as a god himself. The people rebelled, and Zahhak had him sawn asunder.Osborne (1744), p.179 ; Parysatis Parysatis, wife and half-sister of Darius II (r. 423‚Äì405 BC) was the real power behind the throne of the Achaemenid Empire; she instigated and became involved in a number of court intrigues, made several enemies, yet had an uncanny knack for dispatching them at an opportune time. At one point, she decided to have the siblings of her daughter-in-law Stateira killed, and only relented from killing Stateira as well due to the desperate pleas of her son, Artaxerxes II. Stateira's sister Roxana was the first of her siblings to be killed, by being sawn in half. When Darius II died, Parysatis moved quickly, and was able to have the new queen Stateira poisoned; Parysatis still remained a power to be reckoned with for years after.Osborne (1747), p.266 ;Hormizd IV Hormizd IV (), son of Khosrow I, was the twenty-first King of Persia from AD 579 to 590.Dignas; Winter (2007) p.42 He was deeply resented by the nobility due to his cruelties. In 590, a palace coup was staged in which his son, Khosrow II, was declared king. Hormizd was forced to watch his wife and one of his sons sawn in two, and the deposed king was then blinded. After a few days, the new king is said to have killed his father in a fit of rage.Osborne (1742), p.535 =Thracians= Thracians were regarded as warlike, ferocious, and bloodthirsty by Romans and Greeks.Head; Heath (1982), p. 51, Webber; McBride (2001): \\"Perhaps the prospect of getting to the spoils explains Thucydides VII, 29: \`For the Thracian race, like all the most bloodthirsty barbarians, are always particularly bloodthirsty when everything is going their own way\\", p.1 One of the most notorious was the king Diegylis, possibly only topped by his son Ziselmius. According to Diodorus Siculus, Ziselmius sawed several persons to death and commanded their families to eat the flesh of their murdered relatives. The Thracians eventually rebelled, captured him and sought to inflict every conceivable torture upon him prior to his death.Diodorus Seculus (1840), p.2450 =Ancient Rome= ;The Twelve Tables Promulgated about 451 BC, the Twelve Tables is the oldest extant law code for the Romans. Aulus Gellius, whose work \\"Attic Nights\\" is partially preserved, states that death by the saw was mentioned for some offenses in the tables, but that the use of which was so infrequent that no one could remember ever having seen it done.For Gellius' statement, see, Rosenm√ºller (1820), p.95 Of the retained laws in the Twelve Tables, the following concerning how creditors should proceed with debtors is found in Table 3, article 6: \\"On the third market-day they [the creditors] shall cut pieces. If they shall have cut more or less [than their shares], it shall be with impunity.\\" The translator notes the ambiguity of the original text, but says that later Roman writers understood this to mean that creditors were allowed to cut their shares from the body of the debtor. If true, that would constitute dismemberment, rather than sawing.Coleman-Norton (1948))The Twelve Tables ;Caligula This method of execution was uncommon throughout the time of the Roman Empire. However, it was used extensively during the reign of CaligulaSuet.

It is said that Caligula would watch such executions while he ate, stating that witnessing the suffering acted as an appetiser. ;The Kitos War The Kitos War occurred 115‚Äì117 AD, and was a rebellion by the Jews within the Roman Empire. Major revolts happened several places, and the main source by Cassius Dio claims that in Cyrene, 220,000 Greeks were massacred by the Jews; in Cyprus, 240,000. Dio adds that many of the victims were sawn asunder, and that the Jews licked up the blood of the slain, and \\"twisted the entrails like a girdle about their bodies\\".Gibbon (1776), Appendix, p.lxxvi ;Valens In 365 AD, Procopius declared himself emperor, and moved against Valens. He was defeated in battle, and due to the treachery of his two generals Agilonius and Gomoarius (they had been promised they would be \\"shown favour\\" by Valens), he was captured. In 366, he was fastened to two trees bent down with force; when the trees were released, Procopius was ripped apart in the manner of the legendary execution of the bandit Sinis. The \\"favour\\" Valens showed to Agilonius and Gomoarius was to have them both sawn asunder.Sozomen (1846), p.262 =Jewish tradition= ;Death of Isaiah The prophet Isaiah was, according to some traditional rabbinic texts, sawn apart on orders of King Manasseh of Judah.Warnekros (1832), p.368 One tradition states that he was put within a tree, and then sawn apart; another says he was sawn apart by means of a wooden saw.Du Pin (1699), p.115 =Christian martyrs= ;Simon the Zealot Illustration by Lucas Cranach the Elder of St. Simon sawn in two Several early Christians are credited with being martyred by means of a saw. The earliest, and most famous, is the obscure apostle of Jesus, Simon the Zealot. He is said to have been martyred in Persia, and that the express mode by which he was executed was to be hanged up by the feet, as in the woodcut illustration. ;Conus and his son According to the Acta Sanctorum, after his wife's death in the age of Domitian, Conus went with his 7-year-old son into a desert. He destroyed several pagan idols in Cogni, Asia Minor (Anatolia). When caught, he and his son were tortured by starvation and fire, and were finally put to the saw, praying while they died.Schmauss (1719), p.69 ;Symphorosa and her seven sons According to the 16th-century Foxe's Book of Martyrs, Symphorosa was a widow with seven sons living in the age of emperor Trajan (98-117) or Hadrian (117‚Äì138). Refusing a command to pray at a heathen temple, Symphorosa was scourged, and then thrown in the river Aniene with a large stone fastened to her. The six eldest sons were all killed by stab wounds, and the youngest, Eugenius, was sawn apart.Foxe (1840), p.5Symphorosa at the Catholic Encyclopedia ;The 38 monks and martyrs on Mount Sinai According to the Martyrologium Romanum, during the reign of Diocletian \\"wild barbarians\\" decided to rob a community of monks living at Mount Sinai. There was nothing of material wealth there, and in their rage, the Arabs slaughtered them all, several by flaying, others by sawing them with dull saws.Deinl (1850), p.42 ;St. Tarbula Accused of practising witchcraft and causing the sickness of the wife of the ardently anti-Christian Persian king Shapur II, Tarbula was condemned and executed by being sawn in half in the year 345.St. Tarbula Africa =Egypt= ;The monk from Montepulciano In the 1630s, there are several reports from the Levant and Egypt that monks were killed. One of them, Brother Conrad d'Elis Barthelemy, a native of Montepulciano is said to have been sawn in two, from the head and downwards.Chateaubriand (1812), p.143 ; The renegade Coptic governor Writing in 1843, William Holt Yates speaks of a governor under Muhammad Ali (r.1801‚Äì49), Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, who was said to be particularly cruel and avaricious. He was a renegade Copt, and abused his position to gain hold of wealth. He is even credited with having sawed people in two. Yates further supplies the detail: \\"This fellow has since been assassinated-report says, with sanction and approval of the Government\\"Yates (1843), p.123 More on this governor and his assassination in 1840 in Gliddon (1841), p.70-72, footnote =Morocco= ;1705 The sawing of Alcaide Melec One of the most notorious cases of sawing as execution is that of the Alcaide (castellan/governor) Melec under Sultan Moulay Ishmael (r. 1672‚Äì1727). The fullest description of this execution is found in Dominique Busnot's:fr:Dominique Busnot 1714 work Histoire du r√®gne de Mouley Ismael, although a brief notice of the event can be found in the January 1706 edition of Present state of Europe.Rhodes (1706), p.46 In the following, the tale as told by Busnot will be given. Melec was judged as the chief rebel to be punished in a rebellion instigated by one of the Sultan's sons, Mulay Muhammad. In particular, according to Busnot, the Sultaness was incensed that Melec had personally beheaded one of her cousins, Ali Bouchasra.Busnot (1716), p.66-67 In September/October 1705, Mulay Ismail sent for his chief carpenter and asked if his saws were capable of sawing a man in two. The carpenter answered \\"Sure enough\\". He was then given the grisly task, and before he left, he asked him whether Melec should be sawn across or along the length. The emperor said the sawing should proceed lengthwise, from the head downwards. He told, however, Boachasra's sons, they should follow the carpenter and decide for themselves how best to take revenge upon the murderer (i.e., Melec) of their father. Taking with him 8 of the public executioner's assistants, the master carpenter went to the prison where Melec was held, two of his brand new saws packed in cloth, in order to keep from Melec information of the intended manner of execution. Melec was now placed on a mule, bound with an iron chain, and led to the public square, where some 4000 of his relatives and members of his tribe were assembled. These made a \\"terrifying\\" spectacle through screaming, and clawing their faces in a public display of grief. Melec, on the other hand, seemed unperturbed, calmly smoking from his tobacco pipe. When taken down from the mule, Melec's clothes were removed, damning letters \\"proving\\" his treason was cast in the fire. Then, he was strapped onto a board, and placed upon a saw-bench, his arms and legs fastened. The executioner's team then sought to start by sawing him from the head downwards, but Boucasra's sons intervened, and demanded that one began between Melec's legs instead, because otherwise, he would die too quickly. Under the terrible screams of Melec and his relatives, thus began his execution. Once they had sawed him up to the navel, they pulled out the saw in order to commence from the other side. Melec is said to have been still conscious, asking for some water. His friends, though, thought it best to hasten his demise and shorten his sufferings, and the executioners went on, sawing him from skull to navel so he fell apart. In the process, chunks of flesh were ripped out by the saw's teeth, causing blood to splatter everywhere, thus making the execution quite unbearable to watch. Around 300 other conspirators were impaled alive, and another report states that in addition to these, some other 20 chief conspirators had their arms and legs sawn off, and left to expire in the marketplace. ;1721 The sawing of Larbe Shott 19 July 1721, a noble descended from the Andalusian Moors, Larbe Shott was put to the saw. He had spent considerable time at Gibraltar, and one of the crimes imputed to him was to have spent time in Christian kingdoms without his emperor's leave. Furthermore, he had been found guilty of defiling himself with Christian women, and often drunk alcohol. In short, he was charged as an apostate and unbeliever, in addition to being charged with having invited the \\"Spaniards\\" to invade Barbary (i.e., treason). They brought him to one of the gates in the city, fastened him between two boards, and sawed him in two, from skull and downwards. After his death, Mulay Ishmael pardoned him, so that his body could be picked up and given a decent burial at least, instead of being eaten by the dogs.Windus (1725), p.156-57 Americas ;Swiss sawing In 1757, a French officer was executed by his men in a mutiny on Cat Island in current- day Mississippi. Three of the mutineers were eventually captured and brought to New Orleans for trial. After conviction, two of the mutineers died on the French wheel. The last mutineer, a Swiss from the Karrer regiment, was allegedly, nailed into a coffin-shaped wooden box, and it was sawed into with a cross-cut saw. This claim of a Swiss being sawn in two was first made by the French captain and traveller Jean Bernard Bossu in his 1768 Nouveaux Voyages aux Indes Occidentales, translated into English by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1771.On French publication date and biographical details of Bossu, see: Jean Bernard Bossu (1720‚Äì1792) at the website: \\"Encyclopedia of Arkansas History&Culture;\\". On relevant excerpt, see Forster (1771), p.324-325 Commenting on Bossu's general reliability in a footnote to his essay A Map within an Indian Painting?, jurist Morris S. Arnold says the following: \\"Bossu's books contain a lot of tall tales, so one needs to be cautious about relying on him\\".Lewis, Arnold (1998), footnote 11, p.200 Bossu claims that being \\"sawed asunder\\" was a traditional Swiss military punishment, and alleges that one Swiss mutineer actually committed suicide to avoid that punishment.Forster (1771), p.324 Therefore, the one who was allegedly sawn in half had his punishment as governed by Swiss military law, rather than French. An incident from 1741 (in Louisbourg, Canada) shows that at that time, when two Frenchmen and a Swiss were executed, Swiss mercenary troops had been placed under French military law, rather than under Swiss.\\" Whatever the rights and wrongs of a particular case might be, the Swiss were not to be treated as an independent unit and their officers must be subordinate to the French commandant\\", at The Administration Of Justice At The Fortress Of Louisbourg (1713-1758) , excerpted from Greer (1976), \\"The Soldiers of Isle Royale, 1720-1745\\" Furthermore, detailing the recorded executions in the Swiss Canton of Z√ºrich through the 15th-18th century, Gerold Meyer von Knonau records 1445 executions in total, none of them being through death by sawing.Knonau (1846) p.335 ;Haitian revolution In August 1791, a great slave revolt broke out at Saint-Domingue, eventually leading to Haitian independence. In the process, some 4,000 white planters and their family members were massacred.Censer and Hunt (2001), p.124 One of the victims was a carpenter by trade, Robert. The rebels decided he \\"should die in the way of his occupation\\" and accordingly fastened him between two boards and sawed him apart.Edwards (1819), p.79 Asia =Levant= ;An episode from the Crusades In 1123, Joscelin de Courtenay and Baldwin II were separately ambushed and surprised by a Turkish emir, Balac, and made prisoners at the castle at Quartapiert. Some 50 Armenians, bound by oath to Joscelin as Count of Edessa, decided to free their liege lord as well as Baldwin II. Dressed as monks and pedlars, they gained entry in the town where the two nobles were held captive, and managed, through massacre, to take control of the castle. Joscelin slipped out in order to raise a force, while Baldwin II and his nephew Galeran remained behind to hold the castle. Apprised of the capture of the castle, Balac sent quickly a force to recapture it, and Baldwin II saw no possibility of holding it. Graciously, Balac took Baldwin and his nephew merely prisoners. Not so merciful was he towards the Armenians: Several of them were flayed, others buried up to the neck and used as target practice, the rest were sawn apart.Collins (1812), p.220 ;The Assassins The Assassins, a misnomer for the Nizari, an Ismaili sect, had an independent kingdom in the Levant during the age of the Crusades, and were feared and loathed by Muslims and Christians alike. The Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela, travelling the region around 1157 notes that the Assassins were reputed to saw in two the kings of other peoples, if they managed to capture them.Benjamin of Tudela (1858), p.10 =Ottoman Empire= A number of accounts exist where the Ottomans are said to have sawn persons in two, most of them said to occur in Mehmed the Conqueror's reign (1451‚Äì81). ;1453 conquest of Constantinople A number of cruel excesses against the populace of Constantinople is said to have happened in the wake of the taking of the city. according to one rendering of the tale:Salisbury (1830), p.225 ;1460 Capture of Mystras After the last Despot of Morea, Demetrios Palaiologos in 1460 switched allegiance to the Turks and gave them entry to Mystras, a tale grew up that the actual castellan at the castle of Mystras was ordered sawn in two. This tale was \\"well known\\" in later centuries, whatever actual veracity.Pouqueville (1813), p.82 ;1460 Michael Szil√°gyi In 1460, the Hungarian general Michael Szil√°gyi was seized by the Turks, and since he was regarded as a traitor and spy, he was sawn in half at Constantinople.Grumeza (2010), p.8 ; 1460-64 campaigns and slaughter in the Morea In the following years, inhabitants in Greece under the Venetians fought several battles in the Morea. In 1464, for example, a small city is said to have been subdued, and 500 prisoners sent to Constantinople. There, they were put to the saw, according to one account.Fallmerayer (1836), p.420 ;1463 conquest of Mytilene, Lesbos The Knights Hospitallers, then stationed at Rhodes, sent several knights to aid in the defence of Mytilene from the Turks. They eventually surrendered, under promise of having their lives spared. Instead, according to some reports, they were sawn asunder.Mignot (1787), p.162 According to Kenneth Meyer Setton, the sultan had actually promised to spare the heads of some 400 knights, and sawed them in half to keep his oath of not harming the heads.Setton (1978), p.238 ;1469/1470 conquest of Negroponte The Triarchy of Negroponte, a Crusader state or Stato da M√†r under control of the Republic of Venice, was extinguished by the capture of the city in 1469/1470, and the governor Paolo Erizzo, is said to treacherously to have been ordered sawn in two, after have being promised his life would be spared. The sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, is said to have cut off the head of Erizzo's daughter by his own hands, because she would not yield to his desires.Watkins (1806), p.366 ;1473 the arsonist at Gallipoli In 1473, a Sicilian called Anthony, is said to have managed set fire to the sultan's ships at the Sanjak of Gelibolu, Gallipoli. After being captured at Negroponte, he was brought before the sultan who asked him what harm had been done to him that he performed such an evil deed? The young man answered that he simply wanted to harm the enemy of Christianity in some glorious way. The sultan is said to have ordered that Anthony should be sawn in two.a)For dating and place of capture, Lempriere (1825), p.99\\" b) For interview between Anthony and sultan, see: von Kreckwitz (1654), p.240\\" ;1480 invasion of Otranto In 1480, the Ottomans, led by Gedik Ahmed Pasha, invaded mainland Italy, occupying Otranto. A general massacre, of disputed magnitude,11.000, by \\"traditional\\" count, see for example Smedley (1832), p.110 occurred. Archbishop Stefano Pendinelli was, by some reports, ordered to be sawn in half.Reider (1841), p.125 ;1611 revolt of Dionysius the Philosopher Dionysius the Philosopher led an eventually unsuccessful revolt against the Ottomans, seeking to establish a power base at Ioannina. Dionysius was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed with straw, was sent as a present to the sultan, Ahmed I, at Constantinople. The other principal conspirators were said to be punished in various ways, some were burnt alive, others impaled, and yet others sawn asunder.Hughes (1820), p.22 ;The mythologized death of Rhigas, the protomartyr of Greek independence Rigas Feraios (1760‚Äì98), was an early Greek patriot, whose struggle for independence of Greece preceded with about 30 years the general uprising known as the Greek War of Independence. His actual manner of death has garnered many tales; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911, for example, states that he was shot in the back.CONSTANTINE RHIGAS Yet others state that he was strangled. Some 19th century stories report that he was sawn in two.See, for example: Wigand (1844)p.307 Finally, one source asserts he was beheaded.Aurach (1859), p.82 =Mughal Empire= Martyrdom of Bhai Mati Das The Sikh Bhai Mati Das, a follower of the 9th guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur was in 1675 AD ordered executed by emperor Aurangzeb, along with several other prominent Sikhs, including their Guru, because of treason. Bhai Mati Das was sawn in half, the others in different manners.Singha (2000), p.142 =Burma= Several reports state that even in the 1820s, sawing criminals in two was an occasional punishment in Burma for \\"certain offences\\". The criminals were fastened between two planks prior to the sawing.Murray (1829), p.44 However, this might possibly have been conflated by reports of disembowelment, for which eyewitness reports exist.For eyewitness report disembowelment Judson (1823), p.84-86 The Burmese general Maha Bandula is said to have had one of his high-ranking officers sawn in two, due to some act of disobedience, the person being fastened between two planks for that purpose.Knowles (1830) \\"p.167-68 =Vietnam= ;Martyrdom of Augustin Huy On occasion, a confusion of reports may exist where, for example, performed post-mortem indignities are misinterpreted as the actual manner of execution: In 1839, the governor of Vietnam's Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province summoned five hundred soldiers to a banquet to pressure them into trampling upon a cross in renunciation of Christianity. Most of the guests complied, but three Catholic soldiers refused.St. Domingo Nicolas Dat Dinh One of the Vietnamese Martyrs, Augustin Huy, is reported by some sources to have been sawed in two.Sadler (1858), p.356 Pachtler (1861), p.353 Others report that he was hacked to death,Inderbitzi (1840), p.548\\" Hahn (1860), p.120-21 or cut in two.Inst.

The Chinese overcame this problem by securing the victim in an upright position between two boards firmly fixed between stakes driven deep into the ground. Two executioners, one at each end of the saw, would saw downwards through the stabilized boards and enclosed victim.Abbott (2004) Whether sawing as an execution method actually existed, or that cases referred to are garbled accounts of the \\"slow slicing\\" method of execution will remain an open question. ;Tang dynasty The emperor Zhaozong of Tang (r. 888‚Äì904) is said to have commanded one of his prisoners sawn asunder.Bridgman (1841), p.141 ;Qing dynasty When the last emperor of the Ming dynasty committed suicide in 1644, the new emperor had one of the previous regime's strongest supporters, Chen, said to be viceroy of Canton, sawn in two.

The crushing of the revolt was extremely bloody, and at Almer√≠a 1569, the historian Luis del Marmol Carvajal states that one Morisco was sawn apart alive.de Ferreras (1760), p.89 ;La Mancha rebellion In the Spanish rebellion of 1808 against the occupying French forces, reports exist that some French officers were sawn in two. In one of those reports, it is colonel Rene (or FreneNapier (1862), p.88) who met this fate.Napier (1839), p.73 In another report, Rene was merely thrown into a kettle of boiling water, whereas the officers Caynier and Vaugien were the ones sawn in two.Foy (1827), p.192 =Russia= ;1812 the Grande Arm√©e After the Fire of Moscow in September 1812, the French Grande Arm√©e had not exactly endeared itself to the local population.

In addition, the \\"wild Cossacks\\" lurked about, and both groups of Russians could be a deadly enemy to solitary French soldiers. Some of those unfortunates are said to have been sawn apart.Heyne (1840)p.386 =Hungary= ;1848 Revolution The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 was a bitter struggle where different ethnicities and people of different religious persuasions committed atrocities against others.

The custom consisted of the boys running about to find the \\"oldest woman in the village\\", and then make a wooden effigy in her likeness. Then, the wooden figure was sawn across the middle.

It was highly regarded in the Middle Ages. This profusely illustrated manuscript was produced in the 13th century. Encyclopedism is an outlook that aims to include a wide range of knowledge in a single work. The term covers both encyclopedias themselves and related genres in which comprehensiveness is a notable feature. The word encyclopedia is a Latinization of the Greek enk√Ωklios paide√≠a, which means all-around education.\\"encyclopedia,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2013. The encyclopedia is \\"one of the few generalizing influences in a world of overspecialization. It serves to recall that knowledge has unity,\\" according to Lewis Shore, editor of Collier's Encyclopedia. It should not be \\"a miscellany, but a concentration, a clarification, and a synthesis\\", according to British writer H.G. WellsH. G. Wells, World Brain. Besides comprehensiveness, encyclopedic writing is distinguished by its lack of a specific audience or practical application. The author explains facts concisely for the benefit of a reader who will then use the information in a way that the writer does not try to anticipate. Early examples of encyclopedic writing include discussions of agriculture and craft by Roman writers such as Pliny the Elder and Varro ‚Äì discussions presumably not intended as practical advice to farmers or craftsmen.Marco Formisano, \\"Late Latin Encyclopedism: toward a new paradigm for practical knowledge,\\" in Jason K√∂nig and Gregg Wolf (eds.), Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 197‚Äì218: \\"Roman encyclopaedism and practical knowledge\\", pp. 199-204. . The vast majority of classical learning was lost during the Dark Ages. This enhanced the status of encyclopedic works which survived, including those of Aristotle and Pliny. With the development of printing in the 15th century, the range of knowledge available to readers expanded greatly. Encyclopedic writing became both a practical necessity and a clearly distinguished genre. Renaissance encyclopedists were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost. They hoped to recover and record knowledge and were anxious to prevent further loss.Blair, Ann, \\"Revisiting Renaissance Encyclopedism,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 381-382. . In their modern form, encyclopedias consist of alphabetized articles written by teams of specialists. This format was developed in the 18th century by expanding the technical dictionary to include non-technical topics. The Encyclop√©die (1751‚Äì1772), edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was a model for many later works. Like Renaissance encyclopedists, Diderot worried about the possible destruction of civilization and selected knowledge he hoped would survive.\\"Encyclopedists\\", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Etymology In 1517, Bavarian Johannes Aventinus wrote the first book that used the word \\"encyclopedia\\" in the title. The word \\"encyclopedia\\" is a Latinization of the Greek enk√Ωklios paide√≠a. The Greek phrase refers to the education that a well- round student should receive. Latin writer Quintilian uses it to refer to the subjects a student of oratory should be familiar with before beginning an apprenticeship.Quintilian, The Orator's Education, 1.10.1: ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±ŒΩ vocant. It translates literally as \\"in (en) the circle (k√Ωklios) of knowledge (paide√≠a).\\" The earliest citation for \\"encyclopedia\\" given in Oxford English Dictionary refers to the Greek curriculum and is dated 1531.\\"Encyclopedia\\", Oxford English Dictionary, From The Book of the Governor by Thomas Elyot (i. xiii): \\"The circle of doctrine is in one worde of greke Encyclopedia.\\" The use of the term to refer to a genre of literature was prompted by a line that Pliny used in the preface of Natural History: \\"My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks include in the Encyclop√¶dia [tƒìÃÇs enkykl√≠ou paide√≠as], which, however, are either not generally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious conceits.\\"Pliny the Elder, Natural History, preface 14: ante omnia attingenda quae graeci œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œÖŒ∫ŒªŒØŒøœÖ œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ vocant.

Some printers substituted encyclop√¶dia or another Latin phrase. Others just left a blank space.A Venice incunabulum printed in 1469 has a blank space in the middle of second page where this phrase is supposed to be. This led to the misunderstanding that Pliny had called his work an encyclopedia.Jason K√∂nig and Gregg Wolf, \\"Introduction\\", to Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 1 In the Renaissance, writers who wanted their work compared to that of Pliny used the word. In 1517, Bavarian Johannes Aventinus wrote Encyclopedia orbisqve doctrinarum, a Latin reference work.Aventinus, Johannes, Encyclopedia orbisqve doctrinarum : hoc est omniu[m] artiu[m]m, scientiaru[m], ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio scriptores earundem rerum ... ; ex Platone Aristotele, Auguste : Miller, 1517. (WorldCat entry) Ringelberg's Cyclopedia was published in 1541 and Paul Scalich's Encyclopedia in 1559.Ringelberg, Joachim Fortius, Lucubrationes, vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia, 1541. Scalich, Paul, Pauli Scalichii Encyclopaediae, sen Orbis disciplinarum epistemon (Paul Scalich's Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines), Basel, 1559. Both of these reference works were written in Latin.Markey, Morris, \\"The Encyclopedists\\", The Atlantic, Feb. 1868. The French Encyclop√©distes popularized the word in the 18th century. The Oxford English Dictionary's first citation of \\"enyclopedism\\" is dated 1833. The context is a book on Diderot.1833 Carlyle, Diderot, Misc. V. 45 \\"This exaggerated laudation of Encyclopedism.\\" History In the 4th century BC, Aristotle wrote on a broad range of topics and explained how knowledge can be classified. =Aristotle= The Greek writer and teacher Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) had much to say on a broad range of subjects, including biology, anatomy, psychology, physics, meteorology, zoology, poetics, rhetoric, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political thought. He was among the first writers to describe how to classify material by subject, the first step in writing an encyclopedia. Aristotle wrote to help his students follow his teaching, so his corpus did not much resemble an encyclopedia during his lifetime. Long after his death, commentators filled in the gaps, reordered his works, and put his writing in a systematic form. Catalogs of his work were produced by Andronicus in the first century and by Ptolemy in the second century. As Aristotle's corpus was one of the few encyclopedic works to survive the Middle Ages, it became a widely used reference work in late medieval and Renaissance times.Jason K√∂nig and Gregg Wolf, \\"Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 27‚Äì28. . =Alexandria= Dorotheus (mid first century AD) and Pamphilus (late first century AD) both wrote enormous lexicons. Neither work has survived, but their lengths suggest that they were considerably more than just dictionaries. Pamphilus's work was 95 books long and was a sequel to a lexicon of four books by Zopyrion. This passage from the Souda suggests that it was made up of alphabetized entries:Hatzimichali, Myrto, \\"Encyclopedism in the Alexandrian Library,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 197‚Äì218. . Hesychius (fifth century) credits Diogenianus as a source,Barnes, Jonathan, Mantissa (2015), p. 282. \\"Plainly, Diogenianus was an important source for Hesychius.\\" who in turn used Pamphilus.Francesca Schironi, From Alexandria to Babylon: Near Eastern Languages and Hellenistic Erudition in the Oxyrhynchus Glossary (P.Oxy. 1802 + 4812) (2009), p. 49. \\"From this scholium it become clear that Diogenianus did not excerpt directly from Pamphilus, but rather from Vestinus. So we have the chain Pamphilus-Vestinus-Diogenianus-Hesychius.\\" This is the only form in which any of Pamphilus's work may have survived. =Rome= A Roman who wanted to learn about a certain subject would a send a slave to a private library with orders to copy relevant passages from whatever books were available. As they were less likely to withdraw or buy a book, readers were little concerned with the scope of a given work. So the emergence of encyclopedic writing cannot be explained by practical need. Instead, it may have been inspired by Cato's ideal of the vir bonus, the informed citizen able to participate in the life of the Republic.Formisano, p. 200. Three Roman works are commonly identified as encyclopedic: The collected works of Varro (116‚Äì27 BC), Pliny the Elder's (c. 77‚Äì79 AD) Natural History, and On the Arts by Cornelius Celsus (c. 25 BC ‚Äì c. 50 AD). These three were grouped together as a genre, not by the Romans themselves, but by later writers in search of antique precedent.Jason K√∂nig and Gregg Wolf, \\"Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 23‚Äì63. . In Cicero's time, the study of literature was still controversial. In Pro Archia, Cicero explains that he studied literature to improve his rhetorical skills and because it provides a source of elevating moral examples. Varro's emphasis on the city's history and culture suggests patriotic motives. Pliny emphasized utilitarian motives and public service. He criticized Livy for writing history simply for his own pleasure.Beagon, Mary, \\"Labores pro bono publico the burdensome mission of Pliny's Natural History,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 92. . Varro Varro's Antiquities consisted of 41 books on Roman history. His Disciplines was nine books on liberal arts. Varro also wrote 25 books on Latin and 15 on law. Only fragments of Varro's work survive. According to Cicero, Varro's comprehensive work allowed the Romans to feel at home in their own city.Cicero, Academica Posteriora 1.9 Cornelius Celsus Cornelius Celsus wrote prolifically on various topics in first century Rome. He knew \\"all things,\\" according to a tribute by Quintilian. Only his work on medicine survives. Celsus wrote prolifically on many subjects. \\"Cornelius Celsus, a man of modest intellect, could write not only about all these arts but also left behind accounts of military science, agriculture, and medicine: indeed, he deserves, on the basis on this design alone, to be thought to have known all things,\\" according to Quintilian.Quintilian, The Orator's Education, 12.11.23-4 Only the medical section of his massive On the Arts has survived. This is eight books long. Celsus followed the structure of the medical writers that had gone before him. He summarized their views in a workmanlike manner. He seldom presented insights of his own. He struggled to manage the overwhelming quantity of relevant source material.Jason K√∂nig and Gregg Wolf, \\"Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire, \\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 39-40. . His medical books were rediscovered in 1426-1427 at libraries in the Vatican and in Florence and published in 1478. He is our main source concerning Roman medical practices.\\"The Oldest Western Medical Document after the Hippocratic Writings, and How it Survived the Middle Ages\\", Jeremy Norman's History of Information. Pliny the Elder If Varro made the Romans feel at home their own city, Pliny tried to do the same for the natural world and for the Empire. Pliny's approach was very different than that of Celsus. He was a man ahead of his time. Not content to build on what went before, he reorganized the world of knowledge to fit his encyclopedic vision. In a Latin preface, the writer customarily listed the models he hoped to surpass. Pliny found no model in previous writing. Instead, he emphasized that his work was novicium (new), a word suitable for describing a major discovery. Although Pliny was widely read, no later Roman writer followed his structure or claimed him as a model. Niccol√≤ Leoniceno published an essay in 1492 listing Pliny's many scientific errors.\\"Pliny the Elder\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2013. In the introduction of Natural History, Pliny writes: > ... in Thirty-six Books I have comprised 20,000 Things that are worthy of > Consideration, and these I have collected out of about 2000 Volumes that I > have diligently read (and of which there are few that Men otherwise learned > have ventured to meddle with, for the deep Matter therein contained), and > those written by one hundred several excellent Authors; besides a Multitude > of other Matters, which either were unknown to our former Writers, or > Experience has lately ascertained.Pliny. (1847). Pliny's Natural History. In > thirty-seven books (P. Holland, Trans.). London. With an entire book dedicated to listing sources, Natural History is 37 books long. (It's 10 volumes in the modern translation.Pliny, the Elder.; H Rackham, Natural History, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1938-1963.) Eschewing established disciplines and categories, Pliny begins with a general description of the world. Book 2 covers astronomy, meteorology, and the elements. Books 3‚Äì6 cover geography. Humanity is covered in Book 7, animals in Books 8‚Äì11, trees in 12‚Äì17, agriculture in 18‚Äì19, medicine in 20‚Äì32, metals in 33‚Äì34, and craft and art in 35‚Äì37. Following Aristotle, Pliny counts four elements: fire, earth, air and water.Natural History II:10 There are seven planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars (\\"of a fiery and burning nature\\"), the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon (\\"the last of the stars\\").Natural History II:28-51 The earth is a \\"perfect globe,\\" suspended in the middle of space, that rotates with incredible swiftness once every 24 hours.Natural History II:5-6, 8, 10. As a good Stoic, Pliny dismisses astrology: \\"it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs.\\"Natural History II:38. He considers the possibility of other worlds (\\"there will be so many suns and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense trains of other heavenly bodies\\") only to dismiss such speculation as \\"madness.\\" The idea of space travel is \\"perfect madness.\\"Natural History, II:6. Pliny had opinions on a wide variety of subjects often interjected them. He tells us which uses of plants, animals, and stone are proper, and which ones are improper. Was the Roman Empire benefiting or corrupting the classical world? Pliny returns to this theme repeatedly. He analogizes Rome's civilizing mission to the way poisonous plants of all nation were tamed into medicines.Molly Ayn Jones-Lewis, \\"Poison: Nature's Argument for the Roman Empire in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia\\", Classical World, Volume 106, Number 1, Fall 2012, pp. 51‚Äì74, 10.1353/clw.2013.0013 Pliny also wants us to know that he is a heroic explorer, a genius responsible for a highly original and most remarkable work. The extensive reading and note taking of his slave secretaries is rarely mentioned. At the very end of the work, Pliny writes, \\"Hail Nature, parent of all things, and in recognition of the fact that I alone have praised you in all your manifestations, look favorably upon me.\\"Pliny, 37.205. Here Pliny points to comprehensiveness as his project's outstanding asset. Nature awarded Pliny a heroic death that gave him \\"a kind of eternal life,\\" according to his nephew. The great encyclopedist was commander of the Naples fleet and died trying to assist the local inhabitants during the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.Pliny the Younger, \\"Mt Vesuvius Eruption 79 AD\\" =The Middle Ages= Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1190 ‚Äì 1264?) was one of the best-known encyclopedists of the medieval period. This illustration is from a 15th-century French translation of his work. While classical and modern encyclopedic writers sought to distribute knowledge, those of the Middle Ages were more interested in establishing orthodoxy. They produced works to be used as educational texts in schools and universities. Students could consider the knowledge within them as safely orthodox and thus be kept from heresy. Limiting knowledge was an important part of their function.Keen, Elizabeth, \\"Shifting Horizons: The Medieval Compilation of Knowledge as Mirror of a Changing World,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 278. . As a Stoic, Pliny began with astronomy and ended with the fine arts. Cassiodorus attempted to write a Christian equivalent to Pliny's work. His Institutiones (560) begins with discussions of scripture and the church. Other subjects are treated briefly toward the end of the work. With onset of the Dark Ages, access to Greek learning and literacy in Greek declined. The works of Boethius (c. 480‚Äì524) filled the gap by compiling Greek handbooks and summarizing their content in Latin. These works served as general purpose references in the early Middle Ages. The Etymologies (c. 600‚Äì625) by Isidore of Seville consisted of extracts from earlier writers. Three of the Isidore's twenty books represent material from Pliny. Isidore was the most widely read and fundamental text in terms of medieval encyclopedic writing.Keen, p. 277. These early medieval writers organized their material in the form of a trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) followed by a quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music). This division of seven liberal arts was a feature of monastic education as well as the medieval universities, which developed beginning in the 12th century. From the fourth to the ninth centuries, Byzantium experienced a series of religious debates. As part of these debates, excerpts were compiled and organized thematically to support the theological views of the compiler. Once orthodoxy was established, the energy of the compilation tradition transferred to other subjects. The tenth century, or Macedonian dynasty, saw a flowering of encyclopedic writing. The Suda is believed to have been compiled at this time. This is the earliest work that a modern reader would recognize as an encyclopedia. It contains 30,000 alphabetized entries. The Suda is not mentioned until the 12th century, and it might have been put together in stages.Magdalino, Paul, \\"Byzantine encyclopaedism of the ninth and tenth centuries,\\" Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 221. . The most massive encyclopedia of the Middle Ages was Speculum Maius (The Great Mirror) by Vincent of Beauvais. It was 80 books long and was completed in 1244. With a total of 4.5 million words, the work is presumably the product of an anonymous team.Blair, p. 387. (By comparison, the current edition of Britannica has 44 million words.\\"\\"44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet,\\" New York Times, February 8, 1994.) It was divided into three sections. \\"Naturale\\" covered God and the natural world; \\"Doctrinale\\" covered language, ethics, crafts, medicine; and \\"Historiale\\" covered world history. Vincent had great respect for classical writers such Aristotle, Cicero, and Hippocrates. The encyclopedia shows a tendency toward \\"exhaustiveness,\\" or systemic plagiarism, typical of the medieval period.\\"Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum historiale,\\" Medieval Primary Sources Vincent was used as a source by Chaucer. The full version of Speculum proved to be too long to circulate in the era of manuscripts and manual copying. However, an abridged version by Bartholomeus Anglicus did enjoy a wide readership.Blair, pp. 388-389. The Arab counterpart to these works was Kitab al-Fehrest by Ibn al-Nadim. =Renaissance= With the advent of printing and a dramatic reduction in paper costs, the volume of encyclopedic writing exploded in the Renaissance. This was an age of \\"info-lust\\" and enormous compilations. Many compilers cited the fear of a traumatic loss of knowledge to justify their efforts. They were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost in the Dark Ages. Pliny was their model. His axiom that, \\"there is no book so bad that some good cannot be got from it\\" was a favorite. Conrad Gesner listed over 10,000 books in Bibliotheca universalis (1545). By including both Christian and barbarian works, Gesner rejected the medieval quest for orthodoxy. Ironically, Jesuit Antonio Possevino used Bibliotheca universalis as a basis to create a list of forbidden books.Blair, p. 383. England The invention of printing helped spread new ideas, but also revived old misconceptions. Printers of incunabulia were eager to publish books, both ancient and modern. The best- known encyclopedia of Elizabethan England was Batman upon Bartholomew, published in 1582. This book is based on a work compiled by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the 13th century. It was translated by John Trevisa in 1398, revised by Thomas Berthelet in 1535, and revised again by Stephen Batman. In Shakespeare's day, it represented a worldview already four centuries old, only modestly updated. Yet several ideas inspired by Batman can be found in Shakespeare. The idea that the rays of the moon cause madness can be found Measure for MeasureShakespeare, Measure for Measure, 3.1.23-5 and Othello,Shakespeare, Othello, 5.2.107-9. hence the word \\"lunacy.\\" The discussion of the geometric properties of the soul in King Lear is likely to reflect the influence of Batman as well.Shakespeare, King Lear 1.1.73 An encyclopedia that Shakespeare consulted more obviously than Batman is French Academy by Pierre de la Primaudaye. Primaudaye was much taken with analogies, some of which have found their way into Shakespeare: the unweeded garden, death as an unknown country, and the world as a stage. (Various other sources have also been suggested for the last analogy.) Both Batman and Primaudaye were Protestant.Rhodes, Neil, \\"Shakespeare's Encyclopedias\\", Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 414‚Äì443. . Francis Bacon wrote a plan for an encyclopedia in Instauratio magna (1620). He drew up a checklist of the major areas of knowledge a complete encyclopedia needed to contain. Bacon's plan influenced Diderot and thus indirectly later encyclopedias, which generally follow Diderot's scheme. =The Enlightenment= Encyclop√©die (1751‚Äì1777), edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was greatly admired and a model for many subsequent works. While ancient and medieval encyclopedism emphasized the classics, liberal arts, informed citizenship, or law, the modern encyclopedia springs from a separate tradition. The advance of technology meant that there was much unfamiliar terminology to explain. John Harris's Lexicon Technicum (1704) proclaims itself, \\"An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.\\" This was the first alphabetical encyclopedia written in English. Harris's work inspired Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopedia (1728). Chambers's two-volume work is considered the first modern encyclopedia. Encyclop√©die (1751‚Äì1777) was a massively expanded version of Chambers's idea. This 32-volume work, edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was the pride of Enlightenment France. It consisted of 21 volumes of text and 11 volumes of illustrations.\\"About this project\\", The Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert There were 74,000 articles written by more than 130 contributors. It presented a secular worldview, drawing the ire of several Church officials. It sought to empower its readers with knowledge and played a role in fomenting the dissent that led to the French Revolution. Diderot explained the project this way: > This is a work that cannot be completed except by a society of men of > letters and skilled workmen, each working separately on his own part, but > all bound together solely by their zeal for the best interests of the human > race and a feeling of mutual good will.The Encyclopedia of Diderot and > D'Alembert This realization that no one person, not even a genius like Pliny assisted by slave secretaries, could produce a work of the comprehensiveness required, is the mark of the modern era of encyclopedism. Diderot's project was a great success and inspired several similar projects, including Britain's Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (first edition, 1768) as well as Germany's Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die (beginning 1808). Enlightenment encyclopedias also inspired authors and editors to undertake or critique \\"encyclopedic\\" knowledge projects in other genres and formats: the 65-volume Universal History (Sale et al) (1747-1768), for example, far exceeded its predecessors in terms of scope, and The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences (1755-1765) published by Benjamin Martin (lexicographer) sought to bring encyclopedism to the monthly periodical. A loyal subscriber, he wrote, would ‚Äúbe allowed to make a great Proficiency, if he can make himself Master of the useful Arts and Sciences in the Compass of Ten Years.‚Äù In Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759-1767), the title character satirically refers to his fictional autobiography as a ‚Äúcyclop√¶dia of arts and sciences.\\" Such \\"experiments in encyclopedism\\" demonstrate the widespread literary and cultural influence of the form in the 18th century. =The 19th and 20th centuries= Once solely for society's elites, in the 19th and 20th centuries encyclopedias were increasingly written, marketed to, and purchased by middle and working class households. Different styles of encyclopedism emerged which would target particular age groups, presenting the works as educational tools‚Äîeven made available through payment plans advertised on TV. One of the earliest individuals to advocate for a technologically enhanced encyclopedia indexing all the world's information was H. G. Wells. Inspired by the possibilities of microfilm, he put forward his idea of a global encyclopedia in the 1930s through a series of international talks and his essay World Brain. It would be another several decades before the earliest electronic encyclopedias were published in the 1980s and 1990s. The production of electronic encyclopedias began as conversions of printed work, but soon added multimedia elements, requiring new methods of content gathering and presentation. Early applications of hypertext similarly had a great benefit to readers but did not require significant changes in writing. The launching of Wikipedia in the 2000s and its subsequent rise in popularity and influence, however, radically altered popular conception of the ways in which an encyclopedia is produced (collaboratively, openly) and consumed (ubiquitously). =China= The nearest Chinese equivalent to an encyclopedia is the leishu. These consist of extensive quotations arranged by category. The earliest known Chinese encyclopedia is Huang Lan (Emperor's mirror), produced around 220 under the Wei dynasty. No copy has survived.Zurndorfer, Harriet T., \\"The passion to collect, select, and protect: fifteen hundred years of the Chinese encyclopedia,\\" in Jason K√∂nig, Greg Woolf (eds.), Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 505-528. The best-known leishu are those of Li Fang (925‚Äì996), who wrote three such works during the Song dynasty. These three were later combined with a fourth work, Cefu Yuangui, to create Four Great Books of Song.Zurndorfer, pp. 510-511. References External links *Pliny the Elder, The Natural History.

In geometry, the cross- ratio, also called the double ratio and anharmonic ratio, is a number associated with a list of four collinear points, particularly points on a projective line. Given four points A, B, C and D on a line, their cross ratio is defined as : (A,B;C,D) = \\\\frac {AC\\\\cdot BD}{BC\\\\cdot AD} where an orientation of the line determines the sign of each distance and the distance is measured as projected into Euclidean space. (If one of the four points is the line's point at infinity, then the two distances involving that point are dropped from the formula.) The point D is the harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B precisely if the cross-ratio of the quadruple is ‚àí1, called the harmonic ratio. The cross-ratio can therefore be regarded as measuring the quadruple's deviation from this ratio; hence the name anharmonic ratio. The cross-ratio is preserved by linear fractional transformations. It is essentially the only projective invariant of a quadruple of collinear points; this underlies its importance for projective geometry. The cross-ratio had been defined in deep antiquity, possibly already by Euclid, and was considered by Pappus, who noted its key invariance property. It was extensively studied in the 19th century.A theorem on the anharmonic ratio of lines appeared in the work of Pappus, but Michel Chasles, who devoted considerable efforts to reconstructing lost works of Euclid, asserted that it had earlier appeared in his book Porisms. Variants of this concept exist for a quadruple of concurrent lines on the projective plane and a quadruple of points on the Riemann sphere. In the Cayley‚ÄìKlein model of hyperbolic geometry, the distance between points is expressed in terms of a certain cross-ratio. Terminology and history D is the harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B, so that the cross- ratio equals ‚àí1. Pappus of Alexandria made implicit use of concepts equivalent to the cross-ratio in his Collection: Book VII. Early users of Pappus included Isaac Newton, Michel Chasles, and Robert Simson. In 1986 Alexander Jones made a translation of the original by Pappus, then wrote a commentary on how the lemmas of Pappus relate to modern terminology.Alexander Jones (1986) Book 7 of the Collection, part 1: introduction, text, translation , part 2: commentary, index, figures , Springer-Verlag Modern use of the cross ratio in projective geometry began with Lazare Carnot in 1803 with his book G√©om√©trie de Position. The term used was le rapport anharmonique (Fr: anharmonic ratio). German geometers call it das Doppelverh√§ltnis (Ger: double ratio). Given three points on a line, a fourth point that makes the cross ratio equal to minus one is called the projective harmonic conjugate. In 1847 Carl von Staudt called the construction of the fourth point a throw (Wurf), and used the construction to exhibit arithmetic implicit in geometry. His Algebra of Throws provides an approach to numerical propositions, usually taken as axioms, but proven in projective geometry.Howard Eves (1972) A Survey of Geometry, Revised Edition, page 73, Allyn and Bacon The English term \\"cross-ratio\\" was introduced in 1878 by William Kingdon Clifford.W.K. Clifford (1878) Elements of Dynamic, books I,II,III, page 42, London: MacMillan & Co; on-line presentation by Cornell University Historical Mathematical Monographs. Definition The cross-ratio of a quadruple of distinct points on the real line with coordinates z1, z2, z3, z4 is given by :(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \\\\frac{(z_3-z_1)(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-z_1)}. It can also be written as a \\"double ratio\\" of two division ratios of triples of points: :(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \\\\frac{z_3-z_1}{z_3-z_2}:\\\\frac{z_4-z_1}{z_4-z_2}. The cross-ratio is normally extended to the case when one of z1, z2, z3, z4 is infinity (\\\\infty); this is done by removing the corresponding two differences from the formula. For example: if z_1 = \\\\infty the cross ratio becomes: :(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4) = \\\\frac{(z_3-\\\\infty)(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-\\\\infty)}=\\\\frac{(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)} . In geometry, if A, B, C and D are collinear points, then the cross ratio is defined similarly as :(A,B;C,D) = \\\\frac {AC\\\\cdot BD}{BC\\\\cdot AD} , where each of the distances is signed according to a consistent orientation of the line. The same formulas can be applied to four different complex numbers or, more generally, to elements of any field and can also be extended to the case when one of them is the symbol ‚àû, by removing the corresponding two differences from the formula. The formula shows that cross-ratio is a function of four points, generally four numbers z_1, \\\\ z_2, \\\\ z_3, \\\\ z_4 taken from a field. Properties The cross ratio of the four collinear points A, B, C, D can be written as :(A,B;C,D) = \\\\frac {AC}{CB}:\\\\frac {AD}{DB} where \\\\frac {AC}{CB} describes the ratio with which the point C divides the line segment AB, and \\\\frac {AD}{DB} describes the ratio with which the point D divides that same line segment. The cross ratio then appears as a ratio of ratios, describing how the two points C, D are situated with respect to the line segment AB. As long as the points A, B, C and D are distinct, the cross ratio (A, B; C, D) will be a non-zero real number.

Thus, four points can have only six different cross-ratios, which are related as: : \\\\begin{align} & (A,B;C,D) = (B,A;D,C) = (C,D;A,B) = (D,C;B,A) = \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & (A,B;D,C) = (B,A;C,D) = (C,D;B,A) = (D,C;A,B) = \\\\frac 1 \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & (A,C;B,D) = (B,D;A,C) = (C,A;D,B) = (D,B;C,A) = 1-\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & (A,C;D,B) = (B,D;C,A) = (C,A;B,D) = (D,B;A,C) = \\\\frac 1 {1-\\\\lambda} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & (A,D;B,C) = (B,C;A,D) = (C,B;D,A) = (D,A;C,B) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda-1} \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & (A,D;C,B) = (B,C;D,A) = (C,B;A,D) = (D,A;B,C) = \\\\frac \\\\lambda {\\\\lambda-1} \\\\end{align} Projective geometry The cross-ratio is a projective invariant in the sense that it is preserved by the projective transformations of a projective line. In particular, if four points lie on a straight line L in R2 then their cross-ratio is a well-defined quantity, because any choice of the origin and even of the scale on the line will yield the same value of the cross-ratio. Furthermore, let be four distinct lines in the plane passing through the same point Q. Then any line L not passing through Q intersects these lines in four distinct points Pi (if L is parallel to Li then the corresponding intersection point is \\"at infinity\\"). It turns out that the cross-ratio of these points (taken in a fixed order) does not depend on the choice of a line L, and hence it is an invariant of the 4-tuple of lines {Li}. This can be understood as follows: if L and L‚Ä≤ are two lines not passing through Q then the perspective transformation from L to L‚Ä≤ with the center Q is a projective transformation that takes the quadruple {Pi} of points on L into the quadruple {Pi‚Ä≤} of points on L‚Ä≤. Therefore, the invariance of the cross-ratio under projective automorphisms of the line implies (in fact, is equivalent to) the independence of the cross-ratio of the four collinear points {Pi} on the lines {Li} from the choice of the line that contains them. Definition in homogeneous coordinates If four collinear points are represented in homogeneous coordinates by vectors a, b, c, d such that and , then their cross-ratio is k. Role in non-Euclidean geometry Arthur Cayley and Felix Klein found an application of the cross-ratio to non- Euclidean geometry. Given a nonsingular conic C in the real projective plane, its stabilizer GC in the projective group acts transitively on the points in the interior of C. However, there is an invariant for the action of GC on pairs of points. In fact, every such invariant is expressible as a function of the appropriate cross ratio. =Hyperbolic geometry= Explicitly, let the conic be the unit circle. For any two points P, Q, inside the unit circle . If the line connecting them intersects the circle in two points, X and Y and the points are, in order, . Then the hyperbolic distance between P and Q in the Cayley‚ÄìKlein model of the hyperbolic plane can be expressed as : d_h(P,Q)=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{XQPY}{XPQY}\\\\right ) \\\\right (the factor one half is needed to make the curvature ‚àí1). Since the cross-ratio is invariant under projective transformations, it follows that the hyperbolic distance is invariant under the projective transformations that preserve the conic C. Conversely, the group G acts transitively on the set of pairs of points in the unit disk at a fixed hyperbolic distance. Later, partly through the influence of Henri Poincar√©, the cross ratio of four complex numbers on a circle was used for hyperbolic metrics. Being on a circle means the four points are the image of four real points under a M√∂bius transformation, and hence the cross ratio is a real number. The Poincar√© half- plane model and Poincar√© disk model are two models of hyperbolic geometry in the complex projective line. These models are instances of Cayley‚ÄìKlein metrics.  The anharmonic group  The cross-ratio may be defined by any of these four expressions: : (A,B;C,D) = (B,A;D,C) = (C,D;A,B) = (D,C;B,A). \\\\, These differ by the following permutations of the variables: : \\\\begin{align} (A, B) (C, D) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] (A, C) (B, D) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] (A, D) (B, C) \\\\end{align} These three and the identity permutation leave the cross ratio unaltered. They make up a realization of the Klein four-group, a group of order 4 in which the order of every non-identity element is 2\\\\. Other permutations of the four variables alter the cross-ratio so that it may take any of the following six values. : \\\\begin{align} (A, B; C, D) & = \\\\lambda & (A, B; D, C) & = \\\\frac 1 \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] (A, C; D, B) & = \\\\frac 1 {1-\\\\lambda} & (A, C; B, D) & = 1-\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] (A, D; C, B) & = \\\\frac \\\\lambda {\\\\lambda-1} & (A, D; B, C) & = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda-1} \\\\lambda \\\\end{align} As functions of Œª, these form a non- abelian group of order 6 with the operation of composition of functions. This is the anharmonic group. It is a subgroup of the group of all M√∂bius transformations. The six cross-ratios listed above represent torsion elements (geometrically, elliptic transforms) of . Namely, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}, 1-\\\\lambda\\\\,, and \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda-1} are of order 2 in , with fixed points, respectively, ‚àí1, 1/2, and 2 (namely, the orbit of the harmonic cross- ratio). Meanwhile, elements \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\lambda} and \\\\frac{\\\\lambda-1}{\\\\lambda} are of order 3 in ‚Äì in (this corresponds to the subgroup A3 of even elements). Each of them fixes both values e^{\\\\pm i\\\\pi/3} of the \\"most symmetric\\" cross- ratio. The anharmonic group is generated by and . Its action on } gives an isomorphism with S3. It may also be realised as the six M√∂bius transformations mentioned, which yields a projective representation of S3 over any field (since it is defined with integer entries), and is always faithful/injective (since no two terms differ only by 1/‚àí1). Over the field with two elements, the projective line only has three points, so this representation is an isomorphism, and is the exceptional isomorphism \\\\mathrm{S}_3 \\\\approx \\\\mathrm{PGL}(2, 2). In characteristic 3, this stabilizes the point -1 = [-1:1], which corresponds to the orbit of the harmonic cross-ratio being only a single point, since 2 = 1/2 = -1. Over the field with 3 elements, the projective line has only 4 points and \\\\mathrm{S}_4 \\\\approx \\\\mathrm{PGL}(2, 3), and thus the representation is exactly the stabilizer of the harmonic cross- ratio, yielding an embedding \\\\mathrm{S}_3 \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathrm{S}_4 equals the stabilizer of the point -1. =Role of Klein four-group= In the language of group theory, the symmetric group S4 acts on the cross-ratio by permuting coordinates. The kernel of this action is isomorphic to the Klein four-group K. This group consists of 2-cycle permutations of type (AB)(CD) (in addition to the identity), which preserve the cross-ratio. The effective symmetry group is then the quotient group \\\\mathrm{S}_4/\\\\mathrm{K}, which is isomorphic to S3. =Exceptional orbits= For certain values of Œª there will be greater symmetry and therefore fewer than six possible values for the cross-ratio. These values of Œª correspond to fixed points of the action of S3 on the Riemann sphere (given by the above six functions); or, equivalently, those points with a non-trivial stabilizer in this permutation group. The first set of fixed points is However, the cross-ratio can never take on these values if the points A, B, C and D are all distinct. These values are limit values as one pair of coordinates approach each other: :(Z,B;Z,D) = (A,Z;C,Z) = 0 :(Z,Z;C,D) = (A,B;Z,Z) = 1 :(Z,B;C,Z) = (A,Z;Z,D) = \\\\infty. The second set of fixed points is This situation is what is classically called the ', and arises in projective harmonic conjugates. In the real case, there are no other exceptional orbits. In the complex case, the most symmetric cross-ratio occurs when \\\\lambda = e^{\\\\pm i\\\\pi/3}. These are then the only two values of the cross-ratio, and these are acted on according to the sign of the permutation. Transformational approach The cross-ratio is invariant under the projective transformations of the line. In the case of a complex projective line, or the Riemann sphere, these transformations are known as M√∂bius transformations. A general M√∂bius transformation has the form :f(z) = \\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\\\;,\\\\quad \\\\mbox{where } a,b,c,d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} \\\\mbox{ and } ad- bc e 0. These transformations form a group acting on the Riemann sphere, the M√∂bius group. The projective invariance of the cross-ratio means that :(f(z_1), f(z_2); f(z_3), f(z_4)) = (z_1, z_2; z_3, z_4).\\\\ The cross-ratio is real if and only if the four points are either collinear or concyclic, reflecting the fact that every M√∂bius transformation maps generalized circles to generalized circles. The action of the M√∂bius group is simply transitive on the set of triples of distinct points of the Riemann sphere: given any ordered triple of distinct points, , there is a unique M√∂bius transformation f(z) that maps it to the triple . This transformation can be conveniently described using the cross-ratio: since must equal , which in turn equals f(z), we obtain :f(z)=(z, z_2; z_3, z_4) . An alternative explanation for the invariance of the cross-ratio is based on the fact that the group of projective transformations of a line is generated by the translations, the homotheties, and the multiplicative inversion. The differences are invariant under the translations : z \\\\mapsto z + a where a is a constant in the ground field F. Furthermore, the division ratios are invariant under a homothety :z \\\\mapsto b z for a non-zero constant b in F. Therefore, the cross-ratio is invariant under the affine transformations. In order to obtain a well-defined inversion mapping :T : z \\\\mapsto z^{-1}, the affine line needs to be augmented by the point at infinity, denoted ‚àû, forming the projective line P1(F). Each affine mapping can be uniquely extended to a mapping of P1(F) into itself that fixes the point at infinity. The map T swaps 0 and ‚àû. The projective group is generated by T and the affine mappings extended to P1(F). In the case , the complex plane, this results in the M√∂bius group. Since the cross-ratio is also invariant under T, it is invariant under any projective mapping of P1(F) into itself. =Co-ordinate description= If we write the complex points as vectors \\\\overrightarrow{x}_n = [\\\\Re(z_n),\\\\Im(z_n)]^{\\\\rm T} and define x_{nm}=x_n-x_m, and let (a,b) be the dot product of a with b, then the real part of the cross ratio is given by: :: C_1 = \\\\frac{ (x_{12},x_{14}) (x_{23},x_{34}) - (x_{12},x_{34}) (x_{14},x_{23}) + (x_{12},x_{23}) (x_{14},x_{34}) } {x_{23}^2 x_{14}^2 } This is an invariant of the 2D special conformal transformation such as inversion x^\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{x^\\\\mu}{x^2} . The imaginary part must make use of the 2-dimensional cross product a\\\\times b = [a,b] = a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2 :: C_2 = \\\\frac{ (x_{12},x_{14}) [x_{34},x_{23}] - (x_{43},x_{23}) [ x_{12},x_{34} ] } {x_{23}^2 x_{14}^2 } Ring homography The concept of cross ratio only depends on the ring operations of addition, multiplication, and inversion (though inversion of a given element is not certain in a ring). One approach to cross ratio interprets it as a homography that takes three designated points to 0, 1, and infinity. Under restrictions having to do with inverses, it is possible to generate such a mapping with ring operations in the projective line over a ring. The cross ratio of four points is the evaluation of this homography at the fourth point. Differential-geometric point of view The theory takes on a differential calculus aspect as the four points are brought into proximity. This leads to the theory of the Schwarzian derivative, and more generally of projective connections. Higher-dimensional generalizations The cross-ratio does not generalize in a simple manner to higher dimensions, due to other geometric properties of configurations of points, notably collinearity ‚Äì configuration spaces are more complicated, and distinct k-tuples of points are not in general position. While the projective linear group of the projective line is 3-transitive (any three distinct points can be mapped to any other three points), and indeed simply 3-transitive (there is a unique projective map taking any triple to another triple), with the cross ratio thus being the unique projective invariant of a set of four points, there are basic geometric invariants in higher dimension. The projective linear group of n-space \\\\mathbf{P}^n=\\\\mathbf{P}(K^{n+1}) has (n + 1)2 ‚àí 1 dimensions (because it is \\\\mathrm{PGL}(n,K) = \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathrm{GL}(n+1,K)), projectivization removing one dimension), but in other dimensions the projective linear group is only 2-transitive ‚Äì because three collinear points must be mapped to three collinear points (which is not a restriction in the projective line) ‚Äì and thus there is not a \\"generalized cross ratio\\" providing the unique invariant of n2 points. Collinearity is not the only geometric property of configurations of points that must be maintained ‚Äì for example, five points determine a conic, but six general points do not lie on a conic, so whether any 6-tuple of points lies on a conic is also a projective invariant. One can study orbits of points in general position ‚Äì in the line \\"general position\\" is equivalent to being distinct, while in higher dimensions it requires geometric considerations, as discussed ‚Äì but, as the above indicates, this is more complicated and less informative. However, a generalization to Riemann surfaces of positive genus exists, using the Abel‚ÄìJacobi map and theta functions.

An example of such linear fractional transformation is the Cayley transform, which was originally defined on the 3 x 3 real matrix ring. Linear fractional transformations are widely used in various areas of mathematics and its applications to engineering, such as classical geometry, number theory (they are used, for example, in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem), group theory, control theory. General definition In general, a linear fractional transformation is a homography of P(A), the projective line over a ring A. When A is a commutative ring, then a linear fractional transformation has the familiar form :z \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{az + b} {cz + d}, where are elements of A such that is a unit of A (that is has a multiplicative inverse in A) In a non-commutative ring A, with (z,t) in A2, the units u determine an equivalence relation (z,t) \\\\sim (uz,ut) . An equivalence class in the projective line over A is written U[z,t] where the brackets denote projective coordinates. Then linear fractional transformations act on the right of an element of P(A): :U[z,t] \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{pmatrix} = U[za + tb,\\\\ zc + td] \\\\sim U[(zc + td)^{-1}(za + tb),\\\\ 1]. The ring is embedded in its projective line by z ‚Üí U[z,1], so t = 1 recovers the usual expression. This linear fractional transformation is well-defined since U[za + tb, zc + td] does not depend on which element is selected from its equivalence class for the operation. The linear fractional transformations form a group, denoted \\\\operatorname{PGL}_1(A). The group \\\\operatorname{PGL}_1(\\\\Z) of the linear fractional transformations is called the modular group. It has been widely studied because its numerous applications to number theory, which include, in particular, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Use in hyperbolic geometry In the complex plane a generalized circle is either a line or a circle. When completed with the point at infinity, the generalized circles in the plane correspond to circles on the surface of the Riemann sphere, an expression of the complex projective line. Linear fractional transformations permute these circles on the sphere, and the corresponding finite points of the generalized circles in the complex plane. To construct models of the hyperbolic plane the unit disk and the upper half-plane are used to represent the points. These subsets of the complex plane are provided a metric with the Cayley-Klein metric. Then the distance between two points is computed using the generalized circle through the points and perpendicular to the boundary of the subset used for the model. This generalized circle intersects the boundary at two other points. All four points are used in the cross ratio which defines the Cayley-Klein metric. Linear fractional transformations leave cross ratio invariant, so any linear fractional transformation that leaves the unit disk or upper half-planes stable is an isometry of the hyperbolic plane metric space. Since Henri Poincar√© explicated these models they have been named after him: the Poincar√© disk model and the Poincar√© half-plane model. Each model has a group of isometries that is a subgroup of the Mobius group: the isometry group for the disk model is SU(1, 1) where the linear fractional transformations are \\"special unitary\\", and for the upper half-plane the isometry group is PSL(2,R), a projective linear group of linear fractional transformations with real entries and determinant equal to one.C. L. Siegel (A. Shenitzer & M. Tretkoff, translators) (1971) Topics in Complex Function Theory, volume 2, Wiley-Interscience  Use in higher mathematics  M√∂bius transformations commonly appear in the theory of continued fractions, and in analytic number theory of elliptic curves and modular forms, as it describes the automorphisms of the upper half-plane under the action of the modular group. It also provides a canonical example of Hopf fibration, where the geodesic flow induced by the linear fractional transformation decomposes complex projective space into stable and unstable manifolds, with the horocycles appearing perpendicular to the geodesics. See Anosov flow for a worked example of the fibration: in this example, the geodesics are given by the fractional linear transform :\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot i\\\\exp(t) = \\\\frac{ai\\\\exp(t)+b}{ci\\\\exp(t)+d} with a, b, c and d real, with ad-bc=1. Roughly speaking, the center manifold is generated by the parabolic transformations, the unstable manifold by the hyperbolic transformations, and the stable manifold by the elliptic transformations.  Use in control theory  Linear fractional transformations are widely used in control theory to solve plant-controller relationship problems in mechanical and electrical engineering.John Doyle, Andy Packard, Kemin Zhou, \\"Review of LFTs, LMIs, and mu\\", (1991) Proceedings of the 30th Conference on Decision and Control Juan C.

Here, the 3x3 matrix components refer to the incoming, bound and outgoing states. Perhaps the simplest example application of linear fractional transformations occurs in the analysis of the damped harmonic oscillator. Another elementary application is obtaining the Frobenius normal form, i.e. the companion matrix of a polynomial. Conformal property alt=Planar rotations with complex, hyperbolic and dual numbers. The commutative rings of split-complex numbers and dual numbers join the ordinary complex numbers as rings that express angle and \\"rotation\\".

Conformality can be confirmed by showing the generators are all conformal. The translation z ‚Üí z + b is a change of origin and makes no difference to angle. To see that z ‚Üí az is conformal, consider the polar decomposition of a and z. In each case the angle of a is added to that of z resulting in a conformal map.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, and Boston Red Sox from 1984 through 1999, and a comeback in 2001. Saberhagen is a three-time All-Star, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, a Gold Glove Award winner, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1985 World Series. He led MLB in wins and earned run average in 1989, and threw a no-hitter in 1991. Early years Saberhagen was born in Chicago Heights, Illinois. His parents, Linda and Bob, divorced when he was five years old. He attended Grover Cleveland High School, located in Reseda, California. Saberhagen starred in both basketball and baseball. In 1982, during his senior year, he pitched a no-hitter and was the winning pitcher in the Los Angeles City Championship game, played at Dodger Stadium. He also played football in high school. Career Saberhagen was drafted out of high school by the Kansas City Royals in the 19th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft and made his major league debut at the age of 19 on April 4, 1984. He made an immediate impact, compiling a 10-11 record and a 3.48 ERA. The Royals made the postseason but lost to the Detroit Tigers. Saberhagen pitched well in his first postseason start, giving up two runs in eight innings. In 1985, the 21-year-old Saberhagen established himself as the ace of the staff. He went 20-6 with a 2.87 ERA and won the American League Cy Young Award. He led the Royals to a World Series championship and was named MVP of the World Series, pitching two complete games, including a shutout in Game 7. He was also the subject of much media attention during the Series as his wife gave birth to his first son, Drew William, on the same night of the infamous Don Denkinger call. Saberhagen developed an odd pattern of successful seasons in odd-numbered years (1985, 1987, 1989, 1991) and poor performances in even-numbered years. In 1986, he was 7-12 with a 4.12 ERA. In 1987, another odd-numbered year, Saberhagen had an excellent year, going 18-10 with a 3.36 ERA. That record, however, was disappointing because Saberhagen had entered the All-Star break with a 15-3 record and another Cy Young Award seemingly in the bag. He pitched in the 1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but he suffered a shoulder injury that hampered his second-half performance. In 1988, the pattern continued as Saberhagen went 14-16 for the Royals with a 3.80 ERA, the second most losses in the American League. The following year, 1989, he brought back his old brilliance by compiling a record of 23-6 with a 2.16 ERA, leading both leagues with 12 complete games, and finishing third in strikeouts. Before his July 26, 1989 start against the Boston Red Sox, Saberhagen had a record of 9-5\\\\. Over the next two months, he compiled a record of 14-1 with four shutouts. He also led the league in innings pitched, complete games, and strikeout to walk ratio. For his efforts, Saberhagen won his second Cy Young Award as the American League's best pitcher. Despite a 5-7 record, Saberhagen was selected to the 1990 American League All-Star team, primarily due to his 1989 performance. He rewarded the selection by being the winning pitcher in the 2-0 American League triumph. Saberhagen pitched only one game after the all-star break before being shelved for most of the rest of 1990 with an injury. In 1991, Saberhagen went 13-8 with a 3.07 ERA. On August 26, he no-hit the Chicago White Sox 7-0 at Royals Stadium; to date, the no-hitter is the last thrown by a Royal. On December 11, 1991, Saberhagen was traded along with Bill Pecota to the New York Mets in exchange for Kevin McReynolds, Gregg Jefferies, and Keith Miller. With the trade to the Mets, Saberhagen's odd-year, off-year pattern vanished. He struggled with injuries in 1992 and 1993, before bouncing back with a 14-4 record in a strike shortened 1994 season. That season he had more wins than walks (14 to 13). No other pitcher (as of 2005) pitching more than 150 innings had accomplished this feat since 1919. His stint with the Mets was not without controversy; on July 27, 1993, Saberhagen sprayed bleach into a group of reporters. After admitting his role in this incident, Saberhagen donated one day's pay to charity and apologized to fans and the media. In 1995, he joined the Colorado Rockies. While the Rockies made the playoffs as the National League Wild Card team, Saberhagen had a mostly-lost season, marred by injuries. He lost his only post-season start, Game 4 of the NLDS, as the Rockies were eliminated by the Braves on their way to a World Series win. Saberhagen didn't pitch at all in 1996 due to injury. His comeback with the Boston Red Sox was limited in another injury-limited 1997 season, but reached its peak in 1998, as he went 15-8 that year, winning both the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award and the Tony Conigliaro Award. He had another winning season for Boston in 1999, finishing with a 10-6 record. After missing the 2000 season, Saberhagen attempted a comeback in 2001 but pitched in only three games. He retired at the end of the season. Post-playing career In , he was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame. Saberhagen was eligible for the 2007 ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame. He stated if he were voted in, he would not attend the ceremony because he believes Pete Rose should be inducted. Saberhagen finished with 7 votes and was not eligible for next year's ballot. He was a guest on an episode of Married... with Children where he played himself while delivering pizza. In 2006, he began coaching the Calabasas High School Coyotes Varsity baseball team, in Calabasas, California. He was a primary contributor to the building of a first-class baseball field for the Varsity team there. His younger son Dalton played on the Freshman team at that time and Saberhagen's goal was to coach his son when he moved up to Varsity. However, a constant set of battles with the Las Virgines Unified School District administration‚Äîamong other reasons‚Äîcaused him to resign his coaching duties in October 2007. Before the 2008 season, Saberhagen returned as the head coach of the Calabasas varsity team. He currently resides in Thousand Oaks, California. In October 2017, Saberhagen was evacuated from a Napa hotel due to the Tubbs Fire after attending a charity golf event. Family On February 9, 2019, Saberhagen married Kandace DeAngelo, the president and CEO of a medical group and a Colorado State University graduate. Saberhagen's wife has battled breast cancer 3 times and is an advocate for other cancer survivors struggling from the negative effects of medical financial toxicity. Saberhagen was previously married to Janeane Inglett, his high school sweetheart, for less than a decade. They had 3 children together. Saberhagen's son, Drew William, played college baseball for the Western Carolina Catamounts and the Pepperdine Waves. Bret Saberhagen's Hit & Fun Bret Saberhagen at one time opened and operated a sports entertainment facility featuring Major League-caliber indoor batting cages, pitching mounds, bowling, laser tag, and arcade games. The sports center was located at 580 Montauk Highway in West Babylon, New York, near Saberhagen's Babylon, New York, estate. The facility's fa√ßade was shaped like Ebbets Field, the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and designed by Steven Ray Fellman of Amityville, New York. Other Media Saberhagen appeared as himself in the 1994 Brendan Fraser movie The Scout. In the movie, he is hired by former New York Yankees scout AL Percolo (Albert Brooks) to pitch to Al's phenom prospect Steve Nebraska (Brendan Fraser). During the 1994-95 MLB strike, Saberhagen and a handful of other striking players appeared as themselves in the November 27, 1994 episode of Married With Children (Season 9, Episode 11.)

It is situated in the Chiltern Hills, about east of Wendover, north of Chesham and from Berkhamsted. Cholesbury is one of four villages comprising Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards, a civil parish within Chiltern District. Braziers End is a hamlet which has always been closely associated with Cholesbury. It is a rural community and most local people rely for employment on neighbouring towns, the proximity of London and the availability of broadband technology. Geography At ,Acreage Vision of britain Cholesbury Cholesbury is one of the smallest villages in the county and is located within Chiltern downland landscape on the upland plateau and close to the chalk escarpment which overlooks the Aylesbury Vale. At its highest point the village is some above sea level. =Geology= The geology of the area has dictated the land use. The soil comprises gravely clay, intermixed with flints, small pebbles and √∂olite over a chalk formation. Several examples of puddingstones a characteristic form of this aggregate have been found locally. There are no streams in the area due to the porous chalk sub soil. In places the occurrence of clay close to the surface accounts for several natural ponds fed by springs. Until connection with mains water in the mid-20th century, the scarcity of water had necessitated the sinking of deep wells and capture of rainwater.The Geology of the Chilterns Author Geoff Larminie published on www.cholesbury.com =Land use= In contrast to nearby areas of the Chilterns more land is given over to open space, namely agricultural, both arable and pasture; paddocks; heathland and most significantly the Common on either side of which the majority of houses are arranged. Mature woodland is a feature, including a stand of beech trees which mark out the circumference of the hillfort. Some beech plantation remains formerly associated with the chair- making industry in High Wycombe. Both chalk and a small amount of clay have been extracted over the years. The latter as a raw material for pottery and more recently brick-making. Meanwhile, in more recent times flint was dug out for road making. Both activities have left their mark in the form of small mounds and shallow depressions. Historically, many homes had access to orchards, gardens for vegetable production and pasture for domestic animals. These have largely disappeared and over the last ten years or so the increasing popularity of horse riding has created a demand for suitable land for paddocks.Hepple & Doggett The Chilterns =Settlement= Villages in this part of the Chilterns are often set out around Greens and Commons or strung out along ridges with which they connect often without a gap to adjacent settlements. Cholesbury is consequently more closely linked in this way with the neighbouring villages of Hawridge, St Leonards and Buckland Common. The hamlet of Braziers End is closely associated with the village of Cholesbury. The name is purported to derive from braziers lit by Travellers who periodically gathered to celebrate weddings. Until 1935 Cholesbury did not have mains water and drainage did not arrive until 1963. The road down to Chesham was frequently impassable in winter and periodic flooding has occurred even in recent years. The Second World War resulted in an influx of people escaping the London Blitz and not returning afterwards. This migration had a lasting effect with more houses built or greatly enlarged or refurbished. Transport improvements enabling daily commuting to London from the 1950s onwards also led to a further change with the growth in more affluent families which irrevocably changed the composition of the village community. Concerns in the 1960s about uncontrolled housing development encouraged the establishment of resident's groups focused on preserving the village scene. Situated in the Chilterns AONB, and combined with national and local government planning controls there is strict enforcement of restrictions on residential building developments. This has led to a shortage in affordable and social housing. The scarcity of available property has added a premium onto house prices in Cholesbury (average selling price circa ¬£950k as at 2007) and neighbouring villages compared to other areas in the rest of South East England.Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards Parish Council Minutes. Retrieved from Local History Group archive History =Origins and the first settlement= The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Cealwald's burh' (or plateau camp). This name refers to the Iron Age hillfort known as Cholesbury Camp close to the centre of the village, which from investigations (Kimball 1933) is understood to have been constructed between 300 and 100BC, possibly on the site of an earlier settlement which is also supported by the find of a Bronze Age axe nearby. Despite the extent of the defences trading activity rather than military purpose was the predominant use of the fort over most of its period of occupation. There is evidence of iron smelting with several hearths and waste slag having been identified from archaeological investigations. The Roman conquest of Britain meant that the use of the hillfort was relatively short-lived. By the 2nd century it had been largely deserted as the result of a probable organised migration of labour from the hill plateau to valley where villa settlements were being established (Branigan 1967). More recent investigations (Gover 2001) have suggested from evidence of rectangular structures that there was a subsequent period of occupation during early medieval times. There have been finds indicating earlier settlement including during the 1960s, a Palaeolithic hand axe.Hay and Hay ‚Äì Hilltop Villages of the Chilterns Chap 1‚Äì2 =Development of the manor and village= St Lawrence Church In Edward the Confessor's time the land was part of the estate of Aluric, the King's thane and is only recorded in the Domesday Book as 'Chowdesbury', a part of the manor of Draiton valued at 100 shillings (¬£5). Magno le Breton who held the manor under a tenancy to one Helgist would have valued the hilltop area for its summer pasture supported by reliable springs feeding ponds. From the record of land use the area was still heavily wooded being able to sustain 200 hogs.Records of Buckinghamshire Vol1. 1858 During this period Cholesbury still would have been a small, temporary settlement. Over the next 150 years a permanent hamlet was established remaining part of the Drayton estates and a typical example of a Chiltern strip parish. In 1091 the le Breton family although retaining ownership, passed control of the land and the income to the Knights Templar who when dissolved in 1312 passed it subsequently to the Knights Hospitaller as an endowment to the Commandery of Hogshaw.17\\\\. THE COMMANDERY OF HOGSHAW, Accessed 13 April 2014 After this period Cholesbury gradually detached from Drayton Beauchamp and became a separate manor, developing into a village community indicated by the construction, within the hillfort, of an early 12th-century church dedicated to St Laurence. This is one of two churches, both incidentally called St Lawrence, to be found within hillforts in the Chilterns. The other is at West Wycombe. By the reign of Henry III around 1248 the population was large enough to warrant Cholesbury being split off as a separate manor, still controlled by the le Bretons. The church was enlarged with the adding of a porch and its importance recognised with the appointment of a resident parson by the name of Abel. Around 1330 Thomas Perot became Lord of the Manor of the estate where Parrott's Farm is today. But independence was short-lived with its association with Drayton Beauchamp being re-established in 1336 when taken control of by Mary the Dowager Countess of Norfolk. The family granted the estate to Edward II but in 1364 it was passed to Thomas Cheyne. Full independence from then manor of Drayton Beauchamp finally came in 1541 when Robert Cheyne sold the manor to Chief Justice John Baldwin. In 1618 John Baldwin sold the manor to one Thomas Stile, one of the attorneys of the Court of King's Bench. By 1650 the rights attaching to the Lord of the Manor were transferred to the Seare family who also held the manor in neighbouring Hawridge. Until the middle of the 18th century, Cholesbury continued to be just a chapelry under the administration of the parish of Drayton Beauchamp. The establishment Cholesbury as a separate ecclesiastical parish was sanctioned by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1756.Victorian County History ‚Äì Cholesbury Parish History On Line Retrieved 15 June 2009 =English Civil War= It is known that in common with many parts of the Chilterns there was much discontent with the levying of Ship Money and the oath required in support of the Protestation some of the causes of the dispute between Parliamentarians and King Charles I. As with other villages Parliamentarian troops were billeted in Cholesbury during the English Civil War and took part in skirmishes involving Prince Rupert at Chesham and Wendover. Jeston window, St Lawrence's Church =Impact of the Poor Laws= The Darell (Daryell) family had held sway in Cholesbury from 1748 until 1814 when Edward Darvell an absentee owner and Director of the Bank of England, passed it on his death to his nephew, the Rev. John Jeffreys, Rector of Barnes, Surrey. This also signalled a change in fortunes for the village. Cholesbury can claim one modest contribution to the reform of social policy in England. From the time of Elizabeth I a levy was imposed on property owners to fund poor relief in their parish. The amount collected increased significantly during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The increasingly desperate living available off the land in this part of the Chilterns from 1812 onwards meant the parish vestry was unable to raise sufficient funds to support the poor and in 1832 declared itself bankrupt. An account of the plight of the parish was recorded in the report to Parliament by the Poor Law Commission provided by the Rev. Henry Jeston. He had arrived as vicar in 1830, chaired vestry meetings and between 1832 and 1835 and eventually raised sufficient loans from neighbouring parishes and advances from landowners, including himself, to rescue the parish from its plight and put into effect measures to ensure the future financial security of the parish.Records of Buckinghamshire 1961 Volume 17, Part 1 The Vestry at Cholesbury 1829-1894 Arnold Baines, Retrieved 8 June 2013 He was mentioned in the subsequent debate which led to reform of the Poor Laws for which Herbert Spencer provided an account in his most famous book The Man Versus the State.The Man Versus the State ‚Äì Essay 2 The Coming of Slavery Herbert Spencer(1884) Retrieved 15 June 2009 The village recognised Jeston's achievements through raising a subscription for a stained-glassed window in his honour. Local economy Cholesbury stands at the crossroads of several droving routes, the Commons providing a safe place to rest their animals. In turn this regular traffic supported local trades and several alehouses over the years. By 1753 The Castle, the Maidenhead (later the Bricklayers Arms), next door to it the Queen's Head and The Slip Inn were operating for at least a period. They were able to flourish due to the boost in trade between the 18th and the early part of the 20th centuries when they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. None of these public houses has survived to the present day. Prior to the 20th century, agriculture and woodworking had been the main employment for villagers although work was often of a casual nature, supplemented by road mending and season fruit picking when orchards were commonplace. Straw plaiting was the chief occupation of women and children during most of the 19th century. The plait was sent to Luton or London. Until the Second World War agriculture had been the principle industry in the area. In Chesham work could be found in mills and boot factories. The discovery of clay deposits in the surrounding area had been a source for small-scale pottery production since the 17th century. The demand for new houses after the First World War lead to the rapid expansion of brickmaking in the area and St Brown's brickworks was opened on the site of clayfields in Shire Lane. At its height it was producing between 3‚Äì3.5m bricks per year. In 1946 another local brickmaking company Dunton's, encouraged by the Ministry of Works rented land on an adjacent site to meet the demand for post-war reconstruction and new house building. Since the Second World War some land has been progressively taken out of agricultural use although today there is still a significant area around the village given over to arable crops and sheep-grazing. Improvement to the road networks and public transport resulted in work being sought from further afield. The arrival of the railway to Chesham during the 1880s enabled travel to London and other conurbations. Today there are no significant employers remaining in the village. More recently, the 2001 census has indicated a further change with increasing numbers of professional workers taking advantage of enhanced telecommunication through availability of broadband connectivity to work from home. Demographics The census of 1801 records there were 122 inhabitants in 25 families living in 22 houses in Cholesbury. According to the subsequent censuses the population fell between 1801 and 1861 when it was 105. It remained around this level into the 20th century and in 1931 was still only 115.Population ‚Äì Vision of Britain Cholesbury As at 2001 93.5% of the local people were recorded as of White ethnic origin. Just under 80% declared they were Christians. Some 45% of people were in employment and 21%, a significantly higher proportion than elsewhere in the district, were self- employed and over 15% were retired which was slightly higher than in nearby areas. Notable people Gilbert Cannan at his Mill, 1916 Hawidge Mill (also known as Cholesbury Mill), as it strides the boundary between the two villages, became associated with members of two artists' groups, the Bloomsbury Group and the lesser known London Group around the time of the First World War. Gilbert Cannan used the mill tower as a studio and with his wife Mary Ansell frequently invited friends to stay or to rent cottages nearby. These included Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry who were having an affair and lodged next door at The Gables as did Mark Gertler who between 1915‚Äì16 painted Gilbert Cannan at his Mill depicting Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs. The black and white one had belonged to J.M. Barrie and was the inspiration for Nana in the book Peter Pan Others visiting included D.H. Lawrence, Lady Ottoline Morrell, Compton Mackenzie, Bertrand Russell, the historian G.M. Trevelyan, interior decorator Dora Carrington, Lytton Strachey. The Cannans left the mill in 1916 and it was subsequently rented by the celebrated American actress of the day, Doris Keane. John Haden Badley born 1865, a progressive educationalist and author who founded Bedales School now located in Steep, Hampshire in 1893, lived in Cholesbury after retiring in 1935, having served as headmaster for 42 years. After the death of his wife, Amy he returned to live in the grounds of the school until his death in 1967. General Robert Money after a distinguished military career during the First and Second World War lived in the village from the 1950s until his death in 1985. In the churchyard there are at several gravestones of interest. One commemorates David Newton who died in 1878, a Royal Marine who fought at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.David Newton's story Cholesbury-cum-St leonards LHG newsletter 2005 p8 Retrieved 15 June 2009 There are adjoining gravestones of two sisters Margaret Lowenfeld a pioneer of child psychology and psychotherapy who died in 1973, her sister Helena Wright known internationally for her campaigning work in birth control and family planning who died in 1982, and their cousin's wife Claire Loewenfeld who wrote books on herb gardening and nutrition and died in 1974. Landmarks and buildings Cholesbury Windmill 1998 The Manor House, where the Lord of the Manor held his court periodically between 1599 and 1607, dates back to the end of the 16th century and was once considerably larger than it is today. Many of the older houses in the village also date from around this time of expansion. Cholesbury Camp an Iron Age hillfort and scheduled monument, is the dominant feature in the landscape. It almost circular in shape and the 10 hectare site is enclosed by a double rampart or vellum, broken on its southern side by houses. Originally, a palisade, requiring wood from between 10‚Äì15,000 trees, would have topped the earthworks. Today, the extent of the fort is demarcated by a magnificent stand of mature beech trees. Associated with the fort is a pond, known locally as the 'Holy' or 'Bury' pond, which is fed by a spring, that is perpetual: it has never been known to run dry, even in the severest of droughts. The church of St Lawrence is within the hillfort's boundary. Cholesbury Common runs through the village either side of the road. Buildings of note include Cholesbury Windmill which was first built in 1863 as a smock mill but was rebuilt in the style of a tower mill in 1883. Cholesbury Village Hall, built in 1895 on land given by Frederick Butcher, a banker, from Tring and contemporary of the other banking dynasty, the Rothschild family who also lived in the area. Butcher was a staunch supporter of the Temperance movement and saw the importance of providing recreational facilities for working men as an alternative to the alehouses.The Bank of Tring Frederick Butcher and Cholesbury VH Retrieved 15 June 2009 An exterior shot of the village hall was used in the 2013 BBC television comedy Up the Women. In 1899 Henry J. Turner, J.P. bought the lordship and living at Braziers End House was the first Lord to reside in his Manor for nearly 300 years. The 'Full Moon' public house dates from the 17th century. The pub was known as the Half Moon until 1812, the Moon from then until 1883, when it took its present name. The Full Moon was the traditional meeting place for the Lord of the Manor of Hawridge to hold court, with proceedings mainly concerned with the use of the commons, especially grazing rights and enclosures.History The Full Moon, Hawridge Common, Cholesbury, Bucks, HP5 2UH, Accessed July 2012 A stone obelisk on the boundary between Hawridge and Cholesbury was erected in 1898 to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee the year before. Nearby a group of three puddingstones was assembled and dedicated in November 2012 on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Governance The manorial rights originating from the 12th century, which have continued to be held jointly with Hawridge since the 17th century no longer control village life. Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons Preservation Society manage the Commons, which is still owned by a Lord of the Manor. The church vestry has been succeeded by the parochial church council focusing on church affairs and its responsibilities for the village ceded to the parish council. Cholesbury is one of four 'Hilltop Villages', the others being Hawridge, St Leonards and Buckland Common. Prior to 1934 Cholesbury had been a separate parish and part of Aylesbury Rural District. From 1934 it came together with the other villages to form the new civil parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards and was also transferred to Amersham Rural District. As part of the 1974 Local Government reorganisation the rural district was succeeded by Chiltern District. Education Until the opening of the National School in Hawridge in 1874 education was provided in the village by a straw plaiting school also mentioned in a Select committee report of 1819. (Hay and Hay 1994) Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School in nearby Hawridge. A private nursery school is based at Cholesbury Village Hall. The catchment area secondary schools are:- Chiltern Hills Academy and Chesham Grammar School in Chesham, Dr Challoner's Grammar School for boys in Amersham and ‚Äì Dr Challoner's High School for girls in Little Chalfont. Transport Almost 95% of local residents have access to a car. Over the years the provision of buses has decreased significantly. Today a bus service runs once each way on alternative days connecting to Chesham, Tring and local villages. School buses are a valuable facility transporting children to secondary schools in Chesham and Amersham.Neighbourhood Statistics 2001 Census data Retrieved 15 June 2009 Sport and recreation The cricket club was founded in 1885 with permission from the Lord of the Manor to use the Common and continues to thrive today with the First XI playing in the Premier Division of the Morrant Chiltern League. The local area with its open views, rural lanes, commons and woodland, criss-crossed by footpaths and bridleways consequently are very popular with cyclists, walkers and horse riders.Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards Website ‚Äì Walks Retrieved 15 June 2009 The churches of Hawridge and Cholesbury jointly hold a summer f√™te on the August Bank Holiday Monday, alternatively on Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons.

It shares a joint parish council with Newton Blossomville. Extent It is bounded, on the North, by the River Great Ouse, by which this parish is separated from Lavendon and Cold Brayfield; on the East, by Newton-Blossomville; on the South, by Petsoe and Emberton; and on the West, by the latter and by Olney. Origin of name The village name comes in two parts: the former name 'Clifton' is Anglo Saxon in origin and means 'Cliff farm', referring to the village's position on a cliff on a bank of the River Ouse. The latter name 'Reynes' refers to the ancient lords of the manor of the village, whose family name this was. In the Domesday Book on 1086 Clifton Reynes was recorded as Cliftone. Buildings of note St Mary's Church, Clifton Reynes The parish church dedicated to St Mary is (unusually for a Buckinghamshire church) completely castellated: even the gables are embattled. The tower is thought to be Norman; however, the top is later probably 14th century. The majority of the building is of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and the nave is unusually tall. Features of interest include the 14th-century font and the medieval monuments of the Reynes family. These include two pairs of wooden effigies; one pair is of Ralph and Amabel de Reynes (ca. 1320‚Äì30) and the other is unidentified and slightly earlier.Betjeman, J. (ed.)

It was founded in 1872 by Hungarian linguist S√°muel Brassai, known as the \\"Last Transylvanian Polymath\\". Its director in 1905 was Alad√°r Richter, then P√°ter B√©la, Gy≈ërffy Istv√°n, and then, in 1920, it was taken over by the local university and by Alexandru Borza. The Japanese Garden In addition to its role as a tourist destination, the garden also serves as a teaching and research center as part of the Babe»ô-Bolyai University. In 2010, the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony categorized it as a historical monument. The garden is over 14 hectares in area, with over 10,000 plants found throughout the world. It is divided into ornamental, phytogeographic (geobotanical), systematic (taxonomical), economic, and medicinal sections. Romanian flora and vegetation are represented by plants from the Transylvanian plains, the Carpathian Mountains, Banat, etc. Among the Botanical Garden's interesting attractions are the Japanese Garden (a garden in Japanese style, with a brook and a Japanese-style house), the Roman Garden with archeological remains from the Roman colony of Napoca, among them a statue of Ceres, goddess of cereals and bread, alongside cultivated plants that dominate contemporary Romanian agriculture. Jablonovszki Elem√©rJablonovszki Elem√©r, head gardener was its head gardener for 45 years.  History  After the establishment of the first universities, the existing herb gardens beside the monasteries were subordinated to them, gradually forming the true botanical gardens where the botanical sciences with their different branches became study disciplines. Likewise is the case similar with the botanical garden of Alexandru Borza of Cluj-Napoca, and its history has been tied to the Romanian University situated in the capital of Transylvania. = Precursors = In 1872, with the founding of the Franz Josef University in Cluj, the unique botanical department was attached to a vast garden, the attachment having been orchestrated in said park by Count Mik√≥, the Ardelean National Museum. This was to be later transformed into a botanical garden. A rich collection of trees and shrubs formed the foundation and the promising beginning of a botanical garden. At the entrance of the park was a four-room building, which served as a Botanical Institute and office. The first director, Prof. Dr. A. Kanitz (1872-1896), failed to organize a solid institution. Despite the funds he disposed of having been of minimal value, he could hardly achieve either a systematically medicinal school or a small greenhouse for tropical plants. Consequently, more than three-quarters of space remained unsolved. In 1882, the Institute of Chemistry was built in the middle of the garden. Count Mik√≥'s House was transformed into a Zoological Museum, rather than being used as part of a Botanical Museum. In 1897, when the second director, Prof. Dr. J. Istv√°nffi (1897-1901) was instated, the building of the Botanical Institute was demolished, the whole garden thereby losing its original meaning despite considerable efforts to raise the garden to Western standards. Until 1901 and the instatement of the garden's third director, Prof. Dr. Alad√°r Richter, who had rich experience and modern views, the Botanical Garden was endowed with a larger greenhouse. This greenhouse was raised in the outside garden, which had been abandoned until then. At that time Prof. Dr. Alad√°r Richter was expecting a flourishing era for this cultural institution when suddenly Prof. Apathy placed her new Zoological Institute in the middle of the botanical garden. Thus, with the Institute of Chemistry and Zoology away from its botanical institute, the Botanical Garden could no longer serve the botanical sciences seriously. After many efforts, director Alad√°r Richter managed to convince the government of the need for measures to save the garden. In 1910‚Äì1912, as compensation for the museum garden, a great land for a new botanical farden was purchased. The chosen territory was corrugated and rugged, rendering it suitable for different cultures and rare landscapes. It was endowed with separate buildings for the director, staff and household. Professor Richter retired and thus did not personally handle the arrangement of this garden. For lack of funds and initiative, Gyorffy (1913-1919) also did not handle the arrangement, but rather cultivated fruits and vegetables for hospitals and housed the Hungarian refugees in 1916 during World War I. The new Romanian administration was tasked with transforming the orchard of existing fruit trees into a true botanical garden.

It is south of Amersham and north of Beaconsfield. History The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Coll's hill', though it has only been known by this name since the early 16th century. Previously it was known as 'Stoke'. The change of name occurred at about the same time as the village was transferred from Hertfordshire to Buckinghamshire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. From 1919‚Äì1939, the village was home to the Coleshill Convalescent Home, officially opened on 27 June 1919 by Lady Portman.

The hamlet's name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'farm where saffron grows'. Queen Edith, the wife of king Edward the Confessor, had a hunting lodge in the small area between Mentmore and Crafton known as Berrystead. The remains of the Lodge, converted in the 15th century to a farmhouse, were demolished when Mentmore Towers was under construction in the mid 19th century. The hamlet while in the ecclesiastic parish of Wing, is nearer to Wingrave. It is however under the jurisdiction the parish council of Mentmore. There are two 16th century farmhouses, one of which (known as Hellesthorpe) has the unusual distinction of having a Crafton postal address, but is in the parish of Wingrave. Many residents of the hamlet are equally confused by their parish's whereabouts, most have chosen to worship and be buried at Mentmore, the village most socially connected to Crafton. Crafton once had a small Methodist chapel; this is now a private house. The remainder of the settlement comprises small terraced 18th century cottages. However the hamlet was substantially rebuilt after the 1850s when it became part of the Mentmore estate of Baron Mayer de Rothschild. In addition to building some cottages the Baron built his famed Crafton Stud farm in the hamlet. In the short space of ten years following its creation the stud farm bred two Epsom Derby winners for the Baron. These were Ladas and Sir Visto. One of the most attractive buildings in the hamlet is Keeper's Cottage, originally the home of the head game-keeper it also served as the lodge to the Crafton drive of Mentmore Towers. This drive long overgrown is now part of one of the fairways of Mentmore Golf Club. The hamlet is reached only by one small cul-de-sac road. It contains no public house or shop.

As a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, he was instrumental in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria for which he earned the nickname \\"Lawrence of Manchuria,\\" a reference to Lawrence of Arabia. However, according to Jamie Bisher, the flattering sobriquet was rather misapplied, as that Colonel T.E. Lawrence had fought to liberate, not to oppress people. As a leading intelligence officer, he played a key role to the Japanese machinations that led to the occupation of large parts of China, the destabilization of the country, and the disintegration of the traditional structure of Chinese society to diminish reaction to the Japanese plans by using highly-unconventional methods. He became the mastermind of the Manchurian drug trade and the real boss and sponsor behind every kind of gang and underworld activity in China. After the end of World War II, he was prosecuted for war crimes in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was found guilty, sentenced to death, and hanged in December 1948. Early life and career Doihara in army cadet uniform, 1903 Kenji Doihara was born in Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture. He attended military preparatory schools as a youth, and graduated from the 16th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1904. He was assigned to various infantry regiments as a junior officer, and returned to school to graduate from the 24th class of the Army Staff College in 1912. Doihara longed for a high-ranking military career, but his family's low social status stood in the way. He therefore contrived to use his 15-year-old sister as a concubine for a prince, who in exchange, rewarded him with a military rank and a posting to the Japanese embassy in Beijing as assistant to the military attach√© General Hideki T≈çj≈ç.Encyclopedia of War Crimes And Genocide, p.127, Facts on File, Leslie Alan Horvitz & Christopher Catherwood, , 2006Encyclopedia of espionage, p.313, Ronald Sydney Seth, , Doubleday, 1974The Enemy Within: A History of Espionage, p.221, Terry Crowdy, Osprey Publishing, , 2008 After that, Doihara quickly rose within the ranks of the army. He spent most of his early career in various postings in northern China, except for a brief tour in 1921-1922 as part of the Japanese forces in eastern Russia during the Siberian Intervention. He was attached to IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment from 1926 to 1927 and IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment in 1927. In 1927, he was part of an official tour to China and then attached to IJA 1st Division from 1927 to 1928. He learned to speak fluent Mandarin Chinese and other Chinese dialects, and with this, he managed to take a position in military intelligence. From that post in 1928, it was he who masterminded the assassination of Zhang Zuolin, the Chinese warlord who controlled Manchuria on his way from Beijing to Shenyang ordering to blown up of his train at Shenyang. After that he was made military adviser to the Kuomintang Government until 1929. In 1930, he was promoted to colonel and commanded IJA 30th Infantry Regiment. Member of the \\"Eleven Reliable\\" clique A section of the Li«îti√°o railway where Suemori Komoto under Doihara's orders planted the bomb that triggered the Japanese invasion in Manchuria. The caption reads \\"railway fragment\\". Doihara's performance was recognized, and by 1930 he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. There, together with Hideki Tojo, Seishir≈ç Itagaki, Daisaku Komoto, Yoshio Kudo, Masakasu Matsumara and others, he became a chosen member of the \\"Eleven Reliable\\" circle of officers. The Eleven Reliable clique was an external tool of a more closed group of three influential senior military officers called the \\"Three Crows\\" (Tetsuzan Nagata, Yasuji Okamura and Toshishiro Obata) who wanted to modernize the Japanese military and to purge it of its anachronistic samurai tradition and the dominant allied clans of Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma that favored that tradition. The real sponsor behind both two bodies was Field Marshal Royal Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, uncle and advisor of the Emperor Hirohito, and responsible for eight fake coups d'√©tat, four assassinations, two religious hoaxes, and countless threats of murder and blackmails between 1930 and 1936 in his effort to neutralize the Japanese moderates, who opposed war, by spreading terror. Higashikuni highly favored covered work by faithful officers inside the intelligence departments in order to bring about the political program of his own clique named \\"Toseiha\\". This clique had a decisive materialistic, westernizing approach on the issue of the Empire's expansion, in a rather colonization-like fashion, as opposed to the rival \\"Kodoha\\" clique which was for a more \\"spiritual\\" way of expansion as an effort to liberate and unite all yellow race peoples under a racial, not nationalistic Empire. K≈çd≈çha, headed by Gen. Sadao Araki, under the national socialistic, totalitarian and populistic philosophical influence of Ikki Kita charged Toseiha for collusion with the Zaibatsu financial conglomerate business clique, or to simply put it, for amoralism and pro-capitalism.Sims, Japanese Political History Since the Meiji Renovation 1868‚Äì2000 It is not quite clear whether Doihara joined the movement for ideological or opportunistic reasons, but in any case, from then on his military career accelerated. In 1931, he became head of the military espionage operations of the Japanese Army of Manchuria in Tientsin. The following year, he was transferred to Shenyang as head of the Houten Special Agency, the military intelligence service of the Japanese Kwantung Army. \\"Lawrence of Manchuria‚Äù Harvest of poppy in Manchukuo used for opium production While at Tientsin, Doihara, together with Seishir≈ç Itagaki engineered the infamous Mukden Incident by ordering Lieutenant Suemori Komoto to place and fire a bomb near the tracks at the time when a Japanese train passed through. In the event, the bomb was so unexpectedly weak and the damage of the tracks so negligible that the train passed undamaged, but the Imperial Japanese Government still blamed the Chinese military for an unprovoked attack, invaded and occupied Manchuria. During the invasion, Doihara facilitated the tactical cooperation between the Northeastern Army Generals Xi Qia in Kirin, Zhang Jinghui in Harbin and Zhang Haipeng at Taonan in the northwest of Liaoning province. Next, Doihara took the task to return former Qing dynasty Emperor Pu Yi to Manchuria as to give legitimacy to the puppet regime. The plan was to pretend that Pu Yi had returned to resume his throne by an imaginable popular demand of the people of Manchuria and that although Japan had nothing to do with his return, it could do nothing to oppose the will of the people. To carry out the plan, it was necessary to land Pu Yi at Yingkou before that port froze; therefore, he had to arrive there before 16 November 1931. With the help of the legendary spy Kawashima Yoshiko, a woman well-acquainted with the Emperor, who regarded her as a member of the Chinese Imperial Family, he succeeded in bringing him into Manchuria within the deadline. In early 1932, Doihara was sent to head the Harbin Special Agency of the Kwantung Army, where he began negotiations with General Ma Zhanshan after he had been driven from Tsitsihar by the Japanese. Ma's position was ambiguous; he continued negotiations while he supported Harbin-based General Ting Chao. When Doihara realized his negotiations were not going anywhere, he requested that Manchurian warlord Xi Qia advance with his forces to take Harbin from General Ting Chao. However, General Ting Chao was able to defeat Xi Qia's forces, and Doihara realized he would need Japanese forces to succeed. Doihara engineered a riot in Harbin to justify their intervention. That resulted in the IJA 12th Division under General Jir≈ç Tamon coming from Mukden by rail and then marching through the snow to reinforce the attack. Harbin fell on 5 February 1932. By the end of February, General Ting Chao retreated into northeastern Manchuria and offered to cease hostilities, ending Chinese formal resistance. Within a month, the puppet state of Manchukuo was established under Doihara's supervision who had named himself mayor of Mukden. He then arranged for the puppet government to ask Tokyo to supply \\"military advice\\". During the next months 150,000 soldiers, 18,000 gendarmes and 4,000 secret police came into the newly-founded protectorate. He used them as an occupying army, imposing slave labour and spreading terror to force the 30 million Chinese inhabitants into abject submission.White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans- Siberian,p.299, Jamie Bisher, Routledge, , 2005 Ma's fame as an uncompromised fighter against the Japanese invaders survived after his defeat and so Doihara made contact with him offering a huge sum of money and the command of the puppet state's army if he would defect to the new Manchurian government. Ma pretended that he agreed and flew to Mukden in January 1932, where he attended the meeting on which the state of Manchukuo was founded and was appointed War Minister of Manchukuo and Governor of Heilongjiang Province. Then, after using the Japanese funds to raise and re-equip a new volunteer force, he led, on 1 April 1932, his troops to Tsitsihar, re-establishing the Heilongjiang Provincial Government as part of the Republic of China and resumed the fight against the Japanese. From 1932 to 1933, the newly-promoted Major General Doihara commanded IJA 9th Infantry Brigade of IJA 5th Division. After the seizure of Jehol in Operation Nekka, Doihara was sent back to Manchukuo to head Houten Special Agency once again until 1934. He was then attached to IJA 12th Division until 1936. Second Sino-Japanese War and Second World War Doihara in a press photo in Tokyo during 1936, by then a Lt. General From 1936 to 1937, Doihara was the commander of the 1st Depot Division in Japan until the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, when he was given command of the IJA 14th Division under the Japanese First Army in North China. There, he served in the Beiping‚ÄìHankou Railway Operation and spearheaded the campaign of Northern and Eastern Henan, where his division opposed the Chinese counterattack in the Battle of Lanfeng. After the Battle of Lanfeng, Doihara was attached to the Army General Staff as head of the Doihara Special Agency until 1939, when he was given command of the Japanese Fifth Army, in Manchukuo under the overall control of the Kwantung Army. In 1940, Doihara became a member of the Supreme War Council which shifted its military policy in China that year to what was called the Three Alls (\\"Kill all ‚Äì Burn all ‚Äì Loot all\\"). He then became head of the Army Aeronautical Department of the Ministry of War, and Inspector- General of Army Aviation until 1943. From 1940 to 1941, he was appointed Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. On 4 November 1941, as a general in the Japanese Army Air Force and a member of the Supreme War Council he voted his approval of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1943, Doihara was made Commander in Chief of the Eastern District Army. In 1944, he was appointed the Governor of Johor State, Malaya, and commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore until 1945. Returning to Japan in 1945, Doihara was promoted to Inspector-General of Military Training (one of the most prestigious positions in the Army) and commander in chief of the Japanese Twelfth Area Army. At the time of the surrender of Japan in 1945, Doihara was commander in chief of the 1st General Army. = Criminal activities = Doihara's activity in China vastly exceeded the normal behaviour of an intelligence officer. As chief of the Japanese secret services in China, he worked out, put in motion, and oversaw a wide series of activities, systematically exploiting the occupied areas and disrupting Chinese social structure in the rest of the country to weaken public resistance by using every possible kind of action, including deliberately fueling criminality; fostering drug addiction; sponsoring terrorism, assassinations, blackmail, bribery, opium trafficking, and racketeering; and spreading every kind of corruption in the almost-ungovernable country.The peace conspiracy: Wang Ching-wei and the China war, 1937-1941, vol. 67, Harvard East Asian Series, The East Asian Research Center at Harvard University, Harvard University Press, 1972 The extent of his activities and covert operations is still inadequately understood. According to Ronald Sydney Seth, his activity played a key role in shattering China's ability to confront Japan's expansion by generating chaotic conditions, which prevented any mass reaction in the invaded country. After the occupation of Manchuria, the Japanese secret service, under his supervision, soon turned Manchukuo into a vast criminal enterprise in which rape, child molestation, sexual humiliation, sadism, assault, and murder became institutionalized means of terrorizing and controlling Manchuria's Chinese and Russian populations. Robbery by soldiers and gendarmes, arbitrary confiscation of property, and unabashed extortion became common. Underground brothels, opium dens, gambling houses, and narcotics shops run by Japanese gendarmes competed with the state monopoly syndicate of opium. Many conscientious Japanese officers protested the conditions, but Tokyo ignored them and so they were silenced. The ritual suicide of Gensui Baron Mut≈ç Nobuyoshi, who allegedly had left a note to the emperor, Hirohito, pleading for mercy for the people of Manchuria, was in vain.White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian,p.299, Jamie Bisher, Routledge, , 2005 Doihara soon expanded his activity into the still unoccupied parts of China. By using about 80,000 paid Chinese villains known as Chiang Mao Tao, he funded hundreds of criminal groups, using them for every kind of social disturbance, turnover, assassinations and sabotage inside unoccupied China. Through the organizations, he soon managed to control a large part of the opium traffic in China, using the money earned to fund his covert operations.Encyclopedia of espionage, p.316, Ronald Sydney Seth, , Doubleday, 1974Encyclopedia of War Crimes And Genocide, p.128, Facts on File, Leslie Alan Horvitz & Christopher Catherwood, , 2006 He hired an army of agents and sent them throughout China as representatives of various humanitarian organizations. They established thousands of health centers, mainly in the villages of the districts, for curing tuberculosis, which was then epidemic in China. By adulterating medicines with opium, he managed to addict millions of unsuspecting patients, expanding societal degeneration into areas which had been hitherto untouched by the increasing breakdown of Chinese society. The scheme also created a pool of addicted victims desperate to offer any kind of service to secure a daily dose of opium.Secret servants: a history of Japanese espionage, p.128, Ronald Sydney Seth, ASIN: B0007DM4XG, Straus and Cudahy, 1957Tales of Real Spies, p.47, Fergus Fleming, EDC, 1998, He initially gave food and shelter to tens of thousands Russian White √©migr√© women who had taken refuge in the Far East after the defeat of the White Russian anti-Bolshevik movement during the Russian Civil War and the withdrawal of the Entente and Japanese armies from Siberia. Having lost their livelihoods, and with most of them widowed, Doihara forced the women into prostitution, using them to create a network of brothels throughout China where they worked under inhuman conditions. The use of heroin and opium was promoted to them as a way to tolerate their miserable fate. Once addicted, the women were used to further spread the use of opium among the population by earning one free opium pipe for every six they were selling to their customers.Encyclopedia of espionage, p.315, Ronald Sydney Seth, , Doubleday, 1974White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian,p.298, Jamie Bisher, Routledge, , 2005 Winning the necessary support from the authorities in Tokyo he persuaded the Japanese tobacco industry Mitsui of Mitsui Zaibatsu to produce special cigarettes bearing the popular to the Far East trademark \\"Golden Bat\\". Their circulation was prohibited in Japan, as they were intended only for export. Doihara's services controlled their distribution in China and Manchuria where the full production was exported. In the mouthpiece of each cigarette a small dose of opium or heroin was concealed, and by this subterfuge millions of unsuspecting consumers were added to the ever-growing crowds of drug addicts in the crippled country, simultaneously creating huge profits. According to testimony presented at the Tokyo War Crimes trials in 1948, the revenue from the narcotization policy in China, including Manchukuo, was estimated as twenty to thirty million yen per year, while another authority stated during the trial that the annual revenue was estimated by the Japanese military at 300 million dollars a year.Mitsui: Three Centuries of Japanese Business, pages 312-313, John G. Roberts, Weatherhill, 1991, Given the chaotic situation in China, the corruption Doihara methodically spread didn't take long to reach the very top. In 1938 Chiang was forced to execute 8 generals commanding Chinese divisions when it was found that they were informers for Doihara's services. This heralded a wave of executions of high-ranking Chinese officials found guilty for every kind of dealing with Doihara during the next 6 years of the war. To many westerners in touch with the Chinese leadership, the purges were without lasting results.

First in the front row from left to right Last writing of the Class-A War Criminals (Kenji Doihara, Iwane Matsui, Hideki Tojo and Akira Muto) Kenji Doihara in 1948 After the surrender of Japan, he was arrested by the Allied occupation authorities and tried before the International Military Tribunal of the Far East as a Class A war criminal together with other members of the Manchurian administration responsible for the Japanese policies there. He was found guilty on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36, and 54 and was sentenced to death, while his close colleague Naoki Hoshino, financial expert and director of the Japanese State Opium Monopoly Bureau in Manchuria, was sentenced to life imprisonment. According to the indictment, as tools of successive Japanese governments they: \\"... pursued a systematic policy of weakening the native inhabitants' will to resist (...) by directly and indirectly encouraging the increased production and importation of opium and other narcotics and by promoting the sale and consumption of such drugs among such people.\\"The Opium Empire: Japanese Imperialism and Drug Trafficking in Asia, 1895-1945, John M.

It was then the property of Lord Clifford but has also now disappeared. The church at Creslow, which dates from the 13th century, was formerly owned by the Knights Hospitaller (the Order of St John of Jerusalem). Following the dissolution of the Monasteries it was held by the Crown, and the whole of the manor was used as pasture for the cattle of the Royal Household. The ecclesiastical parish was abolished by Queen Elizabeth I and the building itself was demolished during the English Civil War, by the regicide Cornelius Holland, and was never replaced.

Bahr, the early sales manager of the company, named them, thinking \\"Dum Dums\\" was a phrase any child could say. In 1953, Dum Dums were purchased by the Spangler Candy Company and moved manufacturing to Bryan, Ohio. Initially, there were 7 flavors: lemon, lime, orange, coconut-pineapple, cherry, grape, and butterscotch. Spangler once experimented with plastic sticks instead of the current paper sticks, but they were met with complaints of potential injury due to the possible breakage of the unbending plastic in manufacturing leading to plastic fragments in the candy.

It originated in 1917, growing and diversifying into electronics. It expanded after the Second World War by acquisition of companies and formed overseas companies. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 1989, it was taken over by a consortium formed by GEC and Siemens which split the assets of the Plessey group. The majority of Plessey's defence assets were amalgamated into BAE Systems in 1999 when British Aerospace merged with the defence arm of GEC, Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). A small portion of the defence market, mostly embedded electronic systems and circuitcards remained with GE, formerly GE Fanuc and GE Intelligent Platforms (GE-IP) and now Abaco Systems based in Huntsville, Alabama and Towcester, Northamptonshire. The bulk of Plessey's telecommunications assets were acquired by Ericsson through its 2005 acquisition of Marconi Corporation plc, a successor company of GEC. History =Early history= The Plessey company was founded in 1917 in Marylebone, central London. The original shareholders were Thomas Hurst Hodgson, C. H. Whitaker, Raymond Parker and his brother Plessey Parker. A talented German engineer, William Oscar Heyne, was employed by the company. Heyne later became the managing director and chairman of Plessey and was one of the key figures in the development of Plessey during the 1920s and 1930s. The company moved to Cottenham Road in Ilford early in 1919. In 1925, the original company was wound up and a new one was formed with a greater share capital. Most of the early work carried out by the company was in mechanical engineering. =The Clark connection= An early customer of Plessey was a galvanising company called British Electro Chemists. One of that company's shareholders was Byron G. Clark, an American, who was also a business associate of T. H. Hodgson, one of the founders of Plessey. The Clark family would eventually dominate the management of Plessey for most of its history. Byron's son Allen George Clark joined the company in 1921, and went on to become a driving force behind the development of Plessey, followed later by his sons John Allen Clark, and Michael William Clark, both of whom rose to prominent positions in the company. =Electrical manufacturing= During the 1920s Plessey began to diversify into electrical manufacturing. Important contracts included the manufacture of early radios for Marconi and the production of telephones for the GPO. In order to increase production, Plessey moved to Vicarage Lane, Ilford, in 1923. In 1929, the television pioneer John Logie Baird had his first production televisions made by Plessey. The company also produced the first British-made portable radio in the same year. The manufacture of electrical components became an area of growth for Plessey. A vast array of components was manufactured, many under licence from overseas companies. Plessey became one of the largest manufacturers in this field as the radio and television industries grew. In 1936/7, turnover was more than ¬£1 million and Plessey became a public company on 17 March 1937. =Aircraft components= Aircraft components was another market into which the company diversified. In 1936, Plessey obtained a number of important manufacturing licences from American companies such as Breeze Corporation for aircraft multi-pin electrical connectors, Federal Laboratories for Coffman starters (an explosive cartridge device used to start aircraft engines), and Pump Engineering Services Corporation for the manufacture of Pesco fuel pumps. Plessey went on to produce large numbers of these fuel pumps for Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, and in 1940 the fuel pump for Britain's first jet engine was also supplied by Plessey. R1155 receiver on top of T1154 transmitter =Second World War= During the war, Plessey produced a vast array of components and equipment for the war effort, including shell cases, aircraft parts, and radio equipment such as the R1155 (receiver), and T1154 (transmitter). In all, 161,500 pieces of wartime electronic equipment were produced. To allow greater production, Plessey converted five miles of twin tunnel, built for a new extension to the London Underground Central line from Leytonstone to Newbury Park, into a factory. The company also built a new factory at Swindon in Wiltshire, and opened several other shadow factories around the country to produce munitions. Caswell, Northamptonshire became the site of Plessey's first dedicated research centre in 1940. The wartime workforce of Plessey grew to over 10,000. =Post World War II= With the end of the war the company's orders dropped from ¬£5 million in 1944/5 to ¬£263,000 in 1946 and the workforce fell to less than 6,000. Radio and television sales were the main area of activity until the renewed demand for defence products with the onset of the Korean War. From a turnover of ¬£5 million in 1949/50, there was an increase to ¬£32 million in 1959/60. In 1951, the Electronics Division was started by Michael Clark. By 1955, this had expanded to become the Electronics and Equipment Group with 5,000 staff. The following year the Roke Manor research facility was set up under the direction of H. J. Finden near Romsey, Hampshire. Plessey produced an early integrated circuit model in 1957, before the patents of Jack St. Clair Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild.Peter Robin Morris, Institution of Electrical Engineers \\"A history of the world semiconductor industry\\" In the 1960s the Group continued to expand, setting up facilities at places such as West Leigh (Havant, Hampshire) and Templecombe, Somerset. Plessey Electronics logo In 1961 Plessey merged with the British Ericsson Telephone company and Automatic Telephone and Electric (AT&E;) of Liverpool, to become Britain's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, including the majority of the country's crossbar switches. Alongside the Telecommunications Division, three other businesses were set up: Plessey Avionics and Communications, Plessey Radar and Plessey Marine. In 1970, the Command and Control unit was set up at Christchurch, Dorset, which became the centre of the Plessey Defence Systems business. In 1979, a major subsidiary was set up, Plessey Electronic Systems Ltd, which incorporated the three businesses and by 1986 achieved sales of over ¬£500 million and employed 15,000. Plessey were partners in the development of the Atlas Computer in 1962 and in the development of digital telephone systems, including System X, from the late 1970s. In 1988, Plessey's Telecommunications Division merged with that of GEC to become GEC Plessey Telecommunications. Plessey Naval Systems was formed in 1986 by the merger of Plessey Marine with Plessey Displays, which had been part of Plessey Radar. In 1967 or 1968, English Electric was subject to a takeover bid by Plessey, but chose instead to accept an offer from GEC. Plessey were among the first firms to use computers. Their Training Department developed an interactive management game (PITDEX) using TeleType printer/keyboards to link to LEASCO computers in the United States via standard telephones and acoustic couplers. Plessey also pioneered the gathering and consolidation of accounting information from around the world using in-house software. Each of their 140 management reporting entities used HP125s with DIVAT (data input, validation and transmission) software. Nearly 450 validation rules ensured accuracy within and between various reports. The data were then transmitted to Ilford where a HP 3000 ran Fortran software for consolidation and reporting‚Äîalso on HP125s.Micro Decision, August 1983; Accountancy, March 1984; Information Systems. February 1986 During the 1970s and early 1980s, Plessey manufactured a series of computer systems and peripherals compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-11. By 1972, Plessey designed the first industrial capability-based security computer, a fault-tolerant multiprocessor system called Plessey System 250. Plessey was also the lead contractor for the Ptarmigan communications system supplied to the British Army, which adopted the System 250 architecture. Plessey PDRM82F geiger counter =UK air defence= In 1959 AT&E;, later Plessey, became the prime contractor for a new UK air defence system, known by the company under the name Plan Ahead and, from 1961, as Project Linesman. To enable the system to be designed and built without too much information becoming public knowledge, a new factory called \\"Exchange Works\\" was built in Cheapside in Liverpool city centre, where young employees were granted exemption from conscription. At the heart of the system, installed in a huge building in the middle of a council housing estate in West Drayton, was the computer room, occupying an area of around and filled with around 1,000 racks of electronics, including mainly the XL4 computer, based entirely on germanium transistors and using a computer language developed at Exchange Works in the 1950s and 1960s. The secure status of the factory attracted many other secret contracts and led to it becoming one of the major designers and manufacturers of cryptographic equipment. Exchange Works is now luxury flats. =South Africa= The South African roots of Plessey can be traced to the acquisition of AT&E; and Ericsson in 1963, and a Cape Town-based company, the Instrument Manufacturing Company (IMC), acquired in 1964. At the time, IMC was in the process of industrialising a unique South African invention, the Tellurometer, the first successful microwave electronic distance measurement equipment. The instrument was invented by Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), also responsible for the Wadley loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals. South African insurance and investment company Sanlam bought 26% of Plessey South Africa in 1974, with first right of refusal to purchase more of the company. These shares were later transferred to Sankorp, Sanlam's industrial holdings company. In 1989, when GEC-Siemens took control of the Plessey Company plc, Sankorp indicated its intention to purchase the remaining 74% of shares in the South African subsidiary. =GEC takeover bid= In December 1985, GEC launched a takeover bid for the Plessey Company, valuing the group at ¬£1.2 billion. Both Plessey and the Ministry of Defence were against the merger, since GEC and Plessey were the two largest suppliers to the MoD and in many tenders the only competitors. In January 1986, the bid was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), whose report published in August advised against the merger. The government concurred and blocked GEC's bid. In 1988, Plessey and GEC merged their telecom units to form GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT), at the time the UK's leading telecommunications manufacturer. =GEC Siemens takeover= In 1988, GEC and Siemens AG set up a joint holding company called GEC Siemens plc, to launch a hostile takeover of Plessey. Their initial offer was made on 23 December 1988, valuing Plessey at ¬£1.7 billion. Again, Plessey rejected the offer and again it was referred to the MMC. The original proposal envisaged joint ownership of all of Plessey's defence businesses, with GPT and Plessey's North American businesses split in the ratios 60:40 and 51:49 respectively. The level of GEC's involvement in the Plessey defence businesses was not likely to meet with regulatory approval and in February 1989, GEC Siemens announced a new organisation. The takeover was completed in September 1989. Break-up of the business In April 1990, GEC and Siemens agreed a new structure of ownership of the Plessey businesses: =GEC acquisitions= *In the UK **Plessey Aerospace **Plessey Avionics **Plessey Crypto **Plessey Materials **Plessey Naval Systems **Plessey Semiconductors **Plessey Research Caswell *In North America **Plessey Aero Precision Corp **Plessey Dynamics Corp **Plessey Electronic Systems Corp (including ES Marine Systems) **Sippican Inc **Plessey Materials Inc **Leigh Instruments =Siemens acquisitions= *Siemens Plessey Radar *Siemens Plessey Defence Systems *Siemens Plessey Controls *Siemens Plessey Australia *Siemens Plessey Assessment Services *Roke Manor Research Limited =Jointly owned= *GEC-Plessey Telecommunications (GPT): 60% GEC and 40% Siemens =Disposals= *Birkby Plastics *Hoskyns Group *Plessey S.p.a (Italy) *51% share in Plessey Telenet acquired by minority partner in 1992 *74% share in Plessey South Africa acquired by minority partner Sankorp Subsequent history =UK= In 1997, British Aerospace and Daimler-Benz Aerospace acquired the UK operations and the German part of Siemens Plessey Systems, respectively. By 1997, the GPT name disappeared in the UK and the company was known as Siemens GEC Communication Systems (SGCS), which later became Siemens Communications. In August 1998, GEC acquired Siemens' 40% stake in GPT (by now only existing as a legal entity) and merged GPT with the telecoms units of its other subsidiaries, namely Marconi SpA, GEC Hong Kong and ATC South Africa, to form Marconi Communications. In December 1999, GEC's defence arm Marconi Electronic Systems was amalgamated with British Aerospace to form BAE Systems. The remainder of GEC was renamed to Marconi plc, and Marconi Communications became its principal subsidiary.GEC buys Siemens out of GPT This company was affected by the dot-com bubble and was restructured into Marconi Corporation in 2003, then collapsed in 2005. Most of it (including Marconi Communications) was bought by Ericsson and the remainder became Telent plc. The part of GPT which evolved into Siemens Communications would eventually become Siemens Enterprise Communications in 2008. Plessey Semiconductors factory at Cheney Manor, Swindon in 1982. The factory housed both bipolar and MOS lines. A small part of the canteen facilities (which had five grades of service) for all Plessey employees is visible on the right of the image, since demolished around 2010GEC Plessey Semiconductors (GPS) was purchased by Mitel Semiconductors of Canada in 1998. After a number of downsizes, including the purchase of the power semiconductor and silicon on sapphire operation at Lincoln, Lincolnshire by Dynex Semiconductor in 2000, the company renamed itself Zarlink Semiconductor in 2001. The GPS fabrication plant in Plymouth was acquired by Xfab. =Plessey Semiconductors Ltd= After the sale of the Roborough site in Plymouth to Xfab, the original Plessey Semiconductors site at Cheney Manor, Swindon continued to operate under the Zarlink Semiconductor name until it was sold to MHS Industries in early 2008. In February 2009, the UK business was forced into receivership following the collapse of the parent MHS Electronics business in France. After a subsequent management buyout the company traded as Plus-Semi Ltd.Plessey Semiconductors factory at Cheney Manor, Swindon, on 17 July 2012, undergoing demolition The Roborough site ( 8\\" and 6\\" lines) was re-acquired from Xfab on 1 January 2010 and the company renamed as Plessey Semiconductors Ltd. The new company transferred its Bipolar processes on Silicon & SOI into the 8\\" Plymouth facility during 2010, exploiting the combined technology base in the development of new processes and products in a number of markets. The Swindon site on the Cheney Manor Industrial estate in the west of the town was demolished in July 2012. In 2011/2, Plessey acquired the rights to disruptive GaN on Silicon technology by acquisition of CamGaN, a startup company, from Cambridge Enterprises. Using the GaN on Silicon technology and semiconductor expertise, Plessey Semiconductors Ltd manufactured solid state lighting, horticultural lighting and medical sensing products. Their GaN on Silicon i2LED high power LEDs and Stellar Orion Beam Forming modules, launched in autumn 2016, which enabled new form factors of lighting products and remove critical design constraints for lighting product designers. In horticulture, the Plessey Attis Growlight was at the forefront of an engineering approach to LED based plant grow lights which was then developed into a new brand, Hyperion Grow Lights. The company's medical products were based on the EPIC sensor, which were used in the advanced portable ECG monitoring device, Impulse, and was also the basis of an R&D; program, named Warden, to develop driver alertness monitoring devices in automotive and aeronautical applications. In 2017, Plessey pivoted the focus of the business to the R&D; and manufacturing of microLEDs (micro light-emitting diodes) as a market disrupting display technology for a wide-range of applications, including: Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, smartphones, televisions, smartwatches, head-up displays, head-mounted displays and more. Plessey Semiconductors Ltd HQ in Roborough, Plymouth in August 2017 Plessey continues to operate in the Roborough site with leading-edge 150mm and 200mm wafer processing facilities to undertake design, test and assembly of products, and a comprehensive suite of photonic characterisation and applications laboratories. Their original microLED product was an illuminator for display light engines (DMD and LCOS), which offered a 40% reduction in light engine size whilst delivering higher energy efficiency. They have now upgraded to full-field emissive microLED displays that combine very high-density RGB pixel arrays with high-performance CMOS backplanes to produce very high-brightness, low-power and high-frame-rate image sources. These are innovative products that are widely recognised within the industry with many accolades from prestigious electronics, engineering and display industry award programs, including: Elektra Awards 2017, British Engineering Excellence Awards 2017, National Technology Awards 2018, CES Innovation Awards 2019 and Electronics Industry Awards 2019. In March 2019, Plessey used their GaN on Silicon technology, which natively emits Blue, to innovatively engineer the early layers within the process to emit native Green, opening more opportunities for markets such as military. Plessey also achieved the world‚Äôs first GaN on Silicon monolithic, wafer to wafer bonding, in May which was a massive breakthrough for not only the company but the industry. =South Africa= In South Africa, following the successful GEC/Siemens takeover, after protracted negotiations in 1991, Plessey South Africa became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sankorp under the new name of Plessey Tellumat South Africa Limited (PTSA). The addition of the name Tellumat had a double symbolism, firstly for the company's commitment to exports, as it is the name of its UK-based export subsidiary. Secondly, the name derives from the Tellurometer, South Africa's world first electronic surveying development‚Äîand by implication, a commitment to ongoing electronic research and development. PTSA continued to grow with a strong focus on telecommunications and defence products, particularly with a major expansion into large projects, rolling out the microwave backbone of MTN, one of South Africa‚Äôs first GSM cellular networks and the installation of a fibre optic network and radio broadcasting system in Malaysia. A software division was formed through the acquisition of BSW data, largely staffed by engineers from the recently terminated South African space programme in which PTSA had also participated, both in the electronics of the launch vehicle and the satellite itself. 1995 was a landmark year in the history of the business in South Africa. The merger of PTSA and Tek Electronics, the consumer electronics audio and video products, manufacturer and distributor, (also wholly owned by Sankorp) took the business full circle back to its consumer electronics roots. This resulted in the renaming of PTSA back to the original name of Plessey South Africa Limited. The full acquisition of AWA-Plessey Communications, which Plessey jointly owned in Australia with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd (AWA) and had a similar product portfolio, resulted in penetration into the Pacific Rim market. The culmination of this growth was the company‚Äôs listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as the Plessey Corporation in the same year. Trading started off at R4.80 a share. On the evening of 6 February 1996, a devastating fire swept through two bays of the White Road factory in Retreat, Cape Town causing huge damage to stock, instruments, plant and work in progress. No one was injured, but work was disrupted for several weeks. Large sections of the factory had to be rebuilt. At the end of 1996, Plessey Corporation sold off the Sales and marketing business of Telefunken, Pioneer and Satellite TV. In August 1998, Plessey Corporation was bought by Dimension Data Holdings and Worldwide African Investment Holdings for R1.6 billion. The new owners retained BSW Data, Plessey Solutions and Communications Systems. The remaining divisions, notably with a product development and manufacturing focus, were bought back by a combined management buyout supported by Rand Merchant Bank. The corporate name was changed to Tellumat Pty Ltd. Tellumat continues to develop and manufacture Plessey-branded products as before and operates in the defence, telecommunications and contract manufacturing markets. Plessey barcodes \\"123456E\\" encoded in a Plessey barcode The name is also used to refer to a barcode symbology developed by Plessey, which is still used in some libraries and for shelf tags in retail stores, in part as a solution to their internal requirement for stock control. The system was first used in the early 1970s by J.Sainsbury to identify all of its products on supermarket shelves for its product restocking system. The chief advantages are the relative ease of printing using the dot-matrix printers, which were popular at the time of the code's introduction, and its somewhat higher density than the more common 2 of 5 and 3 of 9 codes. Plessey barcodes use two bar widths. Whitespace between bars is not significant. The start element is a wide bar, and the stop element is two narrow bars. In between, the bars are in groups of four. High order bars appear leftmost. Narrow bars are 0 and wide bars are 1. This symbology is not self checking, though a modulo 10 or modulo 11 checksum (or some combination of both checksums, depending on application) is usually appended.

The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means \\"Cubbel's estate\\". In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as Coblincote. History The parish church of St Nicholas is built in the perpendicular style. The tower of the church is decorated with blank tracery windows. Inside, the chancel arch has unusual corbels of a man and a monkey. At one time there was also a Methodist Chapel in the village. The Beacon 500 yards (500 m) from the church is a small man-made hill, about . high, known as \\"The Beacon\\", it is in fact the motte of a small Norman castle.Cublington, The Beacon (Pastscape) North west of the church the 18th-century stable block of the former manor house survives, it is an impressive building built of brick. A granary also survives built on an arcaded basement. This is rare as granaries in the area tended to be built on staddle stones. This type of agricultural building was generally raised from the ground to deter rodents. There are some houses of note, these include: Old Manor Farm, a large low house with a recently created series of spectacular gardens; and opposite the church, the former rectory, dating from the 18th century with more recent additions, and an informal garden, open to the public once or twice a year. Neales Farm is an H plan half-timbered house dating from circa 1600. The village has many old cottages, as well as small enclaves of newly built houses. In 1971, the Report of the Roskill Commission on the London Airport expansion selected Cublington as the location of a proposed third airport for London on the basis of Cost Benefit Analysis.

It is near the Oxfordshire border, about six miles west of Aylesbury. The village name is Old English (Anglo-Saxon) in origin, and means \\"Cudda's estate.\\" In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as Cudintuna. Anciently the village was the location of a medicinal spring of great repute, though its exact location is unknown. The Church of St Nicholas dates from the 12th Century but was much restored in 1857. Across the road is Tyringham Hall that dates from the 17th Century. During the Second World War the King of Norway who was staying at the nearby Hartwell House attended a church service in the village. Cuddington is centred on the village green and the road junction linking Aylesbury, Long Crendon and Haddenham. The majority of the original houses were built on the north side but in the last 50 years or so new homes have been built predominantly on the south side. The current population is around 550 residents. Two of the most famous former residents were Jonathan and David Dimbleby. The village, like surrounding villages, has been the location of several Midsomer Murders episodes. Facilities in the village include: * Shop/post office * Hairdressing salon * Pub/Restaurant * 2 Churches (although one of these is rarely used) * Village Hall * Playing Field with Clubhouse, Tennis Courts, Children's Park and Cricket and Football pitches For many years the village has won the regional heat of Britain's Best Kept Village Competition and also the Britain in Bloom competition.

Early life Pujol was born in Barcelona, studied at the German School of Barcelona and received a medical degree from the University of Barcelona. During his college years, he joined different activist groups that were seeking to rebuild the ideal Catalonia that the Spanish Civil War and Franco's dictatorship had undermined. Among these organizations were Grup Torras i Bages (where he met other activists such as Jaume Carner or Joan Revent√≥s), Comissi√≥ Abat Oliva, Grup Pere Figuera or Cofradia de la Mare de D√©u de Montserrat de Virt√®lia. In 1960, in the course of an homage to Catalan poetist Joan Maragall, held in Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana, part of the audience sang the Cant de la Senyera (The Song of the Flag in English) despite being previously prohibited by the Spanish authorities. Pujol was among those who organized this protest, and he was captured and detained for his protests against the regime of Francisco Franco. =Invention of Neobacitrin ointment= As a physician, Pujol was inventor of the antibiotic ointment Neobacitrin while working in the family-run laboratory Fides Cuatrecasas. The ointment went on to achieve great success and is still used today. Political career and President of Catalonia In 1974, Pujol founded the political party called Converg√®ncia Democr√†tica de Catalunya (CDC) (Democratic Convergence of Catalonia in English), of which he was the first Secretary. The political party was not legalized until 1977, during the Spanish transition to democracy after Franco's death in November 1975. From 1977 to 1980, Pujol was Minister without portfolio in the Provisional government of Catalonia, presided by Josep Tarradellas. In 1977 he led Pacte Democr√†tic per Catalunya, a coalition of Catalan parties that were trying to approve the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. In the Spanish general election of 1977 he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies, representing Barcelona. Pujol was re-elected at the 1979 General Election but resigned from the parliament in 1980. On 20 March 1980, the first Parliament of Catalonia elections after Franco's regime were held. The Catalan nationalist party Converg√®ncia i Uni√≥ (coalition of CDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia) won the elections and Pujol was elected President of the Generalitat de Catalunya on 24 April 1980. He was reelected again in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1995 and 1999. Pujol is a supporter of European integration. In 1985, he started a collaboration with Edgar Faure in the Council of the Regions of Europe (CRE), which would later become the Assembly of European Regions (AER). Pujol was the President of the Assembly of European Regions from 1992 to 1996. Pujol retired in 2003. He left the head of the party (CDC) to Artur Mas. That year, he gave the Biblioteca de Catalunya a bibliographic collection of more than 16,000 documents assembled during his presidency. Pujol and Catalan nationalism During the last decades of the Franco regime and his 23 years as President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Pujol pertained to the majority establishment in Catalan nationalism, which, instead of seeking a fully independent republic, intended to work towards a federalized Spain that would, according to Pujol, recognize Catalonia \\"as a country, as a collective with its own personality and differences,\\" and a \\"guarantee that her own identity be respected\\". With the conservative People's Party opposing the Catalan Statute of Autonomy, however, as well as the recognition for the language in the east of Aragon, Pujol has stated that, at least shortly before the Spanish transition to democracy, \\"there is more aggression towards Catalonia than ever\\", and that Catalans can \\"no longer hope for anything from the Spanish state\\". A lifelong federalist, Pujol has recently become very disenfranchised by the Spanish political arena. He also has recently stated, regarding the recent surge of Catalan separatism that more people than ever want independence, \\"and they have the right to want it.\\" Personal life He married Marta Ferrusola in Santa Maria de Montserrat in 1956 and the couple have seven children. Corruption scandals In July 2014, Jordi Pujol released a note explaining that for 34 years, including 23 as the President of Catalonia, he had maintained secret foreign bank accounts inherited from his father. The note apologized for his actions and explained that the millions had been declared and taxes paid. The scandal erupted in the Spanish media as it involves allegations against many family members, including trafficking of influence, bribery, money laundering and public corruption. At this time, his sons Jordi and Oleguer Pujol Ferrusola are being investigated by tax authorities. Another son Oriol Pujol resigned from his leadership position in CiU earlier in the month to face charges of public corruption as well. As a direct result of Pujol's admission on 29 July, Judge Pablo Ruz issued an indictment against Jordi Pujol Ferrusola and his wife for money laundering and tax evasion. On 29 July Catalan president Artur Mas, after a meeting with Pujol, announced that Pujol renounced both his salary and the office that he had been assigned as ex-president, as well as the honorary title of founding chairman of CDC and CiU. The opposition parties from both left and right, nationalist and non-nationalist, have demanded he testify before the parliament. The main government allies in the Catalan parliament, Esquerra Republicana, have declared that they support stripping Pujol of all his honors. The Catalan government has declared this a \\"private matter\\" that will have no impact on the movement for Catalan independence and the referendum scheduled for 9 November 2014. In announcing his resignation from all party offices, President Mas initially stated that Pujol would keep the right to be called \\"The Right Honorable\\" as a former president of Catalonia. Hours later the party spokesperson Francesc Homs stated that Pujol must \\"forfeit everything,\\" including the Medalla de Oro of Catalunya and all honorifics previously awarded to him. Indicative of the conflicted reaction of many Catalan nationalists, his personal friend Xavier Trias, the Mayor of Barcelona, lamented on Catalonia Radio \\"He must disappear...He failed us. It is a disaster that has taken place and the shadowy times of Pujol are finished while a new era begins.\\" Perhaps no one is more deeply conflicted than current President Mas who has acknowledged that Pujol is his \\"political father\\" and has stated that \\"he does not know the details and he is not interested in them either.\\" The impact of the Pujol family scandals on the Catalan independence movement, the CIU party and Mas' political future remain to be seen. Pujol and his family have been suspected for many years of cashing in on the political power he amassed as a 23-year president of Catalonia. In 1984 his family's bank went bankrupt and was taken over by the Spanish government. His children have amassed a fortune in private businesses that frequently did business and received contracts from the Catalan government. Pujol's wife and children have investments in the tens of millions of dollars in Mexico, Panama and Argentina. Financial records show the movement of money between foreign banks in Andorra, Switzerland, Jersey, Cayman Islands and other tax havens in excess of ‚Ç¨100 million. Critics, including Jordi Pujol Ferrusola's former girlfriend, charge that this family wealth could not be accumulated from a family inheritance or successful business practices. Ever since the 1984 bankruptcy of Banca Catalana, as well as in subsequent years, whenever corruption allegations were made against Pujol, his supporters claimed that the charges were politically motivated against Catalonia. The matter is still under investigation in 2017. =Impact= In early September 2014, public opinion polls began to show a measurable impact of the Pujol scandals on Catalan politics and public opinion. According to a poll conducted by El Peri√≥dico, a Catalan newspaper, 55% of Catalan voters believe the scandals will negatively affect the \\"right to decide\\" on November 9. El Pa√≠s, a Madrid newspaper, likewise found in its polling that 54% of Catalans believe that the corruption scandals are having a negative effect on the independence movement. In addition, over 78% of those Catalans polled by El Peri√≥dico believed that the Pujol family had collected illegal payments for government contracts habitually. In anticipation of the 11 September national holiday, the Diada, as well as the planned November 9 vote, the political strategies of the major parties are in flux. Pujol's old party has moved to a position of both welcoming (and limiting) his testimony in the Catalan parliament and reasserting that the critics are seeking political advantage from the investigations. Through its public statements the party is trying to remain optimistic about holding the vote while at the same time recognizing that the planned consultation may be deemed unconstitutional by Spain's Constitutional court. While the difficulty of maintaining the sovereignty alliance, and the competing demands of legality and democracy, is undeniably challenging for President Mas, his political decision-making has become increasingly difficult due to the Pujol scandals. On 5 September 2014 The Jordi Pujol Center for Studies announced its closing. The Center had been the major focus of Pujol's work in retirement sponsoring different academic activities related to ethics and disseminating his political philosophy. The Catalan government and many private sources of income ended their affiliations and it was decided that it was no longer a viable entity in light of the scandals.

There are two different GeForce4 families, the high-performance Ti family, and the budget MX family. The MX family spawned a mostly identical GeForce4 Go (NV17M) family for the laptop market. All three families were announced in early 2002; members within each family were differentiated by core and memory clock speeds. In late 2002, there was an attempt to form a fourth family, also for the laptop market, the only member of it being the GeForce4 4200 Go (NV28M) which was derived from the Ti line.  GeForce4 Ti  GeForce4 Ti 4800 (NV28 Ultra) GPU Albatron GeForce4 Ti 4800SE Mac =Architecture= The GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was launched in February 2002 and was a revision of the GeForce 3 (NV20). It was very similar to its predecessor; the main differences were higher core and memory clock rates, a revised memory controller (known as Lightspeed Memory Architecture II), updated pixel shaders with new instructions for Direct3D 8.0a support,https://techreport.com/review/3379/a-look-at-nvidia- geforce4-chips/2http://www.activewin.com/reviews/hardware/graphics/nvidia/gf4ti4600/gf2.shtml an additional vertex shader (the vertex and pixel shaders were now known as nFinite FX Engine II), hardware anti-aliasing (Accuview AA), and DVD playback. Legacy Direct3D 7-class fixed-function T&L; was now implemented as vertex shaders. Proper dual-monitor support (TwinView) was also brought over from the GeForce 2 MX. The GeForce 4 Ti was superior to the GeForce 4 MX in virtually every aspect save for production cost, although the MX had the Nvidia VPE (video processing engine) which the Ti lacked. =Lineup= The initial two models were the Ti4400 and the top-of-the-range Ti4600. At the time of their introduction, Nvidia's main products were the entry-level GeForce 2 MX, the midrange GeForce4 MX models (released the same time as the Ti4400 and Ti4600), and the older but still high-performance GeForce 3 (demoted to the upper mid- range or performance niche). However, ATI's Radeon 8500LE was somewhat cheaper than the Ti4400, and outperformed its price competitors, the GeForce 3 Ti200 and GeForce4 MX 460. The GeForce 3 Ti500 filled the performance gap between the Ti200 and the Ti4400 but it could not be produced cheap enough to compete with the Radeon 8500. In consequence, Nvidia rolled out a slightly cheaper model: the Ti4200. Although the 4200 was initially supposed to be part of the launch of the GeForce4 line, Nvidia had delayed its release to sell off the soon-to-be discontinued GeForce 3 chips. In an attempt to prevent the Ti4200 damaging the Ti4400's sales, Nvidia set the Ti4200's memory speed at 222 MHz on the models with a 128 MiB frame buffer--a full 53 MHz slower than the Ti4400 (all of which had 128 MiB frame buffers). Models with a 64 MiB frame buffer were set to 250 MHz memory speed. This tactic didn't work however, for two reasons. Firstly, the Ti4400 was perceived as being not good enough for those who wanted top performance (who preferred the Ti4600), nor those who wanted good value for money (who typically chose the Ti4200), causing the Ti4400 to be a pointless middle ground of the two. Furthermore, some graphics card makers simply ignored Nvidia's guidelines for the Ti4200, and set the memory speed at 250 MHz on the 128 MiB models anyway. Then in late 2002, the NV25 core was replaced by the NV28 core, which differed only by addition of AGP-8X support. The Ti4200 with AGP-8X support was based on this chip, and sold as the Ti4200-8X. A Ti4800SE replaced the Ti4400 and a Ti4800 replaced the Ti4600 respectively when the 8X AGP NV28 core was introduced on these.Connolly, Chris. The GeForce4‚Äôs Last Gasp : MSI‚Äôs GeForce4 Ti4800 / Ti4600-8X, GamePC, January 20, 2003.R., Jason. MSI GeForce4 Ti4800SE 8X VIVO Video Card, Extreme Overclocking, March 30, 2003. The only mobile derivative of the Ti series was the GeForce4 4200 Go (NV28M), launched in late 2002. The solution featured the same feature-set and similar performance compared to the NV28-based Ti4200, although the mobile variant was clocked lower. It outperformed the Mobility Radeon 9000 by a large margin, as well as being Nvidia's first DirectX 8 laptop graphics solution. However, because the GPU was not designed for the mobile space, it had thermal output similar to the desktop part. The 4200 Go also lacked power-saving circuitry like the MX-based GeForce4 4x0 Go series or the Mobility Radeon 9000. This caused problems for notebook manufacturers, especially with regards to battery life. =Performance= The GeForce4 Ti outperformed the older GeForce 3 by a significant margin. The competing ATI Radeon 8500 was generally faster than the GeForce 3 line, but was overshadowed by the GeForce 4 Ti in every area other than price and more advanced pixel shader (1.4) support. Nvidia, however, missed a chance to dominate the upper-range/performance segment by delaying the release of the Ti4200 and by not rolling out 128 MiB models quickly enough; otherwise the Ti4200 was cheaper and faster than the previous top-line GeForce 3 and Radeon 8500. Besides the late introduction of the Ti4200, the limited release 128 MiB models of the GeForce 3 Ti200 proved unimpressive, letting the Radeon 8500LE and even the full 8500 dominated the upper-range performance for a while.Freeman, Vince. Nvidia GeForce4 Ti 4200 Review, Sharky Extreme, April 26, 2002. The Matrox Parhelia, despite having several DirectX 9.0 capabilities and other innovative features, was at most competitive with the GeForce 3 and GeForce 4 Ti 4200, but it was priced the same as the Ti 4600 at US$399. The GeForce 4 Ti4200 enjoyed considerable longevity compared to its higher-clocked peers. At half the cost of the 4600, the 4200 remained the best balance between price and performance until the launch of the ATI Radeon 9500 Pro at the end of 2002.Wasson, Scott. ATI's Radeon 9500 Pro graphics card: DirectX 9 goes mainstream , Tech Report, November 27, 2002. The Ti4200 still managed to hold its own against several next generation DirectX 9 chips released in late 2003, outperforming the GeForce FX 5200 and the midrange FX 5600, and performing similarly to the mid- range Radeon 9600 Pro in some situations.Gasior, Geoff.

GeForce4 MX  =Architecture= GeForce4 MX 420 Many criticized the GeForce 4 MX name as a misleading marketing ploy since it was less advanced than the preceding GeForce 3. In the features comparison chart between the Ti and MX lines, it showed that the only \\"feature\\" that was missing on the MX was the nfiniteFX II engine--the DirectX 8 programmable vertex and pixel shaders. However, the GeForce4 MX was not a GeForce4 Ti with the shader hardware removed, as the MX's performance in games that did not use shaders was considerably behind the GeForce 4 Ti and GeForce 3. Though its lineage was of the past-generation GeForce 2, the GeForce4 MX did incorporate bandwidth and fill rate-saving techniques, dual-monitor support, and a multi- sampling anti-aliasing unit from the Ti series; the improved 128-bit DDR memory controller was crucial to solving the bandwidth limitations that plagued the GeForce 256 and GeForce 2 lines. It also owed some of its design heritage to Nvidia's high-end CAD products, and in performance-critical non- game applications it was remarkably effective. The most notable example is AutoCAD, in which the GeForce4 MX returned results within a single-digit percentage of GeForce4 Ti cards several times the price. Despite harsh criticism by gaming enthusiasts, the GeForce4 MX was a market success. Priced about 30% above the GeForce 2 MX, it provided better performance, the ability to play a number of popular games that the GeForce 2 could not run well--above all else--to the average non-specialist it sounded as if it were a \\"real\\" GeForce4--i.e., a GeForce4 Ti. GeForce 4 MX was particularly successful in the PC OEM market, and rapidly replaced the GeForce 2 MX as the best-selling GPU. In motion-video applications, the GeForce4 MX offered new functionality. It (and not the GeForce4 Ti) was the first GeForce member to feature the Nvidia VPE (video processing engine). It was also the first GeForce to offer hardware-iDCT and VLC (variable length code) decoding, making VPE a major upgrade from Nvidia's previous HDVP. In the application of MPEG-2 playback, VPE could finally compete head-to-head with ATI's video engine. =Lineup= GeForce4 MX 440 There were 3 initial models: the MX420, the MX440 and the MX460. The MX420 had only Single Data Rate memory and was designed for very low end PCs, replacing the GeForce 2 MX100 and MX200. The GeForce 4 MX440 was a mass-market OEM solution, replacing the GeForce 2 MX/MX400 and GeForce 2 Ti. The GeForce 4 MX460 was initially meant to slot in between the MX440 and the Ti4400, but the late addition of the Ti4200 to the line at a very similar price point (combined with the existing GeForce 3 Ti200 and ATI's Radeon 8500LE/9100, which were also similarly priced) prevented the MX460 from ever being truly competitive, and the model soon faded away. In terms of 3D performance, the MX420 performed only slightly better than the GeForce 2 MX400 and below the GeForce 2 GTS, but this was never really much of a problem, considering its target audience. The nearest thing to a direct competitor the MX420 had was ATI's Radeon 7000. In practice its main competitors were chipset-integrated graphics solutions, such as Intel's 845G and Nvidia's own nForce 2, but its main advantage over those was multiple-monitor support; Intel's solutions did not have this at all, and the nForce 2's multi-monitor support was much inferior to what the MX series offered. NVIDIA GeForce PCX 4300 The MX440 performed reasonably well for its intended audience, outperforming its closest competitor, the ATI Radeon 7500, as well as the discontinued GeForce 2 Ti and Ultra. When ATI launched its Radeon 9000 Pro in September 2002, it performed about the same as the MX440, but had crucial advantages with better single-texturing performance and proper support of DirectX 8 shaders. However, the 9000 was unable to break the MX440's entrenched hold on the OEM market. Nvidia's eventual answer to the Radeon 9000 was the GeForce FX 5200, but despite the 5200's DirectX 9 features it did not have a significant performance increase compared to the MX440 even in DirectX 7.0 games. This kept the MX440 in production while the 5200 was discontinued. The GeForce4 Go was derived from the MX line and it was announced along with the rest of the GeForce4 lineup in early 2002. There was the 420 Go, 440 Go, and 460 Go. However, ATI had beaten them to the market with the similarly performing Mobility Radeon 7500, and later the DirectX 8.0 compliant Mobility Radeon 9000. (Despite its name, the short-lived 4200 Go is not part of this lineup, it was instead derived from the Ti line.) Like the Ti series, the MX was also updated in late 2002 to support AGP-8X with the NV18 core. The two new models were the MX440-8X, which was clocked slightly faster than the original MX440, and the MX440SE, which had a narrower memory bus, and was intended as a replacement of sorts for the MX420. The MX460, which had been discontinued by this point, was never replaced. Another variant followed in late 2003--the MX 4000, which was a GeForce4 MX440SE with a slightly higher memory clock. The GeForce4 MX line received a third and final update in 2004, with the PCX 4300, which was functionally equivalent to the MX 4000 but with support for PCI Express. In spite of its new codename (NV19), the PCX 4300 was in fact simply an NV18 core with a BR02 chip bridging the NV18's native AGP interface with the PCI-Express bus.  GeForce4 model information  GeForce4 Go driver support This family is a derivative of the GeForce4 MX family, produced for the laptop market. The GeForce4 Go family, performance wise, can be considered comparable to the MX line. One possible solution to the lack of driver support for the Go family is the third party Omega Drivers. Using third party drivers can, among other things, invalidate warranties. The Omega Drivers are supported by neither laptop manufacturers, laptop ODMs, nor by Nvidia. Nvidia attempted legal action against a version of Omega Drivers that included the Nvidia logo.

The 89th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Toronto Blue Jays and the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves. Toronto defeated Atlanta four games to two, marking the first time a team based outside the United States won the World Series. The Blue Jays remain the only Canadian team to have appeared in, and won, a World Series (which they would do again the following year, in ). The 1992 World Series was the first World Series in which games were played outside the United States. Background The Blue Jays won the American League Eastern Division title for the second consecutive season and third time in four years. They faced the winners of the Western Division, the Oakland Athletics, in the American League Championship Series. The A's were looking to advance to the World Series for the fourth time in five years, having previously been in the World Series in 1988, 1989, and 1990. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were looking to become the first Canadian team to win a pennant. The Blue Jays lost the first game at home but then won the next three to take a commanding lead, eventually closing the series out at home in Game 6. The Braves won the National League Western Division for the second straight season and earned another matchup with the three-time defending Eastern Division winners, the Pittsburgh Pirates, in the National League Championship Series. The Braves won three of the first four games in the series, but the Pirates won the next two and were leading in the bottom of the ninth in Game 7 before the Braves rallied, capped off by a single by seldom-used utility man Francisco Cabrera that drove in two runs and won the series. Summary Matchups =Game 1= Braves fans had plenty to worry about in regard to both starting pitchers. Tom Glavine's post-season career had been less than stellar, including giving up eight runs in the second inning of Game 6 of the NLCS against Pittsburgh. Entering Game 1, Glavine's career post-season record was 1‚Äì5 despite two starts where he had pitched well and only given up one earned run each time. Glavine was 0‚Äì2 in those starts. In addition to Glavine's struggles in the postseason, the Braves would be facing their nemesis from the previous postseason. In the offseason, the Blue Jays signed the MVP of the 1991 World Series, Jack Morris, away from the Minnesota Twins. The Braves were more than familiar with Morris' work, as he had defeated them twice in three starts and only allowed a total of three runs. One of the victories came in the decisive seventh game, where Morris pitched a ten-inning complete game shutout. Morris' fortunes in 1992, however, were quite the opposite. Despite leading the Blue Jays with 21 wins in the regular season, Morris had not performed well in the postseason. He lost one of his two starts in the 1992 American League Championship Series despite throwing a complete game and took a no-decision in the other despite giving up five early runs. Toronto's other big offensive acquisition had been veteran Dave Winfield, who entered his 20th season in 1992 having yet to win a World Series ring. Winfield, primarily just the team's designated hitter by this point, paid dividends by recording his best batting average and runs batted in numbers in several years and added two home runs in the ALCS. His presence in the lineup was one that manager Cito Gaston wanted to keep, which forced some maneuvering of the lineup for the games to be played in Atlanta under National League rules; Winfield's natural position was right field, which was manned by All-Star Joe Carter during the season. Therefore, for Game 1, Winfield was inserted into Carter's place in the outfield. Carter, in turn, played first base in place of normal starter John Olerud. Glavine gave up a home run to Joe Carter in the fourth for the first run of the Series, while Morris shut the Braves out for five innings. In the sixth, Morris ran into trouble by walking David Justice and Ron Gant. Damon Berryhill golfed a Morris pitch over the right-field wall for a three-run homer. Morris would finish the inning, but it was all the offense Atlanta needed, and the Braves took the game by a 3‚Äì1 count. Glavine went the distance for the victory, only giving up four total hits. In taking the loss, Morris suffered his first career World Series defeat in his sixth start, with one no-decision. Berryhill's home run marked the first runs Morris had given up in the World Series since a Terry Pendleton home run in the bottom of the third inning of Game 4 of the 1991 Series. Morris pitched an additional innings in that game, all ten in Game 7, and the first innings of this game to run his scoreless innings streak in the World Series to 19. =Game 2= Before the game started, during the performance of the National Anthems of the United States and Canada, the U.S. Marine Corps Color Guard accidentally flew the flag of Canada upside down The Corps apologized for the error and took pains to carry the flag properly prior to Game 3 in Toronto after insisting that they would be honored to do so. On top of that, Canadian rock/country musician Tom Cochrane sang the Canadian national anthem incorrectly. Instead of singing the line \\"... from far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee ...\\", Cochrane instead sang a lyric that was in a previous version of the song: \\"... O Canada, we stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee ...\\". Not only did Cochrane substitute the archaic lyric, he also did not sing it correctly, as the lyric said \\"we stand on guard, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee\\" before it was changed. The pitching match-up featured, strangely, the top two pitchers in the National League in strikeouts for 1992. On August 27, 1992, the Blue Jays traded rookie infielder Jeff Kent and minor league outfield prospect Ryan Thompson to the New York Mets for their ace starting pitcher, David Cone. At the time of the trade, Cone had been leading the National League in strikeouts and was looking to do so for a third consecutive season. Major League Baseball rules dictate that when a player changes leagues during a season, the statistics he earns in each league are kept separate from each other. As such, Cone's total of 214 strikeouts with the Mets was frozen. Smoltz eventually caught and passed Cone toward the end of the season, finishing with a total of 215 strikeouts to lead the league. Cone, meanwhile, settled for the overall major league lead at a career high 261 strikeouts after recording 47 with the Blue Jays. As far as the postseason had gone to that point, both men's fortunes varied. Smoltz had started three games in the NLCS, winning two and being saved from a loss when the Braves made a two-out rally in the decisive final game; his performance was enough to make him the series MVP. Cone started the second and fifth games of the ALCS, winning his first start by allowing one run over eight innings. His second start saw him give up five runs (three unearned) over four innings, saddling him with the loss. A controversial call was made by umpire Mike Reilly in the top of the fourth inning with Atlanta leading 1‚Äì0 after David Justice walked, stole second, advanced to third, and scored on a wild pitch from Cone in the bottom of the second. Roberto Alomar was at third base with John Olerud batting. On the first pitch of the at-bat, Smoltz threw a breaking ball that skipped past Damon Berryhill. Alomar broke for home plate while Berryhill went to retrieve the ball. As Smoltz moved in to receive the throw he nearly collided with a sliding Alomar, who had reached the plate at exactly the same time that both Smoltz and the ball did. Smoltz tagged Alomar and Reilly called him out on the close play, despite an angry Alomar's protest, and the inning came to an end. Replays shown by CBS showed that Alomar might have touched the plate with his hands before Smoltz was able to apply a tag. The Braves scored again in the bottom of the fourth, when Sid Bream walked and eventually scored on a Mark Lemke two-out single to make the score 2‚Äì0. In the top of the fifth Pat Borders and Manuel Lee both reached base in front of Cone, who had already singled earlier in the game. Cone responded with his second hit of the game (only the third hit for a pitcher in the World Series since 1979) to drive in Borders and cut the Atlanta lead to 2‚Äì1. Lee then scored on a single by Devon White, tying the game. The Braves rallied in the bottom half of the inning as Deion Sanders provided a spark. With one out, Sanders singled. He then immediately stole second, and after Borders made an errant throw he got up and ran to third. Cone then walked Terry Pendleton, then gave up the go-ahead run when David Justice singled in Sanders and moved Pendleton to third. Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston then pulled Cone in favor of David Wells, who gave up the fourth Atlanta run when pinch hitter Brian Hunter's sacrifice fly scored Pendleton. Toronto made another rally in the eighth inning. After Alomar doubled to left with one out, Joe Carter and Dave Winfield hit back to back singles, the second of which scored Alomar and cut the lead to 4‚Äì3. Smoltz was then lifted in favor of left-handed specialist Mike Stanton, who retired Olerud for the second out. The Braves then called on their own late season pitching acquisition. Needing to shore up their bullpen, Atlanta sent two minor leaguers to the Boston Red Sox at the August trade deadline to acquire Jeff Reardon, Boston‚Äôs closer who earlier in the season had broken Rollie Fingers‚Äô career saves record. In his first appearance in a World Series since 1987, he struck out Kelly Gruber to end the threat. The Jays entered the ninth trailing by the one run Reilly had cost them and turned to their bench, which the team had nicknamed \\"The Trenches\\". After a walk to pinch-hitter Derek Bell (batting for Lee), Toronto reserve infielder Ed Sprague drilled a pitch from Reardon to left for a two-run homer to give the Blue Jays the lead. The play was called by legendary Blue Jays announcer the late Tom Cheek, who said \\"Watch him hit a homer.\\", during Sprague's at bat. Atlanta tried to rally in the ninth. After Mark Lemke flew out, Toronto closer Tom Henke hit pinch hitter Lonnie Smith with a pitch. Ron Gant came in to pinch run for him and, after Otis Nixon recorded the second out, he stole second. Sanders then walked to put the winning run on base and Pendleton, an NL MVP candidate, came to the plate. Pendleton had led the majors with a .391 average with runners in scoring position and two out. However, he popped out to Jays third baseman Kelly Gruber to seal the victory for Toronto. Gruber then angered Braves fans and players by mocking the \\"Tomahawk Chop\\" as he left the field.Major League Baseball Presents: 1992 World Series. Dir. Mike Kostel, Rich Domich. Perf. Len Carlou, Tim McCarver, Sean McDonough. Videocasette, DVD. Major League Baseball Productions, QVideo, 1992, 2002. =Game 3= Before this game, the U.S. Marine Corps Color Guard offered to hoist the Canadian flag once more in order to make amends for the inverted flag incident of Game 2. Likewise, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police flew the flag of the United States. The two guards received a standing ovation from the Toronto fans. As Game 3 moved across the border (for the first Canadian Classic) the question still remained of the Blue Jays' ballpark benefit. Before this series, the Blue Jays had previously only gone 3‚Äì6 in the postseason in their home park. Two of the wins, however, had come in the American League Championship Series as the Blue Jays won Game 2 and the clinching Game 6 against Oakland at home. The starters for this game were Steve Avery for the Braves and Juan Guzman for the Blue Jays. In the fourth inning, the first big defensive play of the Series nearly resulted in a rare World Series triple play and another bit of World Series history was made. Deion Sanders and Terry Pendleton reached base to start the inning, and with nobody out in the top of the inning David Justice hit a deep fly to center field. Devon White was able to chase down the ball and make a leap to snare it before crashing into the wall. As White tracked down the ball, the baserunners watched the play develop and after he caught it, Pendleton inadvertently ran past Sanders and by rule was automatically out. While Sanders was still standing between second and third, first baseman John Olerud received the cutoff throw from Roberto Alomar (they had tried to double off Pendleton, who was already out) and relayed it to third baseman Kelly Gruber, who began chasing Sanders back to second. Sanders dove back toward the bag as Gruber lunged at him to try and tag him to complete the triple play. Second base umpire Bob Davidson ruled that Sanders was able to return to the base, but Gruber protested that he had tagged Sanders on his foot before he could slide back in. The television replays backed up Gruber's case, as he appeared to clip Sanders' heel with his glove a split second before Sanders began his slide. In the bottom half of the fourth Joe Carter homered off of Braves starter Steve Avery, with the hit scoring the first ever World Series run in Canada. The Braves would tie the game in the sixth when Sanders ripped a double into the right-field corner and scored on a Justice single through the right side. They then took the lead in the top of the eighth. Otis Nixon led off the inning and hit a ball to third base that Gruber attempted to field, but the ball popped out of his glove and went into left field for an error. Nixon then stole second and with two out stood on third. Juan Guzman then walked Justice to pitch to Lonnie Smith, who delivered with a single that scored Nixon but also ended the inning as Justice was tagged out going to third. Guzman would finish the inning but was in danger of a loss. With the Blue Jays coming to bat in the bottom half, Gruber received an immediate chance to make up for his gaffe in the field and in doing so, would erase a long hitless streak. After going hitless in the ALCS opener, Gruber had recorded a home run and a double in the second game, both of which led to runs that were necessary to win that game. Those had been the only two hits he had recorded to that point in the postseason, as he failed to record a hit in either the remaining four ALCS games or the first two games in the World Series and was 0-for-1 in this game with a walk in his previous at bat. After going 23 consecutive at-bats without recording a single hit, Gruber worked a full count on Avery and then drilled a home run into left field to tie the game. Gruber would only record one more hit in the series after this. The top of the ninth inning saw the first World Series ejection since 1985 (when St. Louis Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog and Joaqu√≠n And√∫jar were ejected). Sid Bream led off the inning with a single off of Game 2 winner Duane Ward. As was often the case late in games at this time, Braves manager Bobby Cox elected to pinch run for the slow-footed Bream with Brian Hunter, his backup and a legitimate threat to steal a base (although he only had one steal during the regular season). With Jeff Blauser batting and the count at 2-2, Hunter took off from first. Blauser had thought about swinging, but attempted to stop himself as catcher Pat Borders threw down to second to beat the sliding Hunter to the bag. After he put the tag on Hunter, shortstop Manuel Lee jumped up and told Borders to appeal to first base umpire Dan Morrison, who ruled that Blauser had not checked his swing in time and was also out. Cox, who said he had been frustrated with home plate umpire Joe West's strike calls the entire night, picked up a batting helmet and threw it down with enough force that it bounced out of the Braves' dugout and rolled out onto the field. West, seeing this, immediately ejected Cox from the game immediately after the incident (Cox would later get ejected in the 1996 World Series). Shortly thereafter Ward struck out Damon Berryhill to end the inning. Avery started the bottom of the ninth for the Braves and gave up a single to Roberto Alomar. Acting manager Jimy Williams (usually the team's third base coach) pulled Avery from the game and brought in hard-throwing Mark Wohlers to face Carter, a right-handed batter. CBS announcer Tim McCarver questioned the strategy, as Alomar was a threat to steal a base and Avery, as a left-handed pitcher, had a quicker pickoff move than the right-handed Wohlers. The Blue Jays took advantage of this as Alomar stole second on a 2-0 pitch. With first base now open and Carter ahead 3‚Äì0, Wohlers put him on intentionally to keep a double play possibility alive. The next batter was Dave Winfield, who had been told by manager Cito Gaston that if Alomar and Carter reached in front of him, he wanted to move them into scoring position. Winfield did as Gaston asked and laid down a sacrifice bunt, which was successful and put the winning run at third base with one out. With the left-handed Olerud due up, Williams took the ball from Wohlers and called in left-handed specialist Mike Stanton. Gaston called Olerud back to the dugout after the change and sent Game 2 hero Ed Sprague, a right-hander, to pinch hit for a better matchup against Stanton. With Candy Maldonado, a right-handed batter, due up next, Williams ordered Stanton to walk Sprague to load the bases and then lifted him from the game in favor of Game 2 loser Jeff Reardon. Reardon had recorded some success against Maldonado in his career, and looked to do so again with two curveballs for strikes. However, instead of switching pitches, Reardon elected to throw a third curve and Maldonado, who was expecting it, drove a single to deep center to bring in a Tomahawk Chopping Alomar in from third with the winning run. Reardon later explained \\"People ask, why'd you throw another curve? Well, I threw another curve because he looked sick on the first two.\\" Maldonado, for his part, said \\"I figured after he made me look so bad the first two that he wasn't going to change, and I guess I guessed right.\\" Ward, the winner of Game 2, got his second victory of the series. The loss went to Avery as he was responsible for the lead runner (Alomar) on base when the game ended. Reardon would not pitch again in the series after his back to back poor performances, and would not pitch in a postseason game again in his career before his 1994 retirement. =Game 4= The Braves continued to employ the short rotation they had used during the postseason and sent Tom Glavine, the Game 1 winner, out for his second start of the series, bypassing 15-game-winner Charlie Leibrandt, who had only seen mop-up duty for Atlanta in Games 5 and 6 of the NLCS. For the Blue Jays, veteran Jimmy Key was given the start. Key had been with the Blue Jays since 1984 and was one of several players from their first ever division champion squad that were still with the team. However, he had not performed particularly well during the season and Cito Gaston had not included him in the ALCS rotation; Key only pitched in Toronto's Game 5 loss in relief. The Braves began the game with a single off the bat of Otis Nixon, who was a threat to steal a base. Although Key managed to pick Nixon off of first, he immediately gave up a single to Jeff Blauser, hitting second in place of the resting Deion Sanders, and allowed him to steal second. Key neutralized the threat by forcing Terry Pendleton to line out and Lonnie Smith to ground out. Over the next six innings, the Braves only recorded one hit (another single by Nixon) and did not advance the runner past first base. In the third inning, the Blue Jays scored their first run when Pat Borders hit a home run. They added a second run in the bottom of the seventh, which would prove decisive, when Kelly Gruber scored on a single by Devon White with two out. The Braves broke through against Key in the eighth. Ron Gant, starting in place of Sanders, led off with a double. Brian Hunter, starting at first base in place of Sid Bream, followed by beating out a bunt down the third base line to put runners on the corners with nobody out. Key recorded back-to-back outs, retiring Damon Berryhill on a failed sacrifice bunt attempt that didn't advance the runners and getting Mark Lemke to ground out to third. On the Lemke play, Gant scored the Braves' first run of the game and with the tying run now in scoring position as Hunter advanced to second on the groundout, Key was removed from the game. On his way off the field, he tipped his cap to the fans as they gave him a standing ovation. Duane Ward was brought in for his third consecutive appearance and his first batter was Nixon, who had recorded two of the Braves' hits. Although Ward got Nixon to strike out swinging, the third strike got past Borders and Nixon took off for first base. Nixon then stole second to put the go-ahead runs in scoring position, with Hunter having advanced to third on the wild pitch. Blauser, however, ended the inning by grounding out to Olerud. Tom Henke closed the game for the Blue Jays by retiring Pendleton, Smith, and David Justice in order in the ninth and Toronto found itself a win away from becoming the first world championship team from outside the United States. Tom Glavine would pitch another solid complete game, but his bad luck in the postseason continued and he was charged with a loss--the third time he had lost a post-season game despite turning in a very solid outing, previously losing a 1‚Äì0 game to Pittsburgh and a 3‚Äì2 game to Minnesota (in which two of the three runs were unearned) along with the 2‚Äì1 loss in this game. He would later add another hard-luck World Series loss four years later despite another stellar outing giving up one earned run and four hits in seven innings. In what proved to be his last start for the Blue Jays after nine years, Key recorded his first victory in the postseason since he won Game 3 of the 1989 ALCS. =Game 5= Down three games to one and facing elimination, the Braves returned John Smoltz to the mound for Game 5, who was still seeking his first World Series win after three previous solid starts all resulted in no decision. Jack Morris, who had lost Game 1 of the series, was given the start for Toronto. Before the game Terry Pendleton, who had seen a 3‚Äì1 lead evaporate in the World Series before (having been a member of the 1985 St. Louis Cardinals), reminded his teammates that the possibility still existed that they may win the series. The middle of the Braves' lineup, which consisted that evening of Pendleton hitting third, David Justice fourth, and Lonnie Smith fifth, had been struggling with the rest of the team and to that point, none of the batters hitting in those three slots (Pendleton, Justice, Smith, or Sid Bream who had hit fifth in the first two games in Atlanta) had recorded an extra base hit. The Braves took care of that statistic quickly. Otis Nixon led the game off for the Braves with a ground rule double due to fan interference. After Deion Sanders struck out, Nixon stole third as Pendleton batted. He then scored as Pendleton responded with a double of his own to right field, scoring the first run of the game and giving Justice a chance to drive in a runner in scoring position. Morris settled down, however, and retired Justice on a strikeout and Smith on a flyball to end the inning. The Blue Jays tied the game in the bottom of the second. With one out, John Olerud singled and Candy Maldonado reached on a walk. Smoltz struck out Kelly Gruber for the second out, but Pat Borders responded with a double. The slow- footed Olerud was sent home on the play and the throw to the plate was wide, which enabled him to score and put Maldonado on third with the lead run. Manuel Lee ended the threat, however, by lining out to Pendleton. The fourth inning saw the teams exchange runs again. In the visiting half, Justice led off with a home run for a 2‚Äì1 lead. Morris quickly retired Smith and Sid Bream, however, and Borders threw Jeff Blauser out stealing to keep the deficit at one. In the bottom half, Olerud and Maldonado reached base in front of Borders with one out, and as he had in the second inning he drove in Olerud with a single. But once again, the Blue Jays could not score the lead run as Lee grounded into a fielder's choice which forced Maldonado out at third and Smoltz struck Devon White out with Borders at second. Morris started the fifth inning by striking out Damon Berryhill, whose home run in Game 1 saddled him with the loss, and forcing Mark Lemke to ground out. Nixon followed with his second hit of the game, then stole his second base of the game to put himself in scoring position. Sanders followed with a single to score Nixon, bringing Pendleton back to the plate. The third baseman followed with another hit that a fan reached over the fence and touched. This forced Sanders, who had rounded third and was on his way to score the Braves' second run of the inning, to return to third base. However, the Braves now had two runners in scoring position instead of one and Justice, coming off his home run an inning earlier, was due up. With Toronto now behind by a run at 3-2 and with his ace in trouble, Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston decided to make a strategic play with the struggling Smith on deck. In a move mirroring the one he made in the eighth inning of Game 3, Gaston put Justice on with an intentional walk and decided to take his chances with the Braves' designated hitter. Smith to this point in the series had only recorded one hit, coming after the aforementioned intentional walk to Justice two nights earlier and resulting in a run. Seeing the same strategic play angered the veteran Smith, who recalled that he felt insulted to be thought of in that way, believing they saw him as \\"an easy out\\" and would be able to escape the inning without further damage.1992 World Series: Toronto Blue Jays vs. Atlanta Braves. Major League Baseball Productions, 1992. Smith fouled the first pitch off, then took a ball to even the count. Morris got Smith to foul off the next pitch, leaving him one strike away from escaping the jam and leaving the Braves with the bases loaded. Smith, however, was determined to make the Blue Jays pay for disrespecting his ability and after he fouled off two more pitches, he deposited Morris' sixth pitch over the wall and into the Atlanta bullpen. The grand slam home run gave the Braves a five-run lead and Gaston finally removed his starter from the game. David Wells retired Bream to end the inning, with the Blue Jays trailing 7‚Äì2. Smoltz pitched into the seventh inning giving up one hit afterward, a single to Dave Winfield in the bottom of the fifth. After walking Lee to lead off the seventh, he was pulled in favor of Mike Stanton, who got White to ground into a fielder's choice and then induced a double play from Roberto Alomar to end the threat. The Blue Jays only received one more baserunner the rest of the night as Joe Carter singled, stole second, then advanced to third on a sacrifice fly by Ed Sprague in the eighth inning but got nothing additional. Meanwhile, the Toronto relief corps of Wells, Mike Timlin, and Mark Eichhorn managed to keep the Braves in check from the remainder of the game. Atlanta threatened one more time in the ninth with one out as Lemke, Nixon, and Sanders all reached base, but Todd Stottlemyre induced a fly ball out to Maldonado off the bat of Pendleton and Lemke was thrown out trying to score. Smoltz took the win, his first ever World Series victory, with Stanton getting the save and Morris taking his second loss. Morris would not pitch another postseason game after this, with Smith being the last batter he would face in the postseason. With Smoltz and Morris earning the decisions, this was, to date, the last World Series game in which both the winning and losing pitcher were later inducted into the Hall of Fame until 2001. Atlanta's offensive outburst ensured the series would return to the United States for at least one more game and dashed the Blue Jays' hopes of clinching the World Series at home on Canadian soil. The Braves would return home looking to force second straight Game 7 of the World Series, and potentially supplant the 1985 Kansas City Royals as the most recent team to come back from 3-1 down to win the World Series. Smoltz's win in Game 5 was the first of only two World Series wins he recorded in his Hall of Fame career. After recording three no decisions in as many starts (Games 4 and 7 in 1991 and Game 2 in this series), Smoltz would go another four years before winning another World Series game before winning Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. His overall record in World Series play was 2-2, despite a track record of seven quality starts out of eight. He lost Game 5 in 1996, 1-0 (the one run was unearned) and Game 4 in 1999. Smoltz's only other World Series start was in the 1995 World Series and this was his only poor start in a World Series, but this one also resulted in a no decision in Game 3 after the Braves rallied to force extra innings. Morris, meanwhile, continued his struggles in the 1992 postseason. In four total appearances, Morris allowed a total of 19 runs and went 0‚Äì3 with an ERA above 7.00. In the World Series alone, his ERA was 8.44, over seven points higher than his performance the year before when he recorded a 1.17 ERA. Game 5 would be his last postseason appearance for his career; Morris was injured toward the end of the following season and did not pitch in the postseason. He would retire from baseball in 1995. Smith's grand slam was the first in a World Series since 1988, when Jose Canseco hit one in the Oakland Athletics' eventual 5‚Äì4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smith became the first player to hit one for the winning team since Kent Hrbek did so in Game 6 of the 1987 World Series for the Minnesota Twins, and was the last for a player on the visiting team until Addison Russell did so in Game 6 of the 2016 World Series for the Chicago Cubs. =Game 6= The sixth game saw Steve Avery return to the mound for Atlanta in an attempt to make up for his Game 3 loss. Toronto countered with Game 2 starter David Cone, who received a no-decision after Ed Sprague's heroics saved him from a loss. After playing the middle three games as the Blue Jays' designated hitter, Dave Winfield returned to playing right field as he had done in the first two games in Atlanta. Cito Gaston elected to start Joe Carter at first base again, as he had done in Game 1. The Blue Jays got on the board right out of the gate when David Justice misplayed a line drive by Carter to right field scoring Devon White who had singled. In the third, Atlanta's surprise hero of the Series Deion Sanders doubled off Carter's glove and scored when Terry Pendleton hit a sacrifice fly. Candy Maldonado responded by hitting a home run in the top of the fourth to give Toronto the lead again. The Blue Jays threatened again later in the inning as catcher Pat Borders reached on a double with one out. Three batters later, Borders attempted to score on a single and was thrown out at the plate by Sanders. The Braves threatened in the bottom of the fifth against Cone, as Mark Lemke walked to lead off the inning and advanced to third on a single by Sanders with two out. However, after Sanders stole second to put the go ahead run in scoring position, Terry Pendleton struck out to end the inning. Neither team saw a runner reach third base in the sixth, seventh, or eighth. Cone left the game after six innings and gave way to Todd Stottlemyre, who recorded the first two outs of the seventh, and David Wells, who finished the inning. Duane Ward, who had won Games 2 and 3 of the series, shut down the Braves in the eighth. Avery was pulled after the fourth inning, but Pete Smith, Mike Stanton and Mark Wohlers combined for five scoreless innings and kept the score at 2-1 entering the home half of the ninth inning. With the Blue Jays three outs away from baseball history, Gaston again turned to his closer Tom Henke. He and his fellow relievers had not given up an earned run in the previous 77 postseason innings to this point, and the Blue Jays had also not blown any of their save opportunities in the ALCS or World Series. Jeff Blauser led off the inning with a single and with Damon Berryhill batting next, Braves manager Bobby Cox called for a sacrifice bunt. Berryhill, who had not been called on to sacrifice to advance a runner in either the regular season or the NLCS and also had a failed bunt attempt in a crucial point in game 4, did as he was asked and successfully Blauser moved into scoring position with one out. Cox then called Lemke back to the dugout and sent up Lonnie Smith, whose home rn in Game 5 clinched the victory and gave Atlanta the opportunity to play Game 6, to pinch hit. Smith got behind 0-2 but battled back to work the count full and drew a walk on the eighth pitch of the at bat. With his World Series hero now carrying the game winning run, Cox decided to call on the man whose single in Game 7 of the NLCS got the Braves into the Series and sent Francisco Cabrera to bat for the pitcher Wohlers. Once again, Henke was drawn into an eight pitch at bat, but he managed to record the second out when Cabrera lined out to left. Maldonado, however, had to leap at the last second to catch the ball as he initially lost sight of it. Otis Nixon stood in against Henke next with his team down to its final out. After quickly picking up two strikes, Nixon slapped a single to left field. Blauser rounded third as Maldonado came up throwing, and he scored standing up as the throw sailed past Borders and into the protective netting behind home plate. With the save now blown, the scoreless innings streak over, and Smith, the winning run, advancing to third on the wild throw, Henke faced off with Ron Gant and retired him on a fly ball to end the inning. For the second consecutive year, Game 6 of the World Series was headed to extra innings. Atlanta called on Charlie Leibrandt to make his first series appearance in the top of the tenth with Maldonado, Kelly Gruber, and Borders due to bat. He was able to retire Maldonado, and after giving up a single to Gruber (his first hit since his Game 3 homer) Leibrandt got Borders to fly out. Pat Tabler, hitting for the light-hitting Manuel Lee, then lined out to the mound to retire the side. Henke started the bottom of the tenth by getting Pendleton to ground out. With two lefties coming up next, Gaston brought Game 4 winner Jimmy Key in on short rest to face Justice and Sid Bream. He responded by inducing two groundouts of his own to keep the game even. Leibrandt started the visiting 11th by retiring Key on a foul pop. He followed that by hitting lead-off man Devon White with a pitch on a 1-2 count, and then allowed a single to Roberto Alomar to advance White to second. On the CBS television broadcast, analyst Tim McCarver theorized that with right- handed batters Carter and Winfield coming to the plate, Cox would bring in Jeff Reardon to pitch. Although Reardon was warming in the bullpen and had been ready for some time, he also had not pitched after his back-to-back bad outings in Games 2 and 3 (taking the loss and a blown save in game 2) where he allowed the winning runs to score. Perhaps having that in mind, Cox stuck with the veteran Leibrandt and he rewarded his manager by recording the second out as Carter flied to center. This brought a struggling Dave Winfield to the plate. Winfield, to this point in the series, was hitting below .250 and was hitless in his four previous at-bats in the game. He had also struggled in his only other appearance in the World Series (he had hit just .045), when he was a member of the 1981 New York Yankees team that lost that year's World Series. But he had had success against Leibrandt previously, with a lifetime average against him of .302 including four home runs. Additionally, Winfield was known to feast on off-speed pitches like changeups, which were also Leibrandt's strength, while Reardon in the bullpen was more of a fastball pitcher, making Cox's move more questionable in sticking with Leibrandt. He was worked to a full count by the 41-year-old veteran outfielder, and on the sixth pitch of the at-bat Winfield connected on a line drive down the left field line. White scored from second and after the ball took a bad hop off the left field corner and skipped away from Gant, Alomar scored without a play. Winfield's hit was his first career World Series extra-base hit, and at 41 he was the oldest player in baseball history to record one in the World Series. Leibrandt managed to retire Maldonado to end the inning, but as he had done in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series, he gave up a run-scoring extra base hit to give the opposing team the lead; in that game, he allowed a walk-off home run by Kirby Puckett which forced Game 7. It was also the last time Leibrandt pitched for the Braves; he would retire after spending 1993 with the Texas Rangers. With a two-run lead, Gaston sent Key out for the last half of the inning to try and pick up his second win of the series. Blauser, as he had done in the ninth inning, led off with a single. On the very next pitch, Berryhill hit a ground ball to short that appeared to be an easy double play ball. However, the ball took a strange hop at the last moment and handcuffed veteran shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who had entered the game in the tenth as a replacement for Lee and was normally a sure-handed fielder. Blauser advanced to third on the error, and Cox sent pitcher John Smoltz in to run for the slow-footed Berryhill. Light-hitting Rafael Belliard, who had taken Lemke's place in the field and in the lineup, stepped in to take his first at bat and Cox called for a sacrifice to move Smoltz into scoring position. With one out and the tying runs now both in scoring position, Brian Hunter was called on to pinch hit for Leibrandt. Key forced him to ground out to Carter at first, and while Blauser scored, the Braves were in the same position they were in two innings earlier: tying run on base, two outs, and Otis Nixon batting. As Nixon was announced, Gaston made his way to the mound to discuss strategy with his infielders. As the Blue Jays knew, Nixon was one of the fastest players in the game; he was one of two players, Sanders being the other, to record five stolen bases in the series. As many speedy players are known to do, Nixon would lay down bunts from time to time and try to beat them out for base hits. Although doing so resulted in a relatively simple putout if not done properly, and despite the Braves being down to their last out, the Blue Jays still needed to consider the possibility of Nixon bunting. With this in mind, Gaston signaled to the Toronto bullpen to bring in Mike Timlin for his second appearance in the series. This move confused McCarver and his broadcast partner Sean McDonough, who believed Key was staying in the game. Nixon, in addition to all of the aforementioned attributes, was a switch hitter who had better statistics as a right-handed batter. (For the season he had batted .343 right-handed and .263 left-handed.) Since Timlin was a right-handed pitcher, Nixon would be hitting from his weaker side. But at the same time, the left-handed batter's box is located closer to the first base line than the right-handed box, which would give Nixon a faster jump toward first if he bunted. As the conference ended, Carter said to Timlin to be aware that the bunt was a possibility and \\"be careful\\". After fouling off the first pitch, Nixon did indeed lay down a bunt. Having listened to Carter, Timlin was able to field the ball quickly and throw to Carter at first in time to clinch the series for the Blue Jays. In the ensuing celebration Carter was trying to hold onto the ball. Timlin stopped him as he was celebrating and asked for the ball, as even though Carter had recorded the last out Timlin had gotten the save, and said to him \\"gimme the ball, that's my save, that's my World Series save\\". With mock anger of resignation, Carter slammed the ball into Timlin's mitt but then hugged him joyfully. The next year Carter managed to keep the ball from the last at-bat of the World Series, as he would be the final batter and won the Series with a home run. Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston became the first African American manager to win a World Series. American League president Dr. Bobby Brown presented the World Series Trophy in the place of the commissioner. Just a month earlier, Fay Vincent was forced to resign and was replaced by Bud Selig (then owner of the Milwaukee Brewers) on what was originally perceived to be an \\"interim basis.\\" Dr. Brown also presented the Blue Jays the trophy in 1993. The last World Series not to be presided over by a Commissioner until this year had taken place in 1919; Selig officially became Commissioner of Baseball in 1998. It also marked the first world championship for the city of Toronto since the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs won the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals. Composite box 1992 World Series (4‚Äì2): Toronto Blue Jays (A.L.) over Atlanta Braves (N.L.) This World Series is notable for being one of the few six-game series in which the winning team was outscored. It happened previously in 1918, 1959, and 1977; later in 1996 and 2003. Seven-game winners were outscored in 1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1991, 1997, and 2002; (equaled in 2016 and 2017). Broadcasting At 30 years of age, CBS' Sean McDonough became the youngest man to call all nine innings and games of a World Series (while serving as a full network television employee). Although Vin Scully and Al Michaels were several years younger when they called their first World Series (1955 and 1972 respectively), they were products of the then broadcasting policy of announcers representing the participating teams (a process that ended following the 1976 World Series). McDonough's record would subsequently be broken by Fox's Joe Buck, who at 27 years of age, called the 1996 World Series. Coincidentally, it was Joe Buck's father, Jack, that McDonough had replaced as CBS's lead play-by-play man. Serving as field reporters for CBS's coverage were Jim Kaat (in the Braves' dugout) and Lesley Visser (in the Blue Jays' dugout). The Series drew an overall Nielsen rating of 20.2, down from the previous year's 24.0 but higher than that of any subsequent World Series. CBS Radio also broadcast the Series nationally, with Vin Scully and Johnny Bench announcing. Locally, the Series was called on WGST-AM in Atlanta by Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Ernie Johnson, Joe Simpson, and Don Sutton, and on CJCL-AM in Toronto by Jerry Howarth and Tom Cheek.

In their short but successful career their achievements included reaching the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart with four singles (\\"Everything\\", \\"Can't Get You Out of My Thoughts\\", \\"You Do Something To Me\\" and \\"Army of Two\\") and playing at Wembley Stadium with Bon Jovi and at Hyde Park, London with Elton John, Christina Aguilera and Destiny's Child. After selling out a final UK tour, they decided to part ways at the peak of their popularity under a shroud of mystery. Their principal songwriter/lead vocalist Josh Doyle is now resident in Nashville, Tennessee. After years in the musical wilderness he emerged in 2012 to make his network TV debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, with his new band and a single \\"Solarstorms\\". Billboard magazine wrote in their 7 November 2012 issue \\"615 Spotlight\\" feature, that Doyle \\"may well be the Next Big Thing on an international level\\".615 Spotlight: Josh Doyle Breaks Through. Billboard. Retrieved on 2013-02-04. Career Originally formed in 1997, straight out of school, the band spent their early years gigging in small venues and songwriting. They signed a management contract with Modernwood Management, and then signed to Wildstar Records in March 1999. In the same month they went on their first UK tour, supporting fellow Modernwood artist, Nik Kershaw. A more extensive tour in September, supporting My Life Story, followed. It was on this tour that the band began to build up their fanbase, selling a two-track CD known as \\"The Blue CD\\" that contained the tracks \\"Everything\\" and \\"Until My Ship Comes In\\". Dum Dums' debut single, \\"Everything\\", produced by Steve Power was released on 28 February 2000. Accompanied by a video and A-listing on British radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, it reached 21 in the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Thoughts\\" was released on 26 June 2000 and reached number 18 in the UK chart. On 18 September 2000, their debut album, It Goes Without Saying, again produced by Power, was released in the UK. It received favourable reviews from the music press, with the band being compared to Green Day, The Police, Blink-182, Elvis Costello and The Jam. The album comprised eleven listed tracks and an unlisted bonus track, revealed as \\"Setting Sail\\" in the liner notes. A third single, \\"You Do Something To Me\\" was released a week prior to the album, and this reached number 27. The music video for this song, inspired by Queen's \\"I Want to Break Free\\" promo, featured Doyle and Wilkinson in drag. The song was used as the theme tune to the CBBC show Xchange, and they performed the song on the last episode of the series. They supported Bon Jovi at Wembley Stadium and also performed at Glastonbury, T in the Park, V2000 and several roadshows and outdoor gigs organised by local radio stations. In October they played 22 shows at arenas around the country supporting Robbie Williams. The year ended with another headline tour, with a final gig at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire on 19 December. There was also TV exposure on shows such as The Big Breakfast, CD:UK, and The Pepsi Chart. Doyle also appeared as a panellist on the BBC Two quiz show, Never Mind The Buzzcocks. The final single from their debut album, \\"Army of Two\\" was released on 5 February 2001. It reached number 27 in the UK Singles Chart; exactly matching the chart placings of both \\"You Do Something To Me\\" and It Goes Without Saying. There were three acoustic performances at Tower Records in London, Birmingham and Southampton to promote the release. UK gigs in 2001 mainly consisted of appearances at University Summer Balls. The band also travelled to Germany and Japan for tours with Wheatus and The PeteBest. They entered the Japanese Top 20 with \\"Everything\\". The band went into the studio on three occasions in 2001, recording demo versions of the songs that would eventually comprise their second album. A session in February resulted in five new tracks being laid down, including \\"Photographs\\", which was played many times on tour in 2000. Another session in April saw ten tracks recorded, and a final session in June, just prior to their Japanese tour, yielded another four tracks. By mutual agreement the band decided to break up, and announced via their website that their last concert would be at the Greenbelt Festival in August 2001. The set at the last gig included a new song that had been demoed, called \\"Travelling at Speed\\". Doyle has had a re-emergence as a US-based singer-songwriter whilst Wilkinson and Clarke formed Rogue States. The band released b-sides under the title Dumdums in May 2018.

Classical liberals and conservatives generally argue that welfare and other tax-funded services reduce incentives to work, exacerbate the free-rider problem, and intensify poverty. On the other hand, socialists generally criticize welfare reform because it usually minimizes the public safety net and strengthens the capitalist economic system. Welfare reform is constantly debated because of the varying opinions on the government's determined balance of providing guaranteed welfare benefits and promoting self-sufficiency.  Regional examples   Overview  Within the last two decades, welfare systems have been under extreme scrutiny around the world. Demographic changes like the post-war \\"baby boom\\" followed by the subsequent \\"baby bust\\", coupled with economic shifts such as the 1970 oil shocks, led to aging populations and a dwindling working force. In turn, there became an increased dependency on social welfare systems, which inevitably brought up the issue of welfare reform. U.S systems primarily focused on reducing poor single-parents need for welfare, through employment incentives. The U.K focused primarily on reducing general unemployment through the New Deal. The Netherlands emphasized reforming disability programs, and Latin America focused primarily on pension reforms. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was one political leader who attempted to put an end to socialism by proposing government healthcare. He approved the 1883 Health Insurance Act which was the first to introduce compulsory government-monitored health insurance. The German legislation ensured contributory retirement and disability benefits. Participation became mandatory. Many historians trace the beginnings of contemporary welfare in Europe and America to Bismarck's Health Insurance law. However, this welfare program intended for the working class was practiced by the Roman Empire, China's Song Dynasty, and the 7th Century Islamic System. In the United States, the Great Depression and 1929 crash of the stock market contributed significantly to the formation of the concept of welfare as many Americans struggled economically during those times. = United States = President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his administration's War on Poverty in 1964 as the poverty rate increased by 19%. He funded welfare programs like Social Security, Food Stamps, Job Corps, and Head Start. The War on Poverty included programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. It provided the first direct federal assistance for school districts, milestone environmental law, urban renewal, civil rights, subsidy for bilingual education, and national donations for arts and humanities. President Richard Nixon's administration proposed the 1969 Family Assistance Plan, which would require all welfare recipients, excluding mothers with children under the age of three, to work. This program stopped in 1972 and liberals criticized the plan for providing too little support, and requiring too strict of work regulations. Instead of welfare reforms, the government ended up providing major expansions to welfare programs during this presidency. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan cut Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) spending and gave states the option of requiring welfare recipients to participate in workfare programs. Charles Murray's book Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950‚Äì1980 (1984) argued that the Welfare state actually harms the poor, especially single-parent families, by making them increasingly dependent on the government, and discouraging them from working. Murray proposed that current welfare programs be replaced by short-term local programs.\\"Welfare.\\" West's Encyclopedia of American Law. . Encyclopedia.com. 6 Mar. 2018 . Overall decline in welfare monthly benefits (in 2006 dollars)2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Figure TANF 2. On August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). Clinton's reform aligned closely with Charles Murray. In his 1992 campaign Clinton promised to ‚Äúend welfare as we have come to know it.‚Äù Staying true to his promise, he instated one of the most well-known welfare reforms in US History.[Clinton, Bill (October 23, 1991). \\"The New Covenant: Responsibility and Rebuilding the American Community. Remarks to Students at Georgetown University\\".Democratic Leadership Council. Retrieved 2018-03-08.] PRWORA instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) to replace the AFDC, the former welfare program providing cash to poor families since 1935. TANF instated work restrictions in order for recipients to qualify for aid. TANF also shifted welfare to the state governments, where each state was given an allocation of money to be used for this program, as long as there existed work requirements, and a five- year limit for families on welfare.[Schott, Liz. 2011. Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Accessed 03/07/2018 from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id;=936] The general premise behind this reform was that aid should not be a one-way handout. State governments have established and currently administer welfare programs for the welfare of the impoverished but operating in accordance with guidelines of the federal government. Funds for these programs are remitted to states in the form of block grants giving them more flexibility in making decisions on how money will be allocated among different welfare programs. = United Kingdom =  New Deal  In recent years reform of the welfare system in Britain began with the introduction of the New Deal programme introduced by the Labour government in 1997. The aim of this programme was to increase employment through requiring that recipients make serious efforts to seek employment. The Labour Party also introduced a system of tax credits for low- income workers.  Welfare Reform Act 2007  The Welfare Reform Act 2007 provides for \\"an employment and support allowance, a contributory allowance, [and] an income-based allowance.\\". The objectives of the Welfare Reform Act of 2007 were to increase the employment rate to 80% from 75%, to assist 300,000 single parents find employment, to increase the number of workers over 50 by 1 million, and to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits by 2 million  Welfare Reform Act 2009  This welfare reform proposed an increase of personal responsibility within the welfare system. The reform eliminated Income support, and allocated funds over to the Jobseeker's allowance, to encourage employment. It also encouraged increased parental responsibility by amending child support laws, and requiring births be registered jointly by both parents.‚ÄúWelfare Reform Act 2009.‚Äù Welfare Reform Act 2009 - UK Parliament, services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/welfarereform.html.  Welfare Reform Act 2012  This welfare reform proposed changes to the Housing Benefit, which reduced the benefit paid to recipients depending on the size of their living space. This act got the nickname of the ‚ÄúBedroom Tax.‚Äù from the media. It was stated that similarly to other welfare reforms, this act would reduce welfare dependency. = France = Beginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the social insurance program began to appear. The deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous amount of opposition to the program as it stands. In February 2020, a pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution. = Brazil = During the 2015‚Äì2018 Brazilian economic crisis, there has been both economic and political turmoil. President Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached and replaced by President Michel Temer, strived to expand the social welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia instated by her predecessor Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. As a social-democrat, Rousseff pledged that \\"Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility.\\"AFP. \\"Nos EUA, Dilma se manifesta contra privatiza√ß√£o de empresas do setor el√©trico e da Petrobras\\". Zero Hora. 6 March 2018. When Michel Temer took office, to cope with the severe economic recession, he proposed social welfare reforms to change labor rules and the social security pension system. Temer's plan included limiting pension benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save money and fix the economy. Additionally, under his reform, companies have greater power to require longer work days and use part-time workers. In response to this reform, labor unions, rural workers, and government employees held protests all over Brazil.Voa. ‚ÄúBrazilians Protest against President's Reform Plan.‚Äù VOA, VOA, 17 Mar. 2017, learningenglish.voanews.com/a/brazilians-protest- against-presidents-reform-plan/3769485.html. The vote to approve the pension reform was first suspended until February 2018, and now has been further postponed as a campaign issue in this year's election. Temer's critics believe that the reason for the postponed reform is its vast public disapproval.Boadle, Anthony (19 February 2018). \\"Brazil Government Acknowledges Pension Bill Going Nowhere\\".

Historically one of the first planned cities within British India, it has long since developed into a cosmopolitan metropolis. Faisalabad was restructured into city district status; a devolution promulgated by the 2001 local government ordinance (LGO). The total area of Faisalabad District is while the area controlled by the Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) is . Faisalabad has grown to become a major industrial and distribution centre because of its central location in the region and connecting roads, rails, and air transportation. It has been referred to as the \\"Manchester of Pakistan\\". , GDP (PPP) of Faisalabad was estimated as $43 billion and projected to rise to $87 billion in 2025 at a growth rate of 5.7%.http://faisalabad.dc.lhc.gov.pk/PublicPages/HistoryOfDistrict.aspx Faisalabad contributes over 20 percent to the Punjab's GDP and has an average annual GDP (nominal) of $20.5 billion. Agriculture and industry remain its hallmark.  History  = Toponymy = The Faisalabad district actually began as the Lyallpur district in 1904, and, prior to that, was a tehsil of the Jhang district.This city was made by Rai Bahadur Bhavanidas Sikka. During the British Raj in colonial India, the city of Lyallpur was named in honour of the then Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Sir James Broadwood Lyall, for his services in the colonisation of the lower Chenab Valley. The surname Lyall was joined with the noun pur, meaning 'city' in Sanskrit. On 1st September 1977,https://www.tuf.edu.pk/history- faisalabad#:~:text=In%201977%2C%20the%20name%20of,Jhang%20and%20Toba%20Tek%20Singh. the Government of Pakistan changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to Faisalabad ('City of Faisal') in honour of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who made several financial contributions to Pakistan. = Early settlements = According to the University of Faisalabad, the city of Faisalabad traces its origins to the 18th century, when the land was inhabited by a number of forest-dwelling tribes. It is believed these early settlements belonged to the ancient districts of Jhang and Sandalbar, which included the area between Shahdara to Shorekot and Sangla Hill to Toba Tek Singh. The Faisalabad area is developed in the old area of Paki Mari. The shrine of Baba Noor Shah Wali was erected in this area before the development of Faisalabad.https://pakvoter.org/wp- content/pdfs/Punjab%20Local%20Government%20Elections%202016/Faisalabad.pdf = Colonial rule = By the mid-18th century, the economic and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire, from Punjab to Bengal, led to its dissolution. Internal unrest resulted in multiple battles for independence and further deterioration of the region, which then led to formal colonialisation as established by the Government of India Act 1858, with direct control under the British Rajfrom 1858 to 1947. Quote: \\"When the formal rule of the Company was replaced by the direct rule of the British Crown in 1858, ....\\" Quote: \\"... Company rule in India lasted effectively from the Battle of Plassey in 1757 until 1858, when following the 1857 Indian Rebellion, the British Crown assumed direct colonial rule of India in the new British Raj.\\" In 1880, Poham Young CIE, a British colonial officer, proposed construction of a new strategic town within the area. His proposal was supported by Sir James Broadwood Lyall and the city of Lyall was developed. Historically, Faisalabad, (Lyallpur until 1979), became one of the first planned cities within British India. Young designed the city centre to replicate the design in the Union Jack with eight roads extending from a large clock tower at its epicentre; a design geometrically symbolic of the Cross of Saint Andrew counterchanged with the Cross of Saint Patrick, and Saint George's Cross over all. The eight roads developed into eight separate bazaars (markets) leading to different regions of the Punjab. In 1892, the newly constructed town with its growing agricultural surplus was added to the British rail network. Construction of the rail link between Wazirabad and Lyallpur was completed in 1895. In 1896, Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal comprising the Tehsils of Lyallpur were under the administrative control of the Jhang District. In 1904, the new district of Lyallpur was formed to include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which later became a full tehsil in itself. The University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur, was established in 1906. The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool and grain centre. The 1930s brought industrial growth and market expansion to the textile industry as well as to food processing, grain crushing and chemicals. = Independence = In August 1947, following three decades of nationalist struggles, India and Pakistan achieved independence. The British agreed to partition colonial India into two sovereign states ‚Äì Pakistan with a Muslim majority, and India with a Hindu majority; however, more Muslims remained in India than what governing authorities believed would assimilate into Pakistan. The partitioning led to a mass migration of an estimated 10 million people which made it the largest mass migration in human history. India's Bengal province was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal (India), and the Punjab Province was divided into Punjab (West Pakistan) and Punjab, India. There were also respective divisions of the British Indian Army, the Indian Civil Service, various administrative services, the central treasury, and the railways. Riots and local fighting followed the expeditious withdrawal of the British, resulting in an estimated one million civilians deaths, particularly in the western region of Punjab. Lyallpur, which was located in the region of the Punjab Province that became West Pakistan, was populated by a number of Hindus and Sikhs who migrated to India, while Muslim refugees from India settled in the district. In 1977, Pakistani authorities changed the name of the city to \\"Faisalabad\\" to honour the close relationship of Faisal of Saudi Arabia with Pakistan. During the eighties, the city realised an increase in foreign investment. More Faisalabadis began working abroad as bilateral ties improved within the new dominion. This led to more monetary funds returning to the city that aided the development of the region. In 1985, the city was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh.  Government and public services  = Civic administration = Faisalabad was restructured into city district status; a devolution promulgated by the 2001 local government ordinance (LGO). It is governed by the city district's seven departments: Agriculture, Community Development, Education, Finance and Planning, Health, Municipal Services, and Works and Services. The district coordination officer of Faisalabad (DCO) is head of the city district government and responsible for co-ordinating and supervising the administrative units. Each of the seven departments has its own Executive District Officer who is charged with co-ordinating and overseeing the activities of their respective departments. The aim of the city district government is to empower politics by improving governance which basically involved decentralising administrative authority with the establishment of different departments and respective department heads, all working under one platform. The stated vision and mission of the city district government of Faisalabad is to \\"establish an efficient, effective and accountable city district government, which is committed to respecting and upholding women, men and children's basic human rights, responsive towards people's needs, committed to poverty reduction and capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. Our actions will be driven by the concerns of local people.\\" = Tehsil municipal administration = In 2005, Faisalabad was reorganised as a city district composed of eight Tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) or towns as follows: Lyallpur, Madina, Jinnah, Iqbal, Chak Jhumra, Jaranwala, Samundari, and Tandlianwala. The functions of the TMA include preparation of the spatial and land use plans, management of these development plans and exercise of control over land use, land sub-division, land development and zoning by public and private sectors, enforcement of municipal laws, rules and by-laws, provision and management of water, drainage waste and sanitation along with allied municipal services. There are 118 union councils in Faisalabad. Their role is to collect and maintain statistical information for socio-economic surveys. They consolidate ward neighbourhood development needs and prioritise these into union-wide development proposals. The council identifies any deficiencies in the delivery of these services and makes recommendations for improvement to the TMA. = Faisalabad Development Authority = The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) was validly established in October 1976 under The Punjab Development of Cities Act (1976) to regulate, supervise and implement development activities in its jurisdiction area.Assessment of Land Development and Management Practices in Five Large Cities of Punjab The FDA acts as a policy-making body for the development of the city and is in charge of arranging and supervising major developments within the city. It is responsible for the administration of building regulations, management of parks and gardens and subsoil water management. The FDA works with the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to control and maintain the water supply, sewerage and drainage. The FDA works to improve conditions in the slums. = Healthcare = Healthcare services are provided to the citizens by both public and private sector hospitals. The government‚Äìrun hospitals are Allied Hospital, District HQ Hospital, Institute of Child Care, PINUM Cancer Hospital, Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (FIC) and General Hospitals in Ghulam Muhammadabad and Samanabad. There are a number of private hospitals, clinics and laboratories in the city. =Law enforcement= Law enforcement in Faisalabad is carried out by the city police, under the command of the city police officer (CPO), an appointment by the provincial government. The office of the CPO is located in the District Courts, Faisalabad. Various police formations include district police, elite police, traffic police, Punjab highway patrolling, investigation branch, and special branch. = Water supply and sanitation = The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) is a subsidiary of Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), established in 23 April 1978 under the Development of Cities Act 1976. Estimates in indicate that the WASA provides about 72% of the city's sewerage services and about 60% of their water services. The existing production capacity of the WASA is , almost all of which is drawn from wells located in the old beds of the Chenab River. From the wells, water is pumped to a terminal reservoir located on Sargodha Road. Water is normally supplied for a total of about 8 hours per day to the majority of the city. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided financial and hardware equipment to help improve the water and sanitation conditions in the city.  Geography  = Location = Faisalabad lies in the rolling flat plains of northeast Punjab, at above sea level. The city proper comprises approximately while the district encompasses more than . The Chenab River flows about , and the Ravi River meanders to the southeast. The lower Chenab canal provides water to 80% of cultivated lands making it the main source of irrigation. Faisalabad is bound on the north by Chiniot and Sheikhupura, on the east by Sheikhupura and Sahiwal, on the south by Sahiwal and Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang. = Geology = The district of Faisalabad is part of the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers. The soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion. Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower Rechna Doab, the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. There is a mild slope from the northeast to the southwest with an average fall of . The city is situated at an elevation of about . The topography is marked by valleys, local depression and high ground.  Climate  Thunderstorm over the city, March 2020 The weather in the city is monitored by the Pakistan Meteorological Department. The Pakistan Meteorological Department regularly provides forecasts, public warnings and rainfall information to farmers with the assistance of the National Agromet Centre. Average annual rainfall is approximately . It is at its peak in July and August during monsoon season though western disturbances during winter months also bring considerable rainfall associated with hail.https://nation.com.pk/24-Jul-2019/rain-forecast- flood-warning-for-three-days Monsoon season which starts in July and ends in September brings heavy rain to the city causing flash flooding.https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/urban-flooding-likely-in- various-divisions-t-720528.htmlhttps://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/07/pdma-warns- of-urban-flooding-in-several-punjab-cities/ If the monsoon currents interact with the western disturbance, then cloudburst can also occur. July is the wettest month of the year during which flooding is reported number of times.https://www.dawn.com/news/1493771https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/503153-heavy- rains-pmd-issues-flood-landslide- alerthttps://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/501988-Heavy-monsoon-rain-lashes-parts- of-country Monsoon ends in September and then the dry period begins. October and November are the driest months with very little rainfall. During winter the weather usually remains cloudy associated with frequent fog. Record- breaking rainfall of was recorded on 5 September 1961 by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.Pakistan Meteorological Department http://www.pmd.gov.pk/ Retrieved 18 January 2016 The temperature of the city has reached a summer maximum record temperature of 48.0 ¬∞C (118.4 ¬∞F), which was observed on 9 June 1947 and again on 26 May 2010.http://rmcpunjab.pmd.gov.pk/P-historical.html An extreme minimum temperature of ‚àí4.0 ¬∞C (24.8 ¬∞F) was recorded on 15 January 1978. The highest wind gust ever recorded in Faisalabad occurred during a severe dust- thunderstorm on 2 June 2000, when the maximum wind speed reached 151 kilometers per hour (94 mph). Apart from temperature and rainfall records, the winds in Faisalabad are generally light. The city lies in an area with low wind speeds. Westerly breeze dominates the afternoons, while the nights are calm. Southeast / easterly winds are common here during the monsoon season. Faisalabad, being in the plains, can experience severe thunderstorms and high wind gusts that can be damaging to its crops.https://www.urdupoint.com/en/weather/faisalabad-receives-heavy- rain-663064.html  Demographics  Faisalabad was established as one of the first planned towns of British India, covering an area of .India Unbound: from Independence to the Global Information age by Gurcharan Das It was initially designed to accommodate 20,000 people. The city's population increased from 69,930 in 1941 to 179,000 in 1951 (152.2% increase). Much of the increase is attributed to the settlement of Muslim refugees from East Punjab and Haryana, India. In 1961, the population rose to 425,248, an increase of 137.4%. Faisalabad set a record in the demographic history of Pakistan by registering an overall population increase of 508.1% between 1941 and 1961. The industrial revolution of the 1960s contributed to population growth. In 1961, the population was 425,248. A 1972 census ranked Faisalabad as the 3rd largest city of Pakistan with a population of 864,000. In a 1981 census, the population was 1,092,000; however, the Faisalabad Development Authority estimated the number to be 1,232,000. In the 2017 consensus, the total population of the city was 3,203,846 = Religion and ethnic groups = The province of Punjab, in which Faisalabad is the second largest city, has prevalent sociocultural distinctions. Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure, high age dependency ratio, a higher percentage of males, a higher proportion of married population, and heterogeneity in castes and languages. Islam is the most common religion, with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet. Islamic influences are evident in the fundamental values of various inhabitants, including cultural traditions, marriage, education, diet, ceremonies and policies which may reflect the stark differences between rural villages and urban areas. People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions. Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and caste. However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly in the area of the dowry system. In the following ancient culture, marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers. In some instances, the husband must buy his wife from her parents. Marriage ceremonies, which can be more or less formal, include rituals which are universal in nature and hold sociological importance. Studies conducted in 2007 and 2013, the latter in an outlying rural village in Faisalabad District, acknowledged the existence of gender bias and discrimination against females, stating that \\"Gender discrimination is not a new phenomenon\\", and that it still exists in the modern world. It was further noted that situations may be worse in villages because \\"whenever a girl is born, nobody celebrates her birth, whereas when a boy is born, it means great joy and celebration.\\" Social change in the region has been a slow process but there are indications that change has occurred as more villages are exposed to various forms of media and modernized urban communities. It is further noted that there has been a \\"conscious and persistent effort\\" to educate rural and urban societies about gender bias and equality. In early 2014, there was a march known as the \\"White Ribbon Campaign\\" which took place in front of the Faisalabad Press Club. Protestors appealed to the government to adopt new laws \\"to protect women who are discriminated against in the family and workplace.\\" Prevalent minorities, particularly Hindu and Christian, feel a sense of vulnerability because of their religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste by virtue of their birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia. Economy GDP (PPP) of Faisalabad was estimated as $43 billion and projected to rise to $87 billion in 2025 at a growth rate of 5.7%. Faisalabad contributes over 5% toward Pakistan's annual GDP; therefore, it is often referred to as the \\"Manchester of Pakistan\\". Faisalabad's average annual GDP (nominal) is $20.55 billion (USD), of which 21% comes from agriculture. The surrounding countryside, irrigated by the lower Chenab River, produces agricultural commodities such as cotton, rice, sugarcane, wheat, fruit and vegetables. The city has carved a niche as an industrial centre with its highways, railways, railway repair yards, processing mills, and engineering works. It is a producer of industrial goods and textile manufacturing including cotton and silk textiles, super phosphates, hosiery, dyes, industrial chemicals, clothing, pulp and paper, printing, agricultural equipment, ghee (clarified butter), and beverages. The Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry monitors industrial activity in the city and reports their findings to the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and provincial government. The city has a major dry port and an international airport. Faisalabad is recognised as the centre of the textile industry in Pakistan, contributing to half of Pakistans total textile shipments. At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3 trillion rupees ($13.8 billion) in textile products, most of which were exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the textile industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost bilateral trade, Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city. The Faisalabad clock tower and its eight bazaars (markets) remain a major trading zone in the city. Each of the eight bazaars has a special name and is known for selling certain goods as follows: * Katchery Bazaar, named for the court (Katchery) is known for its mobile phone and accessory market. * Rail Bazar is a gold and cloth market. * Bhawana Bazaar supplies electrical and electronic goods. * Jhang Bazaar supplies fish, meat, vegetables and fruits. * Aminpur Bazaar supplies stationery and interior d√©cor. * Kharkhana Bazaar is known for herbal medicines. * Gol Bazaar contains dry fruit, as well as wholesale soap, oil, and ghee shops. * Chiniot Bazaar is known for allopathic and homoeopathic medicinal stores, cloth, blankets, sofa cloth, and curtains. It also has poultry feed wholesale shops. * Montgomery Bazaar (also known as Sutar Mandi) is known for yarn and raw cloth trading. Faisalabad has received substantial funding from the government of Punjab and the city district government to improve infrastructure and roads to rural areas. In an effort to deal with the energy crisis, the FCCI has been working with private companies to develop renewable energy resources such as solar energy and the construction of dams within the district. CAE, a German-based renewable energy company, has disclosed plans to establish the first solar panel manufacturing facility in Faisalabad, second of its kind in Asia, with intentions of investing upwards of ‚Ç¨100 million (Rs 12.9 billion) for its development.  Transportation  Faisalabad is well-connected by rail, road and air. Public transportation in Faisalabad includes auto-rickshaws, buses and railways. Faisalabad International Airport is located on the outskirts of the city, and operates flights to the Middle East. = Road = The majority of roads are under the control of the National Highway Authority, linking Faisalabad with other cities in the country. National highways and motorways passing through Faisalabad Faisalabad is connected to various parts of the country by several National Highways and Motorways: * The Grand Trunk Road, otherwise known as GT Road, is the original highway that links Faisalabad to most parts of Pakistan as well as neighbouring countries. GT Road was the main highway that ran through the district before the completion of the motorways. * The M3 motorway (Pakistan) or M3 is an access-controlled motorway connecting Faisalabad with the M2 motorway (Pakistan) or M2 via the Pindi Bhattian Interchange. The M2 was the first motorway connecting Rawalpindi and Islamabad to Lahore. * The M4 motorway (Pakistan) or M4 is an access-controlled motorway connecting Faisalabad to Multan. The M4 further joined the M5 which connects to the southern city of Sukkur. The district government has worked with the National Highway Authority to connect Multan and Faisalabad. The M4 was designed to reduce congestion, boost trade, and reduce travel times and transportation costs from Faisalabad, a major textile hub to the major trade centre of Multan. = Buses = The Faisalabad Urban Transport System Service (FUTS) the main bus operator within the city. It was launched in 1994, and operates a number of large CNG buses and smaller Toyota hiace vans connecting the majority of the city.Public Transport in Pakistan: A Critical Overview by Muhammad Imran There is another public-private run bus operator, Brothers Metro, which is a consortium between the government of Punjab and a private firm who operates a fleet of air-conditioned CNG buses. Now the Metro Brothers (MB), the project of buses are also launched in the city by the Punjab government. = Rail = The Faisalabad railway station is the central railway station in the city. The railway line forms part of the Khanewal‚ÄìWazirabad railway line. Rail services are operated by Pakistan Railways, owned and operated by the Ministry of Railways. Cargo Express services are operated by Pakistan Railways which runs from Karachi to Faisalabad via Multan. Twenty- seven bogies comprise the goods train, and are handled respectively by private contractors at the station. The station has a special cargo facility operated by the Ministry of Railways (Pakistan) for handling various goods from the city to other regions of the country. An express parcel service runs from Karachi to Lahore via Faisalabad. = Air traffic = Faisalabad International Airport is approximately from the city centre and is a major airport for domestic and international travel. The airport includes a cargo facility. As of January 2016, passenger flights are run by the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, and a number of middle eastern carriers. FlyDubai became the first international carrier to launch operations from the city followed by Qatar Airways, Air Arabia and Gulf Air. In 2015, significant upgrades and renovations to the airport were initiated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, including updates to aviation technology, construction of additional areas and services for travellers, and the expansion of air traffic capabilities to accommodate wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 777.  Culture  Faisalabad, the third most populated metropolis in Pakistan after Karachi and Lahore is an epicentre for trade that has gained popularity for its colonial heritage sites. In 1982, the Government of Punjab established the Faisalabad Arts Council, a division of the Punjab Arts Council which is overseen administratively by the Information, Culture and Youth Affairs Department. The Faisalabad Arts Council building, designed by architect Nayyer Ali Dada, was completed in 2006. The auditorium was named after the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, a Pakistani musician and singer. = Festivals = The Punjabi people celebrate a variety of cultural and religious festivals throughout the Punjab region, such as arts and craft, music, local events, and religious celebrations. The city of Faisalabad customarily celebrates its independence day on 14 August every year by raising the Pakistan flag at the clock tower in the Commissioner Office compound. Bazaars are colourfully decorated for the celebration, government and private buildings are brightly lit, and there are similar flag‚Äìraising ceremonies that are typically held in the district and its tehsils. The arrival of spring brings the annual \\"Rang-e- Bahar\\" festival where the Parks & Horticulture Authority of the city district government organise a flower show and exhibition at Jinnah Gardens. Annual Chrysanthemum Festival 2015 The University of Agriculture organises a similar event at their main campus which is known as the \\"Kissan Mela\\". The festival of Basant which involves kite flying is an annual tradition in the city despite the ban. The provincial government introduced the \\"Canal Mela\\" which involves five days of festivities including the main canal in the city being decorated with national floats and lights ending with a musical concert to conclude the festival. Being a Muslim majority the city religious observances include Ramadan and Muharram. The festivals of Chaand Raat, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated and are national holidays. The celebration of the Prophet Muhammad birthday is observed in the city which is often referred to as \\"Eid MilƒÅd-un-Nabƒ´\\". There are a number of darbar and shrines which attract a number of devotees during the annual Urs. There are a number of Christian churches in the city where Easter and Christmas services take place each year. = Attire = Traditional attire in Faisalabad is Punjabi clothing such as the dhoti, kurta and pagri. Faisalabadi men wear white shalwar kameez as do women but also with a dupatta (scarf). The more conservative women wear burqas that may or may not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta worn with jeans or trousers, and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants. Men have adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants, trousers, T-shirts and jeans. Faisalabad Institute of Textile and Fashion Design at the Government College University teaches Fashion Design as part of their Fine Arts program. Some of the more conservative establishments and universities follow strict dress codes, such as the National Textile University in Faisalabad where a notice was issued on 27 April 2016 by university professor Muhammad Ashfaq. The intent of the notice was to \\"promote a positive image of the NTU and to maintain good moral, religious and cultural values among the faculty, staff and students.\\" The dress code bans certain styles of Western attire including shorts, sleeveless shirts and shawls for men. Women are prohibited from wearing jeans, tights or leggings, sleeveless or half-sleeved shirts for women. Women are also prohibited from wearing heavy make-up and expensive jewellery. = Cuisine = Faisalabadi cuisine is very much Punjabi cuisine, with influences from the realms of the Mughal and Colonial empires. Key ingredients include rice or roti (flatbread) served with a vegetable or non-vegetable curry, a salad consisting of spiced tomatoes and onions, and yogurt. This is usually accompanied by a variety of South Asian sweets such as jaggery, gajar ka halwa, gulab jamun, and jalebi. Tandoori barbecue specialties consist of a variety of naan bread served with tandoori chicken, chicken tikka or lamb shishkebab served with a mint chutney. Street foods are a key element to Faisalabadi cuisine. Samosas (deep fried pastry filled with vegetables or meat) topped with an onion salad and two types of chutney. There is even a square dedicated to them in the old city. Other street foods include, dahi bhale (deep fried vadas in creamy yoghurt), gol gappay (fried round puri filled with vegetables and topped with tamarind chutney) and vegetable or chicken pakoras. Biryani and murgh pilao rice are a speciality in Faisalabad. A typical breakfast in Faislabadi is halwa poori comprising a deep fried flatbread served with a spicy chickpea curry and sweet orange coloured halwa. It is customarily accompanied by a sweet or salty yoghurt based drink called lassi. During winter, a common breakfast is roghni naan bread served with paya curry. Specialty drinks vary depending on climate. During winter, a variety of hot drinks are available, such as rabri doodh, a creamy dessert drink commonly made with full-fat milk, almonds, pistachios and basil seeds, dhood patti (milky tea), and Kashmiri chai, a pink coloured milky tea containing almonds and pistachios. During summer, drinks such as sugar cane rusk, limo pani (iced lemon water), skanjvi (iced orange and black pepper) and lassi are common. There are American-style fast food franchises that cater to the local community, such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), and Pizza Hut. = Literacy = According to a report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the 2015 literacy rate for Pakistan ranked 160th which is among the lowest literacy rates in the world. In 1981, Faisalabad was among four districts in Punjab, which included Gujranwala, Jhelum and Gujrat, that were experiencing low literacy rates, due primarily to either a lack of resources or family pressure; the latter of which may also be attributable to illiteracy. In 1998, Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level. In 2008, Faisalabad District ranked 51.9% which placed the district 9th in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts. In 2014, the city held its first literary festival which brought a number of writers to the city to encourage the community to follow the arts. Two literary groups were established, the Faisalabad Union of Column Writers and Faisalabad Union of Journalists, to bring together printed media personalities for the purpose of providing training to budding writers from the city.  Recreation  = Parks and open spaces = Faisalabad is home to a number of parks, most of which are maintained by the Parks and Horticulture Authority, Faisalabad. The oldest park in the city is Jinnah Garden, the city's central park, commonly known as \\"Company Bagh\\" and where the monument of Sir James Broadwood Lyall is situated. Other parks include Canal Park, a family park located on the west bank of the Rakh Branch Canal. The Gatwala Wildlife Park is a botanical natural reserve located at Gatwala that was renovated by the city district government. The Pahari Grounds near D Ground is another renovated park that has a Pakistan Air Force F-86 Sabre on display. = Sports = Cricket is a popular sport in Faisalabad. Regional and international cricket matches are held in Iqbal Stadium, named after Pakistani poet Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal. The stadium is home to Faisalabad's local team, the Faisalabad Wolves. Iqbal Stadium hosted the 1987 Cricket World Cup, and the 1996 Cricket World Cup. The Faisalabad Hockey Stadium, located on Susan Road, was constructed in 2002, and can accommodate 25,000 spectators. On 16 April 2003, the stadium was inaugurated by Khalid Maqbool, governor of Punjab. It is the third largest hockey stadium in the country. The stadium has hosted field hockey matches for both national and international competition but by the beginning of 2016 was reported to be in \\"pathetic condition as its astroturf has completed its life span about eight years ago.\\" Commissioner Naseem Nawaz advised that efforts were under way to maintain the stadium. In October 2002, the Government College University established a Directorate of Sports to promote university and national level sports for male and female players. Infrastructure and facilities are available for university players in track, hockey, tennis, basketball, table tennis, badminton and cricket pitch.  Education  In 2013, Faisalabad's literacy rate of 46% for females was noticeably lower than the 69% for males; rural literacy was 49% compared to 74% in urban areas. Faisalabad has several research and educational institutions, both public and private, such as the University of Agriculture, Government College University, National Textile University, Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology, University of Faisalabad, and the University of Engineering & Technology of Lahore. In 2014, the University of Agriculture ranked 1st in agriculture and 4th overall for universities in Pakistan according to the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC), and was ranked 142nd in the 2013 Top 200 World Universities for agriculture and forestry by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). = Education system = The education system is monitored by the District Education Officer (EDO) of the City District Government of Faisalabad. The city government reports its findings to the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training and the Minister for Education. Funding is provided by the government of Pakistan, City District Government and the fees collected from schools. There are four levels of the education system in the city: Primary, Elementary, High and Higher Secondary Level. Primary level education is only compulsory. There are a number of schools for the assistance of children with special needs. = Public libraries and museums = There are two libraries that are open to the public: Allama Iqbal Library and Municipal Corporation Public Library. They are funded and regulated by the government of Punjab under the service sector. * Allama Iqbal Library is located on University Road, opposite the District Courts. The library is housed in the 1911-built colonial building originally named \\"Coronation Library\\" during the rule of the British Empire. In 2012, the building came under control of the Lyallpur Heritage Foundation and the Punjab Archives and Libraries Department. * Lyallpur Museum is located adjacent to the Allama Iqbal Library on University Road. It is a heritage museum and art gallery open to the public. The museum is primarily focused on regional history with a collection of artwork, artefacts and photographs. * Municipal Library is located in Iqbal Park on Narwala Road, opposite the historical grounds of Dhobi Ghat. The library has a large collection of books, a photo gallery and a conference centre. In 2011, the library underwent a renovation costing 40 million rupees. * The Forest Library at the Punjab Forestry Research Institute (PFRI) is one of two specialist libraries, the other being in Lahore. Opened in 1986, the research library is based at the Wildlife Research Center in Gatwala.  Media  = Television and radio = The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) is responsible for the regulation and monitoring of electronic media entertainment in the country. Pakistan Television Corporation, is the state-owned regulated television broadcasting network. The government began licensing private broadcasters in 2002. The government of Pakistan installed the first radio transmitters in the city on 15 September 1982. \\"Radio Pakistan\\" broadcasts three government regulated FM stations: \\"Radio Pakistan FM101, Radio Pakistan FM93 and Radio Pakistan Sautul Qur'an Channel FM93.4. FM101 became operational in 2002, FM93 went live in 2010 and FM93.4 Sautul Qur'an Channel went live in 2016; PBC all three stations are standard power KW 2.5. = Telecommunications = Pakistan Telecommunication Authority is a government-owned organisation that is responsible for the establishment, operation and maintenance of telecommunications in the city. The organisation monitors and prevents illegal exchanges in the city. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited is the main provider of fixed line, mobile and broadband services. Regional headquarters is located at the Central Telecom House in Chinot Bazaar. With the deregulation of the telecommunication sector by the Ministry of Information Technology, a range of companies now offer mobile and broadband services in the city. = Film and theatre = In 2008, the Government of Pakistan lifted a forty-year ban on Bollywood films which allowed Indian films to be played in cinemas. The cinema industry has since seen the introduction of new cinemas such as Cinepax by Hotel One, and Cine Nagina. The Government College University in Faisalabad encourages students from the University of Agriculture to hold workshops and explore themes of peace and tolerance which can be used in an engaging and entertaining way to communicate complex issues to different audiences.

Terminology  Tobruk type positions are named after the system of defensive positions constructed, initially, by the Italian Army at Tobruk, Libya. After Tobruk fell to the Allies in January 1941, the existing positions were modified and significantly expanded by the Australian Army which, along with other Allied forces, reused them in the Siege of Tobruk. A foxhole is one type of defensive strategic position. It is a \\"small pit used for cover, usually for one or two personnel, and so constructed that the occupants can effectively fire from it\\".Bundessprachenamt. Milit√§risches Studienglossar. Englisch. Teil I, A-K. H√ºrth, 2001, p. 580. It is known more commonly within United States Army slang as a \\"fighting position\\" or as a \\"ranger grave\\". It is known as a \\"fighting hole\\" in the United States Marine Corps, a \\"gun-pit\\" in Australian Army terminology, and a \\"fighting pit\\" in the New Zealand Army. In British and Canadian military argot it equates to a range of terms including slit trench, or fire trench (a trench deep enough for a soldier to stand in), a sangar (sandbagged fire position above ground) or shell scrape (a shallow depression that affords protection in the prone position), or simply‚Äîbut less accurately‚Äîas a \\"trench\\". During the American Civil War the term \\"rifle pit\\" was recognized by both U.S. Army and Confederate Army forces. A protected emplacement or concealed post in which one or several machine guns are set up is known in U.S. English as a machine gun nest. History Indian Wehrmacht volunteer in a Tobruk DFP along the Atlantic Wall, 1944 During the fighting in North Africa (1942‚Äì43), U.S. forces employed the shell scrape. This was a very shallow excavation allowing one soldier to lie horizontally while shielding his body from nearby shell bursts and small arms fire. The shell scrape soon proved inadequate in this role, as the few inches of dirt above the soldier's body could often be penetrated by bullets or shell fragments. It also exposed the user to assault by enemy tanks, which could crush a soldier inside a shallow shell scrape by driving into it, then making a simple half- turn. After the Battle of Kasserine Pass (early 1943), U.S. troops increasingly adopted the modern foxhole, a vertical, bottle-shaped hole that allowed a soldier to stand and fight with head and shoulders exposed. The foxhole widened near the bottom to allow a soldier to crouch down while under intense artillery fire or tank attack. Foxholes could be enlarged to two- soldier fighting positions, as well as excavated with firing steps for crew- served weapons or sumps for water drainage or live enemy grenade disposal. =Tobruks= German VK 3001H prototype turret mounted on \\"Tobruk\\" at Omaha Beach, June 1944 Tobruk protecting the entrance to the bunker that now houses the Channel Islands Military Museum. This turret from a Renault R35 was originally employed on a Tobruk at Saint Aubin's Fort, Jersey. The Germans used hardened fortifications in North Africa and later in other fortifications, such as the Atlantic Wall, that were in essence foxholes made from concrete. The Germans knew them officially as Ringst√§nde; the Allies called them \\"Tobruks\\" because they had first encountered the structures during the fighting in Africa.Zaloga, Steven J. D-Day Fortifications in Normandy (Osprey Publishing Ltd.) p.21 Frequently, the Germans put a turret from an obsolete French or German tank on the foxhole. This gave the Tobruk enhanced firepower and the gunner protection from shrapnel and small arms. Modern designs Modern militaries publish and distribute elaborate field manuals for the proper construction of DFPs in stages. Initially, a shallow \\"shell scrape\\" is dug, much like a very shallow grave, which provides very limited protection. Each stage develops the fighting position, gradually increasing its effectiveness, while always maintaining functionality. In this way, a soldier can improve the position over time, while being able to stop at any time and use the position in a fight. Typically, a DFP is a pit or trench dug deep enough to stand in, with only the head exposed, and a small step at the bottom, called a fire step, that allows the soldier to crouch on to avoid fire and tank treads. The fire step usually slopes down into a deeper narrow slit called a grenade sump at the bottom to allow for live grenades to be kicked in to minimize damage from grenade fragments. When possible, DFPs are revetted with corrugated iron, star pickets and wire or local substitutes. Ideally, the revetting will also be dug in below ground level so as to minimise damage from fire and tank tracks. The revetting helps the DFP resist cave-in from near misses from artillery or mortars and tank tracks. Time permitting, DFPs can be enlarged to allow a machine gun crew and ammunition to be protected, as well as additional overhead cover via timbers. In training, DFPs are usually dug by hand or in some cases by mechanical trench diggers. On operations, explosives, especially shaped charges (\\"beehives\\"), may be used to increase the speed of development. Developing and maintaining DFPs is a constant and ongoing task for soldiers deployed in combat areas. For this reason, in some armies, infantry soldiers are referred to as \\"gravel technicians\\", as they spend so much time digging. Because of the large expenditure in effort and materials required to build a DFP, it is important to ensure that the DFP is correctly sited. In order to site the DFP, the officer in charge (\\"OIC\\") should view the ground from the same level that the intended user's weapons will be sighted from. Normally, the OIC will need to lie on his belly to obtain the required perspective. This ensures that the position will be able to cover the desired sector.

By observing multiple modes, one can therefore partially infer a star's internal structure. Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature. Asteroseismology is closely related to helioseismology, the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the Sun. Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.  Theoretical background  A propagation diagram for a standard solar model showing where oscillations have a g-mode character (blue) or where dipole modes have a p-mode character (orange). Between about 100 and 400 ¬µHz, modes would potentially have two oscillating regions: these are known as mixed modes. The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate. By linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four differential equations whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation. The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by spherical harmonics, indexed by an angular degree \\\\ell and azimuthal order m. In non- rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis. The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of \\\\ell, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity. By additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the Cowling approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction \\\\xi_r, \\\\frac{d^2\\\\xi_r}{dr^2}=\\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c_s^2}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{N^2}{\\\\omega^2}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{S_\\\\ell^2}{\\\\omega^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\xi_r where r is the radial co- ordinate in the star, \\\\omega is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode, c_s is the sound speed inside the star, N is the Brunt‚ÄìV√§is√§l√§ or buoyancy frequency and S_\\\\ell is the Lamb frequency. The last two are defined by N^2=g\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma_1P}\\\\frac{dp}{dr}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{dr}\\\\right) and S_\\\\ell^2=\\\\frac{\\\\ell(\\\\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2} respectively. By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators, this implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either greater or less than both S_\\\\ell and N. We identify the former case as high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency gravity modes (g-modes). This basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy) where we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star. By plotting the curves \\\\omega=N and \\\\omega=S_\\\\ell (for given \\\\ell), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both curves or frequencies above both curves.  Excitation mechanisms  = \\\\kappa-mechanism = Under fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature. This opacity bump can drive oscillations through the \\\\kappa-mechanism (or Eddington valve). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope. Pulsations driven by the \\\\kappa-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes. It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables. = Surface convection = In stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency. Because the modes are intrinsically stable, they have low amplitudes and are relatively short-lived. This is the driving mechanism in all solar-like oscillators. = Convective blocking = If the base of a surface convection zone is sharp and the convective timescales slower than the pulsation timescales, the convective flows react too slowly perturbations that can build up into large, coherent pulsations. This mechanism is known as convective blocking and is believed to drive pulsations in the \\\\gamma Doradus variables. = Tidal excitation = Observations from the Kepler satellite revealed eccentric binary systems in which oscillations are excited during the closest approach. These systems are known as heartbeat stars because of the characteristic shape of the lightcurves.  Types of oscillators  = Solar-like oscillators = Because solar oscillations are driven by near-surface convection, any stellar oscillations caused similarly are known as solar-like oscillations and the stars themselves as solar-like oscillators. However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not Sun-like. = Cepheid variables = Cepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star. They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses. They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months. Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness. Cepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium. = RR Lyrae variables = RR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. Population II) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar). They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone. The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium. Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the Blazhko effect. = Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars = Delta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence. They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium. SX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables. Gamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type. The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes. Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking. Following results from Kepler, it appears that many Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids. = Rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars = Rapidly oscillating Ap stars have similar parameters to Delta Scuti variables, mostly being A- and F-type, but they are also strongly magnetic and chemically peculiar (hence the p spectral subtype). Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the oblique pulsator model: the mode's frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth). The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 ŒºHz and amplitudes of a few mmag. = Slowly-pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables = Slowly-pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism. Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours. Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly-rotating stars. = Variable subdwarf B stars = Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core- helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen-burning shell. They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light. The oscillations are low- order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump. = White dwarfs = White dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way. Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB. Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough. White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate. The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables). All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes. The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute. GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.

It was established in 1955 with the arrival of 5,000 refugees from villages between Jaffa and Jerusalem. At first refugees lived in tents. In 1957, UNWRA built 1,260 shelters to add to the 1,400 shelters they initially built on an area of , south of the outskirts of Amman at the time. For almost fifteen years, until the 1970s most families were living in shelters and tents. After the Black September conflicts which lasted from 1970 to 1971, UNRWA worked with the Jordanian government to improve living conditions in Al-Widhat. In 1987-88, 17 percent of households in Wihdat lived in one-room dwellings, compared to 6 percent by 2011. By 2011, 44 percent of households in Wihdat lived in two room-dwellings. In terms of crowding, Fafo Foundation (FAFO) uses the square metre per capita, with Wihdat as one of the \\"lowest median per capita square metres of living space.\\" During the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Al-Wihdat in Jordan became a center of activity for Palestinian nationalists. Even the Al- Wihdat soccer club's matches were synonymous with the 'Palestinian' identity in public life.\\" The eastern quarters of Al-Wihdat developed a low-middle class housing areas with three- and four-storied buildings. There were slum- like areas in the southern quarters of the camp. The camp, which is not enclosed by walls or fences, was an open space with a thriving economic area. Although there are several main roads in the camp, it is crisscrossed with \\"narrow passageways and twisting alleys.\\" The eastern quarters of Al-Wihdat developed a low-middle class housing areas with three- and four-storied buildings. There were slum-like areas in the southern quarters of the camp, where heavy stones anchored zinc roofs. By the late 2000s, there were over 2,000 registered \\"shops and enterprises\\" offering a wide variety of goods and services operating in Al-Wehdat. The large souk in Al Wehdat attracted customers from outside the camp with its wide variety of goods, such as vegetables from the Jordan Valley, and clothing from China, offered at lower prices than other markets in Amman. Achilli lived in Al-Wendat from July 2009 to September 2010 and again in February to March 2011 and March 2012. Demographics By 2010, there were 48,000 inhabitants which included about \\"8,000 local gypsies, Egyptian labor migrants, Iraqi refugees and other low- income non-Jordanian groups.\\" By 2017, there were about 57,000 registered refugees, which includes 8,400 students in Al-Wihdat and almost 370,000 Palestine refugees in Jordan, which represents 18 per cent of Jordan's total. Jordan accommodates the most Palestine refugees of all of the UNWRA locations. In Jordan, most, but not all, Palestine refugees have full citizenship. By 2017, of the 5 million registered Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, 2 million were in Jordan. UNRWA UNRWA, which was established in 1949, provides funding for Palestine refugees to have access to education, \\"primary health care for more than 3.5 million patients and assistance to over 250,000 acutely vulnerable Palestine refugees.\\" UNRWA services in Al-Wehdat includes 13 schools, a health center, a rehabilitation center, a women's programme center, an environmental health office and a camp services office. UNWRA also ran a Teacher Training College in Amman. Seventy percent of UNRWA money funds go to the 700 UNRWA schools attended by 500,000 children and adolescents. In October 2017, the European Union voted to contribute an additional million to UNRWA in response to a call \\"to help close a shortfall\\". Major challenges UNRWA, cited a 2013 Fafo Foundation report, said that Amman New camp is ranked second out of the ten Palestine refugee camps in JordanThe ten Palesine refugee camps in Jordan are Amman New Camp, Baqa'a Camp, Husn Camp, Irbid Camp, Jabal el-Hussein Camp, Jerash Camp, Marka Camp, Souf Camp, Talbieh Camp, and Zarqa Camp. in terms of poverty and female employment. The income of 34% of Palestine refugees there is below Jordan's national poverty line of JD 814. Only 24% of the women in the camp are employed. Eight percent of the camp's population have severe chronic health problems, making it the worst of all the ten. Sixty-six percent of the refugees there have no health insurance. There are no green areas or open play space in the camp which is overcrowded. Many shelters were built in the 1950s and are now in bad state of repair. Many needed to be torn down and replaced as \\"the building material is inadequate (roofs made of corrugated metal plates, cement of poor quality).\\" UNRWA receives 30 percent of its budget from the United States. The US announced on January 16, 2018, that they will withhold $60 million of the $125 million it had planned to send to UNRWA in 2018. UNRWA funding is almost entirely from U.N. member states. According to Spiegel journalist Thore Schr√∂der, who visited Al-Wehdat in January 2018, teachers, doctors and garbage collectors have been laid off and people who live in Al-Wehdat have rented pick-up trucks to manage garbage disposal. Schools are closed for the holidays. According to the 2018 Spiegel article, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the UNRWA to be completely replaced by UNHCR. Schr√∂der cites the case of a 52-year-old tailor who was born in Amman, Jordan, has lived there all his life, but maintains that his real home is the village Ramla, in the heart of Israel that he has never visited. Netanyahu says the hope of the Palestinian right of return, is unrealistic. Al-Wehdat SC The Al-Wehdat Sports Club was originally established at the camp in 1956 by the UNWRA as the Al-Wehdat Youth Center. By 1975 Al-Wihdat won the Jordanian league. Notable people Notable people from Al-Wehdat include writer Ibrahim Nasrallah whose parents came to Al Wehdat in 1948, when they were forced from their home in Al-Bruij in Palestine. His series of novels, Gaza Weddings,Translated by Nancy Roberts were translated into English in 2017. Nasrallah's parents took refuge in Al- Wehdat camp after they were uprooted from their home in Al-Bruij near Jerusalem in 1948. Nasrallah, who was born and grew up in the camp, studied at UNWRA schools there and the UNRWA Teacher Training College in Amman. Nihad Awad, who is the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), has been interviewed frequently by Fox, the BBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Al-Jazeera, C-Span, and other mainstream media outlets.

The program provides information on the energy consumption of products and devices using different standardized methods. The Energy Star label is found on more than 75 different certified product categories, homes, commercial buildings, and industrial plants. Elements of the Energy Star Program have been adopted in the European Single Market as well as Energy Star Canada, Japan, and Taiwan. In the United States, the Energy Star label is also shown on the Energy Guide appliance label of qualifying products. History The Energy Star program was established by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 and operates under the authority of the Clean Air Act, section 103(g), and the 2005 Energy Policy Act, section 131 (which amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, section 324). Since 1992, Energy Star and its partners have reduced various energy bills by at least $430 billion. The EPA manages Energy Star products, homes, and commercial/industrial programs. The EPA develops and manages Energy Star Portfolio Manager, an online energy tracking and benchmarking tool for commercial buildings. The DOE manages Home Performance with Energy Star and provides technical support, including test procedure development for products and some verification testing of products. Initiated as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy efficient products, Energy Star began with labels for computer and printer products. In 1995 the program was significantly expanded, introducing labels for residential heating and cooling systems and new homes.EnergyStar.gov, ‚ÄúMilestones: Energy Star.‚Äù 2007. Retrieved on 1 March 2008. In 2000, the Consortium for Energy Efficiency was directed by members to begin an annual survey of Energy Star impact. According to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report for 2016, 290,000 American workers are involved in the manufacture of Energy Star certified products and building materials. The report also projects that employment in energy efficiency will grow much faster than other areas of the energy sector‚Äî9 percent in 2017 vs. average projected growth of 5 percent across all of the energy sector‚Äîand Energy Star is an integral part of that market. Specifications Energy Star specifications differ with each item, and are set by the EPA. =Computers= Energy Star 4.0 specifications for computers became effective on July 20, 2007. The requirements are more stringent than the previous specification and existing equipment designs can no longer use the service mark unless re- qualified. They require the use of 80 Plus Bronze level or higher power supplies. Energy Star 5.0 became effective on July 1, 2009. Computers with any Energy Star version installed will display its logo, or a rosette and the company's slogan when running the BIOS after turning the machine on. () Energy Star 6.1 became effective on September 10, 2014. Energy Star 7.1 became effective on November 16, 2018. The Version 8.0 specification for computers was finalized on October 15, 2019. =Servers= The EPA released Version 1.0 of the Computer Server specifications on May 15, 2009. It covered standalone servers with one to four processor sockets. A second tier to the specification adding active state power and performance reporting for all qualified servers, as well as blade and multi-node server idle state requirements became effective December 16, 2013.EnergyStar.gov, \\"Energy Star ‚Äì Enterprise Servers\\". Retrieved 30 November 2016. The Version 2.0 Energy Starspecification for Computer Servers came into effect on December 16, 2013. Computer Servers Specification Version 3.0 is in process. =Appliances= 2015 advertisement promoting Energy Star-certified clothes dryers As of early 2008, average refrigerators need 20% savings over the minimum standard. Dishwashers need at least 41% savings. Most appliances as well as heating and cooling systems have a yellow EnergyGuide label showing the annual cost of operation compared to other models. This label is created through the Federal Trade Commission and often shows if an appliance is Energy Star rated.EnergyStar.gov, \\"Learn More about EnergyGuide: Energy Star.\\". Retrieved 1 March 2008. While an Energy Star label indicates that the appliance is more energy efficient than the minimum guidelines, purchasing an Energy Star labeled product does not always mean one is getting the most energy efficient option available. For example, dehumidifiers that are rated under per day of water extraction receive an Energy Star rating if they have an energy factor of 1.2 (higher is better), while those rated to per day receive an Energy Star rating for an energy factor of 1.4 or higher. Thus a higher-capacity but non-Energy Star rated dehumidifier may be a more energy efficient alternative than an Energy Star rated but lower-capacity model.Green Energy Efficient Homes, Energy Efficient Dehumidifiers The Energy Star program's savings calculator has also been criticized for unrealistic assumptions in its model that tend to magnify savings benefits to the average consumer.Belzer, Richard Energy Star Appliances: EPA's Savings Calculator Exaggerates Savings, Regulatory Economics, 5 March 2008 Another factor yet to be considered by the EPA and DOE is the overall effect of energy-saving requirements on the durability and expected service life of a mass-market appliance built to a consumer-level cost standard. For example, a refrigerator may be made more efficient by the use of more insulative spacing and a smaller-capacity compressor using electronics to control operation and temperature. However, this may come at the cost of reduced interior storage (or increased exterior mass) or a reduced service life due to compressor or electronic failures. In particular, electronic controls used on new-generation appliances are subject to damage from shock, vibration, moisture, or power spikes on the electrical circuit to which they are attached. Critics have pointed out that even if a new appliance is energy efficient, any consumer appliance that does not provide customer satisfaction, or must be replaced twice as often as its predecessor contributes to landfill pollution and waste of natural resources used to construct its replacement.Mu√±oz, Sara Schaeffer, \\"Do 'Green' Appliances Live Up To Their Billing\\", The Wall Street Journal, Business, 2 August 2007 =Heating and cooling systems= Energy Star qualified heat pumps, boilers, air conditioning systems, and furnaces are available. In addition, cooling and heating bills can be significantly lowered with air sealing and duct sealing. Air sealing reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building, and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heating/cooling system‚Äôs efficiency. Energy Star qualified room air conditioners are at least 10% more energy efficient than the minimum U.S. federal government standards. =Home electronics= Energy Star qualified televisionsCalifornia Sustainability Alliance Energy Star Televisions use 30% less energy than average. In November 2008, television specifications were improved to limit on-mode power use, in addition to standby power which is limited by the current specifications. A wider range of Energy Star qualified televisions will be available. Other qualified home electronics include cordless phones, battery chargers, VCRs and external power adapters, most of which use 90% less energy. =Imaging equipment= The Energy Star Program Requirements for Imaging Products are focused on product families such as electrophotographic (EP) printers, inkjet printers (e.g., thermal), copiers, facsimile machines and other imaging equipment including MFD's (multifunctional devices). Typical Electrical Consumption (TEC) of a product family are measured and reported against an allowance set by the maximum throughput of the device. Operation modes (OM) are measured and reported for devices such as inkjet products against an allowance set by the functions present in the EUT (equipment under test). Devices that included \\"adders\\" such as Ethernet, on-board memory, wireless, etc. are mathematically \\"added\\" to increase the OM allowance. Recently on February 1, 2011, the EPA/DOE added the requirement that all products registered under the Energy Star service mark, must be tested by an AB (Accredited Body) or CB (Certification Body) Laboratory. =Lighting= EPA graphic promoting light bulb replacement The Energy Star is awarded to only certain bulbs that meet strict efficiency, quality, and lifetime criteria. Energy Star qualified fluorescent lighting uses 75% less energy and lasts up to ten times longer than normal incandescent lights. Energy Star Qualified light-emitting diode (LED) Lighting: * Reduces energy costs ‚Äî uses only 20‚Äì25% of the electricity that incandescent bulbs use, and last as much as 25 times as long. LEDs use 25%-30% of the amount of energy as halogen incandescent bulbs, and last 8‚Äì25 times as long. * Reduces cooling costs ‚Äî LEDs produce very little heat. To qualify for Energy Star certification, LED lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics: * Brightness is equal to or greater than existing lighting technologies (incandescent or fluorescent) and light is well distributed over the area lighted by the fixture. * Light output remains constant over time, only decreasing towards the end of the rated lifetime (at least 35,000 hours or 12 years based on use of 8 hours per day). * Excellent color quality. The shade of white light appears clear and consistent over time. * Efficiency is as good as or better than fluorescent lighting. * Light comes on instantly when turned on. * No flicker when dimmed. * No off-state power draw. The fixture does not use power when it is turned off, with the exception of external controls, whose power should not exceed 0.5 watts in the off state. =New homes= New homes or apartments that earn the Energy Star label have been verified to meet energy efficiency requirements set by U.S. EPA. Energy Star certified homes are at least 10% more efficient than homes built to code and achieve a 20% improvement on average, while providing homeowners with better quality, performance, and comfort. Nearly 1.9 million Energy Star certified homes and apartments have been certified to date. These high-performing homes can be found across the U.S. and include a complete thermal enclosure system, a high- efficiency heating, ventilation and cooling system, a comprehensive water management system, and energy-efficient lighting and appliances. Together, U.S. homeowners living in certified homes saved $360 million on their energy bills in 2016 alone. Energy performance ratings The Energy Star program has developed energy performance rating systems for several commercial and institutional building types and manufacturing facilities. These ratings, on a scale of 1 to 100, provide a means for benchmarking the energy efficiency of specific buildings and industrial plants against the energy performance of similar facilities. The ratings are used by building and energy managers to evaluate the energy performance of existing buildings and industrial plants. The rating systems are also used by EPA to determine if a building or plant can qualify to earn Energy Star recognition.Energy Star ‚Äì Evaluate Performance Energy Star.govEnergy Star Benchmark Energy Star.gov For many types of commercial buildings, one can enter energy information into EPA's free online tool, Portfolio Manager, and it will calculate a score for one's building on a scale of 1‚Äì100. Buildings that score a 75 or greater may qualify for the Energy Star. Portfolio Manager is an interactive energy management tool that allows one to track and assess energy and water consumption across one's entire portfolio of buildings in a secure online environment. Whether one owns, manages, or holds properties for investment, Portfolio Manager can help one set investment priorities, identify under-performing buildings, verify efficiency improvements, and receive EPA recognition for superior energy performance. Portfolio Manager uses an automated benchmarking tool that can award Energy Star certification to buildings that have uploaded 12 months of consecutive energy usage data and received scores of 75 or above. In 2020 energystar.gov released an updated guide for verifying Energy Star certifications. =Buildings= 2015 graph showing cities with the most Energy Star-certified buildings The number of space types that can receive the energy performance rating in Portfolio Manager is expanding and now includes housing,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \\"2006 Annual Report: Energy Star and Other Climate Protection Partnerships.\\". Retrieved 1 March 2008. bank/financial institutions, courthouses, hospitals (acute care and children's), hotels and motels, houses of worship, K-12 schools, medical offices, offices, residence halls/dormitories, retail stores, supermarkets, warehouses (refrigerated and non-refrigerated), data centers, senior care facilities, and wastewater facilities. See the technical descriptions for models used in the rating system at. These documents provide detailed information on the methodologies used to create the energy performance ratings including details on rating objectives, regression techniques, and the steps applied to compute a rating. A 1‚Äì100 rating can be generated for ratable space types by entering building attributes, such as square footage and weekly operating hours, and monthly energy consumption data into Portfolio Manager, a free online tool provided by Energy Star. This process is known as benchmarking and reveals how a building's energy consumption compares to that of other similar buildings of the same space type, based on a national average. Earning a rating of 75 or above is the first step towards achieving the Energy Star for a building. Energy Star energy performance ratings have been incorporated into some green buildings standards, such as LEED for Existing Buildings. In the U.S., builders of energy efficient homes are able to qualify for Federal Income tax credits and deductions. Energystar.gov estimated that energy use in commercial buildings accounts for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, costing more than $100B per year. =Industrial facilities= Energy performance ratings have been released for the following industrial facilities: * Automobile assembly plants * Cement plants * Wet corn mills * Container glass manufacturing * Flat glass manufacturing * Frozen fried potato processing plants * Juice processing * Petroleum refineries * Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants  Small business award  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually recognizes small businesses that demonstrate abilities to reduce waste, conserve energy, and recycle. The businesses use resources and ideas outlined in the Energy Star program. The award was established in 1999. Controversies In March 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) performed covert testing of the Energy Star product certification process and found that Energy Star was for the most part a self-certification program that was vulnerable to fraud and abuse. While the GAO demonstrated, by submitting fake products from made-up companies, that cheating was possible, they found no evidence of consumer fraud relating to the quality or performance of Energy Star qualified products. In response, the Environmental Protection Agency instituted third-party certification of all Energy Star products starting in 2011. Under this regime, products are tested in an EPA-recognized laboratory and reviewed by an EPA-recognized certification body before they can carry the label. In order to be recognized, labs and certification bodies must meet specified criteria and be subject to oversight by a recognized accreditation body. In addition, a percentage of Energy Star certified product models in each category are subject to off-the- shelf verification testing each year. As of 2017, there are 23 independent certification bodies and 255 independent laboratories recognized for purposes of Energy Star product certification and testing. Most cover multiple product types. In 2016, 1,881 product models were subject to verification testing with an overall compliance rate of 95%. In March 2017 the Trump Administration proposed a budget that would eliminate the program. This prompted an outpouring of expressions of support for the Energy Star program from environmental groups, energy efficiency advocates, businesses and others, including coverage of the \\"potentially lethal implications of eliminating the program\\" on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.

The erhu (; ), is a two-stringed bowed musical instrument, more specifically a spike fiddle, which may also be called a Southern Fiddle, and sometimes known in the Western world as the Chinese violin or a Chinese two- stringed fiddle. It is used as a solo instrument as well as in small ensembles and large orchestras. It is the most popular of the huqin family of traditional bowed string instruments used by various ethnic groups of China. As a very versatile instrument, the erhu is used in both traditional and contemporary music arrangements, such as in pop, rock and jazz. History Performer with erhu, photographed Singapore February 1969 √ó July 1971. The Erhu can be traced back to proto-Mongolic instruments which first appeared in China during the Tang Dynasty. It is believed to have evolved from the Xiqin (Â•ö Áê¥). The xiqin is believed to have originated from the Xi people located in current northeast China. The first Chinese character of the name of the instrument (‰∫å, √®r, two) is believed to come from the fact that it has two strings. An alternate explanation states that it comes from the fact that it is the second highest huqin in pitch to the gaohu in the modern Chinese orchestra. The second character (ËÉ°, h√∫) indicates that it is a member of the Huqin family, with Hu commonly meaning barbarians. The name Huqin literally means \\"instrument of the Hu peoples\\", suggesting that the instrument may have originated from regions to the north or west of China generally inhabited by nomadic people on the extremities of past Chinese kingdoms. For most of history, the erhu was mostly a folk instrument used in southern China, whereas the sihu was preferred among northern musicians. However, in the 1920s, Liu Tianhua introduced the erhu to Beijing, and since, it has become the most popular of the huqin. =Historical erhu and bowed string bows= Historic bowed zithers of China, including the Xiqin, Yazheng, and Yaqin, and also the Korean Ajaeng, were originally played by bowing with a rosined stick, which created friction against the strings. As soon as the horsehair bow was invented, it spread very widely. Construction The erhu bow between the strings. The Erhu consists of a long vertical stick-like neck, at the top of which are two big tuning pegs, and at the bottom is a small resonator body (sound box) which is covered with python skin on the front (playing) end. Two strings are attached from the pegs to the base, and a small loop of string (Qian Jin) placed around the neck and strings acting as a nut pulls the strings towards the skin, holding a minute wooden bridge in place. The Erhu has some unusual features: 1\\\\. Its characteristic sound is produced through the vibration of the python skin by bowing. 2\\\\. There is no fingerboard; the player stops the strings by pressing their fingertips onto the strings without the strings touching the neck. 3\\\\. The horse hair bow is never separated from the strings (which were formerly of twisted silk but which today are usually made of metal); it passes between them as opposed to over them (the latter being the case with western bowed stringed instruments). 4\\\\. Although there are two strings, they are very close to each other and the player's left hand in effect plays as if on one string. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4, a fifth higher. The maximum range of the instrument is three and a half octaves, from D4 up to A7, before a stopping finger reaches the part of the string in contact with the bow hair. The usual playing range is about two and a half octaves. Various dense and heavy hardwoods are used in making the Erhu. According to Chinese references the woods include zi tan (Á¥´Ê™Ä red sandalwood and other woods of the genus Pterocarpus such as padauk), Lao hong mu (ËÄÅÁ∫¢Êú® aged red wood), wu mu (‰πåÊú® black wood), and hong mu (Á∫¢Êú® red wood). Particularly fine Erhus are often made from pieces of old furniture. A typical erhu measures 81 cm from top to bottom, the length of the bow also being 81 cm. Erhu with ba jiao qin tong (eight-sided body). The parts of the Erhu: *Q√≠n tong (Áê¥Á≠í), sound box or resonator body; it is hexagonal (liu jiao, southern), octagonal (ba jiao, northern), or, less commonly, round. *Q√≠n p√≠/She p√≠ (Áê¥ÁöÆ/ËõáÁöÆ), skin, made from python. The python skin gives the erhu its characteristic sound. *Q√≠n gan (Áê¥ÊùÜ), neck. *Q√≠n tou (Áê¥È†≠), top or tip of neck, usually a simple curve with a piece of bone or plastic on top, but is sometimes elaborately carved with a dragon's head. *Q√≠n zhou (Áê¥Ëª∏). tuning pegs, traditional wooden, or metal machine gear pegs *QiƒÅn jin (ÂçÉÊñ§), nut, made from string, or, less commonly, a metal hook *N√®i xi√°n (ÂÜÖÂº¶), inside or inner string, usually tuned to D4, nearest to player *Wai xi√°n (Â§ñÂº¶), outside or outer string, usually tuned to A4 *Q√≠n ma (Áê¥Á¢º), bridge, made from wood *Gong (Âºì), bow, has screw device to vary bow hair tension *Gong gan (ÂºìÊùÜ), bow stick, made from bamboo *Gong m√°o (ÂºìÊØõ), bow hair, usually white horsehair *Q√≠n di√†n (Áê¥Â¢ä), pad, a piece of sponge, felt, or cloth placed between the strings and skin below the bridge to improve its sound *Q√≠n tu≈ç (Áê¥Êâò) ‚Äì base, a piece of wood attached to the bottom of the q√≠n tong to provide a smooth surface on which to rest on the leg Most Erhu are mass-produced in factories. The three most esteemed centres of Erhu making are Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou. In the collectivist period after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, these factories were formed by merging what had been previously private workshops. Although most Erhu were machine-made in production lines, the highest quality instruments were handmade by specialist craftsmen.Stock, Jonathan. \\"A Historical Account of the Chinese Two-Stringed Fiddle Erhu.\\" Galpin Society Journal, v. 46 (March 1993), p 85 In the 20th century, there have been attempts to standardize and improve the Erhu, with the aim of producing a louder and better sounding instrument. One major change was the use of steel strings instead of silk. The move to steel strings was made gradually. By 1950 the thinner A-string had been replaced by a violin E-string with the thicker D-string remaining silk. By 1958 professional players were using purpose made D and A steel Erhu strings as standard.Stock, Jonathan. \\"A Historical Account of the Chinese Two-Stringed Fiddle Erhu.\\" Galpin Society Journal, v. 46 (March 1993), p 103 =Use of python skin= nut. In 1988 China passed its Law on the Protection of Endangered Species after ratifying the UN Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making it illegal to use and trade unlicensed pythons. To regulate the use of python skins, China's State Forestry Administration introduced a certification scheme between python skin sellers in Southeast Asia and musical instrument makers in China. From January 1, 2005, new regulations also require Erhus to have a certificate from the State Forestry Administration, which certify that the Erhu python skin is not made with wild pythons, but from farm-raised pythons. Individuals are allowed to take up to two Erhus out of China when traveling; commercial buyers need additional export certificates. Outside China, manufacturers of Erhu can issue their own CITES licenses with approval by governments of their respective countries. Such exports are legal as they have been made from legal skin sources. Some Erhus are made of recycled products. The Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra began their research for an alternative to python skin in 2005 and has since designed the Eco-Huqin series, which substitutes python skin with PET Polyester Membrane. For this innovation the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra received the Ministry of Culture Innovation Award in 2012.The Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra's Eco-Huqin Series Erhu music A blind street performer playing in Jingzhou, Hubei, China, 2006 Blind Chinese Street Musician, Beijing, 1930 A notable composer for the Erhu was Liu Tianhua (ÂàòÂ§©Âçé/ÂäâÂ§©ËèØ; Li√∫ TiƒÅnhu√°; 1895‚Äì1932), a Chinese musician who also studied Western music. He composed 47 exercises and 10 solo pieces (1918‚Äì32) which were central to the development of the Erhu as a solo instrument. His works for the instrument include Yue Ye (ÊúàÂ§ú; Yu√® y√®, Moon Night) and Zhu ying Yao hong (ÁÉõÂΩ±ÊëáÁ∫¢; Zh√∫ y«êng y√°o h√≥ng, Shadows of Candles Flickering Red). Other solo pieces include Er Quan Ying Yue (1950, Two Springs Reflecting the Moon) by Abing, Sai Ma (Horse Race) by Huang Haihuai, Henan Xiaoqu (Henan Folk Tune) by Liu Mingyuan, and Sanmenxia Changxiangqu (1961, Sanmen Gorge Capriccio) by Liu Wenjin. Most solo works are commonly performed with yangqin accompaniment, although pieces such as the ten solos by Liu Tianhua and Er Quan Ying Yue(Two Springs Reflecting the Moon) originally did not have accompaniment. In addition to the solo repertoire, the erhu is one of the main instruments in regional music ensembles such as Jiangnan sizhu, Chinese opera ensembles, and the modern large Chinese orchestra. The Erhu is used in the music of the Cirque du Soleil show O and in solo performances in select Shen Yun tours. Even fusion progressive rock groups like The Hsu-nami have incorporated the erhu into their music and it is their lead instrument. It is incorporated in the Taiwanese black metal band ChthoniC and used in the song \\"Field Below\\" by Regina Spektor. An instrumental album by Erhu artist Song Fei (ÂÆãÈ£û; Song Fei) expresses the painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival (Ê∏ÖÊòé‰∏äÊ≤≥Âõæ; Qƒ´ngm√≠ng Sh√†ngh√© T√∫) drawn in the Song Dynasty by Zhang Zeduan (Âº†Êã©Á´Ø; Zhang Zeduan). It was performed with the Erhu, Jinghu, Banhu, Gaohu, etc., to show the Livelihood, Trade, Festival of the Song Dynasty; the album contains 18 parts. More recently, the Erhu has appeared in several soundtracks, featuring prominently in the TV series Earth: Final Conflict (played by George Gao) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria (played by Jiebing Chen). An Erhu solo is featured in several cues related to Vulcans from 2009's Star Trek soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. Musical groups for wedding celebrations in Cambodia often use the Tro, a similar instrument to the Erhu. An Erhu is listed in the credits for the Doug Anthony All Stars album Icon as being played by Paul McDermott. The Erhu can be heard in the character songs of China, a character in Axis Powers Hetalia.  Comparisons to Western instruments  = Violin = The erhu is often described as a Chinese fiddle, in which when compared to a fiddle, it has a relatively different style. While most of the instrument is built from wood, like the violin, the wood is not where the 'bridge' is put on. The bridge of an erhu has a flat base, and does not require 'fitting' onto an instrument. The reason is because the erhu uses Python skin as its 'top', whereas a violin, the top is a wooden plate. The python skin is stretched out like a flat surface, unlike the curved plate of a violin. Also, erhu have the hairs of the bow strung between the two strings, in which both sides of bow hair is used. The violin has the bow hair played on top of the strings. The erhu has only two strings while violin has four. Playing technique The bow is woven between the strings. Because the hairs are slackened, the bow hand is used to press the hairs away from the bow stick to create enough tension to stroke the strings properly. (video) A street busker playing the Erhu in Beijing, 2017 =Tuning= The Erhu is almost always tuned to the interval of a fifth. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4. This is the same as the two middle strings of the violin. =Position= The Erhu is played sitting down, with the sound box placed on the top of the left thigh and the neck held vertically. However, performers of more recent years have played while standing up using a specially developed belt-clip. =Right hand= The bow is held with an underhand grip. The bow hair is adjusted so it is slightly loose. The fingers of the right hand are used to push the hairs away from the stick in order to create tension in the hairs. The bow hair is placed in between the two strings and both sides of the bow hair are used to produce sound, the player pushes the bow away from the body when bowing the A string (the outside string), and pulls it inwards when bowing the \\"inside\\" D string. Aside from the bowing technique used for most pieces, the Erhu can also be plucked, usually using the second finger of the right hand. This produces a dry, muted tone (if either of the open strings is plucked, the sound is somewhat more resonant) which is sometimes used in contemporary pieces. =Left hand= The left hand alters the pitch of the strings by pressing on the string at the desired point. As the instrument has no frets, the tone is slightly muddied, but resonant. Techniques include hua yin (slides), rou xian (vibrato), huan ba (changing positions), etc. Notable performers Twelve-member concert group at the Hubei Provincial Museum. The Erhu is fourth from left. Prior to the 20th century, most Huqin instruments were used primarily to accompany various forms of Chinese opera and narrative. The use of the Erhu as a solo instrument began in the early 20th century along with the development of guoyue (literally \\"national music\\"), a modernized form of Chinese traditional music written or adapted for the professional concert stage. Active in the early 20th century were Zhou Shaomei (Âë®Â∞ëÊ¢Ö; 1885‚Äì1938) and Liu Tianhua (ÂàòÂ§©Âçé; 1895‚Äì1932). Liu laid the foundations of modern Erhu playing with his ten unaccompanied solos and 47 studies composed in the 1920s and 1930s. Liu Beimao (ÂàòÂåóËåÇ; 1903‚Äì1981) was born in Jiangyin, Jiangsu. His compositions include Xiao Hua Gu (1943) (Little Flower-drum). Jiang Fengzhi (Ëî£È£é‰πã; 1908‚Äì1986) and Chen Zhenduo (ÈôàÊåØÈìé) were students of Liu Tianhua, the piece Hangong Qiuyue (Autumn Moon over the Han Palace) was adapted and arranged by Jiang. Hua Yanjun (A Bing) (ÂçéÂΩ•Âêõ-ÈòøÁÇ≥, c. 1893‚Äì1950) was a blind street musician. Shortly before his death in 1950, two Chinese musicologists recorded him playing a few Erhu and Pipa solo pieces, the best-known being Erquan Yingyue. With the founding of the People's Republic of China and the expansion of the conservatory system, the solo erhu tradition continued to develop. Important performers during this time include Lu Xiutang (ÈôÜ‰øÆÂ†Ç; 1911‚Äì1966), Zhang Rui (Âº†Èîê; born 1920), Sun Wenming (Â≠ôÊñáÊòé; 1928‚Äì1962), Huang Haihuai (ÈªÑÊµ∑ÊÄÄ), Liu Mingyuan (ÂàòÊòéÊ∫ê; 1931‚Äì1996), Tang Liangde (Ê±§ËâØÂæ∑; 1938‚Äì2010), Zhang Shao (Âº†Èü∂) and Song Guosheng (ÂÆãÂõΩÁîü). Liu Mingyuan (ÂàòÊòéÊ∫ê; 1931‚Äì1996) was born in Tianjin. He was known for his virtuosity on many instruments of the huqin family, in particular the banhu. His compositions and arrangements include Henan Xiaoqu (Henan Folk Tune) and Cao Yuan Shang (On Grassland) for Zhonghu. For many years, he taught at the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Tang Liangde (Cantonese: Tong Leung Tak; Ê±§ËâØÂæ∑; 1938‚Äì2010) was born in Shanghai into a famous Shanghainese musical family. He won the \\"Shanghai's Spring\\" Erhu competition and continued to be the soloist for the Chinese Film Orchestra in Beijing, his composition and solos can be heard throughout the Nixon to China documentary movie. Tang was the soloist and performed at the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, then went on to music broadcasting and education for the Hong Kong Government's Music Office making worldwide tours and was named Art Educator of the Year in 1991 by the Hong Kong Artist Guild. Wang Guotong (ÁéãÂõΩÊΩº; born 1939) was born in Dalian, Liaoning. He studied with Jiang Fengzhi, Lan Yusong and Chen Zhenduo and, in 1960, graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. He performed the premiere of Sanmenxia Changxiangqu (Sanmen Gorge Rhapsody) composed by Liu Wenjin. In 1972, Wang became the Erhu soloist and later art director of the China Broadcasting Traditional Orchestra. He returned to the Central Conservatory of Music in 1983 as head of the Chinese music department. He has written many books and articles on Erhu playing and has performed in many countries. Wang also worked with the Beijing National Instruments Factory to further develop Erhu design. Min Huifen (ÈñîÊÉ†Ëä¨; 1945‚Äì2014) was born in Yixing, Jiangsu. She first became known as the winner of the 1963 fourth Shanghai Spring Art Festival. She studied with Lu Xiutang and Wang Yi, and graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1968, and became the Erhu soloist with the Shanghai Minzu Yuetuan (Shanghai Folk Orchestra). She was the undisputed master of erhu for 50 years. Yang Ying (Êù®Ëã±; born 1959) was the featured soloist for the Chinese National Song and Dance Ensemble (‰∏≠Â§ÆÊ≠åËàûÂõ¢) of Beijing from 1978 to 1996. She was a national Erhu champion, frequently recorded for the Chinese film and record industry, and is listed in famous persons of China. Sun Huang Â≠ôÂá∞ has recently recorded a difficult classical violin piece, played by her on the Erhuhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4aOmJgUbM4 Presence in popular music The Erhu is featured along with other traditional Chinese instruments such as the Pipa in the contemporary Chinese instrumental music group Twelve Girls Band. They perform traditional Chinese music as well as Western classical and popular music. A few groups have used the Erhu in a rock context. As of 2012, the Taiwanese black metal band Chthonic remain the only black metal band to use the erhu. The New Jersey-based progressive rock band The Hsu-nami plays a variety of rock sub-styles including metal, psychedelic, prog rock, and funk. An amplified Erhu takes the place of lead vocals. Chie Mukai of the Japanese improv unit Ch√©-SHIZU also plays the Erhu. Another group which falls more under Electronica/Drum & Bass is a musical duo from Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The group, known as USS or Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker, uses an Erhu in a different context. The USS sound is a mixture of drum and bass beats, grunge-like guitar riffs and two-step rhythms. The Erhu is notable in its appearances on their two released CDs, \\"Wielding the C\\" and \\"Questamation\\". Toronto physician and composer Dr. Ian Pun (ÊΩòÂΩ•Ë°°; born 1965) uses Erhu combined with a funk guitar musical riff in the 2011 song \\"Âä†Ê≤π, Âä†Ê≤π, Âä†Ê≤π!\\" performed by York University musicians Amely Zhou and Jaro Dabrowski. Nine Inch Nails bandmember Joshua Eustis has been seen playing an Erhu while on tour, during the song \\"Disappointed\\". Chihsuan Yang plays an Erhu as a solo instrument with Corky Siegel's Chamber Blues on tour and on their new Different Voices CD. Composer Jeremy Zuckerman has used the Erhu in critically acclaimed shows' music such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and The Legend of Korra. Specifically, he has said in the podcast Song Exploder that along with the Zhonghu, he used the Erhu in The Legend of Korra's series finale music.https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQA5HfTIlkiMAOMY5KnYK See also * Dan nhi * Dotara * Ektara * Haegeum, traditional Korean musical instrument. * Huqin, family of traditional Chinese spike fiddles. * Khuuchir * Morin khuur * Music of China * Rebab * String instruments * Traditional Chinese musical instruments Bibliography * Stephen Jones (1995).

Fried clams are an iconic food, \\"to New England, what barbecue is to the South\\". They tend to be served at seaside clam shacks (roadside restaurants). Clam rolls are fried clams served in a hot dog bun. Tartar sauce is the usual condiment. Preparation The clams are dipped in evaporated milk, and coated with a combination of regular, corn, and/or pastry flour. Then the coated clams are fried in canola oil or soybean oil, or lard. The usual variant in New England is made from whole soft-shell clams, known as \\"whole-bellies\\"; these include the clam's gastrointestinal tract and have a fuller flavor. Some restaurants remove the clam's chewy siphon called the neck. Outside New England, \\"clam strips\\", made of sliced parts of Atlantic surf clams, are more common. History 1865 menu with fried clams and oystersFried clams are mentioned as early as 1840,William E. Burton, \\"Thaumaturgia\\", in William E. Burton and Edgar A. Poe, eds., Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, and Monthly American Review, January 1840, p. 70 and are listed on an 1865 menu from the Parker House hotel. How exactly they were prepared is unclear; the 1865 menu offers both \\"oysters‚Äîfried\\" and \\"oysters‚Äîfried in batter\\", but only \\"fried clams\\".see the Parker House menu from 1865 with fried clams and oysters to the right Nineteenth-century American cookbooks describe several different dishes of fried clams: * Seasoned clams saut√©ed in butter.

(1850) (1904) The modern deep-fried, breaded version is generally credited to Lawrence Henry \\"Chubby\\" Woodman from Essex, Massachusetts. He is said to have created the first batch on July 3, 1916, in his small roadside restaurant, now Woodman's of Essex. One of his specialties was potato chips, so he had large vats for deep-frying. He used clams he had collected himself from the mud flats of the Essex River, located close to his home. Later, Thomas Soffron, of Soffron Brothers Clam Co., based in Ipswich, Massachusetts, created clam strips, which are made from the \\"foot\\" of hard-shelled sea clams. He sold these to Howard Johnson's in an exclusive deal, and as the chain expanded, they became popular throughout the country.

The station is not to be confused with Waddesdon Road railway station at the other end of the Waddesdon Manor estate on the Brill Tramway. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Waddesdon (shown here as Waddesdon Manor) alt=Map of mainly open countryside, with scattered villages. Four railway lines diverge from a station labelled Quainton Road. Two stations, labelled Waddesdon and Waddesdon Manor, are not near any populated area. The station was first opened as Waddesdon Manor by the Metropolitan Railway on 1 January 1897. \\"Manor\\" was dropped from the name on 1 October 1922. It was the first station north of Aylesbury on the section of the Metropolitan Railway between Aylesbury and . The Metropolitan Railway amalgamated with several other transport companies to form the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. The station was closed on 6 July 1936 when their services were curtailed at Aylesbury. While open, the station was also served by former Great Central Main Line (running on the same tracks as the Metropolitan line as far as Quainton Road) which was not itself closed to passengers until 1966, under the Beeching Axe. Today the permanent way, now single-track, remains in place through the site of the station. One platform of the station (on the side remote from the remaining track) remains; the other has been demolished. The line is still used for a daily freight train carrying waste from London to Calvert, as well as special services between Aylesbury and Quainton Road for events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. Because of its association with the Metropolitan line this station is considered to be one of the Closed London Underground stations although it is from London and is not underground.

Chivery's southern boundary is formed by the ancient earthworks known as Grim's Ditch. To the north it is bounded by Wendover Woods. Historically Chivery was part of the manor of Aston Clinton. It was created at the end of the 12th century when William de Clinton created the manor of Aston Chiverey provided a dowry for his daughter Alice who married Reginald de Mohun. On his death in 1213 Alice married Robert de Beauchamp. From 1250 until around 1380 the manor was held by the Audley family until through marriage it passed to John Rose, an esquire of Richard II of England. By 1410 in Henry IV's reign it had passed to the Crown before being recovered by John Rose's descendant Thomas St Clair. Thomas' lands were divided on his death in 1483 and his daughter Eleanor inherited the manor of Aston Chiverey and through marriage the land became part of the estates of John Gage. His grandson Sir John Gage sold the manor to Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury in 1534, whereon it became recombined with the manor of Aston Clinton once more. The Countess was executed on Henry VIII's orders in 1451 and all her lands were forfeit and split up. Ownership of the manor resided with William Batchelor until 1555 when the properties passed in his will to his brother-in-law Thomas Gewat. However, by 1582 the fields were being farmed by Silvester and John Baldwin and the woodlands by another John Gage. By this time also the manor had become part of the St Leonards parish, which had split from Aston Clinton. During the 19th century Chivery became part of a new parish of Aston Clinton St Leonards. In 1934 Chivery was hived off from St Leonards which was combined with other parishes to become Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards parish within Amersham Rural District while Chivery became part of Aston Clinton parish, also in Aylesbury Rural District. From 1776 Chivery had a pub, The Plough which survived into the 20th century becoming a restaurant before finally closing in the 1930s.

Iji Shinbun, no 1219, 10 Sept. 1927. (Summary in Esperanto) Moxibustion () is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy which consists of burning dried mugwort (wikt:moxa) on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in the traditional medical systems of China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a cigar-shaped stick. They can use it indirectly, with acupuncture needles, or burn it on the patient's skin.  Terminology  The first Western remarks on moxibustion can be found in letters and reports written by Portuguese missionaries in 16th-century Japan. They called it \\"bot√£o de fogo\\" (fire button), a term originally used for round-headed Western cautery irons. Hermann Buschoff, who published the first Western book on this matter in 1674 (English edition 1676), used the Japanese pronunciation mogusa. As the u is not very strongly enunciated, he spelled it \\"Moxa\\". Later authors blended \\"Moxa\\" with the Latin word combustio (burning). The name of the herb Artemisia (mugwort) species used to produce Moxa is and √†i or √†ic«éo (, ) in ChineseThere is a great variety of further Chinese names (bingtai „ÄÅecao „ÄÅxiang'ai „ÄÅqiai „ÄÅaihao „ÄÅjiucao Ôπëyicao Ôπëhuangcao Ôπëairong ) and yomogi () in Japan. The Chinese names for moxibustion are ji«î ( ) or ji«îsh√π ( ); the Japanese use the same characters and pronounce them as ky≈´ and ky≈´jutsu. In Korean the reading is tteum (). Korean folklore attributes the development of moxibustion to the legendary emperor Dangun.

The stick-on moxa is a modern product sold in Japan, Korea, and China. Usually the base is self-adhesive to the treatment point.  Theory and practice  Practitioners use moxa to warm regions and meridian pointsNot all acupuncture points can be used for moxibustion. A few of them are preferred in both classical literature and modern research: Zusanli (ST-36), Dazhui (GV-14). with the intention of stimulating circulation through the points and inducing a smoother flow of blood and qi. Some believe it can treat conditions associated with the \\"cold\\" or \\"yang deficiencies\\" in Chinese Medicine.https://www.yinovacenter.com/chinese-medicine/moxibustion/ It is claimed that moxibustion mitigates against cold and dampness in the body, and can serve to turn breech babies.American Journal of Chinese Medicine, Winter, 2001, Yoichi Kanakura, et al.Cochrane Library Practitioners claim moxibustion to be especially effective in the treatment of chronic problems, \\"deficient conditions\\" (weakness), and gerontology. Bian Que (fl. circa 500 BCE), one of the most famous semi-legendary doctors of Chinese antiquity and the first specialist in moxibustion, discussed the benefits of moxa over acupuncture in his classic work Bian Que Neijing. He asserted that moxa could add new energy to the body and could treat both excess and deficient conditions. Practitioners may use acupuncture needles made of various materials in combination with moxa, depending on the direction of qi flow they wish to stimulate. There are several methods of moxibustion. Three of them are direct scarring, direct non-scarring, and indirect moxibustion. Direct scarring moxibustion places a small cone of moxa on the skin at an acupuncture point and burns it until the skin blisters, which then scars after it heals. Direct non-scarring moxibustion removes the burning moxa before the skin burns enough to scar, unless the burning moxa is left on the skin too long. Indirect moxibustion holds a cigar made of moxa near the acupuncture point to heat the skin, or holds it on an acupuncture needle inserted in the skin to heat the needle. There is also stick-on moxa. Chuanwu lingji lu (the Record of Sovereign Teachings), by Zhang Youheng, was a treatise on acu-moxa completed in 1869 and featuring several colour illustrations of the points on the body where moxa could be applied to treat the complaint.

Medical research  The first modern scientific publication on moxibustion was written by the Japanese physician Hara Shimetar≈ç who conducted intensive research about the hematological effects of moxibustion in 1927. Two years later his doctoral dissertation on that matter was accepted by the Medical Faculty of the Ky≈´sh≈´ Imperial University.English summary of S. Hara‚Äôs findings Hara's last publication appeared in 1981. A Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the use of moxibustion in correcting breech presentation of babies and called for more experimental trials. Side effects included nausea, throat irritation, and abdominal pain from contractions. Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis, constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to publication bias.  Parallel uses of mugwort  Mugwort amongst other herbs was often bound into smudge sticks. The Chumash people from southern California have a similar ritual. Europeans placed sprigs of mugwort under pillows to provoke dreams; and the herb had associations with the practice of magic in Anglo- Saxon times.

Existing in the Alhambra Unified School District, it administers one of the most extensive high school and adult education programs in California, offering hundreds of academic, cultural, and recreational courses, day and evening, many located on the school grounds. In 2005, it was given a California Distinguished Schools award. The school is located on Second Street, across the street from City Hall and the Police Department, bounded by Second Street, Commonwealth Avenue, Fifth Street, and Main Street. The campus is divided into three parts, by Third and Fourth Streets. Present As of January 2015, enrollment at AHS is 3080 students, In this ethnically-mixed school district, the high school is one of the three comprehensive high schools. Curriculum offerings encompass Reading for remedial instruction, to Advanced Placement courses in six subjects, including English composition, Calculus, Environmental science, Physics, American Government/Civics, United States History, World History, Art History, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, and Psychology History Around 1884, Alhambra citizens saw the need for their own school. Two elections failed, because of the resistance of the San Gabriel School District. Alhambrans then petitioned for a partitioning of the district, placating the San Gabriel District by giving San Gabriel school at Vega and Main Streets. Old Mill Creek became the dividing line on the east, with a deviation that gave San Gabriel the school. Thus began the rivalry the schools hold with each other until this day.Community Life - History of Alhambra When the petition was granted, Sebastian Shaw, the school's principal, and the Alhambra students set up classes in an old redwood cabin on property on South Chapel near Beacon Street. A fire hydrant across the furrowed field on Garfield Avenue provided drinking water for the school. When the roof caught fire one day, the children used their dinner pails to bring water to douse the blaze. A $10,000 bond election was passed to build a school, and a site was purchased for $175 at Garfield and Alhambra Road. There a four-room, two-story frame building was constructed. In September 1887, the school opened with 27 elementary and high school students. Mrs. E. Jones was the teacher and principal. The cornerstone for Alhambra High School was laid in April of that year, and Alhambra High School opened in 1898, between Second and Third Streets, south of Main Street. On October 11, 2006, a small explosive device was found on a sidewalk bordering the north end of campus. Hours later, a second similar device was found in a trash can on the south end of campus. The Los Angeles County sheriff's bomb squad safely removed and disabled both items, and the campus was searched.Pasadena Star-News - Bomb scare at school In early 2007, Alhambra High School hosted Hell's Kitchen. 100 members from the senior class of 2007 were invited to participate.

It discussed that Hispanic students' test scores have improved, then asked why Asian scores were noticeably higher, postulating that Asian students worked harder in academics than Hispanic students, suggesting the latter were \\"not pulling their weight\\". The Los Angeles Times discussed the achievement gap in context, noting the outrage and charges of racism towards the student author and the Latino pride response.

His trial, conviction, and appeals attracted national attention. His lynching two years later, in response to the commutation of his death sentence, became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted and Jim Conley was likely the actual murderer. Born to a Jewish- American family in Texas, Frank was raised in New York and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. At that time, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories owned by members of the Jewish community. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a \\"night witch\\", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory. On May 24, 1913, Frank was indicted on a charge of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice in the aftermath of the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was, in fact, the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment. The case attracted national press and many reporters deemed the conviction a travesty. Within Georgia, this outside criticism fueled antisemitism and hatred toward Frank. On August 16, 1915, he was kidnapped from prison by a group of armed men, and lynched at Marietta, Mary Phagan's hometown, the next morning. The new governor vowed to punish the lynchers, who included prominent Marietta citizens, but nobody was charged. In 1986, Frank was posthumously pardoned by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, although not officially absolved of the crime. The case inspired various media productions, including movies, plays, a TV miniseries, and books. Background =Social and economic conditions= In the early 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, underwent significant economic and social change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 7‚Äì8.MacLean p. 921. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe workplaces.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 7. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that women were moving to the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were viewed as places for potential moral corruption.MacLean p. 919.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 10. During this era, Atlanta's rabbis and Jewish community leaders helped to resolve tensions toward Jews. In the half-century from 1895, David Marx was a prominent figure in the city. In order to aid assimilation, Marx's Reform temple adopted Americanized appearances. Nevertheless, friction developed between the city's German Jews, who were integrated, and Russian Jews who had recently immigrated. Rabbi Marx said the new residents were \\"barbaric and ignorant\\" and believed their presence would create new antisemitic attitudes and a situation which made possible Frank's guilty verdict.Lindemann p. 231. Despite their success, many Jews recognized themselves as different from the Gentile majority and were uncomfortable with their image. Despite his acceptance by Gentiles, Marx believed that \\"in isolated instances there is no prejudice entertained for the individual Jew, but there exists wide-spread and deep seated prejudice against Jews as an entire people.\\"Dinnerstein 1994, p. 181. An example of the type of tension that Rabbi Marx feared occurred in April 1913. At a conference involving the issue of child labor, many proposed solutions were presented that covered the entire political spectrum. Author Steve Oney has written: \\"At the radical end of the spectrum could be heard alarming notions inspired by the fact that many of Atlanta's factories ... were Jewish owned.\\"Oney p. 7. Historian Leonard Dinnerstein summarized Atlanta's situation in 1913 as follows: =Early life= Leo Max Frank was born in Cuero, TexasFrey p. 19. on April 17, 1884 to Rudolph Frank and Rachel \\"Rae\\" Jacobs.Oney p. 10. The family moved to Brooklyn in 1884 when Leo was three months old.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 5. He attended New York City public schools and graduated from Pratt Institute in 1902. He then attended Cornell University, where he studied mechanical engineering. After graduating in 1906, he worked briefly as a draftsman and as a testing engineer.Frey p. 20. At the invitation of his uncle Moses Frank, Leo traveled to Atlanta for two weeks in late October 1907 to meet a delegation of investors for a position with the National Pencil Company, a manufacturing plant in which Moses was a major shareholder. Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at the Eberhard Faber pencil factory. After a nine-month apprenticeship, Frank returned to the United States and began working at the National Pencil Company in August 1908. Frank became superintendent of the factory the following month, earning $180 per month plus a portion of the factory's profits.Lindemann p. 251. Frank was introduced to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta.Oney p. 80. She came from a prominent, upper-middle class Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta. Though she was less devout in her Jewish faith than Frank, they married in November 1910.Oney p. 84. Frank described his married life as happy.Oney pp. 85, 483. In 1912, Frank was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization.Oney p. 11. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge.Lawson pp. 211, 250.Phagan Kean p. 111. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.Alphin p. 26. Murder of Mary Phagan Mary Phagan as shown in The Atlanta Journal =Phagan's early life= Mary Phagan was born on June 1, 1899, into an established Georgia family of tenant farmers.Phagan Kean p. 11. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia.Phagan Kean p. 14. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house.Phagan Kean pp. 12, 14. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part- time in a textile mill.Oney p. 5. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took a job with the National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked on the second floor of the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.Frey p. 5. =Discovery of Phagan's body= On April 21, 1913, Phagan was laid off due to a shortage of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, she went to the factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00 a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet.Oney p. 21. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body in the rear of the basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A strip of wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to first responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.Oney pp. 18‚Äì19. A service ramp at the rear of the basement led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar.Oney pp. 20‚Äì22. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.Oney pp. 30‚Äì31. Two notes were found in a pile of rubbish by Phagan's head, and became known as the \\"murder notes\\". One said: \\"he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef.\\" The other said, \\"mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me.\\" The phrase \\"night witch\\" was thought to mean \\"night watch[man]\\"; when the notes were initially read aloud, Lee, who was black, said: \\"Boss, it looks like they are trying to lay it on me.\\" Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white, when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.Golden pp. 19, 102.Oney pp. 20‚Äì21, 379. =Police investigation= One of the two murder notes found near the body In addition to Lee, the police arrested a friend of Phagan's for the crime.Oney pp. 61‚Äì62. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on the second floor (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.Oney pp. 46‚Äì47. Both Newt Lee, after the discovery of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4 a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27.Oney p. 31. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory.Phagan Kean p. 76. When the police arrived after 7 a.m. without telling the specifics of what happened at the factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45 a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.Oney pp. 27‚Äì32. On Monday, April 28, Frank, accompanied by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10 p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4 p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6 p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate that he had no cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.Oney pp. 48‚Äì51. Frank then met with his assistant, N. V. Darley, and Harry Scott of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, whom Frank hired to investigate the case and prove his innocence.Oney p. 62. The Pinkerton detectives would investigate many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank's case. Unbeknownst to Frank, however, was Scott's close ties with the police, particularly his best friend, detective John Black who believed in Frank's guilt from the outset. On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's residence at 11 a.m. looking for evidence, and found a blood-smeared shirt at the bottom of a burn barrel.Oney p. 65. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.Oney pp. 65‚Äì66. Frank was subsequently arrested around 11:30 a.m. at the factory. Steve Oney states that \\"no single development had persuaded ... [the police] that Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan. Instead, to the cumulative weight of Sunday's suspicions and Monday's misgivings had been added several last factors that tipped the scale against the superintendent.\\"Oney p. 61. These factors were the dropped charges against two suspects; the rejection of rumors that Phagan had been seen on the streets, making Frank the last person to admit seeing Phagan; Frank's meeting with the Pinkertons; and a \\"shifting view of Newt Lee's role in the affair.\\"Oney pp. 63‚Äì64. The police were convinced Lee was involved as Frank's accomplice and that Frank was trying to implicate him. To bolster their case, the police staged a confrontation between Lee and Frank while both were still in custody; there were conflicting accounts of this meeting, but the police interpreted it as further implicating Frank.Oney pp. 69‚Äì70. On Wednesday, April 30, a coroner's inquest was held. Frank testified about his activities on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration. A young man said that Phagan had complained to him about Frank. Several former employees spoke of Frank flirting with other women; one said she was actually propositioned. The detectives admitted that \\"they so far had obtained no conclusive evidence or clues in the baffling mystery ...\\". Lee and Frank were both ordered to be detained.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 16‚Äì17. In May, the detective William J. Burns traveled to Atlanta to offer further assistance in the case.Oney p. 102. However, his Burns Agency withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who was assigned to the case, said that the agency \\"came down here to investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic[s].\\"Oney p. 112. The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.Oney p. 111. =James \\"Jim\\" Conley= Jim Conley as shown in the August 1915 issue of Watson's Magazine The prosecution based much of its case on the testimony of Jim Conley, the factory's janitor, who is believed by many historians to be the actual murderer. The police had arrested Conley on May 1 after he had been seen washing red stains out of a blue work shirt; detectives examined it for blood, but determined that it was rust as Conley had claimed, and returned it.Oney p. 118. Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement. He said that, on the day of the murder, he had been visiting saloons, shooting dice, and drinking. His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that \\"a black negro ... dressed in dark blue clothing and hat\\" had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder. Further investigation determined that Conley could read and write,Oney pp. 128‚Äì129. and there were similarities in his spelling with that found on the murder notes. On May 24, he admitted he had written the notes, swearing that Frank had called him to his office the day before the murder and told him to write them.Oney pp. 129‚Äì132. After testing Conley again on his spellinghe spelled \\"night watchman\\" as \\"night witch\\"the police were convinced he had written the notes. They were skeptical about the rest of his story, not only because it implied premeditation by Frank, but also because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him.Oney pp. 133‚Äì134. In a new affidavit (his second affidavit and third statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He said he had met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told him to leave the factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.Oney pp. 134‚Äì136. The police were satisfied with the new story, and both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Georgian gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the Journal. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day.Oney p. 3. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in The Atlanta Constitution saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.Oney pp. 137‚Äì138. On May 29, Conley was interviewed for four hours.Oney p. 138.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 24. His new affidavit said that Frank told him, \\"he had picked up a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something.\\" Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two had returned to the office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, \\"Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens.\\" Conley's affidavit concluded, \\"The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter.\\"Oney pp. 139‚Äì140. At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.Oney p. 242. The Georgian hired William Manning Smith to represent Conley for $40. Smith was known for specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman. He had also taken an elderly black woman's civil case as far as the Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit, he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the Hearst papers, who had taken Frank's side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the Georgian.Oney pp. 147‚Äì148. On February 24, 1914, Conley was sentenced to a year in jail for being an accomplice after the fact to the murder of Mary Phagan.Frey p. 132. =Media coverage= The Atlanta Georgian headline on April 29, 1913, showing that the police suspected Frank and Newt Lee. The Atlanta Constitution broke the story of the murder and was soon in competition with The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Georgian. Forty extra editions came out the day Phagan's murder was reported. The Atlanta Georgian published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan, in which her head was shown spliced onto the body of another girl. The papers offered a total of $1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer.Oney pp. 36, 60. Soon after the murder, Atlanta's mayor criticized the police for their steady release of information to the public. The governor, noting the reaction of the public to press sensationalism soon after Lee's and Frank's arrests, organized ten militia companies in case they were needed to repulse mob action against the prisoners.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 15. Coverage of the case in the local press continued nearly unabated throughout the investigation, trial, and subsequent appeal process. Newspaper reports throughout the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, \\"Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the yellow journalism account of Mary Phagan's death aroused an anxious city, and within a few days, a shocked state.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, p. 14. Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta's working class saw Frank as \\"a defiler of young girls\\", while the German-Jewish community saw him as \\"an exemplary man and loyal husband.\\"Oney pp. 74, 87‚Äì90. Albert Lindemann, author of The Jew Accused, opined that \\"ordinary people\\" may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in \\"suspend[ing] judgment over a long period of time\\" while the case developed.Lindemann p. 249. As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public's attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan's killer to justice. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that \\"another defeat, and in a case where the feeling was so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, p. 19. Trial The courtroom on July 28, 1913. Dorsey is examining witness Newt Lee. Frank is in the center. On May 23, 1913, a grand jury convened to hear evidence for an indictment against Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment.Oney pp. 115‚Äì116, 236. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.Oney pp. 178‚Äì188. On July 28, the trial began at the Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900.Leonard S. Roan, 1913‚Äì1914. Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia. The prosecution team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley's attorney and Dorsey's jury consultant). Frank was represented by a team of eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas.Oney p. 191. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury.Knight p. 189. Both legal teams, in planning their trial strategy, considered the implications of trying a white man based on the testimony of a black man in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as \\"a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous.\\"Melnick p. 41. Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as \\"a familiar type\\" of \\"old negro\\", like a minstrel or plantation worker. Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining the immediate aftermath of the murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 37, 58. The prosecution presented witnesses who testified to bloodstains and strands of hair found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office.Oney p. 233. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested the place of the murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor.Oney pp. 208‚Äì209, 231‚Äì232. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.Golden pp. 118‚Äì139.Phagan Kean p. 105.Oney p. 205. The defense, to support their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, although he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open and there was no purse in it.Oney pp. 197, 256, 264, 273. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.Oney pp. 179, 225, 228. =Frank's alleged sexual behavior= The prosecution focused on Frank's alleged sexual behavior. They alleged that Frank, with Conley's assistance, regularly met with women in his office for sexual relations. On the day of the murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan's body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan's body to the basement via the elevator, before returning in the elevator to the office where Frank dictated the murder notes.Oney pp. 241‚Äì243.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 40‚Äì41. Conley was cross-examined by the defense for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire testimony concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 45‚Äì47, 57.Oney pp. 245‚Äì247, 252‚Äì253, 258‚Äì259, 265‚Äì266, 279. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death.Oney pp. 75‚Äì76. Ferguson testified that she had tried to get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.Oney pp. 273, 280. The defense called a number of factory girls, who testified that they had never seen Frank flirting with or touching the girls, and that they considered him to be of good character.Oney pp. 295‚Äì296. In the prosecution's rebuttal, Dorsey called \\"a steady parade of former factory workers\\" to ask them the question, \\"Do you know Mr. Frank's character for lasciviousness?\\" The answers were usually \\"bad\\".Oney pp. 309‚Äì311. =Timeline= The Atlanta Journal diagram of Jim Conley's account of the events after Phagan's murder The prosecution realized early on that issues relating to time would be an essential part of its case.Oney p. 115. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15 p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 37‚Äì40.Oney pp. 50, 100. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived. Lemmie Quinn, foreman of the metal room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank in his office at 12:20.Oney pp. 278, 285. Frank had not mentioned Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office,Oney pp. 87, 285. and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left.Lawson p. 226. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 49.Oney p. 359. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as \\"a fraud\\" and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.Oney p. 329. Newt Lee, the night watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was normally calm, came bustling out of his office.Lawson pp. 182‚Äì183. Frank told Lee that he had not yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 2. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out and have a good time in town before coming back.Phagan Kean p. 70. When Lee returned at 6:00, James Gantt had also arrived. Lee told police that Gantt, a former employee who had been fired by Frank after $2 was found missing from the cash box, wanted to look for two pairs of shoes he had left at the factory. Frank allowed Gantt in, although Lee said that Frank appeared to be upset by Gantt's appearance.Oney pp. 47‚Äì48. Frank arrived home at 6:25; at 7:00, he called Lee to determine if everything had gone all right with Gantt.Oney pp. 50‚Äì51. =Conviction and sentencing= During the trial, the prosecution alleged bribery and witness tampering attempts by the Frank legal team.Phagan Kean p. 160. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and outside the courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder. The Constitution described the scene as Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall: \\"...three muscular men swung Mr. Dorsey, (the prosecuting attorney,) on their shoulders and passed him over the heads of the crowd across the street to his office. With hat raised and tears coursing down his cheeks, the victor in Georgia‚Äôs most noted criminal battle was tumbled over a shrieking throng that wildly proclaimed its admiration.\\"\\"Finds Mob Frenzy Convicted Frank.\\" The New York Times, December 14, 1914. On August 26, the day after the guilty verdict was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private chambers and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank.Lawson p. 409. This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.Oney pp. 352‚Äì353. Appeals Under Georgia law at the time, appeals of death penalty cases had to be based on errors of law, not a re-evaluation of the evidence presented at trial.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 77. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non- involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 77‚Äì78. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, \\"I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I do not have to be convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that.\\"Oney p. 364.Linder, Douglas. \\"New Evidence and Appeals,\\" in The Trial of Leo Frank: An Account.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 79.Friedman pp. 1477‚Äì80 with footnotes 39‚Äì52. =State appeals= The next step, a hearing before the Georgia Supreme Court, was held on December 15. In addition to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan's doubts in the defense's bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for \\"carry[ing] the views of the judge.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 81, 163‚Äì165.Oney pp. 369‚Äì370. On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4‚Äì2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an \\"abuse of discretion\\" was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley's testimony on Frank's alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley's statements more credible and helped to explain Frank's motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan's stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 81‚Äì82. The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley's testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: \\"It is perfectly clear to us that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant ... did not tend to prove a preexisting design, system, plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure.\\" They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors' eyes and denied him a fair trial.Oney p. 370. The last hearing exhausted Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution was set for April 17 of that year.Oney p. 377. The defense continued to investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914.Oney p. 395. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the hair on the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At the same time that the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 84‚Äì90, 102‚Äì105.Oney pp. 371‚Äì373, 378‚Äì380, 385‚Äì387, 389‚Äì390. The defense also raised a federal constitutional issue on whether Frank's absence from the court when the verdict was announced \\"constituted deprivation of the due process of law\\". Different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since Rosser and Arnold had acquiesced in Frank's absence. There was a debate between Rosser and Arnold on whether it should be raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of the other evidence being presented. Louis Marshall, President of the American Jewish Committee and constitutional lawyer, urged them to raise the point, and the decision was made that it should be made clear that if the extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through the federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in the trial.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 90‚Äì91. For almost every issue presented by the defense, the state had a response: most of the repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by the witnesses; the question of whether outdated order pads used to write the murder notes had been in the basement before the murder was disputed; the integrity of the defense's investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged; and the significance of Conley's letters to Annie Carter was disputed.Oney pp. 403‚Äì416. The defense, in its rebuttal, tried to bolster the testimony relating to the murder notes and the Carter letters. (These issues were reexamined later when the governor considered commuting Frank's sentence.)Oney pp. 416‚Äì417. During the defense's closing argument, the issue of the repudiations was put to rest by Judge Hill's ruling that the court could only consider the revocation of testimony if the subject were tried and found guilty of perjury.Oney p. 418. The judge denied Frank a new trial and the full court upheld the decision on November 14, 1914. The full court also said that the due process issue should have been raised earlier, characterizing what it considered a belated effort as \\"trifling with the court\\".Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 107‚Äì108.Oney p. 446. =Federal appeals= The next step for the Frank team was to appeal the issue through the federal system. The original request for a writ of error on the absence of Frank from the jury's announcement of the verdict was first denied by Justice Joseph Rucker Lamar and then Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Both denied the request because they agreed with the Georgia court that the issue was raised too late. The full Supreme Court then heard arguments, but denied the motion without issuing a written decision. However, Holmes said, \\"I very seriously doubt if the petitioner ... has had due process of law ... because of the trial taking place in the presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd, thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered.\\"Freedman p. 56.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 109. Holmes' statement, as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by the courts, encouraged Frank's team to attempt a habeas corpus motion, arguing that the threat of crowd violence had forced Frank to be absent from the verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process. Justice Lamar heard the motion and agreed that the full Supreme Court should hear the appeal. On April 19, 1915, the Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 7‚Äì2 vote in the case Frank v. Mangum. Part of the decision repeated the message of the last decision: that Frank failed \\"to raise the objection in due season when fully cognizant of the fact.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, p. 110. Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes dissented, with Holmes writing, \\"It is our duty to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death.\\"Oney p. 468. Commutation of sentence =Hearing= Governor John Slaton and wife On April 22, 1915, an application for a commutation of Frank's death sentence was submitted to a three-person Prison Commission in Georgia; it was rejected on June 9 by a vote of 2‚Äì1. The dissenter indicated that he felt it was wrong to execute a man \\"on the testimony of an accomplice, when the circumstances of the crime tend to fix the guilt upon the accomplice.\\"Oney pp. 470, 473, 480‚Äì488. The application then passed to Governor John Slaton. Slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after Frank's scheduled execution. In 1913, before Phagan's murder, Slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of Luther Rosser, who became Frank's lead attorney (Slaton was not directly involved in the original trial). After the commutation, popular Georgia politician Tom Watson attacked Slaton, often focusing on his partnership with Rosser as a conflict of interest.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 123‚Äì124.Lindemann p. 270. Slaton opened hearings on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations from both sides with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake.Oney pp. 489‚Äì499. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, \\"In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, the way to do it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts.\\"\\"Begin Last Frank Plea to Governor\\", The New York Times, June 13, 1915.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 125. According to Tom Watson's biographer, C. Vann Woodward, \\"While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'\\"Woodward p. 440. Slaton produced a 29-page report. In the first part, he criticized outsiders who were unfamiliar with the evidence, especially the press in the North. He defended the trial court's decision, which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict. He summarized points of the state's case against Frank that \\"any reasonable person\\" would accept and said of Conley that \\"It is hard to conceive that any man's power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which Conley showed, unless it be the truth.\\" After having made these points, Slaton's narrative changed course and asked the rhetorical question, \\"Did Conley speak the truth?\\"Oney pp. 499‚Äì500. Leonard Dinnerstein wrote, \\"Slaton based his opinions primarily upon the inconsistencies he had discovered in the narrative of Jim Conley.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, p. 127. Two factors stood out to Slaton: the transporting of the body to the basement and the murder notes.Oney pp. 500‚Äì501. Transport of the body During the initial investigation, police had noted undisturbed human excrement in the elevator shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that the elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony. During the commutation hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey to address this issue. Dorsey said that the elevator did not always go all the way to the bottom and could be stopped anywhere. Frank's attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, who said that the elevator stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, \\"If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted.\\"Oney pp. 495‚Äì496, 501. Murder notes The murder notes had been analyzed before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous evidence at the commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written in the third person rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.Oney p. 482. Conley's former attorney, William Smith, had become convinced that his client had committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page analysis of the notes for the defense. He analyzed \\"speech and writing patterns\\" and \\"spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [and] favorite verb forms\\". He concluded, \\"In this article I show clearly that Conley did not tell the truth about those notes.\\"Oney p. 483. Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words \\"like\\", \\"play\\", \\"lay\\", \\"love\\", and \\"hisself\\". He also found double adjectives such as \\"long tall negro\\", \\"tall, slim build heavy man\\", and \\"good long wide piece of cord in his hands\\".Oney p. 433. Slaton was also convinced that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank's office. Slaton accepted the defense's argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 128. Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, when he left the company in 1912, \\"he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders ... and sent them down to the basement to be burned. This evidence was never passed upon by the jury and developed since the trial.\\"Golden pp. 267‚Äì269. =Timing and physical evidence= Slaton's narrative touched on other aspects of the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense's argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense's interpretation of the timeline;Oney p. 501. citing the evidence produced at trialincluding the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer officehe wrote: \\"Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room it hardly seems possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered.\\"Golden pp. 268‚Äì269. Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 127‚Äì128. Slaton also commented on Conley's story (that Conley was watching out for the arrival of a lady for Frank on the day of the murder): =Conclusion= On Monday, June 21, 1915, Slaton released the order to commute Frank's murder conviction to life imprisonment. Slaton's legal rationale was that there was sufficient new evidence not available at the original trial to justify Frank's actions.Oney p. 502. He wrote: The commutation was headline news. Atlanta Mayor Jimmy Woodward remarked that \\"The larger part of the population believes Frank guilty and that the commutation was a mistake.\\"Oney p. 503. In response, Slaton invited the press to his home that afternoon, telling them: He also told reporters that he was certain that Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence. =Reaction of the public= The public was outraged. A mob threatened to attack the governor at his home. A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen and a group of Slaton's friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob.John M. Slaton (1866‚Äì1955), The New Georgia Encyclopedia. Slaton had been a popular governor, but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter.\\"Slaton Here; Glad He Saved Frank\\", The New York Times, June 30, 1915. For Frank's protection, he was taken to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary in the middle of the night before the commutation was announced. The penitentiary was \\"strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms\\" and separated from Marietta by of mostly unpaved road.Oney 2003, pp. 513‚Äì514. However, on July 17, The New York Times reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he \\"wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was a disgrace to the prison, and he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank.\\"For stories about the attack, see: *\\"Leo Frank's Throat Cut by Convict; Famous Prisoner Near Death\\", The New York Times, July 18, 1915. *\\"Frank Survives Assassin's Knife\\", The New York Times, July 19, 1915. *\\"Frank's Assailant Before Governor\\", The New York Times, July 25, 1915. *\\"Frank's Head in Braces; Excessive Heat Delaying Recovery from Wound in Throat\\", The New York Times, August 2, 1915. Antisemitism and media coverage Tom Watson, publisher of Watson's Magazine and The Jeffersonian, incited public opinion against Frank. The sensationalism in the press started before the trial and continued throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, but they were not entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant.Dinnerstein 1987, p. 31. On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would \\"amount to judicial murder.\\" Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on \\"the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial.\\"Oney pp. 381‚Äì382. On October 12, 1913, the New York Sun became the first major northern paper to give a detailed account of the Frank trial. In discussing the charges of antisemitism in the trial, it described Atlanta as more liberal on the subject than any other southern cities. It went on to say that antisemitism did arise during the trial as Atlantans reacted to statements attributed to Frank's Jewish supporters, who dismissed Phagan as \\"nothing but a factory girl\\". The paper said, \\"The anti-Semitic feeling was the natural result of the belief that the Jews had banded to free Frank, innocent or guilty. The supposed solidarity of the Jews for Frank, even if he was guilty, caused a Gentile solidarity against him.\\"Oney p. 366. On November 8, 1913, the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee, headed by Louis Marshall, addressed the Frank case. They did so following Judge Roan's reconsideration motion and motivated by the issues raised in the Sun. They chose not to take a public stance as a committee, instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of Frank. Albert Lasker, a wealthy advertising magnate, responded to these calls to help Frank. Lasker contributed personal funds and arranged a public relations effort in support of Frank. In Atlanta, during the time of the extraordinary motion, Lasker coordinated Frank's meetings with the press and coined the slogan \\"The Truth Is on the March\\" to characterize the efforts of Frank's defense team. He persuaded prominent figures such as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams to make statements supporting Frank.Oney pp. 367, 377‚Äì378, 388. During the commutation hearing, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall weighed in, as did many leading magazine and newspaper editors, including Herbert Croly, editor of the New Republic; C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the Chicago Tribune; Mark Sullivan, editor of Collier's; R. E. Stafford, editor of the Daily Oklahoman; and D. D. Moore, editor of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.Oney p. 491. Adolph Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, became involved about the same time as Lasker, organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for Frank. Both Ochs and Lasker attempted to heed Louis Marshall's warnings about antagonizing the \\"sensitiveness of the southern people and engender the feeling that the north is criticizing the courts and the people of Georgia.\\" Dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed, \\"because many Georgians interpreted every item favorable to Frank as a hostile act.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 91‚Äì92. Tom Watson, editor of the Jeffersonian, had remained publicly silent during Frank's trial. Among Watson's political enemies was Senator Hoke Smith, former owner of The Atlanta Journal, which was still considered to be Smith's political instrument. When the Journal called for a reevaluation of the evidence against Frank, Watson, in the March 19, 1914 edition of his magazine, attacked Smith for trying \\"to bring the courts into disrepute, drag down the judges to the level of criminals, and destroy the confidence of the people in the orderly process of the law.\\"Dinnerstein 1987, p. 97. Watson also questioned whether Frank expected \\"extraordinary favors and immunities because of his race\\" and questioned the wisdom of Jews to \\"risk the good name ... of the whole race\\" to save \\"the decadent offshoot of a great people.\\"Oney p. 383. Subsequent articles concentrated on the Frank case and became more and more impassioned in their attacks. C. Vann Woodward writes that Watson \\"pulled all the stops: Southern chivalry, sectional animus, race prejudice, class consciousness, agrarian resentment, state pride.\\" When describing the public reaction to Frank, historians mention the class and ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging the complexity of the case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that \\"economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law. ... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth.\\" Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said \\"[could] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker.\\"MacLean p. 918. Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself \\"in a position of much latent tension and symbolism.\\" Stating that it is impossible to determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that \\"[Frank was seen as] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women.\\" Abduction and lynching of Frank Former Georgia Governor Joseph Mackey Brown, one of the \\"Knights\\" The June 21, 1915 commutation provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank's lynching.Woodward p. 439. He wrote in The Jeffersonian and Watson's Magazine: \\"This country has nothing to fear from its rural communities. Lynch law is a good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people.\\"Woodward p. 432. A group of prominent men organized themselves into the \\"Knights of Mary Phagan\\" and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, and there was a locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a lay preacher.Phagan Kean p. 223. The ringleaders were well known locally but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web based on information compiled by Mary Phagan's great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953).Emory University, Leo Frank Collection, Mary Phagan Kean's list of vigilance committee's members, Box 1, Folder 14. The list included Joseph Mackey Brown, former governor of Georgia; Eugene Herbert Clay, former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E. P. Dobbs, mayor of Marietta at the time; Moultrie McKinney Sessions, lawyer and banker; part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton's clemency hearing; several current and former Cobb County sheriffs; and other individuals of various professions.Oney p. 527. On the afternoon of August 16, the eight cars of the lynch mob left Marietta separately for Milledgeville. They arrived at the prison at around 10:00 p.m., and the electrician cut the telephone wires, members of the group drained the gas from the prison's automobiles, handcuffed the warden, seized Frank, and drove away. The trip took about seven hours at a top speed of through small towns on back roads. Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of cars pass by. A site at Frey's Gin, two miles (3 km) east of Marietta, had been prepared, complete with a rope and table supplied by former Sheriff William Frey.\\"Parties Unknown.\\", Boston Evening Transcript, August 24, 1915. The New York Times reported Frank was handcuffed, his legs tied at the ankles, and that he was hanged from a branch of a tree at around 7:00 a.m., facing the direction of the house where Phagan had lived.\\"Grim Tragedy in Woods\\". The New York Times, August 19, 1915. The Atlanta Journal wrote that a crowd of men, women, and children arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves.\\"Leo Frank Forcibly Taken From Prison; He Is Hanged To A Tree Near Marietta; His Body Has Been Brought To Atlanta\\". The Atlanta Journal, August 17, 1915. In Beller, Miles; Cray, Ed; Kotler, Jonathan (eds.). American Datelines, p. 153. According to The New York Times, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, and asked for a vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.For Slaton's role, see Dinnerstein 1987, pp. 123‚Äì134. :*Also see \\"GEORGIA: A Political Suicide\\". Time, January 24, 1955. *For details of the lynching, see Coleman p. 292\\\\. :*Also see \\"Body Of Frank Is Found Dangling From A Tree Near The Phagan Home\\". Associated Press, August 17, 1915. *For the souvenirs and violence, see Alphin p. 122. Leo Frank's lynching on the morning of August 17, 1915. Judge Morris, who organized the crowd after the lynching, is on the far right in a straw hat. In Atlanta, thousands besieged the undertaker's parlor, demanding to see the body; after they began throwing bricks, they were allowed to file past the corpse. Frank's body was then transported by rail on Southern Railway's train No. 36 from Atlanta to New York and buried in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, New York on August 20, 1915.Oney pp. 573‚Äì576. (When Lucille Frank died, she was not buried with Leo; she was cremated, and eventually buried next to her parents' graves.) The New York Times wrote that the vast majority of Cobb County believed he had received his \\"just deserts\\", and that the lynch mob had simply stepped in to uphold the law after Governor Slaton arbitrarily set it aside. A Cobb County grand jury was convened to indict the lynchers; although they were well known locally, none were identified, and some of the lynchers may have served on the very same grand jury that was investigating them.Alphin p. 123. Nat Harris, the newly elected governor who succeeded Slaton, promised to punish the mob, issuing a $1,500 state reward for information. Despite this, Charles Willis Thompson of The New York Times said that the citizens of Marietta \\"would die rather than reveal their knowledge or even their suspicion [of the identities of the lynchers]\\", and the local Macon Telegraph said, \\"Doubtless they can be apprehendeddoubtful they will.\\"Oney pp. 582‚Äì583. Several photographs were taken of the lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank's nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank, they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license.Alphin p. 122. In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing in front of the body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The Columbia State, which opposed the lynching, wrote: \\"The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers.\\" Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank's body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood says there is no evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta.Wood pp. 77, 106, 148. After the trial The lynching of Frank and its publicity temporarily put a damper on lynchings. Leo Frank's case was mentioned by Adolf Kraus when he announced the creation of the Anti-Defamation League in October 1913.Moore p. 108.Chanes p. 105. After Frank's lynching, around half of Georgia's 3,000 Jews left the state.Theoharis and Cox p. 45. According to author Steve Oney, \\"What it did to Southern Jews can't be discounted ... It drove them into a state of denial about their Judaism. They became even more assimilated, anti-Israel, Episcopalian. The Temple did away with chupahs at weddingsanything that would draw attention.\\" Many American Jews saw Frank as an American Alfred Dreyfus, like Frank a victim of antisemitic persecution.Oney p. 578. Two weeks after the lynching, in the September 2, 1915 issue of The Jeffersonian, Watson wrote, \\"the voice of the people is the voice of God\\",Woodward p. 446. capitalizing on his sensational coverage of the controversial trial. In 1914, when Watson began reporting his anti-Frank message, The Jeffersonian's circulation had been 25,000; by September 2, 1915, its circulation was 87,000.Woodward p. 442. The consensus of researchers on the subject is that Frank was wrongly convicted. The Atlanta Constitution started was investigating the case again in the 1940s. A reporter who visited Frank's window (she never remarried), Lucille, stated that she started crying when he discussed the case with her. Jeffrey Melnick wrote, \\"There is near unanimity around the idea that Frank was most certainly innocent of the crime of murdering Mary Phagan.\\"Melnick p. 7. Other historians and journalists have written that the trial was \\"a miscarriage of justice\\" and \\"a gross injustice\\", \\"a mockery of justice\\", that \\"there can be no doubt, of course, that ... [Frank was] innocent\\", that \\"Leo Frank ... was unjustly and wrongly convicted of murder\\",Sorin, Gerald. AJS Review, Vol. 20, No. 2 (1995), pp. 441‚Äì447. that he \\"was falsely convicted\\", and that \\"the evidence against Frank was shaky, to say the least\\".Friedman p. 1254. C. Vann Woodward, like many other authors, believed that Conley was the actual murderer and was \\"implicated by evidence overwhelmingly more incriminating than any produced against Frank.\\" Critics cite a number of problems with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley. Websites supporting the view that Frank was guilty of murdering Phagan emerged around the centennial of the Phagan murder in 2013. Online version of a magazine founded by H. L. Mencken in 1924. Most articles in the History category are on the topic of Leo Frank. The Anti-Defamation League issued a press release condemning what it called \\"misleading websites\\" from \\"anti-Semites ... to promote anti-Jewish views\\". =Applications for posthumous pardon= State historical marker where Frank was hanged. The marker mentions Frank's posthumous pardon in 1986. First attempt In 1982, Alonzo Mann, who had been Frank's office boy at the time of Phagan's murder, told The Tennessean that he had seen Jim Conley alone shortly after noon carrying Phagan's body through the lobby toward the ladder descending into the basement.The Tennessean special news section, p. 15, in Dinnerstein 1987. Though Mann's testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue, it was the basis of an attempt by Charles Wittenstein, southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, and Dale Schwartz, an Atlanta lawyer, to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The board also reviewed the files from Slaton's commutation decision.Oney p. 684. It denied the pardon in 1983, hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records. It concluded that, \\"After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation, it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank. For the board to grant a pardon, the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively.\\"Oney pp. 647‚Äì648. At the time, the lead editorial in The Atlanta Constitution began, \\"Leo Frank has been lynched a second time.\\"Dinnerstein, Leonard (October 1996). \\"The Fate Of Leo Frank\\", American Heritage, Vol. 47, Issue 6.

During the mill strikes of 1914, Carson sang \\"Little Mary Phagan\\" to crowds from the Fulton County courthouse steps. His daughter, Moonshine Kate, later recorded the song. An unrecorded Carson song, \\"Dear Old Oak in Georgia\\", sentimentalizes the tree from which Leo Frank was hanged.Melnick p. 18. The Frank case has been the subject of several media adaptations. In 1921, African-American director Oscar Micheaux directed a silent race film entitled The Gunsaulus Mystery, followed by Murder in Harlem in 1935.\\" In 1937, Mervyn LeRoy directed They Won't Forget, based on the Ward Greene novel Death in The Deep South, which was in turn inspired by the Frank case. An episode of the 1964 TV series Profiles in Courage dramatized Governor John M. Slaton's decision to commute Frank's sentence. The episode starred Walter Matthau as Governor Slaton and Michael Constantine as Tom Watson. The 1988 TV miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan was broadcast on NBC, starring Jack Lemmon as Gov. John Slaton and also featuring Kevin Spacey. The 1998 Broadway musical Parade, based on the case, won two Tony Awards. In 2009, Ben Loeterman directed the documentary film The People v. Leo Frank.

They are distinguished from the sac spiders of the family Clubionidae and other spiders by having the abdominal spiracle placed one third to one half of the way anterior to the spinnerets toward the epigastric furrow on the underside of the abdomen. In most spiders the spiracle is just anterior to the spinnerets. Like clubionids, anyphaenids have eight eyes arranged in two rows, conical anterior spinnerets and are wandering predators that build silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark or under rocks. There are more than 500 species in over 50 genera worldwide. The family is widespread and includes such common genera as Anyphaena (worldwide except tropical Africa and Asia) and Hibana (New World). Only one species (A. accentuata) occurs in northwestern Europe. Species in the latter genus are important predators in several agricultural systems, especially tree crops. They are able to detect and feed on insect eggs, despite their poor eyesight. They share this ability at least with some miturgid spiders.

Founded in 1880 by Charles Wesley Emerson as a \\"school of oratory,\\" the college offers more than three dozen degree and professional training programs specializing in the fields of arts and communication with a foundation in liberal arts studies. The college is one of the founding members of the ProArts Consortium, an association of six neighboring institutions in Boston dedicated to arts education at the collegiate level. Originally based in Boston's Pemberton Square, the college moved neighborhoods several times, and is now located in the Theater District along the south side of the Boston Common. Emerson owns and operates the historic Colonial, Paramount, and Cutler Majestic theaters, as well as several smaller performance venues. The school also maintains satellite facilities in Los Angeles and the town of Well, The Netherlands. History =Origins= Charles Wesley Emerson (1887), founder and namesake of Emerson College Charles Wesley Emerson founded the Boston Conservatory of Elocution, Oratory, and Dramatic Art in 1880, a year after Boston University closed its School of Oratory. Classes were held at Pemberton Square in Boston, where ten students enrolled in the conservatory's first class. The following year, the institution changed its name to the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory, in honor of Charles Emerson's teacher at Boston University's School of Oratory, Professor Lewis B. Monroe. In 1890, the name changed again to Emerson College of Oratory and was later shortened to Emerson College in 1939. =Early expansion and growth= The college expanded and rented space at 36 Bromfield Street, and moved to Odd Fellows Hall on Berkeley and Tremont Streets in the South End of Boston. With the new location, the college's first library was established in 1892. Henry Lawrence Southwick, a faculty member and alumnus, became a financial partner for the college with Emerson. This financial partnership led to the acquisition of the Boston School of Oratory from Moses T. Brown in 1894. At the turn of the century, faculty members Henry and Jessie Eldridge Southwick and William H. Kenney purchased the college from Dr. Emerson. Soon after, the college rented a new location in Chickering Hall. Dr. Emerson retired in 1903 and William J. Rolfe, a Shakespearean scholar and actor, was named the second President of Emerson College of Oratory. His service as president lasted until his retirement in 1908. As the Student Government Association of the college held its first meeting in 1908, the third president of the college, Henry Lawrence Southwick, was inaugurated. He introduced the study of acting and stagecraft into the college curriculum. During his tenure, the college rented a new building at 30 Huntington Avenue. The college was also granted the right to award Bachelor of Literary Interpretation (B.L.I.) degrees. In addition, Emerson became the first school with a collegiate-level program in children's theater in 1919. The school offered its first course in Journalism in 1924. The college purchased its first piece of real estate with a new women's dormitory building at 373 Commonwealth Ave. and started intramural sports in 1931 with the organization of volleyball games. =Administrative restructuring= In 1930, full charge and control of the college was transferred to the Board of Trustees by William H. Kenney, Henry Lawrence Southwick, and Jessie Eldridge Southwick. When Harry Seymour Ross was appointed the fourth president of Emerson College in 1931, the first course in Radio Broadcasting was taught by the program director of WEEI, a Boston AM radio station. The purchase of buildings at 130 Beacon Street and 128 Beacon Street a year later began the presence of Emerson College in Boston's Back Bay. Emerson kept ownership of these buildings until summer 2003. In the following years, a professional training program in Speech Pathology (1935) and the first undergraduate program in Broadcast Journalism (1937) were offered for the first time in the United States. Also, construction of a theater behind 128‚Äì130 Beacon began, and the institution was granted the right to award Master of Arts degrees. =Post-war era= In the post-war era, the G.I. Bill of Rights and the Broadcasting curriculum contributed to the rebalancing of the student body from a primarily-female population to an equally-balanced population of men and women. Boylston Green, the first president to have no prior association with the college, used his background as a dean of students to enhance extracurricular activities, including the establishment of a student activities fee. These efforts led to the first publication of Emerson's student newspaper, The Berkeley Beacon, in 1947, which is still in production today. Emerson also saw major development in its broadcasting program. A one-year Certificate of Broadcasting was offered via evening classes. The FCC awarded the college a 10-watt license in 1949, and WERS, the first educational FM radio station in New England, was born. The station's power was increased to 300 watts three years later, and 18,000 watts by 1953. At the start of the decade, In 1950 Emerson College became a member of the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, an accreditation association for schools and colleges in New England. President Green left the college in 1949 after being selected as president of the University of the South, and Godfrey Dewey served as Acting President until 1951. At that time, Jonathon French was appointed as Acting President, and he became president in December of that year, despite never being formally inaugurated. =Financial crisis of 1952 and recovery= The college suffered from a severe financial crisis in 1952, and sought $50,000 in emergency funding. At the time, the Chairman of the Corporation stated that without these funds, the college had three alternatives: go broke, sell out, or merge with another institution. Led by the National Alumni Council, a grassroots campaign was launched to improve the financial situation of the college. The efforts led to the resignation of the Council of Trustees, which was then replaced mostly by alumni. The new board elected a former Emerson history professor, S. Justus McKinley, as the fifth President of Emerson College. Pulling out of its financial crisis, the college started to develop its programs with new facilities. In 1953, Emerson opened The Robbins Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic at 145 Beacon Street, furthering the Communication Sciences and Disorders Program. A television studio was dedicated at 130 Beacon in 1954, with its first closed-circuit TV program the following year as WERS-TV. The first annual spring musical, Lady in the Dark by Moss Hart, was presented. Later, the school was authorized to grant honorary degrees, Bachelors and Masters of Science in Speech, and a Bachelors of Music in conjunction with the Longy School of Music. =Back Bay as Emerson's campus= As the 1960s started, 373 Commonwealth Avenue was sold to purchase a dormitory at 100 Beacon Street for 609 undergraduate and 29 graduate students. A year later, a building at 150 Beacon Street was obtained for dorms, a dining hall, and administrative offices. With major gifts from Elisabeth Abbot Smith and J.F. Buzzard, the college library moved from the fourth floor of 130 Beacon Street into its own building at 303 Berkeley Street. In 1964, two buildings were purchased: 96 Beacon Street, which became the student union building, and 132‚Äì134 Beacon Street, which became a dormitory. The campus remained primarily in Back Bay until the late 1990s. In 1967, Richard Chapin, former Dean of the Harvard Business School was inaugurated as the seventh president of Emerson College. Shortly afterwards, an academic planning committee approved a new course of study for general education requirements. The first level of this program replaced the college-wide requirements with a two-year interdisciplinary course of study and electives. In order to accommodate this new program, the building at 67‚Äì69 Brimmer Street was purchased. The Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies was born. A year later in 1972, the college gained authorization to grant BFA, and MFA degrees. =Attempted relocation= Though Emerson College has moved to various locations within the city of Boston, the appointment of Allen E. Koenig (the ninth President of Emerson College) almost took the college completely outside of Boston. As soon as he was inaugurated in 1979, Koenig initiated talks with Pine Manor College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to relocate Emerson and merge the two schools. However, an agreement was never reached and the plan was dropped entirely. At the start of the 1980s, Koenig made a proposal to the Board of Trustees for a major renovation of the college's facilities. The plan allowed for new performance spaces, classrooms, and faculty offices at Brimmer Street; remodeling the Library and Learning Resources Center at 150 Beacon; remodeling the 303 Berkeley building for the Humanities and Social Sciences Division; a new radio/audio complex at 126 Beacon; and construction of two new television studios behind 130 Beacon. In 1984, 335 Commonwealth Avenue was purchased for Administration and the Communication Studies department. The college also received the authorization to grant MFA degrees in Creative Writing. Despite the newly purchased Commonwealth Avenue buildings, Lawrence, Massachusetts, was soon being discussed as a new location for Emerson College, about away from Boston. The Mayor of Lawrence announced that the necessary land would be taken by eminent domain and sold to Emerson for a token payment of $100. However, the five affected private landowners disagreed with this arrangement and fought the city in court. Three years later in 1988, Judge John Forte ruled in favor of the City of Lawrence. The river-front site in Lawrence was proposed as the new campus for the College. However, as real estate values in Boston dropped and the costs of constructing a new campus increased, the plans were put on hold and eventually abandoned when Koenig resigned as president in 1989. In 1988, the college bought a building at Zero Marlborough Street (also known as 6 Arlington Street) for dormitories and a dining hall. =Rebirth in the Historic Theater District= The Colonial Theater was acquired in 2006; Emerson College built 372 dormitory rooms on top of the building while preserving the theater John Zacharis became the tenth President of Emerson College and faced a college fractured by the failed move to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Over the course of two years, he worked to restore unity to the campus by purchasing a building at 180 Tremont Street, now called the Ansin Building. This purchase started a transition from Back Bay to the Boston Theater District. Zacharis went on medical leave in 1992 and died of leukemia shortly after. During Zacharis's leave, speech pathologist Jacqueline Weis Liebergott was appointed as Acting President and, a year later, inaugurated to become the first female president of the college. Shortly after, she submitted a 10-year master plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority which involved moving the college to the Washington Street Theatre District.https://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/nyu/doc/gvshp-case- studies.pdf In the mid-1990s, a planning document of the college's future plans was drafted and public hearings were held. The college also extended health care benefits to domestic partners of gay and lesbian faculty, administration and staff.https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OLO/Resources/Files/1999_Reports/OLO_Report_99-1_6-8-1999.pdf Under the plan, dental coverage and tuition waivers were also available. That same year, the college debuted online with a $100,000 gift from Mrs. Mary E. Tufte. Financed by the contribution, The Tufte Lab was placed on the fourth floor of the Ansin Building and dedicated in Mrs. Tufte's honor. The lab was the catalyst for a telecommunications/fiber optic network installation, which was completed in October 1995. In addition, the college announced the purchase and restoration of The Little Building (1994) across the street from the Ansin Building and next to Emerson's Majestic Theatre.https://emersonhistory.omeka.net/items/show/274 Restoration was completed on the facades of the college's buildings at 126, 128, 130, 132‚Äì134, 168 Beacon Street, and 21 Commonwealth Avenue.https://web.archive.org/web/20131025043338/http://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic- services/library/archives/emerson-history In 1998, Emerson purchased the Walker Building (Boston) at 120 Boylston. The building currently hosts the school's Department of Television, Radio, Film Production, the Institutional Advancement (Alumni and Development) department, and the Government and Community Relations department. It also contains the school's library and many of its classrooms. =21st century= left The Tufte Performance Production Center (PPC) at 10 Boylston Place opened in 2003. The 11-story steel-and-glass building houses the Department of Performing Arts and includes two theaters (The Semel Theatre and The Greene Theatre), two television studios, makeup and costume labs, faculty offices, and an exhibition area. Also that year, the Cutler Majestic Theatre finished renovations and re-opened as one of the main stages of Emerson Stage productions. Circa 2001 Emerson adjuncts voted to establish a union but in 2003 still had not received a contract. In 2004, it was announced that the buildings at 96, 100, and 132 Beacon had been sold and would be vacated by the Fall 2006 semester.https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2003/10/20/story6.html Construction of a new 14-story residence hall at 150 Boylston Street began in March 2004, and was completed in September 2006.http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/3ad6890e-842d-49af-a8fa-8042b2c8254d It is the first entirely-new residence hall in Emerson's history. The facility includes residential suites, athletic facilities, offices and meeting rooms for student organizations, informal gathering places for off-campus students, spaces for small-group rehearsals and performances, and dining facilities. The school purchased the historic Paramount Theatre (Boston) on Washington Street in 2005, with plans to build a new complex at the site including a 565-seat main stage theater inside the existing Paramount Theater and a 125-seat black box theater in an adjacent new building. Plans also included a 200-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from , six smaller rehearsal spaces, a sound stage for film students, a new scene shop, and a dormitory. In May 2006, the Campus Center in the Piano Row building was named the Max Mutchnick Campus Center after a major gift from the 1987 graduate and co- creator of the television sitcom Will & Grace. In the same year, the school exercised its purchase option on the Colonial Theatre, adjacent to the Little Building, and then converted the upper floors of the building to a 372-bed dormitory.https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2006/02/20/daily58.html With the addition of dorm space here and at the Paramount Theatre, the school hoped to accommodate up to 75% of its students in on-campus housing by the year 2010. In September 2006, a long-running labor dispute between the administrators and faculty union was resolved. The administration limited the union's role in promotion and tenure, and brought department chairs into administrative roles, where they were not covered by the union. In response, the college agreed not to dismantle the union. In September 2007, students in Emerson Alliance for Gays, Lesbians, and Everyone (E.A.G.L.E.) as well as the Student Government Association (S.G.A.) received the gender neutral bathrooms they had pitched to the administration in the spring. In September 2016, every bathroom on Emerson's campus was converted into a gender inclusive restroom. On December 2, 2009, President Liebergott announced she would step down in June 2011. On September 8, 2010, the college announced she would be succeeded by M. Lee Pelton of Willamette University. On March 18, 2010, the newly renovated Paramount Center officially opened, with Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino illuminating the Paramount's original art deco marquee, which Emerson had restored. In addition to the 590-seat Paramount Theatre, the Paramount Center also houses an experimental black box theater, the Bright Family Screening Room, a sound stage, a scene/prop production shop, nine rehearsal studios, six practice rooms, four classrooms, 20 faculty offices, and a student commons area. , two students are suing the college for mishandling their rape cases and failing to provide their Title IX rights. In late 2019, Emerson and Marlboro College announced plans for a merger. Marlboro plans to give its endowment and real estate to Emerson where all Marlboro students will be admitted and tenure-track faculty will be able to choose to teach at Emerson. Marlboro will close its campus at the end of the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year. Campus alt= Emerson College's permanent move from the Back Bay to its current location revitalized and preserved the distinct character and profiles of the surrounding neighborhoods, which comprise many significant historic landmarks and structures - the most notable being Boston Public Garden and Boston Common. Presently, the majority of the college's acquired properties were reclaimed, renovated and/or restored without having to introduce new developments into the Downtown core. Abutting the southeast corner of the Boston Common, the 8-acre urban campus at the intersection of Boylston Street and Tremont Street is served by Boylston station on the MBTA Green Line and Chinatown station on the Orange Line. In addition, Emerson College extends its campus outside Massachusetts state, operating in a fourteenth-century castle in the Netherlands and a major academic center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood for its long-established Los Angeles program. =Academic and theater buildings= Ansin Building (180 Tremont Street) Once owned by the Boston Edison Company, the Ansin Building was purchased by Emerson in 1992. The building stands 14 stories high and contains all Visual & Media Arts (VMA) labs and facilities, offices for all VMA and Writing, Literature & Publishing (WLP) departments, and is the home of WERS, WECB, and ETIN (Emerson's Talk and Information Network, an online radio service). It also contains the registrar's office, Tufte and 3D computer labs, Digital Production labs, and the Media Services center. 216 Tremont Street The former Union Bank building at 216 Tremont Street houses the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and the in-house clinic, The Robbins Speech, Language and Hearing Center. Also located here are the offices of Student Financial Services, Health Services, Career Services, the Counseling Center and the International Student Center. The Bill Bordy Theater and Auditorium on the ground floor is used for lectures, performances, performance classes and special events. Computer Labs: Communication Sciences and Disorders Lab (CSD) Walker Building (120 Boylston Street) alt= Provides classrooms, study rooms, offices to various non-academic and academic departments, five computer labs, and the Iwasaki Library. The fifth and sixth floors connect to the Tufte building. Computer Labs: Advanced Projects Lab (APL), Advanced Teaching Lab (ATL), Communication & Marketing Labs (CML) 1, 2, and Journalism Lab (JRL) Production Facilities: Newsroom TV Studio, Newsroom Editing Labs Academic Facilities: Iwasaki Library, Emerson College Archives and Special Collections One of the sets of popular NBC sitcom Will & Grace (1998-2006, 2017-2020) donated by Emerson alumnus Max Mutchnick, are displayed in the Iwasaki Library. The set‚ÄîWill and Grace's living room and kitchen‚Äîremained in the library until 2013, when it was moved to Emerson's Los Angeles campus. Tufte Performance Production Center (10 Boylston Place) The 11-story building is home to two television studios, two performing art theaters, the Huret and Spector Gallery, set and costume studios, classrooms, and the offices of the Department of Performing Arts. The fifth and sixth floors of the building are connected to the Walker Building. Computer Labs: CAD Lab Performance Theaters and Facilities: Semel Theatre, The Kermit and Elinore Greene Theater, The Bobbi Brown and Steven Plofker Design Technology and Makeup Studio Television Studio and Facilities: Di Bona Television Studio & Control Room, Studio B & Control Room Cutler Majestic Theatre (219 Tremont Street) The theatre is home to Emerson stage productions each year, various speaking events, Open House, and the EVVY Awards - Emerson's own award show and the largest student-run live television production in the country. Paramount Center (555 Washington Street) Opening in 1932 as a movie theatre seating 1,700, the Paramount Theatre was one of the first movie houses in Boston to play talking motion pictures. In 2005, Emerson College announced plans to renovate the Paramount Theatre, building an entire performing arts facility in and around the theatre. The renovated Paramount Center was designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects of Boston and built by Bond Brothers, and completed in 2010. The project included not only renovating the Paramount Theatre into a 550-seat theater, but building both a new Performance Development Center and a new residence hall for the school in the upper floors of the building. The complex features the 120-seat Liebergott Black Box Theatre, the 174-seat Bright Family Screening Room, nine rehearsal studios ranging from , five practice rooms for individuals and small groups, a sound stage for film production classes, a scene shop, several classrooms, a restaurant, and Emerson faculty and staff offices. = External programs = ELA‚ÄîHollywood Center (Los Angeles) alt= Situated on Sunset Boulevard (at Gordon St) in Hollywood, ELA building is a permanent home to Emerson's decades-old Los Angeles program. The international design firm Morphosis, headed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Thom Mayne, designed a signature building incorporating residential, teaching and administrative spaces. The 10-story building was opened for the college's winter semester in 2014. The new facility accommodates 217 students, approximately twice the number of students that were supported by Emerson's older facility in Burbank.Roger Vincent, \\"Emerson College is building a new West Coast campus in Hollywood. The $85-million high-rise on Sunset Boulevard, a potential Hollywood landmark, will be a striking see-through structure where students will live and study the arts.\\" Los Angeles Times, March 2, 2012. The center allows undergraduate students to spend a full fall, spring or summer semester taking classes in Hollywood and participating in a semester-long internship at enterprises related to their field of study. In addition, ELA also offers professional training and workplace education for Los Angeles-area professionals who are not enrolled into the College degree programs.https://patch.com/california/hollywood/emerson-los-angeles-launches- two-new-courses-aimed-helping-students-navigate-entertainment-industry Kasteel Well (Netherlands) Emerson College owns and operates Kasteel Well in the rural province of Limburg, the Netherlands, a national historical monument that provides living accommodations, classrooms, a resource center, and related facilities. Located near the German border, Kasteel Well is approximately two hours from D√ºsseldorf, Amsterdam, and Brussels, and five hours from Paris, Milan, and Madrid. Approximately 85 matriculated Emerson students attend the program each semester, and are chosen through a lottery style system. Student housing is in the two separate buildings of the castle - the \\"Main Castle\\" and the \\"Vorbercht\\" with a variety of doubles, triples, and singles. Most course offerings are at the Sophomore level, but the program is open to Sophomores and above. Students are encouraged to travel throughout the duration of the program, with the campus partially closing each weekend and no Thursday evening or Friday classes to allow for weekend trips. Many students travel most or every weekend of the semester. Classes are taught by Dutch teachers, with several Belgian and other teachers from Europe on staff. Well, The Netherlandsalt= =Residence halls= A hallmark feature of Emerson College's residences is their close proximity to many of the major theaters and performance spaces in the heart of the Washington Street Theatre District of Boston. Some of the student rooms are literally on top of a major Boston theater owned by Emerson, and all of them are in close walking distance to the major performance venues of the District. Also nearby are major shopping centers and restaurants of the Chinatown, Downtown, and Back Bay neighborhoods of Boston. Piano Row & Max Mutchnick Campus Center (150 Boylston Street) Sited on Boylston St. in the historic Piano Row District, the building is often referred to as \\"Piano Row\\" and replaces the former residence hall and student union buildings on Beacon and Arlington streets. The residence floors consist of seven suites per floor, and each suite consists of three two-person bedrooms and one shared bathroom and living room for the unit. In addition, each floor has at least one residence assistant's room with either a common room or an additional residence assistant's room every other floor. The building also features a cafe, which offers several made-to-order food items as well as convenience items, with indoor seating overlooking the Boston Common. Piano Row is also home to the Max Mutchnick Campus Center, and the Bobbi Brown and Steven Plofker Gymnasium. The former features several conference, meeting, and rehearsal spaces open to all students, offices for Student Life and the Student Government Association, and storage for any student organization that requires it. The Brown Gymnasium has an NCAA regulation-sized basketball court, with several sets of bleachers and a sky box equipped for events, as well as a workout and fitness center for athletes. Also housing new offices for the Athletics Department, it is Emerson College's first-ever indoor athletic facility. The construction of the gym was controversial at the time of its announcement, considering lack of performing space on campus and the lack of enthusiasm around athletics at Emerson. Since then, with growing appreciation for athletics among the student body, and the development of significant new performance and rehearsal space in the Paramount Center, the Brown Gym has become an important campus feature. Little Building (80 Boylston Street) In addition to housing a number or retail and restaurant locations on the ground floor, the Little Building was once an office and residential space before Emerson College purchased the building in 1994 and opened it for use in September 1995. The residence hall houses up to 1,035 students in the upper 11 floors of the 13-story building. The housing section of the building comprises singles, doubles, triples, and a few 6-person suites each containing a single, double, and triple room with an ensuite bathroom. The Little Building was originally built to hold 600 offices, 15 stores, 22 shops, and a post office. Built in 1917, it was named after its financier, John Mason Little and was designed by famed architect Clarence Blackall. The building's name is often confused as being a descriptive adjective, which leads to surprise upon discovery that it is one of the larger buildings on campus. In 1998 the building was changed from its original red color. During the 2017‚Äì2018 school year the Little Building was closed for extensive renovations, and re-opened in the Fall of 2019. Prior to renovations, the building was only 12 stories and housed 724 students. The Little Building once contained a dining facility, fitness center, print and copy center, and administrative offices on its non-residential floors, all of which have since moved to other locations on the Emerson College campus or into leased spaces in the area. Colonial Building (100 Boylston Street) The upper floors of this renovated 10-story building house 372 students in single and double rooms in three-, four-, five-, or six-person suite-like environments that include a shared bathroom. Residents share common lounges with kitchenettes and a centralized laundry facility. This was formerly the headquarters of music publishing company, McLaughlin & Reilly Co. Paramount Center (555 Washington Street) The Paramount Center is adjacent to the Boston Opera House and on top of the newly renovated Paramount Theatre, which has classroom spaces, a film soundstage, 200 seat screening room, and a black box theatre. The Residence hall has four floors, on the 6th through 9th floors. Each floor has a common room, and a mix of doubles and four or six person suites; all rooms or suites have their own full bathroom, and all floors are coed. 2 Boylston Place (2 Boylston Place) 2 Boylston Place is the most recent addition to the campus that opened in 2017, and contains an 18-story residence hall that houses approximately 375 students. The new building has created a much-needed student social space and contributes to making the Boylston Place corridor a striking, signature entrance to the urban campus. Accommodations offered are single, double, and triple rooms within six- or eight-person suite-like environments that include a shared bathroom. There are also off-hallway triple rooms that include a private bathroom. Residents share three common lounges, one with a kitchen, and two centralized laundry facilities.http://www.emerson.edu/housing- dining/residence-halls/2-boylston-place Academics Emerson College is divided into two schools (School of Communication and School of the Arts) and eight departments (Marketing Communication; Communication Studies; Journalism; Communication Sciences & Disorders; Performing Arts; Writing, Literature & Publishing; Visual & Media Arts; Liberal Arts & Interdisciplinary Studies) offering 31 undergraduate majors and 19 minors (Bachelor of Arts/Fine Arts, or Science), and 12 graduate degree programs (Master of Arts/Fine Arts, or Science).

Emerson Dance Company Dance plays a large role in the student culture at Emerson College. In the Fall of 2007 Emerson student, Michael Lupacchino (‚Äô10), re-founded the Emerson Dance Company‚Äîan SGA recognized, inclusive organization focused on bringing an open outlet for dance to students of all levels, years, and majors at the college. The company holds bi-annual showcases at the end of every semester highlighting student dancers and choreographers, all of whom have auditioned at the start of every semester and applied to choreograph through a selection process run by the company's executive board. Emerson Dance Company (commonly referred to as EDC) also offers master classes, workshops, and events which are open to the entire Emerson community. In addition to participating in internal college activities, the group also engages in community service around the Boston area. The organization is actively involved with its alumni (inviting one back each semester to choreograph an alumni piece), as well as fellow college and professional level dance organizations around the Boston area (i.e. The Boston Ballet, Suffolk Dance, Northeastern Dance Company {NUDANCO}, and Urbanity Dance). The company has been advised by Senior Dancer-In-Residence in the college's Performing Arts Department, Marlena Yannetti, since its inception. Emerson Dance Company hosts its showcases in Emerson's state of the art theatres, including the newly renovated Paramount Center Mainstage. =Student Radio= WECB is the campus student run radio station, overseen by a faculty advisor. WECB broadcasts online at its websitehttp://www.wecb.fm and on closed-circuit campus television (channel 56). In 1983‚Äì84, WECB was scheduled for demolition without reconstruction, as part of the Mass Communications $1.6M renovation project. Carol Kamerschen, Greg Weremey, Barry Scott and Russ Weisenbacher were instrumental in fighting the board of trustees, and convincing them to allow Weremey and Weisenbacher to design and build new studios at 126 Beacon Street, replacing the former facilities at 130 Beacon Street, 4th floor. ETIN (Emerson's Talk and Information Network), an online talk radio service run by students, is also housed in the same space as WERS and WECB.http://etinradio.org/ =Comedy= The college has a long tradition in the comedy community, including student groups specializing in various combinations of sketch comedy, improvisation, and short films.

Initially released by Software AG in 1971 on IBM mainframe systems using DOS/360, OS/MFT, or OS/MVT, Adabas is currently available on a range of enterprise systems, including BS2000, z/VSE, z/OS, Unix, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Adabas is frequently used in conjunction with Software AG's programming language Natural; many applications that use Adabas as a database on the back end are developed with Natural. In 2016, Software AG announced that Adabas and Natural would be supported through the year 2050 and beyond.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160831005145/en/Software-AG- Announces-%E2%80%9CAdabas-Natural-2050%E2%80%9D-Agenda Adabas is one of the three major inverted list DBMS packages, the other two being Computer Corporation of America‚Äôs Model 204 and ADR‚Äôs Datacom/DB. 4GL support Since the 1979 introduction of Natural\\"Both the Adabas Data Dictionary System and the Adacom batch report writer are due out in July while Natural, a natural programming language, is expected to be ...

Adabas Data Model Adabas is an acronym for _A_ daptable _Da_ ta _Ba_ se _S_ ystem (originally written in all caps; today only the initial cap is used for the product name.) Adabas is an inverted list data base, with the following characteristics or terminology: * Works with tables (referred to as files) and rows (referred to as records) as the major organizational units * Columns (referred to as fields) are components of rows * No embedded SQL engine. SQL access via the Adabas SQL Gateway was introduced through an acquired company, CONNX, in 2004. It provides ODBC, JDBC, and OLE DB access to Adabas and enables SQL access to Adabas using COBOL programs. * Search facilities may use indexed fields or non-indexed fields or both. * Does not natively enforce referential integrity constraints, and parent-child relations must be maintained by application code. * Supports two methods of denormalization: repeating groups in a record (\\"periodic groups\\") and multiple value fields in a record (\\"multi-value fields\\"). Adabas is typically used in applications that require high volumes of data processing or in high transaction online analytical processing environments. Adabas access is normally through Natural modules using one of several Natural statements including READ, FIND, and HISTOGRAM. These statements generate additional commands, under the covers, like open and close file. Adabas data can also be retrieved via direct calls. = Example of Natural program running against Adabas = FIND EMPLOYEE WITH NAME = 'JONES' OR = 'BAKER' AND CITY = 'BOSTON' THRU 'NEW YORK' AND CITY NE 'CHAPEL HILL' SORTED BY NAME WHERE SALARY < 28000 DISPLAY NAME FIRST-NAME CITY SALARY END-FIND END Output of Program: NAME FIRST-NAME CITY ANNUAL SALARY \\\\---------------------------------------- BAKER PAULINE DERBY 4450 JONES MARTHA KALAMAZOO 21000 JONES KEVIN DERBY 7000 Natural (4GL) Natural is a proprietary fourth-generation programming language.

Proponents say that Natural has evolved from a competitor of COBOL to \\"being in competition with Java as language of choice for writing services (SOA).\\" =About Natural= Natural, which includes a built-in screen-oriented editor, has two main components: the system and the language. The system is the central vehicle of communication between the user and all other components of the processing environment. The language is structured and less procedural than conventional languages. Natural objects (programs, maps, data areas, etc.) are stored in libraries, similar in structure to a DOS directory, and can be named with identifiers up to 8 characters. Objects, even if they are of different types, cannot have the same name. Natural provides both online and batch execution and programming testing utilities. Versions exist for z/OS, z/VSE, BS2000/OS, Linux, Unix and Windows.https://resources.softwareag.com/adabas-natural/2018-3-fs-natural-app- dev-en-natural-application-development-platform-fact-sheet =Language features= Natural works not only with Adabas files, but also supports Oracle, DB2, and others.

The system file is not limited to Adabas. Natural can also store programs in VSAM on mainframe operating systems. Natural uses the file system on Windows and various Unix implementations. Programs Natural objects are identified by names up to 8 characters, the first of which must be alphabetical. The Natural program editor allows source in rows of up to 72 positions. Lines are numbered by 4 digits. This numbering is generated by Natural during program creation. Line numbers used by the compiler and editors, and can have important logical functions in the programs. Within the lines, instructions (statements or program commands) have no positional parameters. Comments can be included in two ways: * Full-line comments are identified by a \\"*\\" or \\"**\\" prefix. * Annotated code lines have a \\"/*\\" - everything to its right is a comment. Examples: 0010 * These two lines (0010 and 0020) 0020 ** are comments. 0030 FORMAT LS = 80 /* As well as this part of the line (0030) 0040 * NOTE: The \\"/*\\" form has no space between the SLASH and ASTERISK. . . 0200 END \\"END\\" or \\".\\" indicates the end of a program.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last- minute rescue or deus ex machina.  History  This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by movie serials and 19th-century theatrical melodramas. A well-known example is the clich√© of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the James Bond film series and superhero stories is well known.  Narrative use  It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Throughout the decades, comic book writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes. For instance, one Legion of Super-Heroes story by Jim Shooter had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains wanted the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that \\"absorbs\\" the energy from the hero/heroes. Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such \\"sporting\\" villains include the Riddler, who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the Jigsaw Killer, who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. The Joker and Arcade are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge. On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance. In a similar vein, the villain, often a megalomaniac, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be \\"beneath him\\" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself \\"deserves\\" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so \\"epic\\" that it merits no less than such a conclusion. Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to \\"redeem\\" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs. If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as Dr. Evil. A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. El Sombrero is one villain who exemplifies this reason. When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.  Famous examples  *The Engineer's Thumb (Sherlock Holmes story): the engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp **Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape *Raiders of the Lost Ark: Sealing Indiana Jones and Marion in the Well of Souls **Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside. *Live and Let Die: Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitaire to a platform to be lowered into a shark-infested pool to be eaten alive. **Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's rotary saw function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga. *Goldfinger: James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a circular saw (a laser in the film) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape. **Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement \\"008\\" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive. *Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest. **Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open. * In the Dudley Do-Right cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical \\"movie-serial\\" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt. The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, \\"Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one.\\" In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours. *The 1960s live action television series Batman usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a cliffhanger. **Example: The Joker traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas. ***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground. *The Venture Brothers: Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as \\"Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls.\\" **Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for \\"Hot Voile\\", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer. *The Perils of Penelope Pitstop always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the Hooded Claw. *Disney's The Great Mouse Detective: Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead. **Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap. *Saw: The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a terminally ill vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps, both to test them and to give them an opportunity to repent for former lifestyles in which they took their lives for granted and were unappreciative and unconcerned with the well-being of others. *The Snowman: Rakel, Harry Hole's beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her. **Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers. *Titanic (1997 film): Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters. *Final Destination: The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died. A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the villain speech, also known as monologuing. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In The Incredibles (which used the term \\"monologuing\\"), Mr. Incredible and Frozone attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking Syndrome and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of exposition. Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film 2001 - A Space Odyssey when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: \\"This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!\\". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.  Spoofs  The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many satires. * Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the Austin Powers movies, including a replication of James Bond's Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as \\"an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death\\" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which Dr. Evil calls \\"the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism\\"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered mutant seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense. * In the sitcom Blackadder, Prince Edmund is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, Baldrick and Percy, manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning. * Curse of Monkey Island makes fun of this clich√©. The villain LeChuck, after capturing Guybrush Threepwood, insists on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue. * The famous line from Watchmen wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that \\"Dan, I'm not a Republic serial villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago.\\" * In The Simpsons episode \\"You Only Move Twice\\", which generally spoofs Bond villain clich√©s, supervillain/great boss Hank Scorpio has \\"Mr. Bont\\" strapped to a table with a laser √† la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont. *Some incarnations of the Evil Overlord List point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as \\"Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies.\\" * Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series The Flintstones entitled \\"Dr. Sinister\\" spoofed the James Bond series (\\"James Bondrock\\") and featured, among other deathtraps, Fred and Barney being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

Secret histories of the real world Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the \\"spin\\": one such example is The Secret History of the Mongols. Secret histories can range from standard historical revisionism with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to negative historical revisionism wherein facts are deliberately omitted, suppressed or distorted. The quintessential example secret history is the Anecdota of Procopius of Caesarea (known for centuries as the Secret History). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the Vatican Library and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the Suda, which referred to it as the Anekdota (\\"the unpublished composition\\"). The Secret History covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the History of Justinian's Wars and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the Roman Emperor Justinian I to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.The Secret History, English translation (Dewing, 1935) at LacusCurtius Fictional secret histories Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running science fiction or fantasy universe to preserve continuity with the present by reconciling paranormal, anachronistic, or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the Star Trek universe, Greg Cox's novels The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh cast the devastating Eugenics Wars of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the Smiling Buddha nuclear test, the Yugoslav Wars during the 1990s, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots were all part of one wider conflict. =Secret history thrillers= A certain type of thriller can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando nearly carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not alternate history but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled. Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre: * Eye of the Needle by Ken Follett: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling D-Day; * The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing Charles De Gaulle, president of France, in 1963. These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures ‚Äì including very famous ones ‚Äì appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors. Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with World War II backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others: * The Key to Rebecca: a German spy in Cairo nearly succeeds in letting Erwin Rommel win at El Alamein. * The Man from St. Petersburg: a Russian anarchist in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the First World War. Works of other writers fitting within this type include: * Enigma by Robert Harris: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages. * The Eagle Has Landed by Jack Higgins: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister Winston Churchill out of wartime England. * The Romanov Succession by Brian Garfield: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, Russian exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and restore the monarchy. * The Night Letter by Paul Spike: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt into not running for a third term. * The Ninth Man by John Lee: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt. * Stalag Texas, also by John Lee: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at Los Alamos. * An Exchange of Eagles by Owen Sela: In 1940, senior officers of the German Abwehr and the American Military Intelligence make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate Adolf Hitler and Franklin Roosevelt with the assumption that they would be replaced by Hermann G√∂ring and Henry A. Wallace - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating. * In the 2006 historical detective novel, The Janissary Tree by Jason Goodwin, a power-mad Ottoman general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan Mehmet II and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of Atat√ºrk. * In the thriller The Redbreast by Jo Nesb√∏, a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince. Different types of secret history thriller include: * The Leader and the Damned by Colin Forbes: Adolf Hitler was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a double. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of Martin Bormann in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. * XPD by Len Deighton: Winston Churchill was far more of an appeaser than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle. * The mystery series by Elliott Roosevelt in which his mother, Eleanor Roosevelt, is the detective ‚Äì placing murder mysteries in the Franklin D. Roosevelt White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, Murder at the Chateau, Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high- level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941. * The Berkut by Joseph Heywood. Adolf Hitler did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with Eva Braun. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the Kremlin basement until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, when he was secretly executed. * Many of the \\"Blackford Oakes\\" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in Who's on First, Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching Sputnik ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in Marco Polo, if You Can, Oakes is the real-life U2 pilot Gary Powers, and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the U2 incident was actually planned from the start, Gary Powers was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev never happened). * The plot of Clive Cussler's Night Probe! is based on the assumption that on the eve of World War I in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, with the cooperation of King George V, and US President Woodrow Wilson ‚Äì to sell Canada to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records ‚Äì to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing). * When published in 1903, Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands was mainly a cautionary tale about the then real possibility of war between Britain and Germany. But the very belated 1998 sequel The Shadow in the Sands by Sam Llewellyn transformed it into a full-fledged secret history. It asserts that in 1902-1903 Imperial Germany prepared a meticulous plan for a large-scale invasion of England, supervised by Kaiser Wilhelm II who took personal part in some of the preparations. The German invasion was foiled at the very last moment by a small band of courageous Britons who infiltrated Germany and carried out a series of daring acts of arson and sabotage, undertaken with the risk of being hanged out of hand if caught, and succeeding against all odds in derailing Kaiser Wilhelm's carefully prepared invasion plan - so that a quarter of a million German soldiers who were poised to board the invasion fleet just returned to barracks. In the aftermath the German and British governments tacitly agreed to pretend none of this ever happened. The Germans wanted to keep it secret, because it failed; the British - because the authorities in Britain had ignored all warnings and did nothing to avert the invasion, and those who did avert it were private British citizens acting on their own without any government sanction or support. Thus, the whole affair remained secret history, even when Britain and Germany did go to war eleven years later. * An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the BBC Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventures novel Imperial Moon, which sees the Fifth Doctor and his companions Vislor Turlough and Kamelion learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping. * Another example of a science- fiction secret history is The Proteus Operation by James P. Hogan. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of World War II: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill and provided invaluable information about how the Germans won in their history ‚Äì which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as Harry Hopkins, and to a few scientists such as Albert Einstein. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy ‚Äì and strictly kept it until their deaths ‚Äì and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told. =Fictional \\"secret\\" versions of historical events= * Alexandre Dumas' last major work, The Knight of Sainte-Hermine asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral Horatio Nelson and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. * Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, The Three Musketeers, provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham by the junior officer John Felton. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French Cardinal Richelieu, while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. * Elizabeth Bear's \\"Promethean Age\\" series constitutes a massive secret history of Elizabethan England, with considerable fantasy elements. Among other things the series asserts that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford was a secret illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth I; that Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in Shakespeare's Sonnets were dedicated to Marlowe; that Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch Morgan le Fay; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with Puck and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in A Midsummer Night's Dream. * The first series of Blackadder, in which Henry VII of England comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of \\"Richard IV\\" from the history books. Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard. *The Assassin's Creed video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a \\"New World Order\\" organization that originated with the Knights Templar. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in Assassin's Creed II, that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret \\"First Civilization\\", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars. * The background of Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of London series of contemporary fantasy detective thrillers includes the assertion that Isaac Newton, in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful wizard who codified the basic principles of magic. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis (Latin for \\"Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts\\") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the Bodleian Library in the University of Oxford, and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, World War II had also been fought by magical means, with Nazi Germany, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union each raising its own secret corps of warrior- wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany ‚Äì where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash vampires and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of Caroline of Ansbach; during the War of 1812 British wizards trained Tecumseh's medicine men in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; Maynard Keynes, though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the Iraq War suffered a major fiasco at Falluja which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated. * Bill Walsh's Tales from the Black Chamber assumes that President Calvin Coolidge secretly established a government agency called \\"The Black Chamber\\", its mission being to fight demons, vampires, werewolves, and any other supernatural beings who threaten the United States or the world in general. Foundation of this agency closely coincided with Coolidge appointing J. Edgar Hoover to head what would become the FBI, but the creation and existence of the Black Chamber was and is kept completely secret, even a century later. But it does exist in our present time, and its hands are full . * Umberto Eco's novel Baudolino suggests that Emperor Frederick I, who died while on the Second Crusade, had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task. * Gore Vidal's novel Creation, purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entangling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persians counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted. Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly exerted great influence on India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also on the character of Buddhism, a major world religion. * The same Vidal book also asserts that the Greek philosopher Democritus had a far-traveling great-uncle who had visited both India and China, spoke their languages fluently and had met and conversed with their important sages such as the Buddha and Mahavira in India as well as Lao Tsu, and Confucius in China. The uncle was especially impressed by Confucius, became his disciple for several years and was among the inner circle of close disciples who heard the basic tenets of Confucianism set out for the first time by the Master himself. In his old age, the great-uncle lived in Athens and dictated his autobiography - including detailed accounts of his conversations with the Eastern Sages - to the young Democritus, destined to himself become a major, highly influential philosopher. This would imply that, through that conduit, the Eastern Sages had much more of a direct influence on Greek Philosophy than modern scholars realize. * The books of Steve Berry often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, The Jefferson Key, part of Berry's Cotton Malone series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President (Abraham Lincoln in 1865, James A. Garfield in 1881, William McKinley in 1901 and John F. Kennedy in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret \\"Commonwealth\\" of pirates (or \\"privateers\\"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like Woodrow Wilson during WWI and Franklin Roosevelt in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give this Commonwealth \\"a perpetual authorization\\" to act as privateers. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as treasure hidden by Napoleon Bonaparte, secret survivals of the Knights Templar and the fate of the books of the Alexandrine Library. * Many of Tim Powers's novels are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel On Stranger Tides had a different interpretation of pirate Blackbeard's death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the Fountain of Youth, Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as \\"Edmund Morcilla\\" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel Declare presents a secret history of the Cold War, with the US and the UK jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces. Donna Tartt used the phrase for the title of her debut novel (The Secret History), which recounts the story of a group of Classics students at an elite college in New England who engage in ritual murder ‚Äî and subsequently bury the story. The plot is told via unreliable narration and an inverted detective format. Secret histories of fictional worlds \\"Retcon\\", alteration of the canonical account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming continuity breach might be \\"revealed\\" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running superhero comic books. =Examples= * When Arthur Conan Doyle wrote The Final Problem he fully intended to kill off Sherlock Holmes and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody ‚Äì including even his close friend Dr. Watson ‚Äì believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any way, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place: the \\"death\\" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death. * The Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks also alludes to hidden fictional history, establishing that during the events of the serial An Unearthly Child, the First Doctor had in his possession a super-weapon, the Hand of Omega stolen from his own people, the Time Lords. The story also implies that he knew of the Daleks before he \\"first\\" met them. *Another example in Doctor Who is the War Doctor, whose existence had been covered up by previous Doctors and was retroactively inserted into continuity by showrunner Steven Moffat to create a \\"mayfly\\" Doctor for \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". * DC Comics' Crisis on Infinite Earths made years of \\"established\\" events and characters from the DC Universe (for example the existence of Krypto) \\"un-happen\\". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it \\"secret\\". * Philip Jose Farmer's Wold Newton universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways. * Warren Ellis's comic book series Planetary offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes. * Philip Jos√© Farmer's The Other Log of Phileas Fogg reinterprets Jules Verne's famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf. * Brandon Sanderson's novella Mistborn: Secret History recounts the story of the first Mistborn trilogy from the perspective of a certain character working from behind the scenes to affect the outcome of the aforementioned trilogy, providing explanations for certain events that occur. Time travel secret histories The plots of some time travel books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well ‚Äì since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount. For example, Poul Anderson's story Brave to be a King asserts that King Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire, was, in fact, a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a king by strange circumstances. (However, this is \\"cancelled out\\" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, The Sorrow of Odin the Goth, asserts that also the Nordic god Odin/Wodan was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient Goths and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. Paul Levinson's The Plot to Save Socrates claims (as its title suggests), that the philosopher Socrates did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in twenty-first century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general Alcibiades had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous fourth-century mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor Hero of Alexandria was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the nineteenth-century publisher William Henry Appleton had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited Classical Greece and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century ‚Äì but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial. According to David Drake's novel Birds of Prey, the Roman Empire's Third Century Crisis was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named Diocletian, realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career. Ray Nelson's novel Blake's Progress assumes that the poet William Blake and his wife Kate were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various alternate timelines, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well- known that Blake revered the poetry of John Milton, the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. William Blake's mythology is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character Urizen was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two. According to Michael Moorcock's Behold the Man, also Jesus Christ was a modern time traveler. His real name was Karl Glogauer, and he had a troubled life in 20th Century London, being obsessed with the character of Jesus and finally getting and taking a chance to board a time machine to Jesus' time. Finding the Virgin Mary to be a nymphomaniac and having sex with her, he discovers that her child Jesus is a profoundly intellectually disabled hunchback who incessantly repeats the only word he knows: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus and could never have done any of the things attributed to the New Testament's Jesus Christ. Thereupon, he decides to take up the role himself, gathers disciples and enacts many of the acts attributed to Jesus, and finally ends up on the cross. In the pain of his last moments he cries out in English It's a lie ... it's a lie ... it's a lie ... which Aramaic-speaking listeners understand as the famous Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani.

He was one of the many sons of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. King Khalid's reign saw both huge developments in the country due to increase in oil revenues and significant events in the Middle East. Early life and education Khalid was born in Riyadh on 13 February 1913. He was the fifth son of Ibn Saud. His mother, Al Jawhara bint Musaed Al Jiluwi, was from the important Al Jiluwi clan whose members intermarried with Al Sauds. Khalid had one full-brother, Prince Muhammad. His full sister, Al Anoud, married to the sons of Sa'ad bin Abdul Rahman. She first married Saud bin Saad. After Saud died, she married Fahd bin Saad. Khalid attended the Mufirej school founded by Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al Mufirej in 1879 which was based in the Sheikh Abdullah bin Abdul Latif mosque in the Dukhna neighborhood. There he acquired basic literacy skills and studied arithmetics. Early experience Prince Khalid in the USA in 1943 Aged 14, Khalid bin Abdulaziz was sent by Ibn Saud as his representative to the desert tribes to hear their concerns and problems. Prince Khalid's preparation for ruling a modern state started through his visits with Prince Faisal on foreign missions, representing Saudi Arabia at the United Nations. Prince Khalid served as advisor of him. Prince Khalid became an international figure as a result of his visits and service as Saudi representative. He was more liberal in informing the press about the rationale behind foreign policy decisions. In 1932, Prince Khalid was named as viceroy of the Hejaz, replacing Prince Faisal in the post, who was named minister of foreign affairs. Prince Khalid's term as viceroy of Hejaz lasted until 1934. Prince Khalid joined the Saudi army led by his older brother Prince Faisal and fought against Yemeni forces in 1934. After the war, Prince Khalid served as the chairman of the Saudi delegation at the Taif Conference with Yemen in 1934. This was a diplomatic move that led to the Taif Treaty later that year which was signed by Prince Khalid on behalf of Saudi Arabia and Abdullah al Wazeer on behalf of Yemen. Prince Khalid was named interior minister in 1934 and was the Saudi representative at the peace negotiations in Yemen in 1935. In 1939, he participated in the St. James Conference on Palestine in London as the minister of interior as well as an assistant to Prince Faisal, head of the Saudi delegation. In October 1943 Prince Faisal and Prince Khalid visited the United States upon the July 1943 invitation of President Roosevelt representing their fathers officially. The visit was the earliest high-level contacts between Saudi Arabia and the USA. Vice President Henry A. Wallace organized a dinner for them at the White House. They also met with Roosevelt. They stayed at the official government guest house, Blair House, during their visit and visited the West Coast by a special train that was officially provided by the US government. A foreign diplomat described Prince Khalid following the visit as \\"probably nicest man in Saudi Arabia.\\" At the end of October 1962 Prince Khalid was appointed deputy prime minister in the new cabinet formed by Prince Faisal, indicating his prominence in the line of succession. During the rivalry between King Saud and Prince Faisal, Prince Khalid supported the latter together with other princes who were members of Al Jiluwi branch of Al Saud through maternal lineage or marriage. The group was led by Prince Mohammed, Prince Khalid and Prince Abdullah, who had married a woman from Al Jiluwi clan. Crown prince Khalid's older full-brother Prince Muhammad declined a place in the succession. Khalid also refused the offer of King Faisal to be named as Crown Prince several times until March 1965. However, he was named Crown Prince on 29 March 1965 to succeed King Faisal which was announced by King Faisal on the same day through a broadcast over Mecca Radio: > Since the position of Crown Prince is a fundamental factor for the > continuation and firmness of the reign, now the country enjoys stability, > advancement and prosperity. Thanks to its adherence to Islam. It gives me > great pleasure to announce...that I have chosen my brother Prince Khalid bin > Abdulaziz as Crown Prince to rule after me. Prince Khalid was also appointed first deputy prime minister. His main task was to govern all organisational and executive powers of the Council of Ministers. He also dealt with the affairs of the Governorate of Mecca on behalf of King Faisal. Crown Prince Khalid was not active in daily issues, but acted as a representative during King Faisal's absences in meetings or ceremonies. According to the declassified US diplomatic documents of 1971, he enjoyed the support of the tribal chiefs, religious authorities and of Prince Abdullah, head of the National Guard, during this period. However, he asked King Faisal to remove him from the position various times. His request was not accepted by the King who persuaded him about the fact that his presence as crown prince was necessary to keep peace within the House of Saud. One of the speculations about Prince Khalid's selection as heir designate was his lack of predilection for politics. In short, by selecting him as heir designate the royal family could create intra-familial consensus. Reign Khalid succeeded to the throne on 25 March 1975 when King Faisal was assassinated. He was proclaimed king after a meeting of senior members of Al Saud: his uncle Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman and his elder brothers Prince Mohammed, Prince Nasser, Prince Saad and younger brothers Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah. The meeting occurred just hours after the assassination of King Faisal. King Khalid also became the de facto prime minister of Saudi Arabia. Although there are various reports stating that King Khalid was only a figurehead during his reign, he was in fact not a figurehead, but the final decision-maker on all major policy issues during his reign. Because King Faisal established a system in which the king was the final mediator in family problems. For instance, King Khalid clearly reduced Sudairi Seven's power concerning succession in 1977 when he was in London for treatment. Because he asked Crown Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah to fully obey the existing succession plan without any change. The reason for King Khalid's request was the frequent rumors about Prince Sultan's intention to become crown prince instead of Prince Abdullah when King Khalid died. On the other hand, King Khalid was not an ineffective leader. Although he seemed to be reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. In fact, during the first two years of his reign he was not active due to his poor health condition. However, later he became much more active in politics as a result of his much better health. King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, he failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. He was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country. Ghadah Alghunaim, a board member of the King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue, argues in her doctoral dissertation that his reign is known as the Saudi golden era and the era of goodness. =Domestic affairs= King Khalid's reign was of massive development in Saudi Arabia and therefore, the country became one of the richest countries. He primarily dealt with domestic affairs with special focus on agricultural development. The industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu (now huge complexes) were created in his reign. However, Simon Henderson argues that his period was, as can be expected, undynamic. On the other hand, the number of schools increased during his reign. In 1975, there were 3,028 elementary schools, 649 secondary schools and 182 high schools. In 1980, there were 5,373 elementary, 1,377 secondary and 456 high schools. The other significant development in the field of education during his reign was the establishment of King Faisal University. The others were the Higher Education Center for Women which was opened in 1976 as well as colleges of medicine and pharmacology established specifically for female students. Immediately following his ascension to the throne King Khalid issued a general amnesty which allowed the release of political prisoners who had been members of the left wing movements and the return of those who had been in exile to Saudi Arabia. In terms of administrative functions King Khalid followed the structure established by late King Faisal in which both royals and nonroyals occupied significant positions. In fact, King Khalid expanded the role of nonroyals in bureaucracy without diminishing the roles of royal family members. The strict financial policies of late King Faisal, coupled with the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, created a financial windfall that fueled development and led to a commercial and economic boom in the country. Notable achievements in his reign included the institution of the second \\"Five-Year Plan\\" in 1975, which aimed to build up Saudi infrastructure and health care. The planned budget for the development plan was $142 billion. Although not all goals were achieved, the second development plan was much more successful than the first one. King Khalid also launched the Kingdom's third development plan with the planned budget of $250 billion in May 1980. The political power consolidation of the ruling family was intensified during his reign. In a reorganization of the council of ministers on 30 March 1975, King Khalid named then-crown prince Fahd deputy prime minister and Prince Abdullah second deputy prime minister. Appointment of Prince Fahd as both crown prince and first deputy prime minister made him much powerful figure in contrast to the status of King Khaled when he was crown prince under King Faisal reign. Prince Nayef was named minister of interior succeeding Prince Fahd on 30 March 1975. King Khalid also appointed Prince Saud as the foreign affairs minister in March 1975. Prince Mohammad, elder brother of King Khalid, was one of his key advisors. In fact, they acted together on almost all political issues. Maarouf al-Dawalibi, former Prime Minister of Syria as well as the founder of the Islamic Socialist Front, was also among the advisors of King Khalid. In addition to the existing ministerial bodies six new ones were established by King Khalid. One of them was the ministry of municipal and rural affairs established in October 1975, and Prince Majid was appointed minister. Additionally, Prince Mutaib was appointed minister of public works and housing that was also established by King Khalid in October 1975. These two appointments were a move to reduce the power of Sudairi Seven in the cabinet. Additionally, the ministry of industry and electricity, the ministry of higher education, the ministry of post, telegraph, and telephone and the ministry of planning were all founded by King Khalid. In the same government reshuffle he removed Prince Musaid, his uncle, from the post of finance minister which he had been held since 16 March 1962, and Mohammed bin Ali Aba Khail was made new finance minister. Kemal Adham served as the president of Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah or the general intelligence directorate until 1979 which he had held since 1965. Adham's successor in the post was Turki bin Faisal. Another administrative unit established by King Khalid in 1975 was the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu of which the first secretary general was Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki. Saudi Arabia acquired full control of Aramco in 1980 during his reign. The same year King Khalid established a constitutional committee with eight members under the presidency of Prince Nayef. The reign of King Khalid witnessed at least two major local incidents which have significant effects on the politics of Saudi Arabia: Grand Mosque seizure and Shiite uprising both of which occurred in 1979. Grand Mosque seizure Some foreign observers thought traditionalism was no longer a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, in order to get permission to use military force to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and then commander of National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, then minister of defense and Prince Nayef, then minister of interior, to deal with the incident. The Grand Mosque was regained by Saudi forces on 4 December 1979 and 63 rebels were executed on 9 January 1980 in eight different cities. The executions were decreed by King Khalid after the edict issued by ulemas. Although the Saudi government under King Khalid executed the rebels, the religious establishment that inspired them were given greater powers. And ulema successfully pressed King Khalid to realize their intentions. 1979 Qatif Uprising In November 1979 the Shiite minority in the Eastern Province, particularly in Qatif and in nearby villages, organized protests and several demonstrators were arrested. The major reason for the uprising was negative conditions in villages. In the spring of 1979 King Khalid announced an annual budget of 160 billion Saudi Riyal indicating that this budget would be employed to improve the living conditions of all Saudi citizens. However, the budget did not make any significant contribution to the services for citizens. Instead, the members of the Saudi royal family benefitted from the budget. Following the release of the demonstrators in February 1980, King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd visited the Eastern region from town to town. Due to King Khalid's policy change towards Shiite population in the region they also positively modified their approach towards the Saudi government and abandoned their oppositional ideas and actions. =International relations= U.S. President Jimmy Carter meets with King Khalid in January 1978 Although King Khalid did not have an extensive interest in foreign affairs as much as King Faisal had, his reign witnessed many important international events, including the Iranian Revolution, the assassination of Anwar Sadat and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had significant effects for Saudi Arabia. In addition, the Saudi government led by King Khalid was much more active in improving the relations of Saudi Arabia with neighbouring states in contrast to the reign of Faisal. Kamal Adham was King Khalid's key counsellor on foreign policy during his reign from 1975 to 1982. King Khalid initiated the move to bring in foreign labor to help with the country's development. Major events (1975‚àí1980) In April 1975, his first diplomatic coup was the conclusion of a demarcation agreement concerning the Al Buraymi Oasis, where the frontiers of Abu Dhabi, Oman and Saudi Arabia meet. Claims and counterclaims over this frontier had exacerbated relations among them for years. Therefore, King Khalid aimed at settling this long-standing boundary disputes. The conclusion of negotiations under King Khalid added to his stature as a statesman. Another significant event was the visit of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran to Riyadh in late April 1975. In June 1975 Saudi Arabia appointed an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates which also assigned an ambassador to Saudi Arabia the same date. His first official visit as the King of Saudi Arabia was to Cairo, Egypt, in mid-July 1975. The visit was an indication of Saudi Arabia's support of the initiatives of Anwar Sadat concerning peace settlement between the Arabs and Israel. King Khalid visited Damascus in December 1975 and met with then-Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss the ways to support Muslims in Lebanon that began to experience civil war. He declared the Saudi Arabia's support to Syria's role in the war. Diplomatic relations with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were reestablished in March 1976. A month later, in April 1976, King Khalid made state visits to all of the Gulf states in the hope of promoting closer relations with his peninsular neighbors. He also called numerous summits and inaugurated the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 that is seen an outcome of his early visits. Then GCC was established along with Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. One of the significant international moves occurred in the reign of King Khalid was the establishment of the Safari Club of which the treaty was signed on 1 September 1976. It was a secret organization with the participation of Egypt, France, Iran, Morocco and Saudi Arabia to eliminate the potential influence of communism in the region. The treaty was signed by Kamal Adham on behalf of Saudi Arabia. King Khalid organized a conference in Riyadh in October 1976 to resolve the ongoing Lebanese civil war, and the conference contributed to end the war. The same month he also visited Pakistan, and the visit was mostly concerned with Saudi Arabia's financial support for the joint developmental projects in Pakistan. On 19 May 1977 King Khalid met Syrian President Hafez Assad and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Riyadh to initiate a coordinated policy on Arab- Israeli conflict. King Khalid and Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met in Riyadh on 18 June 1977. Lebanese Foreign Minister Fuad Butrus was received by King Khalid in Riyadh on 5 July 1977 to discuss current situation in Lebanon. On 10 July 1977 Yen Chia-kan, President of Taiwan, visited Saudi Arabia and was received by the King in Riyadh. Two days later, on 12 July 1977, King Khalid and Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre met in Jeddah. Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiry and King Khalid met in Ta'if on 2 August 1977. In early January 1978 US President Jimmy Carter paid an official visit to Riyadh and met King Khalid to discuss the Middle East peace efforts. Following King Khalid's heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic on 3 October 1978 Jimmy Carter invited him to the White House for lunch, and they met on 27 October. The Camp David accord which was signed by Egypt and Israel in September 1978 severely affected the Saudi-Egyptian alliance, and Saudi Arabia's diplomatic relations with Egypt were terminated following the Baghdad Conference in November 1978. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, King Khalid sent Khomeini a congratulatory message, stating that Islamic solidarity could be the basis for closer relations of two countries. He also argued that with the foundation of the Islamic Republic in Iran there were no obstacles that inhibited the cooperation between two countries. In addition, King Khalid requested the secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to congratulate the new Iranian government. However, his initiatives were unsuccessful in that Saudi Arabia unofficially supported Iraq against Iran in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1980. On 24 December 1979 Pakistan President Zia ul Haq visited Riyadh and met King Khalid in relation to the Grand Mosque crisis which had been solved at the beginning of the month. Major events (1980‚àí1982) In April 1980 King Khalid cancelled the state visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of Death of a Princess on 9 April 1980 in the United Kingdom that narrated the execution of Misha'al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz. King Khalid had been invited by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1979, following the Queen's visit to Saudi Arabia in February 1979, during which King Khalid gave her a diamond necklace. In addition, the British ambassador was expelled from Saudi Arabia for five months due to the broadcasting of the documentary on ITV. Egyptian actress Suzan Abu Talib or Sawsan Badr and other actors who had roles in the documentary were banned from entering Saudi Arabia. King Khalid in the capacity of the chairman of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation assisted Pakistani authorities to end the hijacking of the Pakistan International Airlines Flight 326 on 2 March 1981 first to Kabul and to Damascus on the request of President Zia ul Haq. King Khalid's visit to the United Kingdom that had been cancelled in 1980 was realized on 9 June 1981 for four days. Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have said he would be happy to discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she should talk to Crown Prince Fahd. King Khalid asked then-U.S. president Carter to sell advanced fighter planes to Saudi Arabia to assist in countering communist aggression in the area. The delivery of the first of sixty F-15s under the agreement approved by Carter arrived in the Kingdom in 1982. He purchased a Boeing 747 with an operating room should he be stricken while on his travels. Jimmy Carter in his memoirs stated that both King Khalid and then Crown Prince Fahd assured him of \\"their unequivocal support for Sadat\\", but they would realize no concrete move in this direction, at least not publicly. Views At the very beginning of his reign King Khalid stated \\"Islamic law is and will remain our standard, our source of inspiration, and our goal.\\" He questioned the support of the US administration to Greece instead of Turkey in late May 1976 citing Turkey's contributions in the Korean War during the 1950s. In an interview on BBC Summary of World Broadcasts he expressed the following views on Zionism, communism and colonialism on 3 July 1979: We regard Zionism, communism and colonialism as a trinity allied against Arab and Islamic rights and aspirations. Our policy is based on that understanding, and it is natural for us to be always subjected to biased and poisonous campaigns at the hand of that very trinity. At the third summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Taif in January 1981 he declared non-alignment of Saudi Arabia concerning the tensions between the USA and Soviet Union: Our loyalty must be neither to an eastern bloc nor to a western bloc. The security of the Islamic nation will not be assured by joining a military alliance, nor by taking refuge under the umbrella of a superpower. Personal life King Khalid married four times and was the father of ten children. While the sequence in seniority of his wives is not known clearly, his wives were: * Latifa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Latifa was a daughter of King Abdulaziz's maternal uncle and Khalid was fifteen when he married her. They had no child. * Tarfa bint Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. She was a daughter of his uncle, Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman. They had no child. * Noura bint Turki bin Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Turki Al Saud. She was the granddaughter of Abdullah bin Jiluwi and was the mother of Khalid's elder sons, Prince Bandar and Prince Abdullah and his elder daughter, Al Bandari. Noura bint Turki died at age 95 on 12 September 2011. *Sita bint Fahd Al Damir had seven children with King Khalid: Jawhara, Fahd (died young), Nouf, Moudi, Hussa, Mishaal, and Faisal. She was from the Ujman tribe in Al Badiyah and was a niece of Wasmiyah Al Damir, wife of Abdullah bin Jiluwi. She died on 25 December 2012 at the age of 90. Khalid had four sons and six daughters. Prince Bandar, the eldest son of King Khalid, was born in 1935. He was one of the members of Al Saud Family Council established by Crown Prince Abdullah in June 2000 to discuss private issues such as business activities of princes and marriages of princess to individuals who were not member of House of Saud. Prince Bandar died in Mecca in March 2018. His youngest child, Prince Faisal, is the former governor of Asir Province and a member of the Allegiance Council. His eldest daughter, Al Bandari bint Khalid, married to Badr bin Abdul Muhsin Al Saud. One of his daughters, Hussa bint Khalid, married Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki, grandson of Turki I. She died at the age of 59 in November 2010. Nouf bint Khalid was the spouse of Mohammed bin Abdullah, a grandson of King Faisal, and had three children. Another daughter, Moudi, wife of late Prince Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, is the general secretary of the King Khalid Foundation and the Al Nahda Foundation, and a former member of the Consultative Assembly. Mishael bint Khalid died in Riyadh in April 2014. King Khalid owned a desert farm outside Riyadh at Um Hamam. In December 1975 he bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long. He bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for ¬£1.9 million in March 1977. =Personality and pastimes= Khalid was described as warm, cheerful, attentive and devout and was adored by his sisters and brothers. An American journalist from Christian Science Monitor, John K. Cooley, following his observation of King Khalid at majlis stated that he carefully listened to his subjects showing his sense of humor and amused smile. During the first year of his rule King Khalid was said by his close observers to be an open and good man without any pretense representing the best example of Arab gentlemanly culture. His favourite topics to discuss at majlis with visitors were the problems related to education and youth. Khalid had the capacity to settle the conflicts which was first recognized by his father. It was the reason for sending him to Yemen in 1935 to handle the problems with local people. During his kingship Khalid acted as a mediator between Sudairi brothers and Prince Abdullah although he was much closer to the latter. Falconry and horse-riding were Khalid's favorite pastimes, He was described as a man of the desert. He had one of the best falcon collections. In the late 1970s, King Khalid was given a rare Alberta-trained gyrfalcon by the Canadian government as a gift. Hunting was also one of his favorites, and he went to African countries to participate in hunting safaris when he was young. Khalid bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for falconry. =Health= When Khalid bin Abdulaziz was crown prince, he had a massive heart attack in 1970 and had a heart surgery in 1972 at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States. Since King Khalid suffered from heart ailment for a long period of time, then Crown Prince Fahd was in charge of ruling the country. On 3 October 1978, he underwent a second heart surgery again in Cleveland. He also had a hip operation at Wellington Hospital in London in 1976. In February 1980, King Khalid had a minor heart attack. Death and funeral King Khalid died on 13 June 1982 due to a heart attack in Taif. On the same day his body was brought from Taif to Mecca. After funeral prayers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, King Khalid was buried in Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh. Leaders of Qatar, Kuwait, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, as well as then-President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak, participated in the funeral. Legacy King Khalid International Airport, King Khalid University, King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, King Khalid Military City and King Khalid Medical City in the Eastern province were all named after him. In Riyadh there is also a mosque named after him, King Khalid Mosque, serving the Moslems since 1988. In Jeddah a bridge is named after King Khalid. There is a research center on wildlife in Saudi Arabia named after him, namely Khalid Wildlife Research Centre. In addition, his family established King Khalid Foundation, which is being headed by his son, Abdullah bin Khalid. The foundation awards individuals who have achievements in the fields of corporate social responsibility, nonprofit management and social innovation. =Awards= In January 1981, King Khalid was awarded by the United Nations (UN) a gold medal. This medal is the UN's highest decoration for the statesmen who significantly contributed to peace and cooperation worldwide. King Khalid also received the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam due to his efforts in support of Islamic solidarity in 1981.

The film series The series consists of eight television films, which are notable for their high production values. All were later released on DVD (with the original aspect ratio of 16:9 widescreen in Europe and 4:3 in the US). In the US, the series was retitled Horatio Hornblower, and some of the films were known by different titles. The eight films cover the events of just three of the ten novels (Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower, and Hornblower and the Hotspur), and various alterations and additions are made to the source material (e.g., the recurring characters of Lt. Archie Kennedy, Matthews and Styles). * The Even Chance (U.S. title: The Duel) (7 October 1998) * The Examination for Lieutenant (U.S. title: The Fire Ships) (18 November 1998) * The Duchess and the Devil (24 February 1999) * The Frogs and the Lobsters (U.S. title: The Wrong War) (2 April 1999) * Mutiny (24 March 2002) * Retribution (25 March 2002) * Loyalty (5 January 2003) * Duty (6 January 2003) Production Captain Pellew's ship, , is represented by the Grand Turk, a modern copy of the frigate HMS Blandford built in 1741. To represent Hornblower's ship, HMS Hotspur, the Earl of Pembroke, a civilian ship, underwent some conversion. The Baltic trading schooner Julia and the brig Phoenix of Dell Quay were used to represent the smaller vessels. No real 74-gun ship existed any longer at the time of production (the last one, HMS Implacable, was scuttled in 1949), so HMS Justinian and HMS Renown had to be recreated as models. For the first series a quarter of a 74-gun ship (one exterior side and three open sides to shoot live action on several decks) called the pontoon was built. Later live action on the quarterdeck or the gundeck below was shot on the actual HMS Victory. Eleven scale models, ranging from 4.5 to 7 m in length, were used for the battle scenes, the largest weighing 1400 kg, and made with working rigging and cannons that were fired by remote control. Shooting locations included the Black Sea, the Livadia Palace, Portugal, and the former administration (Melville) building of the Royal William Yard and the Barbican, Plymouth in England.

It is the first game in the Lineage series. It is most popular in Korea and is available in Chinese, Japanese, and English language versions. The game was designed by Jake Song, who had previously designed Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds, another MMORPG. Lineage features 2D isometric-overhead graphics similar to those of Ultima Online and Diablo II. Lineage II: The Chaotic Chronicle, a \\"prequel\\" set 150 years before the time of Lineage, was released in 2003. By 2006, the Lineage franchise had attracted 43 million players. Project TL, a sequel will be set after Lineage and will be the last game in the Lineage series. In May 2011, NCSoft announced that due to unprofitability, the North American Servers would be shut down on June 29, 2011. Gameplay Lineage's stat, monster, and item system was originally largely borrowed from NetHack with MMO elements added. Players can choose one of seven character classes: Elf, Dark Elf, Knight, Prince, Magician, Dragon Knight, or Illusionist. Princes are the only class that can lead a blood pledge (which is Lineage's term for a guild or clan). Game play is based primarily upon a castle siege system which allows castle owners to set tax rates in neighboring cities and collect taxes on items purchased in stores within those cities. It features classic RPG elements reminiscent of Dungeons & Dragons, such as killing monsters and completing quests for loot and experience points, levels, character attributes (charisma, strength, wisdom, etc.), and alignments (neutral, chaotic or lawful). A character's alignment affects how monsters and town guards react to the player's character, often turning hostile to chaotic players and attacking on sight. Player versus player combat (also known as PVP) is extensive in Lineage. Players can engage in combat with other player characters at any time as long as they are not in safe zones such as cities. By joining a \\"bloodpledge\\" (an association of players similar to a clan in other games) players become eligible to engage in castle sieges or wars between bloodpledges. Subscription history NCsoft has reported that Lineage had at one point more than three million subscribers,MMOGChart Subscribers most of them in Korea. The magnitude of the number Korean subscribers compared to other countries has sparked a number of theories. A ban on some Japanese imports until 1998 has been cited for delayed growth in its video game console market. As of April 2008, Lineage had a little under 1 million active subscriptions.1Q FY2007 Earnings Release(Consolidated) On May 11, 2011, NC Interactive, the subsidiary of NCSoft in the United States announced it would shut down the Lineage servers (3 at that time) because of poor subscription revenues. Various events were scheduled to take place in the weeks remaining. Players were given free subscriptions to other NCSoft titles of their choice. As of June 29, 2011, Lineage has shut down all servers in NA, permanently. Between the start in 1998 and August 2012, NCsoft has accumulated US$1.3 billion in sales from Lineage. In November 2013 NC Soft announced that the game has made US$1.8 billion. Origin of \\"Lineage\\" The title Lineage came from a series of comic books with same title Lineage by Shin Il-sook, and the servers of Lineage are named after the characters of the comic book. It is a fantasy story where a rightful prince reclaims the throne from the hands of a usurper. When first created, the game closely resembled the original work. As developers have added new features, however, the fictional universes of the two works have gradually diverged.

A wagon train is a group of wagons traveling together. Before the extensive use of military vehicles, baggage trains followed an army with supplies and ammunition. In the American West, settlers traveling across the plains and mountain passes in covered wagons banded together for mutual assistance. Although wagon trains are associated with the Old West, the Trekboers of South Africa also traveled in caravans of covered wagons. In migration =Transit, traces and trails= Wagon trains followed several trails in the American West, with virtually all originating at Independence, Missouri. Perhaps the most famous wagon train trail was the Oregon Trail which had a span of over .Brown, Dee Alexander, and Martin Ferdinand Schmitt. The American West. New York: Scribner, 1994. Print. Other paths included the Santa Fe Trail, the Chisholm Trail, the California Trail (which split southwestward from the Oregon Trail), the Mormon Trail, and the Old Spanish Trail. Although \\"wagon train\\" suggests a line of wagons, when terrain permitted, wagons would often fan out and travel abreast to minimize the amount of dust blown onto other wagons. Travel by wagon train occurred primarily between the 1840s‚Äì1880s, diminishing after completion of the first transcontinental railroad. Some remnants of wagon ruts along the well-travelled trails are still visible today. =Organization= Originally, westward movement began in small groups, but well-funded travelers with a hundred or more wagons could employ professional wagon masters (or trail masters) and ostlers. Overland emigrants discovered smaller groups of twenty to forty wagons were more manageable than larger ones, especially without professional wagon masters. Many operated under democratic principles, creating bylaws and electing a captain. In reality, a captain had limited authority. His role was largely confined to getting everyone moving in the morning and selecting when and where to camp at night.\\"Life and Death on the Oregon Trail, \\"Provisions for births and lethal circumstances\\", OCTA.\\" Oregon-California Trails Association (OCTA) ‚Äì Oregon Trail History. Oregon-California Trails Association, n.d. Web. 4 Oct. 2013. . Membership in wagon trains was generally fluid and wagons frequently joined or left trains depending on the needs and wishes of their owners. An accident or illness, for instance, might force someone to fall behind and wait for the next train, or an emigrant might \\"whip up\\" to overtake a forward train after a quarrel. Some might break away to settle in Colorado Territory or other territories along the way. At night, wagon trains were often formed into a circle or square for shelter from wind or weather, and to corral the emigrants' animals in the center to prevent them from running away or being stolen by Native Americans. While Native Americans might attempt to raid horses under cover of darkness, they rarely attacked a train. Contrary to popular belief, wagons were seldom circled defensively. =Modern-day treks= Today, covered wagon trains are used to give an authentic experience for those desiring to explore the West as it was in the days of the pioneers and other groups traveling before modern vehicles were invented. Indian teams hauling 60 miles to market the 1100 bushels of wheat raised by the school at Seger Colony, Oklahoma Historical Society‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture:Washita County Oklahoma 448x448px Baggage trains The advent of gunpowder warfare meant that an army could no longer rely solely on foraging in the surrounding countryside, and required a regular supply of munitions. In the 18th century, organized commissary and quartermaster departments were developed to centralize delivery of supplies. The delivery took the form of \\"baggage trains\\", large groups of wagons that traveled at the rear of the main army. In popular media Westward-bound collective treks are reflected in numerous books, films and television programs about the journeys. Examples include: Emerson Hough's 1922 novel and James Cruze's silent film based on it, The Covered Wagon (1923); Raoul Walsh's film The Big Trail (1930); Robert N. Bradbury's film Westward Ho (1935); John Ford's Wagon Master (1950) and the television series it inspired, Wagon Train (1957‚Äì1965); William Wellman's film, Westward the Women (1951); A. B. Guthrie Jr.'s 1949 novel The Way West and Andrew V. McLaglen's 1967 film based on it; and the \\"Wagons West\\" series of 24 novels written by Noel Gerson (under the psudonym Dana Fuller Ross) between 1979 and 1989.

A tandem or serial stage is mounted on top of another stage; a parallel stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two- stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched. By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is decreased. Each successive stage can also be optimized for its specific operating conditions, such as decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This staging allows the thrust of the remaining stages to more easily accelerate the rocket to its final speed and height. In serial or tandem staging schemes, the first stage is at the bottom and is usually the largest, the second stage and subsequent upper stages are above it, usually decreasing in size. In parallel staging schemes solid or liquid rocket boosters are used to assist with launch. These are sometimes referred to as \\"stage 0\\". In the typical case, the first-stage and booster engines fire to propel the entire rocket upwards. When the boosters run out of fuel, they are detached from the rest of the rocket (usually with some kind of small explosive charge or explosive bolts) and fall away. The first stage then burns to completion and falls off. This leaves a smaller rocket, with the second stage on the bottom, which then fires. Known in rocketry circles as staging, this process is repeated until the desired final velocity is achieved. In some cases with serial staging, the upper stage ignites before the separation‚Äîthe interstage ring is designed with this in mind, and the thrust is used to help positively separate the two vehicles. A multistage rocket is required to reach orbital speed. Single-stage-to-orbit designs are sought, but have not yet been demonstrated. Performance Cutaway drawings showing three multi-stage rockets Apollo 11 Saturn V first- stage separation The second stage being lowered onto the first stage of a Saturn V rocket A diagram of the second stage and how it fits into the complete rocket The reason multi-stage rockets are required is the limitation the laws of physics place on the maximum velocity achievable by a rocket of given fueled-to-dry mass ratio. This relation is given by the classical rocket equation: :\\\\Delta v = v_\\\\text{e} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac {m_0} {m_f}\\\\right) where: :\\\\Delta v\\\\ is delta-v of the vehicle (change of velocity plus losses due to gravity and atmospheric drag); :m_0 is the initial total (wet) mass, equal to final (dry) mass plus propellant; :m_f is the final (dry) mass, after the propellant is expended; :v_\\\\text{e} is the effective exhaust velocity (determined by propellant, engine design and throttle condition); :\\\\ln is the natural logarithm function. The delta v required to reach low Earth orbit (or the required velocity of a sufficiently heavy suborbital payload) requires a wet to dry mass ratio larger than can realistically be achieved in a single rocket stage. The multistage rocket overcomes this limit by splitting the delta-v into fractions. As each lower stage drops off and the succeeding stage fires, the rest of the rocket is still traveling near the burnout speed. Each lower stage's dry mass includes the propellant in the upper stages, and each succeeding upper stage has reduced its dry mass by discarding the useless dry mass of the spent lower stages. A further advantage is that each stage can use a different type of rocket engine, each tuned for its particular operating conditions. Thus the lower-stage engines are designed for use at atmospheric pressure, while the upper stages can use engines suited to near vacuum conditions. Lower stages tend to require more structure than upper as they need to bear their own weight plus that of the stages above them. Optimizing the structure of each stage decreases the weight of the total vehicle and provides further advantage. The advantage of staging comes at the cost of the lower stages lifting engines which are not yet being used, as well as making the entire rocket more complex and harder to build than a single stage. In addition, each staging event is a possible point of launch failure, due to separation failure, ignition failure, or stage collision. Nevertheless, the savings are so great that every rocket ever used to deliver a payload into orbit has had staging of some sort. One of the most common measures of rocket efficiency is its specific impulse, which is defined as the thrust per flow rate (per second) of propellant consumption:Curtis, Howard. \\"Rocket Vehicle Dynamics.\\" Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students. 2nd ed. Daytona Beach: Elsevier, 2010. Print : I_\\\\mathrm{sp} = \\\\ \\\\frac{T}{\\\\frac{dm}{dt} g_\\\\mathrm{0}} When rearranging the equation such that thrust is calculated as a result of the other factors, we have: : T = I_\\\\mathrm{sp}g_\\\\mathrm{0} \\\\frac{dm}{dt} These equations show that a higher specific impulse means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning for longer periods of time. In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower specific impulse rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes. Later stages of the rocket usually have a higher specific impulse rating because the vehicle is further outside the atmosphere and the exhaust gas does not need to expand against as much atmospheric pressure. When selecting the ideal rocket engine to use as an initial stage for a launch vehicle, a useful performance metric to examine is the thrust-to-weight ratio, and is calculated by the equation: : TWR = \\\\frac{T}{mg_\\\\mathrm{0}} The common thrust-to-weight ratio of a launch vehicle is within the range of 1.3 to 2.0. Another performance metric to keep in mind when designing each rocket stage in a mission is the burn time, which is the amount of time the rocket engine will last before it has exhausted all of its propellant. For most non-final stages, thrust and specific impulse can be assumed constant, which allows the equation for burn time to be written as: : \\\\Delta{t} = \\\\frac{I_\\\\mathrm{sp}g_\\\\mathrm{0}}{T} \\\\times (m_\\\\mathrm{0} - m_\\\\mathrm{f}) Where m_\\\\mathrm{0} and m_\\\\mathrm{f} are the initial and final masses of the rocket stage respectively. In conjunction with the burnout time, the burnout height and velocity are obtained using the same values, and are found by these two equations: : h_\\\\mathrm{bo} = \\\\frac{I_\\\\mathrm{sp}g_\\\\mathrm{0}}{m_\\\\mathrm{e}} \\\\times ( m_\\\\mathrm{f} ~ \\\\mathrm{ln} (m_\\\\mathrm{f}/m_\\\\mathrm{0}) + m_\\\\mathrm{0} - m_\\\\mathrm{f}) : v_\\\\mathrm{bo} = \\\\frac{I_\\\\mathrm{sp} g_\\\\mathrm{0} m_\\\\mathrm{0}} {m_\\\\mathrm{f}} - \\\\frac{g_\\\\mathrm{0}}{m_\\\\mathrm{e}} (m_\\\\mathrm{0} - m_\\\\mathrm{f}) When dealing with the problem of calculating the total burnout velocity or time for the entire rocket system, the general procedure for doing so is as follows: # Partition the problem calculations into however many stages the rocket system comprises. # Calculate the initial and final mass for each individual stage. # Calculate the burnout velocity, and sum it with the initial velocity for each individual stage. Assuming each stage occurs immediately after the previous, the burnout velocity becomes the initial velocity for the following stage. # Repeat the previous two steps until the burnout time and/or velocity has been calculated for the final stage. It is important to note that the burnout time does not define the end of the rocket stage's motion, as the vehicle will still have a velocity that will allow it to coast upward for a brief amount of time until the acceleration of the planet's gravity gradually changes it to a downward direction. The velocity and altitude of the rocket after burnout can be easily modeled using the basic physics equations of motion. When comparing one rocket with another, it is impractical to directly compare the rocket's certain trait with the same trait of another because their individual attributes are often not independent of one another. For this reason, dimensionless ratios have been designed to enable a more meaningful comparison between rockets. The first is the initial to final mass ratio, which is the ratio between the rocket stage's full initial mass and the rocket stage's final mass once all of its fuel has been consumed. The equation for this ratio is: : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{E} + m_\\\\mathrm{p} + m_\\\\mathrm{PL}}{m_\\\\mathrm{E} + m_\\\\mathrm{PL}} Where m_\\\\mathrm{E} is the empty mass of the stage, m_\\\\mathrm{p} is the mass of the propellant, and m_\\\\mathrm{PL} is the mass of the payload.[Nakhjiri, Navid, Ph.D, 2014. Presented at Calpoly Astronautics Lecture] The second dimensionless performance quantity is the structural ratio, which is the ratio between the empty mass of the stage, and the combined empty mass and propellant mass as shown in this equation: : \\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{E}}{m_\\\\mathrm{E}+m_\\\\mathrm{P}} The last major dimensionless performance quantity is the payload ratio, which is the ratio between the payload mass and the combined mass of the empty rocket stage and the propellant: : \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{PL}}{m_\\\\mathrm{E} + m_\\\\mathrm{P}} After comparing the three equations for the dimensionless quantities, it is easy to see that they are not independent of each other, and in fact, the initial to final mass ratio can be rewritten in terms of structural ratio and payload ratio: : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\lambda}{\\\\epsilon + \\\\lambda} These performance ratios can also be used as references for how efficient a rocket system will be when performing optimizations and comparing varying configurations for a mission. Component selection and sizing Saturn family of multistage rockets carrying Apollo spacecraft For initial sizing, the rocket equations can be used to derive the amount of propellant needed for the rocket based on the specific impulse of the engine and the total impulse required in N*s. The equation is: : m_\\\\mathrm{p} = I_\\\\mathrm{tot} / (g*I_\\\\mathrm{sp} ) where g is the gravity constant of Earth. This also enables the volume of storage required for the fuel to be calculated if the density of the fuel is known, which is almost always the case when designing the rocket stage. The volume is yielded when dividing the mass of the propellant by its density. Asides from the fuel required, the mass of the rocket structure itself must also be determined, which requires taking into account the mass of the required thrusters, electronics, instruments, power equipment, etc. These are known quantities for typical off the shelf hardware that should be considered in the mid to late stages of the design, but for preliminary and conceptual design, a simpler approach can be taken. Assuming one engine for a rocket stage provides all of the total impulse for that particular segment, a mass fraction can be used to determine the mass of the system. The mass of the stage transfer hardware such as initiators and safe- and-arm devices are very small by comparison and can be considered negligible. For modern day solid rocket motors, it is a safe and reasonable assumption to say that 91 to 94 percent of the total mass is fuel. It is also important to note there is a small percentage of \\"residual\\" propellant that will be left stuck and unusable inside the tank, and should also be taken into consideration when determining amount of fuel for the rocket. A common initial estimate for this residual propellant is five percent. With this ratio and the mass of the propellant calculated, the mass of the empty rocket weight can be determined. Sizing rockets using a liquid bipropellant requires a slightly more involved approach because of the fact that there are two separate tanks that are required: One for the fuel, and one for the oxidizer. The ratio of these two quantities is known as the mixture ratio, and is defined by the equation: : O/F = m_\\\\mathrm{ox}/m_\\\\mathrm{fuel} Where m_\\\\mathrm{ox} is the mass of the oxidizer and m_\\\\mathrm{fuel} is the mass of the fuel. This mixture ratio not only governs the size of each tank, but also the specific impulse of the rocket. Determining the ideal mixture ratio is a balance of compromises between various aspects of the rocket being designed, and can vary depending on the type of fuel and oxidizer combination being used. For example, a mixture ratio of a bipropellant could be adjusted such that it may not have the optimal specific impulse, but will result in fuel tanks of equal size. This would yield simpler and cheaper manufacturing, packing, configuring, and integrating of the fuel systems with the rest of the rocket, and can become a benefit that could outweigh the drawbacks of a less efficient specific impulse rating. But suppose the defining constraint for the launch system is volume, and a low density fuel is required such as hydrogen. This example would be solved by using an oxidizer-rich mixture ratio, reducing efficiency and specific impulse rating, but will meet a smaller tank volume requirement. Optimal staging and restricted staging =Optimal= The ultimate goal of optimal staging is to maximize the payload ratio (see ratios under performance), meaning the largest amount of payload is carried up to the required burnout velocity using the least amount of non-payload mass, which comprises everything else. Here are a few quick rules and guidelines to follow in order to reach optimal staging: # Initial stages should have lower I_{sp}, and later/final stages should have higher I_{sp}. # The stages with the lower I_{sp} should contribute more ŒîV. # The next stage is always a smaller size than the previous stage. # Similar stages should provide similar ŒîV. The payload ratio can be calculated for each individual stage, and when multiplied together in sequence, will yield the overall payload ratio of the entire system. It is important to note that when computing payload ratio for individual stages, the payload includes the mass of all the stages after the current one. The overall payload ratio is: : \\\\lambda = \\\\prod_{i = 1}^n \\\\lambda_i Where n is the number of stages the rocket system comprises. Similar stages yielding the same payload ratio simplify this equation, however that is seldom the ideal solution for maximizing payload ratio, and ŒîV requirements may have to be partitioned unevenly as suggested in guideline tips 1 and 2 from above. Two common methods of determining this perfect ŒîV partition between stages are either a technical algorithm that generates an analytical solution that can be implemented by a program, or simple trial and error. For the trial and error approach, it is best to begin with the final stage, calculating the initial mass which becomes the payload for the previous stage. From there it is easy to progress all the way down to the initial stage in the same manner, sizing all the stages of the rocket system. =Restricted= Restricted rocket staging is based on the simplified assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, structural ratio, and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage. Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage. This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design. One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system. Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages. However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment. The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number. In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment. Tandem vs parallel staging design A rocket system that implements tandem staging means that each individual stage runs in order one after the other. The rocket breaks free from the previous stage, then begins burning through the next stage in straight succession. On the other hand, a rocket that implements parallel staging has two or more different stages that are active at the same time. For example, the Space Shuttle has two Solid Rocket Boosters that burn simultaneously. Upon launch, the boosters ignite, and at the end of the stage, the two boosters are discarded while the external fuel tank is kept for another stage. Most quantitative approaches to the design of the rocket system's performance are focused on tandem staging, but the approach can be easily modified to include parallel staging. To begin with, the different stages of the rocket should be clearly defined. Continuing with the previous example, the end of the first stage which is sometimes referred to as 'stage 0', can be defined as when the side boosters separate from the main rocket. From there, the final mass of stage one can be considered the sum of the empty mass of stage one, the mass of stage two (the main rocket and the remaining unburned fuel) and the mass of the payload. Upper stages High-altitude and space-bound upper stages are designed to operate with little or no atmospheric pressure. This allows the use of lower pressure combustion chambers and engine nozzles with optimal vacuum expansion ratios. Some upper stages, especially those using hypergolic propellants like Delta-K or Ariane 5 ES second stage, are pressure fed, which eliminates the need for complex turbopumps. Other upper stages, such as the Centaur or DCSS, use liquid hydrogen expander cycle engines, or gas generator cycle engines like the Ariane 5 ECA's HM7B or the S-IVB's J-2. These stages are usually tasked with completing orbital injection and accelerating payloads into higher energy orbits such as GTO or to escape velocity. Upper stages, such as Fregat, used primarily to bring payloads from low Earth orbit to GTO or beyond are sometimes referred to as space tugs.  Assembly  Each individual stage is generally assembled at its manufacturing site and shipped to the launch site; the term vehicle assembly refers to the mating of all rocket stage(s) and the spacecraft payload into a single assembly known as a space vehicle. Single- stage vehicles (suborbital), and multistage vehicles on the smaller end of the size range, can usually be assembled directly on the launch pad by lifting the stage(s) and spacecraft vertically in place by means of a crane. This is generally not practical for larger space vehicles, which are assembled off the pad and moved into place on the launch site by various methods. NASA's Apollo/Saturn V manned Moon landing vehicle, and Space Shuttle, were assembled vertically onto mobile launcher platforms with attached launch umbilical towers, in a Vehicle Assembly Building, and then a special crawler-transporter moved the entire vehicle stack to the launch pad in an upright position. In contrast, vehicles such as the Russian Soyuz rocket and the SpaceX Falcon 9 are assembled horizontally in a processing hangar, transported horizontally, and then brought upright at the pad. Passivation and space debris Spent upper stages of launch vehicles are a significant source of space debris remaining in orbit in a non-operational state for many years after use, and occasionally, large debris fields created from the breakup of a single upper stage while in orbit. After the 1990s, spent upper stages are generally passivated after their use as a launch vehicle is complete in order to minimize risks while the stage remains derelict in orbit. Passivation means removing any sources of stored energy remaining on the vehicle, as by dumping fuel or discharging batteries. Many early upper stages, in both the Soviet and U.S. space programs, were not passivated after mission completion. During the initial attempts to characterize the space debris problem, it became evident that a good proportion of all debris was due to the breaking up of rocket upper stages, particularly unpassivated upper-stage propulsion units. History and development An illustration and description in the 14th century Chinese Huolongjing by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen shows the oldest known multistage rocket; this was the \\"fire-dragon issuing from the water\\" (ÁÅ´ÈæôÂá∫Ê∞¥, hu«í l√≥ng ch≈´ shu«ê), used mostly by the Chinese navy.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 510. It was a two-stage rocket that had booster rockets that would eventually burn out, yet before they did they automatically ignited a number of smaller rocket arrows that were shot out of the front end of the missile, which was shaped like a dragon's head with an open mouth. This multi-stage rocket may be considered the ancestor to the modern YingJi-62 ASCM. The British scientist and historian Joseph Needham points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the Huolongjing, which can be dated roughly 1300‚Äì1350 AD (from the book's part 1, chapter 3, page 23). Another example of an early multistaged rocket is the Juhwa (Ëµ∞ÁÅ´) of Korean development. It was proposed by medieval Korean engineer, scientist and inventor Choe Museon and developed by the Firearms Bureau (ÁÅ´„∑ÅÈÅìÁõ£) during the 14th century.:ko:Ï£ºÌôî (Î¨¥Í∏∞):ko:ÌôîÌÜµÎèÑÍ∞ê The rocket had the length of 15 cm and 13 cm; the diameter was 2.2 cm. It was attached to an arrow 110 cm long; experimental records show that the first results were around 200m in range. There are records that show Korea kept developing this technology until it came to produce the Singijeon, or 'magical machine arrows' in the 16th century. The earliest experiments with multistage rockets in Europe were made in 1551 by Austrian Conrad Haas (1509‚Äì1576), the arsenal master of the town of Hermannstadt, Transylvania (now Sibiu/Hermannstadt, Romania). This concept was developed independently by at least four individuals: *Kazimieras Simonaviƒçius of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1600‚Äì1651) *the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857‚Äì1935) *the American Robert Goddard (1882‚Äì1945) *the German Hermann Oberth (1894‚Äì1989), born in Hermannstadt, Transylvania The first high- speed multistage rockets were the RTV-G-4 Bumper rockets tested at the White Sands Proving Ground and later at Cape Canaveral from 1948 to 1950. These consisted of a V-2 rocket and a WAC Corporal sounding rocket. The greatest altitude ever reached was 393 km, attained on February 24, 1949, at White Sands. In 1947, the Soviet rocket engineer and scientist Mikhail Tikhonravov developed a theory of parallel stages, which he called \\"packet rockets\\". In his scheme, three parallel stages were fired from liftoff, but all three engines were fueled from the outer two stages, until they are empty and could be ejected. This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second-stage engine is never just dead weight. In 1951, Soviet engineer and scientist Dmitry Okhotsimsky carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages. The design of the R-7 Semyorka emerged from that study. The trio of rocket engines used in the first stage of the American Atlas I and Atlas II launch vehicles, arranged in a row, used parallel staging in a similar way: the outer pair of booster engines existed as a jettisonable pair which would, after they shut down, drop away with the lowermost outer skirt structure, leaving the central sustainer engine to complete the first stage's engine burn towards apogee or orbit. Separation events Separation of each portion of a multistage rocket introduces additional risk into the success of the launch mission. Reducing the number of separation events results in a reduction in complexity. Separation events occur when stages or strap-on boosters separate after use, when the payload fairing separates prior to orbital insertion, or when used, a launch escape system which separates after the early phase of a launch. Pyrotechnic fasteners or pneumatic systems are typically used to separate rocket stages.

Their name differed by province and the local language: Cagots, G√©zitains, Gahets, and Gafets in Gascony; Agotes, Argotes, Agotak and Gafos in Basque country; Capots in Anjou and Languedoc; and Cacons, Cahets, Caqueux, and Caquins in Brittany. Evidence of the group exists back as far as AD 1000.Robb, p. 43. Cagots were shunned and hated; while restrictions varied by time and place, they were typically required to live in separate quarters in towns, called cagoteries, which were often on the far outskirts of the villages. Cagots were excluded from all political and social rights. They were not allowed to marry non-Cagots, enter taverns, hold cabarets, use public fountains, sell food or wine, touch food in the market, work with livestock, or enter mills. They were allowed to enter a church only by a special door and, during the service, a rail separated them from the other worshippers. Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament, or the Eucharist was given to them on the end of a wooden spoon, while a holy water stoup was reserved for their exclusive use. They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress to which, in some places, was attached the foot of a goose or duck (whence they were sometimes called \\"Canards\\"). So pestilential was their touch considered that it was a crime for them to walk the common road barefooted or to drink from the same cup as non-Cagots. The Cagots were often restricted to the trades of carpenter, butcher, and rope-maker.Sean Thomas, \\"The Last Untouchable in Europe,\\" The Independent, London, 28 July 2008, p. 20 The Cagots were not an ethnic nor a religious group. They spoke the same language as the people in an area and generally kept the same religion as well. Their only distinguishing feature was their descent from families long identified as Cagots. Few consistent reasons were given as to why they were hated; accusations varied from Cagots being cretins, lepers, heretics, cannibals, to simply being intrinsically evil. The Cagots did have a culture of their own, but very little of it was written down or preserved; as a result, almost everything that is known about them relates to their persecution. The repression lasted through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Industrial Revolution, with the prejudice fading only in the 19th and 20th centuries. Origin and etymology The origins of both the term \\"Cagots\\" (and \\"Agotes\\", \\"Capots\\", \\"Caqueux\\", etc.) and the Cagots themselves are uncertain. It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths, and that the name Cagot derives from caas (\\"dog\\") and \\"Goth\\". Yet in opposition to this etymology is the fact that the word \\"cagot\\" is first found in this form no earlier than the year 1542. Seventeenth century French historian Pierre de Marca, in his Histoire de B√©arn, propounds the reverse ‚Äì that the word signifies \\"hunters of the Goths\\", and that the Cagots were descendants of the Saracens, although this proposal was comprehensively refuted by the Abb√© Venuti as early as 1754.Hawkins, p.37 ;Medieval popular explanations: Another theory is that the Cagots were descendants of the Cathars, who had been persecuted for heresy in the Albigensian Crusade. A delegation by Cagots to Pope Leo X in 1514 made this claim, though the Cagots predate the Cathar heresy.Robb, p. 45 Perhaps this was a strategic move. In limpieza de sangre statutes such stains of heresy expired after four generations and if this was the cause of their marginalisation, it also gave grounds for their emancipation.Hawkins, p.36. One early mention of the Cagots is from 1288, when they appear to have been called Chretiens or Christianos. Thus, another theory is that the Cagots were early converts to Christianity, and that the hatred of their pagan neighbors continued after they also converted, merely for different reasons. Another possible explanation of their name Chretiens or Christianos is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as pauperes Christi, and that, whether Visigoths or not, these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it, such as psoriasis. Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins. However, early edicts apparently refer to lepers and Cagots as different categories of undesirables. By 1593 the distinction was explicit. The Parlement of Bordeaux repeated customary prohibitions against them but added when they are lepers, if there still are any, they must carry clicquettesHawkins, p.12. (rattles). In Bordeaux, where they were numerous, they were called ladres, close to the Catalan lladres and the Spanish ladr√≥n meaning robber or looter, similar to older, probably Celtic term bagaudae (or bagad), a possible origin of agote. The Welsh \\"lladron\\" (robbers) similarly bears a resemblance to the aforementioned terms The alleged physical appearance and ethnicity of the Cagots varied wildly from legends and stories; some local legends (especially those that held to the leper theory) indicated that Cagots had blonde hair and blue eyes, while those favoring the Arab descent story said that Cagots were considerably darker. One common trend was to claim that Cagots had no earlobes, or that one ear was longer than the other. (The same thing appears in popular culture in the novel of Salman Rushdie, Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights, as a characteristic of the Duniaz√°t.) Graham Robb finds most of the above theories unlikely: The Way of St. James; the anti-Cagot prejudice existed in northern Spain, Western France, and Southern France, roughly coinciding with the main routes. ;Collapsed carpentry guild: A modern hypothesis of interest is that the Cagots are the descendants of a fallen medieval guild of carpenters. This theory would explain the most salient thing Cagots throughout France and Spain have in common: That is, being restricted in their choice of trade. The red webbed-foot symbol Cagots were sometimes forced to wear might have been the guild's original emblem. There was a brief construction boom on the Way of St. James pilgrimage route in the 9th and 10th centuries; this could have brought the guild both power and suspicion. The collapse of their business would have left a scattered, yet cohesive group in the areas where Cagots are known.Robb, p. 46. ;Defeated Vikings: A last hypothesis proposes these men were descendants of the Vikings who had invaded Gascony in 840 and were defeated at Taller, near Dax, in 982. This would explain why the Cagots appear around 1000 in Gascony and Navarra ‚Äì the lands of the duke of Gascony and his wife Urraca, the queen of Pamplona, the victors of the battle. This would also explain why they were not allowed to own weapons and trade, why they excelled in woodworking, and why they hunted whales in Capbreton and Biarritz with Scandinavian techniques. To account for the physical differences, Sup√©ry explains that these seamen were protected by famous shipowners, the Templars who came in Aquitaine to develop transports to Saint James of Compostella. When the Templars had to leave France in 1307, their \\"commanderies\\" were given to the Hospitaliers, whose mission was to create \\"maladreries\\". The Hospitaliers' mission attracted all kinds of people, who mixed with the original blond and blue eyed Agots. The Scandinavian origin seems to be confirmed by Martin de Viscaya in 1621: \\"Around 412, a part of this people (Visigoths) invaded Aquitaine and Gascony and committed so many cruelties that the inhabitants of the country rebelled, united their forces and guided by the nobility succeeded in destroying or driving out the Goths, of whom only a few wretched people remained without being dangerous. These wretches, according to the author, were the first Agots and he affirms that it is a constant tradition in B√©arn and Lower Navarre\\". However, the Visigoths who were Christianized and romanized did not commit any exactions in Gascony: The region was entrusted to them by the Romans and their domination was peaceful. Moreover, the Visigoths were defeated by Clovis at the battle of Vouill√© in 507. Clovis was a pagan, foreign king. Martin of Vizcaya's description does not match the Visigothic occupation, but does fit the Viking one. Religion Holy water font for Cagots in Oloron cathedral, B√©arn Cagots were forced to use a side entrance to churches, often an intentionally low one to force Cagots to bow and remind them of their subservient status.International Humanist and Ethical Union ‚Äì \\"The Cagots of B√©arn: The Pariahs of France\\" Retrieved 9 July 2008. This practice, done for cultural rather than religious reasons, did not change even between Catholic and Huguenot areas. They had their own holy water fonts set aside for Cagots, and touching the normal font was strictly forbidden.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Holy Water Fonts\\" These restrictions were taken seriously; in the 18th century, a wealthy Cagot had his hand cut off and nailed to the church door for daring to touch the font reserved for \\"clean\\" citizens.Robb, p. 44. Cagots were expected to slip into churches quietly and congregate in the worst seats. They received the host in communion only at the end of a stick. Many Bretons believed that Cagots bled from their navel on Good Friday. An appeal by the Cagots to Pope Leo X in 1514 was successful, and he published a bull instructing that the Cagots be treated \\"with kindness, in the same way as the other believers.\\" Still, little changed, as most local authorities ignored the bull. Government The nominal though usually ineffective allies of the Cagots were the government, the educated, and the wealthy. It has been suggested that the odd patchwork of areas which recognized Cagots has more to do with which local governments tolerated the prejudice, and which allowed Cagots to be a normal part of society. In a study in 1683, doctors examined the Cagots and found them no different from normal citizens. Notably, they did not actually suffer from leprosy or any other disease that could clarify their exclusion from society. The Parliaments of Pau, Toulouse and Bordeaux were apprised of the situation, and money was allocated to improve the lot of the Cagots, but the populace and local authorities resisted. In 1709, the influential politician Juan de Goyeneche planned and constructed the manufacturing town of Nuevo Bazt√°n (after his native Baztan Valley in Navarre) near Madrid. He brought many Cagot settlers to Nuevo Bazt√°n, but after some years, many returned to Navarre, unhappy with their work conditions. During the French Revolution substantive steps were taken to end discrimination toward Cagots. Revolutionary authorities claimed that Cagots were no different from other citizens, and de jure discrimination generally came to an end. Still, local prejudice from the populace persisted, though the practice began to decline. During the Revolution, Cagots had stormed record offices and burned birth certificates in an attempt to conceal their heritage. These measures did not prove effective, as the local populace still remembered. Rhyming songs kept the names of Cagot families known. Modern status Today the Cagots no longer form a separate social class and have largely assimilated into the general population. Very little of Cagot culture still exists, as most descendants of Cagots have preferred not to be known as such. There was a distinct Cagot community in Navarre until the early 20th century, with the small northern village called Arizkun in Basque (or Arizcun in Spanish) being the last haven of this segregation, where the community was contained within the neighbourhood of Bozate. Because the main identifying mark of the Cagots was the restriction of their trades to a few small options, their segregation has been compared to the caste system in India.

United Kingdom labour law regulates the relations between workers, employers and trade unions.Northern Ireland has specific legislation and is excluded from two primary statutes, the ERA 1996 s 244 and Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 301, but has mostly analogous provisions and falls under most of the other Acts and Regulations. People at work in the UK benefit from a minimum charter of employment rights,See KW Wedderburn, The Worker and the Law (3rd edn Harmondsworth 1986) 6, referring to a \\"floor of rights\\", and Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41, [37] which are found in various Acts, Regulations, common law and equity. This includes the right to a minimum wage of ¬£8.21 for over 25-year-olds under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days paid holidays, breaks from work, and attempts to limit excessively long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the right to leave for child care, and the right to request flexible working patterns. The Pensions Act 2008 gives the right to be automatically enrolled in a basic occupational pension, whose funds must be protected according to the Pensions Act 1995. To get fair labour standards beyond the minimum, the most important right is to collectively participate in decisions about how an enterprise is managed. This works through collective bargaining, underpinned by the right to strike, and a growing set of rights of direct workplace participation. Workers must be able to vote for trustees of their occupational pensions under the Pensions Act 2004. In some enterprises, such as universities,See the Education Reform Act 1988 s 124A and Sch 7A, para 3 staff can vote for the directors of the organisation.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (2019) ch 11, 'Votes at work' In enterprises with over 50 staff, workers must be informed and consulted about major economic developments or difficulties.See the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004 This happens through a steadily increasing number of work councils, which usually must be requested by staff. However, the UK remains behind European standards in requiring all employees to have a vote for their company's board of directors, alongside private sector shareholders, or government authorities in the public sector.See the Companies Act 2006 ss 110 ff Collective bargaining, between democratically organised trade unions and the enterprise's management, has been seen as a \\"single channel\\" for individual workers to counteract the employer's abuse of power when it dismisses staff or fix the terms of work. Collective agreements are ultimately backed up by a trade union's right to strike: a fundamental requirement of democratic society in international law. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 strikes are basically lawful if they are \\"in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\". As well as having rights for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 requires that people are treated equally, unless there is a good justification, based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on fixed-term contracts are treated generally equally compared to full- time or permanent staff.Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000, Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 and Agency Workers Regulations 2010 To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, after two years they can only be dismissed for a fair reason, and are entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary.ERA 1996 ss 86, 94 and 135.

If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that employees' terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason.

Labour law in its modern form is primarily a creation of the last three decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the employment relationship, labour law has existed since people worked.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 1. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 1 In feudal England, the first significant labour laws followed the Black Death. Given the shortage of workers and consequent price rises the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 attempted to suppress sources of wage inflation by banning workers organisation, creating offences for any able-bodied person that did not work, and fixing wages at pre-plague levels. Ultimately this led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which was in turn suppressed and followed up with the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which banned workers from moving around the country. Yet conditions were improving as serfdom was breaking down. One sign was the beginning of the more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, that required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett,(1772) 20 State Tr 1 and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire.However, it was not until the Criminal Justice Act 1948 that penal servitude, forced labour for prisoners, was abolished. The turn into the 19th century coincided with the start of the massive boom in production. Gradually people's relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to contract whereby people were formally free to choose their work.See Henry James Sumner Maine, Ancient Law (1861) However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker's factual dependency on employers. As its height, the businesses and corporations of Britain's industrial revolution organised half the world's production across a third of the globe's surface and a quarter of its population. Joint Stock Companies, building railways, canals and factories, manufacturing household goods, connecting telegraphs, distributing coal, formed the backbone of the laissez faire model of commerce. Industrialisation also meant greater urbanisation, and inevitably miserable conditions in the factories. The Factory Acts dating from 1803 required minimum standards on hours and conditions of working children. But people were also attempting to organise more formally. Initially, trade unions were suppressed, particularly following the French Revolution of 1789 under the Combination Act 1799. The Master and Servant Act 1823 and subsequent updates stipulated that all workmen were subject to criminal penalties for disobedience, and calling for strikes was punished as an \\"aggravated\\" breach of contract. But then the position was slowly liberalised and through the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875 trade unions were legitimised.See also, the Royal Commission on Trade Unions (1867) Cmnd ???; Employers and Workmen Act 1875. Toward the turn of the 20th century, in Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co,[1892] AC 25 the House of Lords emphasised that businesses should be free to organise into trade associations in the same way that employees organised into unions. However, with growing unrest and industrial action the House of Lords changed its mind. At the turn of the 20th century the notorious judgment of Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants,[1901] AC 426 made unions liable in economic tort for the costs of industrial action. Although a combination of employers in a company could dismiss employees without notice, a combination of employees in a trade union were punished for withdrawing their labour. The case led trade unions to form a Labour Representation Committee, which then became the UK Labour Party, to lobby for the reversal of the law. After their landslide victory in the 1906 general election, the Liberals, among whom David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were rising stars, embarked on significant welfare reforms. These included the Trade Disputes Act 1906, which laid down the essential principle of collective labour law that any strike \\"in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\" is immune from civil law sanctions. The Old Age Pensions Act 1908 provided pensions for retirees. The Trade Boards Act 1909 created industrial panels to fix minimum wages and the National Insurance Act 1911 levied a fee to insure people got benefits in the event of unemployment. Amid mass demonstrations across Germany, in 1919 the Versailles Treaty was signed. Part XIII established the International Labour Organization, recalling (in stark contrast to the other treaty's termsSee JM Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919)) that \\"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\\".Versailles Treaty, Part XIII During World War One the brutality of the Western Front demanded the participation of every available person and resource. As women took over traditional \\"men's jobs\\" the Suffragette movement gained momentum. Before the war's conclusion, the Representation of the People Act 1918 gave universal suffrage to men over age 21 and women over 30 if they had property. A new beginning was promised by the victors to their people. The Versailles Treaty created the International Labour Organization to draw up common standards between countries, for as it said, \\"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\\", and echoed the US Clayton Act 1914 in pronouncing that \\"labour should not be regarded merely as a commodity or an article of commerce\\".Versailles Treaty 1919, Part XIII and Art 427 But the international system remained disjointed as the United States Congress withheld its approval to join the League of Nations. Within the UK the postwar settlement was to make a home fit for heroes. Whitley Councils extended the Trade Boards Act 1909 system to Joint Industrial Councils that encouraged (non-legally binding) fair wage agreements,The Whitley Report was published by the Ministry of Reconstruction, see Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed, Final Report (1918) Cmnd 9153; see also, Whitley Committee, Interim Report on Joint Standing Industrial Councils (1917) Cmnd 8606 while the Ministry of Labour actively organised and advised the growth of trade unions.See KD Ewing, 'The State and Industrial Relations: 'Collective Laissez-Faire' Revisited' (1998) 5 Historical Studies in Industrial Relations 1. This was based on a theory of collective bargaining, agreement or action, advocated by Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb in Industrial Democracy to remedy the inequality of bargaining power of workers.S Webb and B Webb, Industrial Democracy (Longmans 1902) Without legal force behind collective agreements, the law remained in a state of collective laissez faire, encouraging voluntarism for agreement and dispute settlement between industrial partners. The 1920s and 1930s were economically volatile. In 1926 a General Strike against coal miners' pay cuts paralysed the country, though was broken by Winston Churchill, by then the Chancellor of the Exchequer under a Conservative government. The Labour Party had formed Parliamentary majorities in 1924 and 1929, but achieved little in the way of reform, particularly after the onset of the Great Depression. By the Second World War and the Labour government of Clement Attlee, trade union membership was well established and collective agreements covered over 80 per cent of the workforce. With the British Empire in rapid dissolution, immigration from Commonwealth countries, and record levels of female workplace participation the composition of Britain's workforce was changing. Though the common law was sometimes comparatively progressive,See Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd [1944] KB 693. sometimes not,See Nairn v The University Court of the University of St Andrews (1907) 15 SLT 471, 473, per Lord McLaren, it was \\"a principle of the unwritten constitutional law of this country that men only were entitled to take part in the election of representatives to Parliament.\\" the first statutes to prohibit discrimination focused on gender and race emerged in the 1960s as the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States. Discrimination in employment (as in consumer or public service access) was formally prohibited on grounds of race in 1965,See the Race Relations Act 1965, RRA 1968 and RRA 1976; Charter v Race Relations Board [1973] AC 868, 889, Lord Morris says \\"a new guiding principle of fundamental and far-reaching importance... In the terms decreed by Parliament, but subject to the exceptions permitted by Parliament, discrimination against a person of colour, race or ethnic or national origins has become unlawful by the law of England.\\" gender in 1975, disability in 1995, sexual orientation and religion in 2003 and age in 2006.See the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Disability Discrimination Act 1995, Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. A complicated and inconsistent jamboree of Acts and statutory instruments was placed into a comprehensive code in the Equality Act 2010. This was backed by European Union law, which the UK acceded to with the European Communities Act 1972. Although labour laws in the early European Treaties were minimal,With the notable exception of the leading case, Defrenne v Sabena (No 2) [1976] ECR 455 (C-43/75) the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty brought employment rights squarely into EU law. Meanwhile, starting from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, workers gained a growing list of minimum statutory rights, such as the right to reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment.See also Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. Labour governments through the 1960s and 1970s were troubled by reform of the unwieldy trade union system. Despite producing reports such as In Place of Strife and the Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracyAlan Bullock, Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy (1977) Cmnd 6706 which would have codified union governance, and created more direct workplace participation, reform did not take place. The UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) was a bitter confrontation between the Thatcher government and coal mine workers, which has left resentment till today. From 1979, a new Conservative government began dismantling most labour rights. During the 1980s ten major Acts gradually reduced the autonomy of trade unions and the legality of industrial action.Employment Act 1980 (trade union right to government funds for ballots, narrowed picketing immunity, reduced secondary action immunity, unions right to expel members limited), Employment Act 1982 (narrowed \\"trade dispute\\" definition), Trade Union Act 1984 (secret ballots for union elections and strikes), Public Order Act 1986 (set out offences related to picketing, and increased police power over groups of over 20 people), Wages Act 1986 (deregulated restrictions on employers fining and deducting money from employees' pay, removed statutory holiday entitlement, reduced state funding for redundancies), Employment Act 1988 (worker's right to not join a union, trade union member's right to challenge strike ballots), Employment Act 1989 (restricted trade union officials' time off for duties, abolished the Training Commission, abolished government support for redundancy payments), Employment Act 1990 (removing closed shop and secondary action protection), Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (consolidated legislation hitherto), Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 (trade union duty to inform employers of upcoming strikes) Reforms to the internal structure of unions mandated that representatives be elected and a ballot is taken before a strike, that no worker could strike in sympathetic secondary action with workers with a different employer, and that employers could not run a closed shop system of requiring all workers to join the recognised union. The wage councils were dismantled. A public campaign against the merits of unions paralleled the decline of membership and collective agreement coverage to under 40 per cent. In addition, the government opted out of the EU Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1997 the new Labour government brought the UK into the EU's Social Chapter, which has served as the source for most reform in UK law since that time. Domestic led reform was minimal. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 established a country-wide minimum wage, but did not attempt to reinvigorate the Wage Board system. The Employment Relations Act 1999 introduced a 60-page procedure requiring employers to compulsorily recognise and bargain with a union holding support among workers, though union membership remained at a level steadily declining below 30 per cent. Most advances in labour rights since 1997 came through EU law, such as paid holidays, information and consultation, or spreading equality. Since 2010, the coalition government continued a programme of labour rights by requiring people take zero hour contracts to get unemployment insurance, and frustrating the right to strike in the Trade Union Act 2016. This has led to consistently rising inequality since 1979, and to large increases in child poverty since 2010. Employment rights and duties All UK workers enjoy a minimal charter of employment rights,Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41 but compared to the EU average have longer working hours, more unequal pay, less time off for child care, and are less likely to have an occupational pension. UK labour law's main concerns are to ensure that every working person has a minimum charter of rights in their workplace, and voice at work to get fair standards beyond the minimum.Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41 It distinguishes self-employed people, who are free to contract for any terms they wish, and employees, whose employers are responsible for complying with labour laws. UK courts and statutes also, however, give more or fewer rights to different groups including \\"worker\\", \\"jobholder\\", \\"apprentice\\" or someone with an \\"employment relation\\". A \\"worker\\", for example, is entitled to a minimum wage (¬£8.21 per hour in 2019),https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum- wage-rates 28 statutory minimum days of paid holiday, enrolment in a pension plan, a safe system of work, and the right to equal treatment that also applies to consumers and public service users.National Minimum Wage Act 1998 s 54; WTR 1998 regs 13‚Äì14; Pensions Act 2008 s 3; Equality Act 2010 An \\"employee\\" has all those rights, and also the right to a written contract of employment, time off for pregnancy or child care, reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment, and the duty to contribute to the National Insurance fund and pay income tax.Health and Safety at Work Act 1975 s 2; Employment Rights Act 1996 ss 1, 71‚Äì80I, 86, 94 and 135; Social Security Benefits and Contributions Act 1992 ss 1‚Äì2 The scope of the terms \\"worker\\", \\"employee\\", and others, are more or less left to the courts to construe according to the context of its use in a statute,See particularly Employment Rights Act 1996 s 230 but someone is essentially entitled to more rights if they are in a weaker position and thus lack bargaining power. English courts view an employment contract as involving a relation of mutual trust and confidence,Malik v BCCI SA [1997] UKHL 23 which allows them to develop and enlarge the remedies available for workers and employers alike when one side acts out of bad faith. =Scope of protection= The UK has not yet codified a single definition of who is protected by labour rights. The law has two main definitions (employee and worker) and three minor definitions (jobholder, apprentice, and an \\"employment relation\\") each with different rights.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 3. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 3 EU law does have one consolidated definition of a 'worker': someone who has a contract for work in return for a wage, or an indirect quid pro quo (as in a communal cooperative), and also stands as the more vulnerable party to the contract.Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-W√ºrttemberg (1986) Case 66/85, [1986] ECR 2121; Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie (1988) Case 196/87, [1988] ECR 6159; Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz eV (2005) C-397/01, [2005] IRLR 137 This reflects the kernel of classical labour law theory, that an employment contract is one infused with \\"inequality of bargaining power\\",See S Webb and B Webb, Industrial Democracy (1897) and O Kahn-Freund, Labour and the Law (Hamlyn Lectures 1972) and stands as a justification for mandating additional terms to what might otherwise be agreed under a system of total freedom of contract. Sidney and Beatrice Webb, in their book Industrial Democracy argued that because workers' inequality of bargaining power meant they could not contract for it themselves, law should create a \\"national minimum\\" of workplace rights, with trade unions to secure a living wage. First, an \\"employee\\" has all main rights, including job security, retirement, child care, and the right to equal treatment. Most people are employees, although this has not yet been fully defined in the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230. Instead, Parliament left it to the courts to decide what \\"employee\\" with a \\"contract of service\\" meant, although the government can explicitly put people into the \\"employee\\" category.Employment Rights Act 1999 s 23 The classical common law test was that an employee was subject to the employer's 'control'.Yewens v Noakes (1880) 6 QBD 530; R v Negus (1873) LR 2 CP 34 But in the 20th century, more people worked outside factories where they had greater autonomy in performing their jobs. New tests were used, such as whether an employee was \\"integrated\\" into the workplace, or wore the \\"badge\\" of the organisation.Cassidy v Minister of Health [1951] 2 KB 343, Stevenson, Jordan & Harrison v MacDonald & Evans [1952] 1 TLR 101, Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart NV v Slatford [1953] 1 QB 248, 295, Denning LJ: \\"It depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.\\" Most importantly, because employers paid National Insurance contributions for their employees, the tax authorities had a central role in enforcing the proper distinction.See National Insurance Act 1946 s 1(2) Courts focused on \\"economic reality\\", and form over substance.Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister for Pensions and National Insurance [1968] 2 QB 497, 515, per MacKenna J It could also be relevant (but not decisive) if employees owned their tools, if they had the chance of profit, or bore the risk of loss.Montreal v Montreal Locomotive Works [1947] 1 DLR 161, 169, per Lord Wright But in the late 1970s and 1980s, some courts introduced a new test of \\"mutuality of obligation\\". The dominant view of this, now approved by the UK Supreme Court,Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2011] UKSC 41, [19] approving Nethermere and [37], quoting para [38] of Foxwell J, referring to \\"mutual obligations, namely the provision of work in return for money ...\\" was merely that employees only needed to exchange work for a wage: this was the \\"irreducible core\\" of an employment contract.Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner [1984] IRLR 240, Dacas v Brook Street Bureau (UK) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 217 But a rival view stated that the employment relationship had to be one where there was an ongoing obligation to offer and accept work.O‚ÄôKelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [1983] ICR 730, [1983] IRLR 369 and James v Greenwich LBC. This appeared to misinterpret M Freedland, The Contract of Employment (1976) 21‚Äì22, first in Airfix Footwear Ltd v Cope [1978] ICR 1210 This led to cases where employers, who hired people on a casual basis, low wages, and with little bargaining power, argued they owed no duties to their staff, because they had neither side had assumed any such obligation. However, the leading case, Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher decided by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2011, adopted the view that mutuality of obligation is the consideration of work for a wage.Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2011] UKSC 41, [17] approving Nethermere and [37] endorsing the consideration view. Lord Clarke held that an exchange of work for a wage was essential, but that employment contracts could not be treated like commercial agreements.Following Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2001] IRLR 279, [20] Lord Steyn, \\"It is no longer right to equate a contract of employment with commercial contracts. One possible way of describing a contract of employment in modern terms is as a relational contract.\\" As he put it,[2011] UKSC 41, [35] This meant that a group of car valeters, although their contracts said they were self-employed, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation.cf Massey v Crown Life Insurance Company [1977] EWCA Civ 12 The second major category is of a 'worker'. This is defined in Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or someone who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This means all employees are workers, but not all workers are employees. Non-employee workers are entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, anti-discrimination rights, and trade union rights, but not job security, child care, and employers do not make National Insurance contributions for them. The Supreme Court has held that this category contains quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm,Clyde & Co LLP v Bates van Winkelhof [2014] UKSC 32 and high- earning plumbers.Pimlico Plumbers Ltd v Smith [2018] UKSC 29 However, staff who are employed through an agency, will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests. =Contract of employment= Once a person's work contract is categorised, the courts have specific rules to decide, beyond the statutory minimum charter of rights, what are its terms and conditions.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 4-5. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 4 Just like ordinary contract law there are rules on incorporation, implied terms and unjust factors.On the illegality principle, see Hounga v Allen [2014] UKSC 47 However, in Gisda Cyf v Barratt, Lord Kerr emphasised that if it affects statutory rights, the way courts construe a contract must be \\"intellectually segregated\\" from the general law of contract, because of the employee's relation of dependency.Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41, [39] In this case, Ms Barratt was told her employment was terminated in a letter that she opened 3 days after its arrival. She claimed her dismissal was unfair within three months (the time limit to bring claims in Tribunals) after reading the letter, but the employer argued it was barred because in commercial contract cases, one is bound by a notice as soon as it arrives in business hours. The Supreme Court held that Ms Barratt could claim: she was only bound by the notice when she actually read it. The purpose of employment law to protect the employee, and so the rules must be construed to uphold employees' rights. Every employee is entitled to a written statement of their employment contract,Employment Rights Act 1996 s. 1 which will usually incorporate the workplace collective agreement, and must follow, or be better than, the minimum statutory rights. Everything an employee is promised or agrees to becomes a term of the contract, so long as this does not contradict statutory labour rights. In addition, terms can be incorporated by reasonable notice, for instance by referring to a staff handbook in a written employment agreement,e.g. French v Barclays Bank plc [1998] IRLR 646 or even in a document in a filing cabinet next to the staff handbook.Harlow v Artemis International Corp Ltd [2008] EWHC 1126 (QB), [2008] IRLR 629 While without express wording they are presumed not binding between the union and employer,Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 179 a collective agreement may give rise to individual rights. The test applied by the courts is to ask loosely whether its terms are 'apt' for incorporation, and not statements of 'policy' or 'aspiration'. Where the collective agreement's words are clear, a \\"last in, first out\\" rule was held in one case to potentially qualify, but in another case a clause purporting to censure compulsory redundancies was held to be binding 'in honour' only.Contrast Alexander and Wall v Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd (No 2) [1991] IRLR 287 and Kaur v MG Rover Group Ltd [2004] EWCA 1507 As well as statutory rights, expressly agreed terms, and incorporated terms, the employment relation contains standardised implied terms, on top of the individualised implied terms that courts always construe to reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties.See Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10. Standardised terms are also called \\"terms implied in law\\" and individualised implied terms are also called \\"terms implied in fact\\". First, the courts have long held that employees are owed additional and beneficial obligations, such as a safe system of work,Wilsons and Clyde Coal Ltd v English [1938] AC 57 and Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority [1991] 2 All ER 293 and payment of wages even when the employer has no work to offer.Devonald v Rosser & Sons [1906] 2 KB 728 The House of Lords held employers have a duty to inform their employees of their workplace pension rights,Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1992] 1 AC 294 although a lower court stopped short of requiring employers to give advice on qualifying for workplace disability benefits.Crossley v Faithful & Gould Holdings Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 293 The key implied term is the duty of good faith, or \\"mutual trust and confidence\\". This is applied in many circumstances. Examples include requiring that employers do not act in an authoritarian manner,Wilson v Racher [1974] ICR 428 do not call employees names behind their back,The Post Office v Roberts [1980] IRLR 347 do not treat workers unequally when upgrading pay,Transco plc v O'Brien [2002] EWCA Civ 379 do not run the company as a front for international crime,Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA [1998] AC 20 or do not exercise discretion to award a bonus capriciously.Mallone v BPB Industries plc [2002] EWCA Civ 126 There has been disagreement among judges about the extent to which the core implied term of mutual trust and confidence can be 'contracted out of', with the House of Lords having held that the parties may when they are \\"free\\" to do so, while others approach the question as a matter of construction of the agreement which is within exclusive judicial competence to define.Contrast Lord Steyn in Mahmud and Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA [1998] AC 20 and Lord Browne-Wilkinson VC in Johnstone v Bloomsbury Health Authority [1991] 2 All ER 293 The second, and older, hallmark of the employment contract is that employees are bound to follow their employers' instructions while at work, so long as that does not contravene statute or agreed terms. Employments relation give the employer discretion in limited fields. This used to be called the 'master‚Äìservant' relationship. The employer has some ability to vary the way work is done in accordance with business needs,e.g. Cresswell v Board of Inland Revenue [1984] ICR 508 so long as it does not contradict a contract's express terms, which always require an employee's consent,Rigby v Ferodo Ltd [1988] ICR 29 or a collective agreement.Robertson v British Gas Corp [1983] ICR 351 The status of 'flexibility clauses', purporting to allow employers the discretion to vary any contract term, has been contested, as it will often enable abuse of power that the common law controls.See Bateman v Asda Stores Ltd [2010] IRLR 370, per Silber J, but contrast Department for Transport v Sparks [2016] EWCA Civ 360 and Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2002] AC 408 The limits of the courts' tolerance for such practices are evident if they touch procedures for accessing justice,Wandsworth London Borough Council v D‚ÄôSilva [1998] IRLR 193 or potentially if they would contravene the duty of mutual trust and confidence. =Health and safety= Every employer must provide a \\"safe system of work\\". In the industrial revolution from 1802 the Factories Acts required workplaces to be cleaner, ventilated, with machinery fenced. The Acts restricted child labour and limited the working day. They targeted mines, or textile mills, before the Factories Act 1961 spread to all \\"factories\\": where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered.Factories Act 1961 The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because individual employees tend not to litigate, to ensure enforcement, there are inspectors under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities. Inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. HSWA 1974 section 2 also foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Health and safety regulations remain in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.Health and Safety Directive 89/391/EEC Nye Bevan, Minister of Health when the NHS was founded. The most important protection for people's health has been the National Health Service (NHS), founded by the National Health Service Act 1946.Before this, the National Insurance Act 1911, Part I created an employer-dependent system of health care, rather than a universal system. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to health care in the UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, to statutory sick pay.Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 ss. 151; Gisda Cyf v Barratt 155 People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress.See Franklin v South Eastern Railway (1858) 3 H&N; 211 and Fatal Accidents Act 1976 Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the \\"course of employment\\" whenever their actions have a \\"close connection\\" to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules.See Turberville v Stampe (1697) 91 ER 1072 and Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22, [2002] 1 AC 215 An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a \\"frolic of his own\\", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not sue their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud.See Morris v Ford Motor Co Ltd [1973] QB 792, 799 and Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] UKHL 17 Until the mid-20th century there was an \\"unholy trinity\\" of defences: common employment,The employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff, e.g. Priestly v Fowler (1837) 3 Mees & Wels 1, abolished in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English [1938] AC 57, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were \\"fundamental obligations of a contract of employment ... for which employers are absolutely responsible\\". volenti non-fit injuria,This meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment, e.g. Woodley v Metropolitan District Railway Co (1877) 2 Ex D 384, overturned in Smith v Baker [1891] AC 325 and Bowater v Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Rowley Regis [1944] KB 476. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, as in ICI Ltd v Shatwell [1965] AC 656 where an experienced quarry shotfirer said he \\"could not be bothered\\" to wait 10 minutes before setting off a detonation, and blew up his brother. and contributory negligence.Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. See Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 s 1 These are gone, but a fourth defence taken advantage of by employers is ex turpi causa non-oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore, and so was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.[2002] EWCA Civ 1821 19th century regulations limited child labour and working time in factories and mines, but employers were not always liable for accidents until 1937. Tort law remains relevant when there is scientific uncertainty about an injury's cause. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed at a number of companies where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one, and some may be insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd,[2002] UKHL 22. See also McGhee v National Coal Board [1972] 3 All ER 1008 the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers.[2006] UKHL 20 Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in Chandler v Cape plc that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders may not be able to hide behind the corporate veil to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.[2012] EWCA Civ 525 =Wages and tax= Since 1998, the United Kingdom has fixed a national minimum wage,There are also proposals circulating moving towards setting principles resembling a \\"maximum wage\\"; see Financial Services Authority pay code. E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 6. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 4 but collective bargaining is the main mechanism to achieve \\"a fair day's wage for a fair day's work\\". The Truck Acts were the earliest wage regulations,Following the Peasants' Revolt, the Statute of Labourers fixed wages for the benefit of employers and feudal landlords. requiring workmen to be paid in money, and not kind. Today, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 stipulates that employers can only dock employees' wages (e.g. for destroying stock) if the employee has consented to deductions in writing. This, however, does not cover industrial action,Employment Rights Act 1996 s 14 so following 18th century common law on part performance of work, employees who refused to 3 out of 37 hours a week in minor workplace disobedience had their pay cut for the full 37.Miles v Wakefield Metropolitan District Council [1987] UKHL 15, [1987] AC 539.

From the Trade Boards Act 1909,See also S Webb, 'The Economic Theory of a Legal Minimum Wage' (1912) 20(10) Journal of Political Economy 973-998 the UK had set minimum wages according to the specific needs of different sectors of work. This eroded from 1986, and then repealed in 1993.See Trade Union Reform and Employment Relations Act 1993 One wages council that survived was the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. It was abolished in England in October 2013, though boards still operate for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill - Reference by the Attorney General for England and Wales [2014] UKSC 43, holding the Welsh government could keep a wages board Modern economic theory suggests a reasonable minimum wage will raise productivity, equality and employment because labour markets are persistently monopsonistic, and people on lower incomes spend more money, stimulating effective aggregate demand for goods and services.e.g. DE Card and AB Krueger, Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage (1995) and S Machin and A Manning, \\"Minimum wages and economic outcomes in Europe\\" (1997) 41 European Economic Review 733 To bring the UK back into compliance with international law,See Universal Declaration of Human Rights art 23(3), European Social Charter 1961 art 4, ILO Minimum Wage Fixing Convention No 131 (1970), European Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights 1989 art 5 the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. Every worker\\" who personally performs work, but not for a client or customer,NMWA 1998 ss 1 and 54(3). Workers do not need to show \\"mutuality of obligation\\": James v Redcats (Brands) Ltd [2007] IRLR 296 (EAT). NMWA 1998 s 34 expressly including agency workers, though National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 reg 12 excludes au pairs and family members in family business and reg 26 allows adults in the first 26 weeks of accredited training to be paid at a lower rate. However, it was held that a pupil barrister did not count as a worker.Edmonds v Lawson [2000] QB 501, saying a pupil did not work but merely had to be \\"conscientious in receiving instruction\\". The minimum wage rate is revised annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, but since 2010 has been cut for under 25-year olds and young people doing apprenticeships.On 1 October 2014 the minimum wage was ¬£6.50 for over-21-year-olds, ¬£5.13 for 18- to 20-year-olds, and ¬£3.79 for under-18-year-olds finished with compulsory education. There was no separate category for 21 to 25-year olds. Since 2010, the minimum was cut for \\"apprentices\\", and stood in 2014 at ¬£2.73. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 state that for people who are not paid by the hour, total pay is divided by the hours actually worked over an average \\"pay reference period\\" of one month.National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 SI 2015/621 Workers who are \\"on call\\" have to be paid when they are on call.McCartney v Oversley House Management [2006] IRLR 514 (EAT) But if a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid.See Scottbridge Construction Ltd v Wright [2002] ScotCS 285, but then National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 say that a worker given suitable sleeping facilities is not doing work when not awake for the purpose of working. However, an employer may agree with a worker what the hours worked actually are, if hours are ordinarily be unmeasured. In Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had to be on call 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities, such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her ¬£31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage.[2003] EWCA Civ 199, [2003] IRLR 469 Deductions up to ¬£6 per day can be made for accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged.See National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 and Leisure Employment Services Ltd v HM Revenue & Customs [2007] EWCA Civ 92, [2007] ICR 1056. SI 2009/1902 reg 5 removed an exception for tips paid through the payroll previously found in National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 reg 31. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 claim for a shortfall of wages in a Tribunal.National Minimum Wage Act 1998 ss 17-18 A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for requesting records or complaining about it.National Minimum Wage Act 1998 ss 10 and 23-25 However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).National Minimum Wage Act 1998 ss 14, 19 and 20. See also the Employment Act 2008 A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.National Minimum Wage Act 1998 ss 11 and 21 The top rate of income tax was 80% to 100% from 1940 to 1980. As it fell, income inequality has risen in the UK. Unlike the rules for Value Added Tax Act 1994, where consumers must see the prices they actually pay after tax,See the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (CAP Code) rule 3.18 there is currently no requirement for workers to see the final wages they will actually earn after income tax, and National Insurance contributions. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, as amended each year by the Finance Acts, in 2019 the 'personal allowance' with 0% was up to ¬£12,500 in income, a 'basic rate' of 20% tax was paid on ¬£12,500 to ¬£50,000, a higher rate was 40% on income over ¬£50,000, and a top rate of 45% over ¬£150,000. The top rate of income tax has been dramatically cut since 1979,See the History of tax in the UK, dating back to the Income Tax Act 1803 to fund the Napoleonic Wars, repealed and then reintroduced by Robert Peel in the Income Tax Act 1842. See also the Beveridge Report, Social Insurance and Allied Services (1942) Cmd 6404 while taxation for the richest people, who receive most money through capital gains,The Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, requires higher or additional rate payers to pay 28% tax on gains from residential property, and 20% on gains from other assets, when selling, or transferring the property. dividends,Income Tax Act 2007 s 8 make the tax on dividends in 2019 for basic rate payers 7.5%, for higher rate payers 32.5%, and for additional rate payers 38.1%. or corporate profits has been cut even further.Corporation Tax Act 2010 sets a main rate of tax at 19%. People will be classified as liable to pay income tax whether or not they work through a company.See the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 ss 48-61 and the leaflet IR35 on disguised employment. Also HMRC v PA Holdings [2011] EWCA Civ 1414. From 2015 to 2019, the \\"personal allowance\\" was linked to the minimum wage, but only up to 30 hours a week of pay (as if people usually had a three-day weekend).See the Income Tax Act 2007 s 57A, repealed by the Finance Act 2019 s 5(4). See also European Social Charter 1966 s 2(1) on progressive reduction of the working week. This link was cut, and there is no personal allowance for National Insurance contributions, which fund the state pension, unemployment insurance (now partly the universal credit), and the insolvency fund. While self- employed people generally pay the same income tax (albeit with more exemptions and deductionsSee the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. These can be made for employees through the tax return, including P35 form filled out by employers for the employees' tax. In the PAYE series, a P60 form from employers proves tax was paid at the end of the year, a P45 form is for when employment ceases recording tax up to the end of employment. P11D is a form for employers to disclose expenses and benefits given to employees earning over ¬£8500 that do not go through the payroll. Each person has an individual tax code. Similar abbreviations for forms are used for self-assessment and tax credits, e.g. S100 and TC600.) they pay 9% in National Insurance contributions, while an employee pays 12%. In addition, the employee's employer makes a standard 13.8% contribution, while the \\"self-employed\\" person has no employer to make such a contribution. These disparities give a large incentive for employers to misrepresent true employment status with \\"sham self-employment\\".See AL Bogg, 'Sham self-employment in the Supreme Court' (2012) 41 ILJ 328, Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2012] UKSC 41, and E McGaughey, 'Uber, the Taylor Review, Mutuality and the Duty Not to Misrepresent Employment Status' (2019) 48(2) ILJ 280 =Working time and child care= The UK has no explicit statute for minimum hours, although zero hours contracts have been used increasingly since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Since Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2011] UKSC 41, zero hours clauses have been held to be ineffective, so that workers are legally entitled to a reasonable amount of work according to their usual patterns.See Devonald v Rosser & Sons [1906] 2 KB 728, Pulse Healthcare Ltd v Carewatch Care Services Ltd (2012) UKEAT/0123/12/BA, and Borrer v Cardinal Security Ltd [2013] UKEAT 0416_12_1607. See also E. McGaughey, \\"Are Zero Hours Contracts Lawful?\\" (2014) SSRN However, individual workers find common law rights difficult to enforce. The Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Working Time Directive give every worker the right to paid holidays, breaks and the right to a weekend.2003/88/EC, replacing 93/104/EC. E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 7. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 4 Following international law,See Universal Declaration of Human Rights art 24, \\"Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.\\" Also, ILO Holidays with Pay Convention (Revised), 1970 C132 every worker must have at least 28 days, or four full weeks in paid holidays each year (including public holidays).Working Time Directive 2003 art 7 and Working Time Regulations 1998 regs 13-16. SI 2007/2079 reg 2 updated the period to 28 days, expressed often as 5.6 weeks, if one takes \\"week\\" to mean a five-day working week. There is no qualifying period for this, or any other working time right,See R (BECTU) v DTI (2001) C-173/99, [2001] 3 CMLR 7, ruling that the UK's initial 13-week qualifying period was \\"manifestly incompatible\\" with the Directive. because the law seeks to ensure both a balance between work and life, and that people have enough rest and leisure to promote better physical and psychological health and safety.Accordingly, the Working Time Directive 2003 was passed under the authority of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union art 153(1)(a). Because the purpose is for workers to have the genuine freedom to rest, employers may not give a worker \\"rolled up holiday pay\\", for instance an additional 12.5% in a wage bill, in lieu of taking actual holidays. However, if the worker has not used his or her holidays before the job terminates, the employer must give an additional payment for the unused holiday entitlement.See Caulfield v Marshalls Clay Products (2006) C-131/04, [2006] IRLR 386. It is also the case that a worker who is off work for a long term illness is still entitled to holiday pay, Stringer v HMRC and Schultz-Hoff v Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund [2009] UKHL 31, [2009] IRLR 214, also, C-520/06 and C-350/06. Where a person works at night, he or she may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is classified as \\"hazardous\\".Working Time Directive 2003 arts. 8-13 and Working Time Regulations 1998 rr. 2-7 Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6-hour period.Commission v United Kingdom (2006) C-484/04, [2006] IRLR 888 held the employer is under an obligation to ensure the breaks are actually observed. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the current maximum is 48 hours, averaged over 17 weeks,Working Time Regulations 1998 r 4(3)(b) but it does not apply to the self-employed or people who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the Court of Justice said the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs.(2005) C-397/01, [2005] IRLR 137, referring to workers being the \\"weaker party\\" to a contract. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers \\"opt out\\" of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form.Working Time Directive 2003 art 22, Working Time Regulations 1998 regs 4-5 Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose.See Fu√ü v Stadt Halle [2010] IRLR 1080, reducing pay after requesting to move to reduced hours is victimisation. \\"On call\\" time where people must be ready to work is working time.See SIMAP v Conselleria de Sanidad y Consumo de la Generalidad Valenciana (2000) C-303/98, [2000] ECR I-7963 The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar(2003) C-151/02, [2003] ECR I-08389 that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same \\"opt out\\" derogation as the UK, but limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, but it has taken a \\"light touch\\" approach to enforcement. UK employers are reimbursed by the government when employees take paid leave for child care.Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 s. 167 Possibly the most important time off during working life will be to care for newly born or adopted children.The right was secured in collective agreements, and then put into legislation for the first time by the Employment Protection Act 1975 ss 34-52. Better rights only came after 1999. However, unlike paid holidays or breaks that are available for \\"workers\\", child care rights are restricted to \\"employees\\". They are also less favourable for male parents, which exacerbates the gender pay gap as women take more time out of their careers than men.cf ACL Davies, Perspectives on Labour Law (2004) 111, minimal paternity leave has the \\"unfortunate side-effect of stereotyping women and perpetuating the view that childcare is their responsibility alone\\". Going beyond the minimum in the Pregnant Workers Directive,92/85/EEC the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 71 to 73 and the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 guarantee maternity leave for 52 weeks in total, but in four steps, paid and unpaid. First, women must take two weeks compulsory leave at the time of child birth.Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/3312) reg 8 Second, and covering the compulsory leave, there is a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90% of ordinary earnings. Third, there is a right to 33 weeks' leave at the statutory rate, or 90% of ordinary earnings if this is lower, which was ¬£138.18 per week in 2014.Boyle v Equal Opportunities Commission (1998) C-411/96, [1998] ECR I-6401, requires this to be at least the same level as statutory sick pay. The government reimburses employers for the costs according to the employer's size and national insurance contributions.Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 s 167 Fourth, the mother may take additional, but unpaid maternity leave for another 13 weeks.Employment Rights Act 1996 ss. 72-73 and Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 rr. 7-8 A contract of employment can always be, and if collectively bargained usually is, more generous. There is no qualifying period for the right to unpaid leave, but the mother must have worked for 26 weeks for the right to paid leave.Work and Families Act 2006 (c. 18) abolished the qualification period for ordinary and additional maternity leave. The mother must also tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Employees may not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks.Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 rr. 17-20 If parents adopt, then the rights to leave follow maternity rules for one primary carer.Employment Rights Act 1996 ss. 75A-D and Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 rr. 15-20 However, for fathers ordinarily, the position is less generous. The Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 entitle a father to 2 weeks leave, at the statutory rate of pay.Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 SI 2002/2788 r. 6. Employment Rights Act 1996 ss 80A-E. See also Statutory Paternity Pay and Statutory Adoption Pay (General) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2822) Both parents may also take \\"parental leave\\".Following the Parental Leave Directive 2010/18/EU, replacing 96/34/EC This means that, until a child turns 5, or a disabled child turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks unpaid leave.Employment Rights Act 1996 ss 76-80 and Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999 regs 13-15 Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days' notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted.Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 r. 16 and Sch. 2 Otherwise, employees have a right to suffer no detriment, nor be dismissed, and have the right to their previous jobs back.Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 rr. 17-20 To redress the imbalance between women and men bearing children, the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/1055) made it possible for the woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her maternity leave entitlements to her partner. This has not stopped the gender pay gap. Unlike the UK, Swedish parental leave is equally available to both parents, though men take around 24% of the leave.See \\"Gender Equality in Sweden\\" at sweden.se In further specific situations, there are a jumble of other rights to leave spread across the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 55 to 80I. \\"Emergency leave\\" is, under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 57A, available for employees to deal with birth or a child's issues at school, as well as other emergencies such as dependents' illness or death, so long as the employee informs the employer as soon as reasonably practicable. In Qua v John Ford Morrison Solicitors, Cox J emphasised that there is no requirement to deliver daily updates.[2003] IRLR 184 (EAT) After Employment Act 2002, employees gained the right to request flexible working patterns for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a disabled child under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in Employment Rights Act 1996 section 80F, and despite the fact that employers may decline the request, employers grant requests in 80% of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment,Employment Rights Act 1996 s 80H and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity. In Commotion Ltd v Rutty a toy warehouse assistant was refused a reduction to part-time work because, according to the manager, everyone needed to work full-time to maintain \\"team spirit\\". The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that because \\"team spirit\\" was not one of the legitimate grounds for refusal, Rutty should get compensation, which is set at a maximum of 8 weeks' pay.[2006] IRLR 171 (EAT). See Flexible Working (Eligibility, Complaints and Remedies) Regulations 2002 r. 7 (SI 2002/3236) Finally, the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 63D-I give employees (and agency workers are expressly included) the right to request the right to get time off for training.Inserted by the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 s 40 =Occupational pensions= There are three \\"pillars\\" of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity and a fair income in retirement.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 6(4) The first pillar is the state pension, administered by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or \\"personal pensions\\", which individuals buy themselves.See Pension Schemes Act 1993 s 1 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every \\"jobholder\\" (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between ¬£5,035 and ¬£33,540Pensions Act 2008 ss 1, 13 and 88(3)) the right to be automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out.Pensions Act 2008 ss 3 and 16 This is a simple \\"defined contribution\\" scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a \\"public option\\" competing with private asset managers.See Pensions Act 2008 Sch 1 Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who have not created a union and collectively bargained for an occupational pension.See I. Adams, \\"Fewer than half of Britons save for pension, says survey\\" (3 April 2010), The Guardian, p. 35 Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had \\"defined benefits\\": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings for the rest of their lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work.See further D Hayton, \\"Pension Trusts and Traditional Trusts: Drastically Different Species of Trusts\\" [2005] Conveyancer 229 Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship.Imperial Group Pension Trust v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 589 An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights.Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1992] 1 AC 294 Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements.Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz (1986) C-170/84, [1986] IRLR 317; Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group (1990) C-262/88, [1990] IRLR 240 The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or \\"member nominated trustees\\".Pensions Act 2004 ss. 241-242. Nomination can be through a direct vote or trade union appointment. These rules followed the Goode Report, Pension Law Reform (1993) Cm 2342 The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half.Pensions Act 2004 s. 243 Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences,See Harries v The Church Commissioners for England [1992] 1 WLR 1241 by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products. Every jobholder will from 2012 be automatically enrolled in an occupational pension, and can codetermine how their retirement savings are invested and their voice in company shares is used.See Pensions Act 2008 and Pensions Act 2004 ss 241-243 Because pension schemes save up significant amounts of money, which many people rely on in retirement, protection against an employer's insolvency, or dishonesty, or risks from the stock market were seen as necessary after the 1992 Robert Maxwell scandal.Goode Report, Pension Law Reform (1993) Cm 2342 Defined contribution funds must be administered separately, not subject to an employer's undue influence. The Insolvency Act 1986 also requires that outstanding pension contributions are a preferential over creditors, except those with fixed security.Insolvency Act 1986 ss. 175, 386 and Sch. 6 However, defined benefit schemes are also meant to insure everyone has a stable income regardless of whether they live a shorter or longer period after retirement.On the scope of regulation, see Houldsworth v Bridge Trustees Ltd [2011] UKSC 42 The Pensions Act 2004 sections 222 to 229 require that pension schemes have a minimum \\"statutory funding objective\\", with a statement of \\"funding principles\\", whose compliance is periodically evaluated by actuaries, and shortfalls are made up. The Pensions Regulator is the non-departmental body which is meant to oversee these standards, and compliance with trustee duties,Pensions Act 2004 ss 13-32 which cannot be excluded.Pensions Act 1995 s 33 However, in The Pensions Regulator v Lehman Brothers, the Supreme Court concluded that if the Pensions Regulator issued a \\"Financial Support Direction\\" to pay up funding, and it was not paid when a company had gone insolvent, this ranked like any other unsecured debt in insolvency, and did not have priority over banks that hold floating charges.[2013] UKSC 52 In addition, there exists a Pensions Ombudsman who may hear complaints and take informal action against employers who fall short of their statutory duties.Pension Schemes Act 1993, s. 163 If all else fails, the Pension Protection Fund guarantees a sum is ensured, up to a statutory maximum.Pensions Act 2004 ss. 173-174 and Sch. 7 =Civil liberties at work= *Human Rights Act 1998 ss. 3-6 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), right to privacy *Copland v United Kingdom [2007] ECHR 253, monitoring the calls and internet usage of an employee was a violation of the employee's right to private life and correspondence under ECHR article 8. A manager, after spying on the employee's telephone calls and internet use, subsequently insinuated and gossiped that the employee was in a personal affair with another employee. *Kopke v Germany [2010] ECHR 1725, that video surveillance of employees, after an employer had found money was going missing from the till, was a proportionate response to the legitimate aim of protecting property rights (and implicitly, general video surveillance without any reasonable suspicion of a wrongful act would be a violation). *Barbulescu v Romania [2016] ECHR 61, Pinto J dissenting, an employer was entitled to monitor use of a workplace messaging account, which it had explicitly prohibited employees using for personal reasons. *Halford v United Kingdom [1997] IRLR 471 *Smith and Grady v United Kingdom [1999] IRLR 734 *Kara v United Kingdom (1998) No. 36528/97 ECHR *Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000, an employer cannot check personal emails at all without the sender's consent, even from a work email account.

Workplace participation UK labour law's central goal since the Trade Disputes Act 1906 has been for people to vote in their workplace, like in Parliament,The Representation of the People Act 1918 implemented universal suffrage, but only with the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 did women have an equal voting age, and only with Representation of the People Act 1948 did voting become equal, regardless of university degree. to achieve \\"a fair day's wage for a fair day's work\\".See generally S Webb and B Webb, The History of Trade Unionism (1920)Appendix VIII This happens through staff organising unions, using legal participation rights, and collectively bargaining. While UK law creates a \\"charter of rights\\" at work, people need a voice in enterprise management to get fair wages and standards beyond the minimum.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) chs 8-11. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 7-11 In law, this means the right to vote for managers, or to vote on important issues such as pensions, and the right to collective bargaining. Trade unions are the main way that workers organise their own voice. Unions aim to improve their members' lives at work.cf Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 1 Unions are founded on contract, but members must have the right to elect the executive, not be excluded without good reason, and not be discriminated against by employers. Unions' main functions are organising and representing a workforce through statutory participation channels, collective bargaining, providing mutual assistance, and being a forum for social deliberation and activism. Collective agreements, which unions make with employers, usually aim to set fair scales of pay and working hours, require pensions, training and workplace facilities, and update standards as the enterprise changes. Trade union bargaining power rests, in the last resort, on collective action. To balance employer power to change the employment relation's terms, or dismiss staff,ERA 1996 ss 98 and 135 an official trade union has been protected by law in its right to strike.Morgan v Fry [1968] 2 QB 710, per Lord Denning MR Since the 1875,Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875 and Trade Disputes Act 1906 UK law has said collective action, including the right to strike, is lawful if it is \\"in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\".Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s 219 Since the 1980s, there have also been a number of requirements for balloting the workforce and warning the employer, suppression of sympathy strikes and picketing. In these respects UK law falls below international labour standards.See the ILO Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (1948) No 87 and ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 No 98 There are legal rights to information about workplace changes and consultation on redundancies, business restructuring and management generally. Finally, there are a small number of rights for direct participation in workplace and company affairs, particularly pension management. In some enterprises, such as universities, staff can vote for representatives on boards that manage the enterprise. =Trade unions= In principle, UK law guarantees trade unions and their members freedom of association.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 8. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 7 This means people can organise their affairs in the way they choose, a right reflected in the ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 and the European Convention on Human Rights, article 11.See also Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 arts 20 and 23, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 art 8 and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 art 22 Under the ECHR article 11, freedom of association can only be restricted by law as is \\"necessary in a democratic society\\". Traditional common law and equity was superficially similar, since unions form through contract, and the association's property is held on trust for its members according to the association's rules. However, before Parliament became democratic, unions were suppressed for allegedly being in \\"restraint of trade\\" and their actions (particularly strikes to improve conditions at work) could be regarded as criminal conspiracy.R v Journeymen-Taylors of Cambridge (1721) 8 Mod 10, 88 ER 9, Hilton v Eckersley (1855) 6 El & Bl 47 and Hornby v Close (1867) LR 2 QB 153. See further JV Orth, Combination and conspiracy: a legal history of trade unionism, 1721-1906 (1992) Nineteenth century reformers, who recognised that unions were democratic,See S Webb and B Webb, Industrial Democracy (1920) chs 1 and 2 gradually succeeded in guaranteeing unions' freedom of association. The Trade Union Act 1871 aimed to keep the courts away from unions' internal affairs, while the Trade Disputes Act 1906 finally confirmed the right of unions to take collective action, free from liability in tort, if it was \\"in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\". The basic philosophy of \\"legal abstention\\" from union organisation lasted until 1971 when the Conservative government attempted comprehensive regulation.Industrial Relations Act 1971 s 14 and Sch 4 This intervention was reversed by Labour in 1974,Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 but after 1979 unions became heavily regulated. Since 2013 Frances O'Grady has been the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, which is the umbrella grouping for British trade unions. Today union governance can be configured in any manner, so long as it complies with the compulsory standards set by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Before 1979, all unions had systems of elections and were democratic. In most the members elected union executives directly.KD Ewing and P Elias, Trade Union Democracy, Members' Rights and the Law (Mansell 1987) ch 5, 139-151 and R Undy and R Martin, Ballots and Trade Union Democracy (1984) 58-59, finding 63 of 101 unions with direct elections, or 61% of total membership. However, it was thought that indirect elections (e.g. where members voted for delegates, who elected executives in conference) made a minority of unions more \\"out of touch\\" and militant than was natural.Department of Employment, Democracy in Trade Unions (1983) Cm 8778, ch 2, 3 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, section 46, requires that members have direct voting rights for the executive, which cannot stay in office for more than five years. In addition, rules were passed (though there was little evidence of problems before) saying no candidate may be unreasonably excluded from an election, all voters are equal, and postal ballots must be available.Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 ss 47, 50-51 In practice, UK union elections are often competitive,For example, in 2007, 2010 and 2013 Jerry Hicks challenged the general secretary of Unite the Union, and only lost by small margins in the system of voting by postal ballots among members. although voter turnouts (without electronic voting) tend to be low. Minor procedural irregularities that would not affect outcomes do not undermine an election,Brown v Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers [1976] ICR 147 but otherwise a Certification Officer can hear complaints about malpractice, make inquiries, and issue enforcement orders, which can in turn be appealed to the High Court.Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 ss 55-56 For example, in Ecclestone v National Union of Journalists[1999] IRLR 166 Jake Ecclestone, who had been the Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists for 40 years, was dismissed by the executive. He attempted to run for election again, but the executive introduced a rule that candidates had to have the executive's \\"confidence\\". Smith J held the union had no express rule stating the executive could do this, nor could any be construed consistently with the democratic nature of the union's constitution. The executive's \\"new rule\\" was also contrary to TULRCA 1992 section 47, which prohibits unfair exclusions of candidates. Where statute is not explicit, standard principles of construction apply. There have been dissenting views, notably in Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union,[1971] 2 QB 175 over the extent to which principles of natural justice may override a union's express rules. However, the better view appears that construction of a union's rules consistently with statutory principles of democratic accountability do require that express rules are disapplied if they undermine the \\"reasonable expectations\\" of members.See Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10, [16] per Lord Hoffmann and Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2000] UKHL 39 In addition, \\"best practice\\" standards will be used to interpret union rules. In AB v CD, where the union's rules were silent on what would happen when an election was tied, the court referred to the Electoral Reform Society's guidance.[2001] IRLR 808 Beyond union governance through the vote and elections, members have five main statutory rights. First, although statute asserts that a union is \\"not a body corporate\\", in every practical sense it is: it can make contracts, commission torts, hold property, sue and be sued.TULRCA 1992 ss 10 and 12. It is doubtful that executives or employees are jointly liable without a specific assumption of responsibility: see Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] UKHL 17 The union's executives and officials carry out actions on its behalf, and their acts are attributed to it by ordinary principles of agency. However, if any union official acts ultra vires, beyond the union's powers, every member has a right to claim a remedy for the breach.Bennett v National Amalgamated Society of Operative House and Ship Painters and Decorators (1916) 85 LJ Ch 298. Despite older authority in Cotter v National Union of Seamen [1929] 2 Ch 58, the act will still probably be valid vis-a-vis third parties, since the union is liable 'to the same extent and in the same manner as if it were a body corporate' under TULRCA 1992 s 12 For example, in Edwards v Halliwell[1950] 2 All ER 1064 a decision of the executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders to increase membership fees was restrained, because the constitution required a two-thirds vote of members first.cf Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189, which suggests that if no express rule is broken (e.g. there is an allegation of mismanagement by union officials) there is a preference for exhausting a union's internal dispute or decision-making procedures before litigation. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 28 requires unions to keep accounts, giving a \\"true and fair\\" view of its financial affairs. Records are kept for six years, members have a right to inspect them, they are independently audited and overseen by the Certification Officer.TULRCA 1992 ss 29-45A Third, members have a right to not give contributions to the trade union's political fund, if there is one. Since the early success of the UK Labour Party in promoting working people's welfare through Parliament, both courts and Conservative governments attempted to suppress unions' political voice,See Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v Osborne [1910] AC 87 (political donations ultra vires), Trade Union Act 1913 reversed Osborne. Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 required union members opt into a political fund. Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946 changed the default, so there was a right to opt out, then regulated further by the Trade Union Act 1984. particularly compared to funding by employers through control of corporations.For this regulation, see Companies Act 2006 ss 366-368 and 378 which requires a shareholder resolution, itemising the money to be donated for any political contributions over ¬£5000 in 12 months, lasting a maximum of four years. In practice the board of directors controls this process. Most shareholder votes are controlled by wealthy individuals or asset managers. Under TULRCA 1992 sections 72, 73 and 82, a union must hold a separate fund for any \\"political object\\" (such as advertising, lobbying or donations), members must approve the fund by ballot at least every 10 years, and individual members have a right to opt-out of it (unlike shareholders in companies). Unions must also have political objects in the constitution.Paul v NALGO [1987] IRLR 413 In 2010, just 29 from 162 unions had political funds, though 57 per cent of members contributed. This generated ¬£22m.Certification Officer, Annual Report 2010-11 (2011) Consolidated statistics on corporate political spending, by contrast, are not available. British unions, in 2007, 2010 and 2013 Jerry Hicks challenged the general secretary of Unite the Union, and only lost by small margins in the system of voting by postal ballots among members. Fourth, members must be treated fairly if they are disciplined by a union, in accordance with judicially developed principles of natural justice. For example, in Roebuck v NUM (Yorkshire Area) No 2[1978] ICR 676 Templeman J held that it was unfair that Arthur Scargill was on the appeal panel for journalists being disciplined for appearing as witnesses against a libel action by Scargill himself. In another example, Esterman v NALGO[1974] ICR 625 held that Miss Esterman could not be disciplined for taking up an election counting job outside of her work, especially since the power of the union to restrain her was not clearly in its own rules. Fifth, members cannot be expelled from the union without a fair reason, set out in the statutory grounds under TULRCA 1992 section 174. This could include an expulsion under the Bridlington Principles, an agreement among unions to maintain solidarity and not attempt to \\"poach\\" each other's members.TUC, Disputes Principles and Procedures (2000) However, the legislation was amended after ASLEF v United Kingdom[2007] ECHR 184 to make clear that unions may exclude members whose beliefs or actions are opposed to the union's legitimate objectives. In ASLEF, a member named Lee was involved in the British National Party, a neo-fascist organisation committed to white supremacy, and Lee himself was involved in violence and intimidation against Muslim people and women. The European Court of Human Rights held that ASLEF was entitled to expel Lee because, so long as it did not abuse its organisational power or lead to individual hardship, \\"unions must remain free to decide in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union.\\"See also Cheall v APEX [1983] 2 AC 180, per Lord Diplock, 'freedom of association can only be mutual; there can be no right of an individual to associate with other individuals who are not willing to associate with him.' Lastly, union members also have the more dubious \\"right\\" to not strike in accordance with the decision of the executive.TULRCA 1992 ss 62-65 This precludes a union disciplining members who break solidarity,See Knowles v Fire Brigades Union [1997] ICR 595 and has been criticised by the International Labour Organization for undermining a union's effectiveness, in breach of core labour standards.ILO Committee of Experts, 'Individual Observation Concerning Convention 87' (1989) 'provisions which deprive trade unions of the capacity to give effect to their democratically determined rules are, prima facie, not in conformity with this right. [TULRCA 1992 ss 64-65 on the right 'not to strike'] clearly has this effect, and on that basis is not in conformity with Article 3.' It should 'be possible to discipline members who refuse to participate in lawful strikes...‚Äô =Collective bargaining= The right of workers to collectively bargain with employers for a \\"fair day's wage for a fair day's work\\" is regarded as a fundamental right in common law,Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1941] UKHL 2, [1942] AC 435 by the European Convention on Human Rights article 11,ECHR article 11 and Demir and Baykara v Turkey [2008] ECHR 1345 and in international law.ILO Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (1948) No 87 and ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 C98 Historically the UK had, however, left the procedure for making collective agreements, and their content, largely untouched by law.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 9. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 8-9 This began to change from 1971, though by contrast to other countries in the Commonwealth, Europe, or the United States the UK remains comparatively \\"voluntarist\\". In principle, it is always possible for an employer and a trade union to come voluntarily to any collective agreement. Employers and unions would usually aim to develop an annually updated wage scale for workers, fair and flexible working time, holidays and breaks, transparent and just procedures for hiring or dismissals, fair and jointly administered pensions, and a commitment to work together for the enterprise's success.See also Companies Act 2006 section 172. In 2010, around 32 per cent of the UK workforce was covered by a collective agreement, leaving around two- thirds of the British workforce with little influence over the terms of their work. Otto Kahn-Freund (1900‚Äì1979), was a Berlin Labour Court judge who was forced out in 1933, heavily influenced the idea of UK labour law as \\"collective laissez-faire\\".See KD Ewing, 'The State and Industrial Relations: 'Collective Laissez-Faire' Revisited' (1998) 5 Historical Studies in Industrial Relations 1 Traditionally, if workers organise a union, their last resort to get an employer to the bargaining table was to threaten collective action, including exercising their right to strike.TULRCA 1992 s 219 ff In addition, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 Schedule A1 contains a statutory procedure for workers to become recognised for collective bargaining.Introduced by the Employment Relations Act 1999 To use this procedure, first, a trade union must be certified as independent and the workplace must have a minimum of 21 workers.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, paras 6 and 7 Second, there must not already be a recognised trade union.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 35 This caused particular problems in R (National Union of Journalists) v Central Arbitration Committee[2005] EWCA Civ 1309 as the Court of Appeal held that a recognised union which lacked any significant support could block the bargaining claim of a union with support. Third, the union must identify an appropriate \\"bargaining unit\\" for a collective agreement, which a government body named the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC)See the Central Arbitration Committee website can verify and approve.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 11-19 On the union's proposal, the CAC must take into account whether the proposed bargaining unit is \\"compatible with effective management\\", as well as the employer's views and the characteristics of the workers.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 19B The CAC has broad discretion, and may only be challenged by an employer under the general principles of natural justice in administrative law.Fullarton Computer Industries Ltd v Central Arbitration Committee [2001] Scot CS 168 In R (Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd) v CAC[2002] EWCA Civ 512 the Court of Appeal found that the CAC's determination that the appropriate bargaining unit was all of Kwik Fit's workers within the M25 London ring road. The union's recommendation is the starting point and the CAC is entitled to prefer this over an employer's alternative, especially since the employer will often attempt to define a larger \\"unit\\" so as to limit the likelihood of union members holding greater majority support. Fourth, once the bargaining unit is defined, the CAC may be satisfied that there is majority support for the union to represent the workforce and will make a recognition declaration.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 22 Alternatively, fifth, it may determine that the position is less clear and that a secret ballot is in the interests of good industrial relations.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 22(4) Sixth, if a ballot takes place both the union and the employer should have access to employees, and be able to distribute their arguments, and threats, bribes or undue influence are forbidden.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 25 and 26 Seventh, when a vote takes place the union must have at least 10 per cent membership, and win 50 per cent of the vote, or least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 36 If the union wins a majority, the eighth and final step is that if the parties do not reach an agreement the CAC will regulate the collective agreement for the parties and the result will be legally binding.TULRCA 1992, Sch A1, para 31-32 This contrasts to the basic position, under TULRCA 1992 section 179, which presumes that collective agreements are not intended to create legal relations.See further Gallagher v Post Office [1970] 3 All ER 712 and New Century Cleaning Co Ltd v Church [2000] IRLR 27 The long, problematic procedure, was partly based on the model of the US National Labor Relations Act 1935, but because of its cumbersome nature it strongly encourages the parties to seek voluntary agreement in the spirit of cooperation and good faith. The European Court of Human Rights has continually held, like the UK courts,Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1941] UKHL 2 and RMT v Serco; ASLEF v London & Birmingham Railway [2011] EWCA Civ 226 that collective bargaining is a basic right guaranteed by ECHR article 11.Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom [2002] ECHR 552 and Demir and Baykara v Turkey [2008] ECHR 1345 Though most collective agreements will come about voluntarily, the law has sought to ensure that workers have true freedom of association by prohibiting employers from deterring union membership, and by creating positive rights for members. First, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 137-143 make it unlawful for employers, including agencies, to refuse anyone employment on grounds of union membership. The courts will interpret the legislation purposively to protect union activities,e.g. Harrison v Kent County Council [1995] ICR 434 (EAT) per Mummery J, holding refusal of employment for someone having ostensibly 'an uncooperative attitude and anti- management style' was simply a code for union organising, and thus unlawful. with the same strictness as other anti-discrimination laws. Second, TULRCA 1992 sections 146-166 state that workers may not be subject to any detriment or dismissal. For example, in Fitzpatrick v British Railways Board[1992] ICR 221 the Board dismissed of a lady who had been a member of a Trotskyist group (which promoted international socialism). The Board justified this on the ground that she had not told the employer about having previously worked for the Ford Motor Company, and so for 'untruthfulness and lack of trust'. Woolf LJ held that this was not the true reason - Trotskyism was the issue. The dismissal was unlawful under section 152. Given the technicality of the legislation, the most important case is Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom,[2002] ECHR 552 where Wilson's pay was not increased by the Daily Mail because he wished to remain on the union collective agreement, and Palmer's pay was not put up by 10 per cent because he would not consent to leaving the union, the NURMTW. The European Court of Human Rights held that any ambiguity about protection in UK law contravened ECHR article 11 because, In principle, like any victimisation case in discrimination law, 'a detriment exists if a reasonable worker would or might take the view that the [treatment] was in all the circumstances to his detriment'.St Helen‚Äôs Borough Council v Derbyshire [2007] UKHL 16, but contrast Gayle v Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust [2011] EWCA Civ 924, where St Helen's was not cited to the Court. Mummery LJ, held a tribunal had not erred in finding that a worker given a final written warning which was not for the sole purpose of a penalty for trade union activities, was not a detriment under TULRCA 1992 s 146. If the UK statutes are not updated, the Human Rights Act 1998 section 3 requires interpretation of the common law, or statute, to reflect ECHR principles. More specific legislation, with the Data Protection Act 1998 sections 17-19 and the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, penalises a practice of recording or blacklisting union members, and potentially leads to criminal sanctions for employers and agencies who do so.Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/493) Income inequality surged as union membership declined from 1980, when people stopped being automatically enrolled in their union.Chart from E McGaughey, 'All in 'It' Together: Worker Wages Without Worker Votes' (2016) 27(1) King's Law Journal 1, 8. N Brownlie, Trade Union Membership 2011 (DBIS 2012) 22-23 and T Piketty, Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2014) Technical Appendices, Table S9.2 A \\"closed shop\\" is unlawful,Young, James and Webster v United Kingdom [1981] ECHR 4 and Employment Act 1990 but with a right to opt out, unions can collectively agree that staff automatically become members.cf Pensions Act 2008 ss 3 and 8 Third, union members have a right to be represented by union officials in any disciplinary or grievance meeting under Employment Relations Act 1999 sections 10-15. This can be particularly important when a worker is in trouble with management. Fourth, an employer must permit officials of independent trade unions, which it recognises for collective bargaining, to a reasonable amount of time off to fulfill their role.TULRCA 1992 s 168 Also, union members have a right to a reasonable amount of time off during work hours also to participate in meetings about agreements with the employer, or voting for elections.TULRCA 1992 s 170. This was held not to cover political protest activities, see Luce v Bexley LBC [1990] ICR 591 (EAT) An ACAS Code of Practice sets out the general guidelines.Revised ACAS Code of Practice 3, Time off for trade union duties and activities (2010) acas.org.uk A final \\"right\\" of a worker is that under TULRCA 1992 he or she may not be compelled to become a union member in what used to be called closed shop arrangements. Collective agreements had required that employers did not hire anyone who was not a union member. However, the European Court of Human Rights decided in 1981 that \\"freedom of association\\" under article 11 also entailed \\"freedom from association\\".Young, James and Webster v United Kingdom [1981] ECHR 4 This shift in the law coincided with the start of a Europe-wide trend toward falling union membership, as the closed shop had been the main mechanism to keep up union support, and thus collective bargaining for fairer workplaces. The ECHR does not, however, prevent unions pursuing fair share agreements, where non-union members contribute to union fees for the services they get for collective bargaining.See, for example, the Canadian case of Lavigne v Ontario Public Service Employees Union [1991] 2 SCR 211, but contrast TULRCA 1992 s 146(3) Nor does it prevent collective agreements that would automatically enroll staff in the trade union, as happens under the Pensions Act 2008,Pensions Act 2008 ss 3 and 8 with the right for the worker to opt-out if they chose. =Collective action= The right of workers to collectively withdraw their labour has always been used to make employers stick to a collective agreement.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 10. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 11 At critical moments of history, it also combatted political repression (e.g. the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and the Indian Independence Movement up to 1947), prevented military coups against democratic governments (e.g. the general strike in Germany against the Kapp Putsch in 1920), and overthrew dictatorships (e.g. in the 2008 Egyptian general strike). Anti-democratic regimes cannot tolerate social organisation they do not control, which is why the right to strike is fundamental to every democratic society, and a recognised human right in international law.e.g. Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa [1996] ZACC 26, [66], confirming the right to strike as more important than a right to lock-out. Historically, the UK recognised the right to strike at least since 1906.Morgan v Fry [1968] 2 QB 710, 'It has been held for over 60 years that workmen have a right to strike...' per Lord Denning MR, referring to the Trade Disputes Act 1906, and Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co [1892] AC 25, 'I have always said that a combination of workmen, an agreement among them to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law; perhaps not enforceable inter se, but not indictable. The Legislature has now so declared.' Lord Bramwell referring to the Trade Union Act 1871 UK tradition has inspired the International Labour Organization Convention 87 (1948) articles 3 and 10,B Gernigo, A Odero and H Guido, 'ILO Principles Concerning the Right to Strike' (1998) 137 International Labour Review 441 the case law of the European Court of Human Rights under article 11,RMT v UK [2014] ECHR 366 and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights article 28. However, the scope of the right to take collective action has been controversial. Reflecting a series of restrictions from 1979 to 1997, the law was partially codified in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 219 to 246, which now falls below international standards. The right to strike, used throughout history like in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, is a fundamental right in every democracy. TULRCA 1992 sets limits which have been found by the International Labour Organization to violate international standards. There is no consensus about the status of the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that \\"to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law\\",Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co [1892] AC 25, Lord Bramwell that \\"right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining\\",Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1942] AC 435, 463 \\"that workmen have a right to strike\\",Morgan v Fry [1968] 2 QB 710, 725, Lord Denning MR and that this is \\"a fundamental human right\\".London Underground Ltd v RMT [1996] ICR 170 This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract,cf P Elias, 'The Strike and Breach of Contract: A Reassessment' in KD Ewing, CA Gearty and BA Hepple, Human Rights and Labour Law (1994) ch 11 and this creates tortious liability for unions organising collective action,See Taff Vale Rly Co v Amalgamated Society of Rly Servants [1901] UKHL 1, Quinn v Leathem [1901] UKHL 2 and South Wales Miners' Federation v Glamorgan Coal Co [1905] AC 239, reversed by the Trade Disputes Act 1906. unless it falls within an immunity from statute.e.g. Rookes v Barnard [1964] UKHL 1 and Metrobus Ltd v Unite [2009] EWCA Civ 2009 On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure,e.g. R v Mawbey (1796) 6 Term Rep 619, 101 ER 736, cf Timeplan Education Group Ltd v NUT [1997] IRLR 457 inducement of breach of contract,Lumley v Gye (1853) 2 E&B; 216 and tortious interference with a contract.Tarleton v McGawley (1793) 1 Peake 270, 170 ER 153 However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula,This was introduced by the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 and repeated in the Trade Disputes Act 1906 that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done \\"in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute\\". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike. Tony Blair, New Labour Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007, said in 1997 that \\"changes that we do propose would leave British law the most restrictive on trade unions in the Western world.\\"Tony Blair, ‚ÄòWe won't look back to the 1970s‚Äô (31 March 1997) The Times, 'The essential elements of the trade union legislation of the 1980s will remain. There will be no return to secondary action, flying pickets, strikes without ballots, the closed shop and all the rest. The changes that we do propose would leave British law the most restrictive on trade unions in the Western world. The scenes from Wapping, Grunwick or the miners' strike could no more happen under our proposals than under the existing laws.' This is still seen as accurate.See A Manifesto for Labour Law: towards a comprehensive revision of workers' rights (Institute of Employment Rights, 2016) 1 and 70, reviewed in (2017) 46(1) Industrial Law Journal 169. First, the meaning of a \\"trade dispute\\" under TULRCA 1992 section 244 is confined to mean a dispute \\"between workers and their employer\\" and must mainly relate to employment terms. In BBC v Hearn[1977] ICR 686 Lord Denning MR granted an injunction against a strike by BBC staff to stop broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final to apartheid South Africa. He reasoned that this was a political dispute, not a \\"trade dispute\\", unless the union was requesting \\"putting a clause in the contract\\" to not do such work. Strikes against government legislation (rather than an employer),Express Newspapers Ltd v Keys [1980] IRLR 247 or privatisation,Mercury Communications Ltd v Scott-Garner [1984] ICR 74 or outsourcing before it happens,University College London Hospitals NHS Trust v Unison [1999] ICR 204, surviving an ECHR article 11 challenge in Unison v United Kingdom [2002] IRLR 497 have been held unlawful. However, at the least, any dispute over the terms or conditions on which workers do their jobs will allow protection.In re P (a minor) [2003] UKHL 8, [4] Second, TULRCA 1992 section 224 prevents collective action against someone who is \\"not the employer party to the dispute\\".TULRCA 1992 s 224(2) \\"Secondary action\\" used to be lawful, from the Trade Union Act 1871 until 1927,Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927, after in National Sailors' and Firemen‚Äôs Union v Reed [1926] Ch 536, Astbury J declared that secondary action was unlawful in the General Strike. and again from 1946 till 1980, but today it is not.Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946 until, following Express Newspapers ltd v MacShane [1980] ICR 42 and the Employment Act 1980. It was then said in Department of Employment, Trade Union Immunities (1981) Cm 8128, para 149, that a total ban 'could tilt the balance of power unacceptably to the benefit of employers'. The present provisions were enacted in the Employment Act 1990 This makes the definition of \\"employer\\" relevant, particularly where a trade dispute involves a company group.RMT v United Kingdom [2014] ECHR 366, rejected an express challenge to the validity of the legislation under ECHR article 11, albeit without discussion of the inequality of bargaining power that is inherent when employees exercise freedom of association, including who the employer purports to make the contract with. cf Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v Saskatchewan, 2015 SCC 4 A worker's written statement of the contract may purport to say that the only \\"employer\\" is a subsidiary, although the parent company carries out the employer's function of ultimately setting the contractual terms and conditions.See further J Prassl, The Concept of the Employer (2015) and cf Duport Steel Ltd v Sirs [1980] ICR 161 Further, any picketing or protest outside a workplace must be \\"peaceful\\" and there must be a picket supervisor.TULRCA 1992 ss 220-220A. See also R (Laporte) v Chief Constable of Gloucestershire [2006] UKHL 55, [47]. There are a limited number of outright prohibitions on strike action, but in accordance with ILO Convention 87 this is only for workplaces that involve the truly essential functions of the state (for armed forces, police,Police Act 1996 s 91 and prison officersCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 ss 127-8. Anomalously, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 s 59 grants a further exception. See further POA v United Kingdom [2013] ECHR 600 and Hrvatski Lijeƒçniƒçki sindikat v Croatia [2014] ECHR 1417), and only when impartial arbitration is used as an alternative.ILO Convention No 87, art 6. Civil Contingencies Act 2004 s 23(3)(b) requires that emergency powers cannot limit the right to strike. Third, under TULRCA 1992 section 226 a union wishing to take collective action for a trade dispute must conduct a ballot.Lord Donovan, Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (1968) Cmnd 3623 rejected a need for ballots, but Department of Employment, Democracy in Trade Unions (1983) Cm 8778 led to their introduction in the Trade Union Act 1984 In summary, the union must give 7 days notice to the employer about holding a ballot, state the categories of employees being balloted, give a total number, all \\"as accurate as is reasonably practicable in the light of the information\\".TULRCA 1992 s 226A Since the Trade Union Act 2016, there is an additional requirement that a ballot has a 50% turnout for a strike to be supported, and a total of 40% of voters supporting a strike (i.e. an 80% turnout if the vote is evenly split) in \\"important public services\\" that include health services, schools, fire, transport, nuclear and border security.TULRCA 1992 s 226(2)(a)(iia) and (2E). A scrutineer must be able to oversee the conduct, the vote must be given to all workers who could strike, the vote must be secret and by post, allowing for 'small accidental failures' which are 'unlikely to affect the result of the ballot'.TULRCA 1992 s 226B-232B The union must inform the employer of the result \\"as soon as reasonably practicable\\", call action within four weeks, and tell the employer of the people taking part.TULRCA 1992 s 231-234A The rules are poorly drafted, and this has generated litigation where some courts allowed injunctions on ostensible technical glitches.Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd v NURMT [2010] EWHC 1084 (QB), EDF Energy Powerlink Ltd v NURMT [2009] EWHC 2852 QB, British Airways Plc v Unite the Union [2009] EWHC 3541 However, the Court of Appeal since emphasised in British Airways Plc v Unite the Union (No 2)[2010] EWCA Civ 669 and RMT v Serco Ltd[2011] EWCA Civ 226 that the rules are to be interpreted consistently with the purpose of reconciling the equally legitimate, but conflicting interests of employers and unions.See RMT v Serco Ltd [2011] EWCA Civ 226, [9] per Elias LJ No employee can be dismissed for taking part in a strike for a period of 12 weeks,TULRCA 1992 s 238A so long as the strike is officially endorsed by the union. However, if strikes are not conducted in accordance with law, employers can (and often do) go to court to seek an injunction against a union conducting the strike, or potentially damages.TULRCA 1992 ss 20-21 on damages. A court should not grant any injunction against a strike unless there is a 'serious question to be tried' and it must consider where the 'balance of convenience lies'.American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] AC 396 In The Nawala the House of Lords stressed that injunctions should be granted rarely and give 'full weight to all the practical realities' and the fact that a court should not end the strike in the employer's favour.[1979] 1 WLR 1294 =Information and consultation= While rights to take collective action, including strikes, are fundamental to democratic and civilised society, the UK has introduced a growing menu of collective rights to have a \\"voice at work\\" without a need for protest.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 11(2). S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 9. H Collins, KD Ewing and A McColgan, Labour Law (2012) ch 15, 593-655 \\"Information and consultation\\" are usually seen as precursors to actual participation rights, through binding votes at work. The economic benefit is that directors or decision-makers who inform and consult staff on important workplace changes (e.g. redundancies) think harder, and see alternatives with fewer costs for the enterprise, taxpayers, and staff.Contrast the status quo bias explained in D Kahneman, JL Knetsch and RH Thaler, 'Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias' (1991) 5(1) Journal of Economic Perspectives 193, 198 and discussed in E McGaughey, 'Behavioural Economics and Labour Law' (2015) LSE Law, Society and Economy Working Papers 20/2014, 20-24 Information and consultation rights have historically derived from collective bargaining models. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 181-182 require employers on a union's written request to disclose information, without which collective bargaining could be materially impeded, according to \\"good industrial relations practice\\".cf R (BTP Tioxide) v Central Arbitration Committee [1981] ICR 843, Forbes J holding an employer did not need to disclose 'the break point between grades, job descriptions and points allocated to job on the basis of the factors used' because the union had not made clear how this was going to be used for collective bargaining under the former EPA 1975 ss 17 and 19 The Companies Act 2006 section 417-419 also requires disclosure of information in a director's report each financial year on how companies \\"have regard\\" to \\"the interests of the company's employees\\" and \\"business relationships with suppliers\\" down the supply chain.Companies Act 2006, ss 172(1)(b)-(c) and 417(2), which states this information's purpose is \\"to inform members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 172 (duty to promote the success of the company).\\" Any party registered as a company member can enforce this duty. General consultation rights existed in the UK with collective bargaining since the Whitley Councils from 1918.See Trade Boards Act 1918, following the Reconstruction Committee, Sub-Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed: Interim report on joint standing industrial councils (1917) Cd 8606. Explored in KD Ewing, 'The State and Industrial Relations: 'Collective Laissez-Faire' Revisited' (1998) 5 Historical Studies in Industrial Relations 1. A general consultation right is now codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 27.Following the Community Charter on the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989 arts 17 and 18 The Court of Justice held this was not directly binding,Association de m√©diation sociale v Union locale des syndicats CGT (2014) C‚Äë176/12, [2014] IRLR 310 but specific rules apply in four main contexts: in general work councils, transnational work councils, for collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, and health and safety.See Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 SI 1977/500. The Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/1513) provides for when there is no union, passed under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 s 2 and the Health and Safety Directive 89/391/EC art 11 UK company with over 50 people has a right to elect a work council which management must inform and consult before major workplace changes.Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004 regs 2-4 and Information and Consultation of Employees Directive 2002/14/EC. Staff who work for companies that operate in two or more EU countries have a right to start a transnational work council.Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 Sch, para 7 and EWCD 2009 Annex para 2 First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004,ICER 2004 (SI 3426/2004 ), implementing Information and Consultation of Employees Directive 2002/14/EC require undertakings with 50 or more employees to inform and consult on probable developments in the enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies.ICER 2004 regs 2-4 and 20. ICED 2002 arts 2 and 3. The UK could have chosen to reduce the threshold. Under reg 2, an \\"undertaking\\" refers to 'public or private undertaking carrying out an economic activity, whether or not operating for gain'. Under reg 4(2)(b) it is suggested that part-time staff, working under 75 hours a month, only count for half a person, but 'there is no provision for it in the Directive‚Äô and 'it appears to cut across... the Part-Time Workers Directive‚Äô, Collins, Ewing and McColgan (2012) 626 Employees must voluntarily initiate an \\"information and consultation procedure\\". If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a \\"standard procedure\\" model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having the right to be consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council.ICER 2004 reg 19 and ICED 2002 art 4(2) A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose.ICER 2004 regs 14-20 and Sch 2 and ICED 2002 arts 4-5. Theoretically, employees can agree to lower standards, but will rarely have an incentive to do so. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue \\"with a view to reaching an agreement\\".ICED 2002 art 4(4)(e) This is \\"an obligation to negotiate\\",Junk v K√ºhnel (2005) C-188/03, [43] the Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 'imposes an obligation to negotiate'. similar to a duty to bargain in good faith.cf in US labor law, National Labor Relations Act 1935 ¬ß8(d) duty to 'meet at reasonable times, and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment'. NLRB v Borg-Warner Corp, at 349, 'The duty is limited to those subjects and within that area neither party is legally obligated to yield... As to other matters, however, each party is free to bargain or not to bargain, and to agree or not to agree.' To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a \\"pre-existing\\" council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees.ICER 2004 reg 7 If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants to keep it that way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure.ICER 2004 reg 8, with reg 8(6) adding that turnout must be high enough so that 40 per cent of total staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council,[2006] IRLR 592, [2006] ICR 1253 (EAT) after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to ¬£75,000 for failure to comply with the rules,ICER 2004 reg 23 though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an \\"effective remedy\\" under EU law.cf ICED 2002 arts 7-8 and CFREU art 47 Second, the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 enable unified work councils in multinational enterprises, operating in the EU. This is most likely for US multinational enterprises.Collins, Ewing and McColgan (2012) 605 In \\"community scale undertakings\\" or corporate \\"groups\\" with over 1000 employees, and 150 employees in two or more member states, employees have a right to a transnational work council to consult on any \\"probable trend of employment, investments, and substantial changes... introduction of new working methods or production processes... and collective redundancies.\\"EWCD 2009 Annex para 2 and TICER 1999 Sch, para 7 A \\"group\\" of undertakings exists when one undertaking has a \\"dominant influence\\" over another, for instance through company share ownership or rights to appoint or remove directors.TICER 1999 reg 3 and EWCD 2009 art 3 Other features of transnational work councils are similar to the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004. Management can initiate a work council, or 100 employees in at least two undertakings and member states can make a request.TICER 1999 reg 9 and EWCD 2009 art 5 Then, a \\"special negotiating body\\" (elected worker representative and management) will try to seek an agreement on the terms. If agreement cannot be reached, a template set of \\"subsidiary requirements\\" will form the work council's constitution.TICER 1999 reg 18 and Sch 2. EWCD 2009 Annex The rules have been criticised for not going further, or being integrated with other consultation laws,e.g. S Laulom, 'The Flawed Revision of the European Works Council Directive (2010) 39(2) Industrial Law Journal 202 although every member state in the EU is able to go beyond the minimum standards laid down. Third, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 188 requires employers, who are \\"contemplating\\" redundancies of 20 employees, in an \\"establishment\\" over 90 days, to consult for 30 days with the workforce.TULRCA 1992 s 188, implementing Collective Redundancies Directive 98/59/EC. For over 100 redundancies, the time is 45 days, reduced from 90 days by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (Amendment) Order 2013/763 art 3. \\"Redundancy\\" is an economic dismissal \\"not related to the individual concerned\\" (e.g. for poor work or misconduct).TULRCA 1992 s 195 In University of Stirling v UCU the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason \\"related to the individual\\", and so staff should have been consulted.[2015] UKSC 26 An \\"establishment\\" includes \\"a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual cost centre managed by a manager.\\" In Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd,(2015) C-182/13, [52] the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in E Green & Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments even though they were part of the same group.[1984] IRLR 135 (EAT) There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are \\"contemplating\\", while the Regulations say \\"proposes\\".TULRCA 1992 s 188(1) and CRD 1998 art 2(1) In AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy(2009) C-44/08, [48] the Court of Justice held consulting must begin \\"once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies has been taken.\\" In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary \\"has been identified\\" for redundancies for consulting \\"to have any meaning\\".(2009) C-44/08, [63]-[65] Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election.TULRCA 1992 s 188(1B)-188A Section 188(7) says that an employer has a \\"defence\\" for not consulting if there are \\"exceptional circumstances\\", but this \\"exception\\" is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it.e.g. Clark‚Äôs of Hove v Baker‚Äôs Union [1978] ICR 1076 Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place.Junk v K√ºhnel (2005) C-188/03, [41]-[43] \\"the directive imposes an obligation to negotiate\\". If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a \\"protective award\\" of up to 90 days' pay to each employee.TULRCA 1992 ss 189-196 Essentially similar rules apply for consultation with staff before any transfer of an undertaking.Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 regs 13-15 and Transfer of Undertakings Directive 2001/23/EC arts 6-7. For curious case, of doubtful compatibility with EU law, allowing an employer to escape consulting see Royal Mail Group Ltd v CWU [2009] EWCA Civ 1045 =Direct participation= Direct participation rights in UK corporations and other forms of enterprise have a long history in specific sectors.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (2019) ch 11, 'Votes at work'. E McGaughey, 'Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the 'Single Channel' (2016) 47(1) Industrial Law Journal 76 They remain today in institutions such as universities,See the Oxford University Act 1854 ss 16 and 21, Cambridge University Act 1856 ss 5 and 12. Also the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, ss 20(2) and 85, and Sch 4, para 4. and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first \\"codetermination\\" laws in the world.See also the South Metropolitan Gas Act 1896 s 19, Port of London Act 1908 s 1(7), Iron and Steel Act 1967, Sch 4, Part V, Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 s 2(8), Post Office Act 1977 s 1 However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation.See M Weiss (ed) et al., Handbook on employee involvement in Europe (Kluwer 2004). For the most developed example, see in German labour law the Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976 and the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz 1972 ¬ß87. Member states with no participation rights are Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the United Kingdom. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. The Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines only \\"members\\" as those with participation rights. Under section 112 a \\"member\\" is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. Moreover, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement.See Employee Involvement Directive 2001/86/EC An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion.See generally, PL Davies, 'Workers on the Board of the European Company?' (2003) 32(2) Industrial Law Journal 75 An \\"SE\\" can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there is likely to have been no participation in any case. Universities in the UK are generally required to give staff members a right to vote for the board of managers at the head of corporate governance, such as in the Oxford University Act 1854,Oxford University Act 1854 ss 16 and 21 or the Cambridge University Act 1856.Cambridge University Act 1856 ss 5 and 12; cf King's College London Act 1997 s 15, though since amended. In the 1977 Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy(1977) Cmnd 6706; see also Lord Donovan, Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers‚Äô Associations (1965‚Äì1968) Cmnd 3623, ¬ß¬ß997-1006, where the minority favoured worker directors in principle. the Government proposed, in line with the new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were for shareholders. But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election.See KW Wedderburn, 'Employees, Partnership and Company Law' [2002] 31(2) Industrial Law Journal 99, a minor duty that could not be legally enforced was Companies Act 1985, section 309, requiring directors to act in shareholders and employees' interests, now reflected in Companies Act 2006, s 172 Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 s 31, and PJ Purcell, ‚ÄòThe Enron Bankruptcy and Employer Stock in Retirement Plans‚Äô (11 March 2002) CRS Report for Congress Another form of direct participation rights is for employees to exercise voting rights over specific workplace issues. The primary example is the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241-243 state employees must be able to elect a minimum of one third of the management of their occupational schemes, as \\"member nominated trustees\\". This gives employees the ability, in principle to have a voice on how their pension money is invested in company shares, and also how the voting power attached to company shares is used. There have, at the initiative of the European Union been a growing number of \\"work councils\\" and \\"information and consultation committees\\", but unless an employer voluntarily concedes to staff having a binding say, there is no legal right to participate in specific questions of workplace policy. Participation at work is limited to information, consultation, collective bargaining and industrial action. Equality The Equality Act 2010 protects against discrimination on grounds of race, gender, belief, disability, age, and sexual orientation. The Equality Act 2010 embodies the principle that people should treat one another according to the content of their character, and not another irrelevant status, to foster social inclusion.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 12-14. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 6 This principle, which slowly became fundamental to common law,Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd [1944] KB 693 and EU law,Mangold v Helm (2005) C-144/04 goes beyond employment, to access private and public services. At work, the law largely builds on the minimum standards set in three basic Directives for the whole EU.See Race Equality Directive 2000/48/EC, for race; Employment Equality Framework Directive 2000/78/EC, for religion, belief, sexuality, disability and age; Equal Treatment Directive 2006/54/EC, for gender. Beyond the absolute prohibitions on discriminating against trade union members,TULRCA 1992 ss 146-166; ECHR art 11 and Wilson v United Kingdom [2002] ECHR 552 the EA 2010 protects the characteristics of gender (including pregnancy), race, sexual orientation (including marital status), belief, disability and age.EA 2010 ss 4-14, 16, 18 Atypical workers, who have part-time, fixed-term, or agency contracts, are also protected under specific regulations.PTWR 2000, FTER 2002, AWR 2010 But although equality legislation explicitly prohibits discrimination on just ten grounds,Contrast the unfair dismissal rules, which set out the legitimate grounds for dismissal, and the European Convention art 13, which catches 'any other status' the common law may also extend protection if employers treat workers unfairly for other reasons that are irrelevant or arbitrary.e.g. Transco plc v O‚ÄôBrien [2002] EWCA Civ 379, cf Mandla v Dowell Lee [1983] QB 1, per Lord Denning MR (overturned on appeal). \\"Direct\\" discrimination is when a worker is treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic (e.g. gender or race) compared to another person (with a different gender or race), unless employers can show that a person's characteristic is a \\"genuine occupational requirement\\".The exception is that direct age discrimination may always be objectively justified, as with discrimination against part-time, fixed term or agency workers. \\"Indirect\\" discrimination is when employers apply a neutral rule to all workers, but this has \\"disparate impact\\" on people with a particular protected characteristic, and the rule cannot be \\"objectively justified\\". Workers have a right to not suffer harassment at work. Claimants may not be victimised for bringing a discrimination claim. Equal pay between men and women has historically been treated separately in law, with subtle differences (sometimes more or less favourable). The law on disability is more favourable, by placing positive duties on employers to make reasonable adjustments to include disabled people in society. While UK and EU law presently only allow promotion of underrepresented groups if a candidate is equally qualified, it is still debated whether more \\"positive action\\" measures should be implemented, particularly to tackle the gender pay gap, and over-representation of white men in senior positions. If discrimination is proven, it is a statutory tort, and it entitles a worker to quit and/or claim damages. =Discrimination= Under the Equality Act 2006, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, with offices near City Hall, London, promotes equality by intervening in discrimination cases, providing guidance and making investigations into workplace practices. UK and EU law divide discrimination into direct and indirect forms.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 12. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 6 Direct discrimination means treating a person, because of a \\"protected characteristic\\", less favourably than a comparable person who has a different type of gender, race, sexual orientation, etc.EA 2010 s 13 This is an objective test, so the employer's motives are irrelevant. Even if employers have \\"positive\\" motives, for instance to help underprivileged groups, discrimination is still unlawful in principle.See James v Eastleigh BC [1990] 2 AC 751 The claimant's trait merely has to be the reason for the unfavourable treatment.R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport [2005] 2 WLR 1 An appropriate comparator is one who is the same in all respects except for the relevant trait, which is claimed as the ground for discrimination. For instance in Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary[2003] UKHL 11, [2003] ICR 337 a chief inspector claimed that she was dismissed because the police force was sexist, and pointed to male chief inspectors who had not been treated unfavourably. The House of Lords overturned a Tribunal finding of sex discrimination because colleagues had complained about how Ms Shamoon had performed appraisals, and her chosen comparators had not received complaints.See also, Ladele v London Borough of Islington [2009] EWCA Civ 1357, [39] Generally there is, however, no need to point to an actual comparator, so a claimant can allege they were treated less favourably than a hypothetical person would have been, who is the same except for the protected characteristic. The burden of proof is explicitly regulated so that claimants merely need to show a set of facts from which a reasonable tribunal could conclude there was discrimination, and need not show an intention to discriminate.Equal Treatment Directive 2000/78/EC art 10; Igen Ltd v Wong [2005] ICR 931; Madarassy v Nomura International Plc [2007] EWCA Civ 33, [2007] ICR 867 Because the law aims to eliminate the mindset and culture of discrimination, it is irrelevant whether the person who was targeted was themselves a person with a protected characteristic, so that people who associate with or are perceived to possess a protected characteristic are protected too. In Coleman v Attridge Law a lady with a disabled child was abused by her employer for taking time off to care for the child. Even though Ms Coleman was not disabled, she could claim disability discrimination.(2008) C-303/06, [2008] IRLR 722 And in English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd, a man who was from Brighton and went to boarding school was teased for being gay. Even though he was married with children, he successfully claimed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.[2008] EWCA Civ 1421 An instruction by an employer to discriminate against customers or anyone else also violates the law.See Showboat Entertainment Centre v Owens [1984] ICR 65, (EAT) \\"Indirect\\" discrimination means an employer, without an objective justification, applies a neutral rule to all employees, but it puts one group at a particular disadvantage.EA 2010 s 19 However, the particular disadvantage is irrelevant if it involves a discriminatory state of mine. In Ladele v Islington LBC a woman who refused to register gay civil partners, because she said her Christianity made her conclude homosexuality was wrong, was dismissed for not carrying out her duties. Lord Neuberger MR held that she was not unlawfully discriminated against because the Council was objectively justified in following its equality policy: that everyone working in marriage or partnership registries had to register everybody equally.Ladele v Islington BC [2009] EWCA Civ 1357, [60], per Lord Neuberger MR The European Court of Human Rights upheld this decision. By contrast, in Eweida v British Airways plc a lady who wished to wear a cross claimed that BA's instruction to remove it was indirectly discriminatory against Christians. Although the English Court of Appeal held crucifix jewellery is not an essential part of the Christian religion,Eweida v British Airways plc [2010] EWCA Civ 80, [37], per Sedley LJ. the ECHR found that, under the reasonableness limb of the proportionality test, it was an illegitimate interference with Ms Eweida's religious beliefs under ECHR article 9. British Airways changed its uniform policy shortly afterwards in any case, and this indicated that they had acted unlawfully. The question of particular disadvantage also typically relies on evidence of statistical impact between groups. For instance in Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz(1986) C-170/84, [1986] ECR 1607 an employer set up pensions only for full-time workers, and not for part-time workers. But 72 per cent of part-time workers were women. So Frau Weber von Hartz was able to show that this rule put her, and women generally, at a particular disadvantage, and it was up to the employer to show there was an objective justification. Statistics might be presented in a misleading way (e.g. a measure could affect twice as many women as men, but that is only because there is 2 women and 1 man affected in a workforce of 100). Accordingly, the correct approach is to show how many people in the affected workforce group are put at an advantage, and then if there is a statistically significant number of people with a protected characteristic who are not advantaged, there must be an objective justification for the practice. In R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment(1999) C-167/97, [2000] UKHL 12 the UK government's former rules on unfair dismissal were alleged to be discriminatory. Between 1985 and 1999, the government had made the law so that people had to work for 2 years before they qualified for unfair dismissal (as opposed to 1 year presently), and this meant that there was a 4 to 8 per cent disparity between the number of men and women who qualified on dismissal for a tribunal claim. Following ECJ guidance, the House of Lords held by a majority that this was a large enough disparity in coverage, which required justification by the government. People celebrate \\"Equal Pay Day\\" in Berlin. The Equal Treatment Directive,2006/54/EC which the Equality Act 2010 sections 64 to 71 follow, covers everyone in the EU, but the law so far has let the gender pay gap persist. A significant exception to the basic framework for indirect discrimination is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women.EA 2010 ss 70-71 exclude the application of ss 39, 49-50, but not for direct discrimination in ss 13-14 Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, and so did the TFEU article 157,See now the Equal Pay Directive 2006/54/EC. In the US, the Equal Pay Act 1963 preceded the Civil Rights Act 1964 by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. there has always been a separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to \\"pay\\", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave.See Rinner-K√ºhn v FWW Spezial-Gebaudereinigung GmbH & Co KG [1989] ECR 2743 (C-171/88) Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply.See Defrenne v Sabena (No 2) [1976] ECR 455 (C-43/75) It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing \\"broadly similar\\" work to the comparator, or work \\"rated as equivalent\\", or work which is of \\"equal value\\". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the \\"value\\" of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an \\"equality clause\\" into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.See further S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (6th edn 2012) 696-7 Originally a sub-category of direct discrimination, harassment is now an independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened.cf Burton v De Vere Hotels Ltd [1997] ICR 1, which is now effectively overturned by EA 2010 s 40(2) and (3) In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust[2006] UKHL 34, [2006] ICR 1199 a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor from the very start of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen‚Äôs MBC v Derbyshire[2007] UKHL 16, [2007] ICR 841 the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan,[2001] ICR 1065 a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings. =Justification= Harassment and victimisation cannot be justified, but in principle there are exceptions or justifications for all forms of direct and indirect discrimination.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 12-13. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 6 Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9,See also, Equality Framework Directive 2000/78/EC art 4 is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a \\"genuine occupational requirement\\". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim in terms of the nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan[1989] IRLR 150 a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness.(2010) C-229/08 Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military.Contrast the stricter approach to policing, Johnston v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (1986) C-222/84, [1986] 5 ECR 1651 This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence,(1999) C-273/97, [1999] ECR I-7403 for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on \\"interoperability\\" meant every member had to be capable of combat.Contrast the ECJ's rejection of the complete ban on non-interoperable forces in Kreil v Germany (2000) C-285/98, [2000] ECR I-0069 Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation,R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2004] EWHC 860 (Admin), [2004] IRLR 430 Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious \\"ethos\\", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job. In 2014, the gender pay gap in the EU averaged men being paid 16.2% more than women, and the UK's gap was higher than average, at 18.3%. Indirect discrimination, after a neutral practice puts a member of a group at a particular disadvantage, is not made out if there is an \\"objective justification\\". In most cases, this will be a justification based on business necessity.cf Griggs v Duke Power Co, 401 US 424 (1971) which was the founding case under the US Civil Rights Act 1964. The ECJ, mostly in cases concerning sex discrimination under TFEU art 157, has held that an employer must show a \\"real need\\" for the practice that has a disparate impact, and it must be \\"unrelated\\" to the protected characteristic.Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz (1984) C-170/84, [1986] ECR 1607, concerning a part-time worker who was refused an occupational pension. The justification should not involve \\"generalisations\\" rather than reasons specific to the workers in question,Rinner-K√ºhn v FWW Spezial-Gebaudereinigung GmbH & Co KG (1989) C-171/88, [1989] ECR 2743, concerning a part-time worker who did not get sick pay. Nimz v Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg (1991) C-184/89, [1991] ECR I-297, concerning a women part-time worker who was paid less than full-time staff. Cf Handels-og Kontorfunktionaerernes Forbund I Danmark v Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening, acting on behalf of Danfoss (1989) C-109/88, [1989] ECR 3199, where criteria of being adaptable, prior training and seniority in practice meant that women were being paid less. Seniority was explicitly approved as a good reason. and budgetary considerations alone are not to be considered an \\"aim\\".Kutz-Bauer v Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg (2003) C-187/00, [2003] ECR I-02741, involving a German law subsidising employment for men up to 65, and women only up to 60. Cf Allonby v Accrington and Rossendale College (2001) C-256/01, [2001] ICR 1189. Many foundational judgments concerned employers who gave fewer benefits to part-time staff than full-time staff. Given the particular disadvantage this caused women it was hard to justify. In domestic equal pay claims based on gender, instead of \\"objective justification\\", the old terminology still used is that there must be a \\"genuine material factor\\", found in EA 2010 section 69. Despite different headings, the same underlying concepts are present as for objective justification, with the need to show a \\"legitimate aim\\" and that action is \\"proportionate\\" to such an aim. In Clay Cross (Quarry Services) Ltd v Fletcher[1978] 1 WLR 1429, [1978] IRLR 361 Lord Denning MR held that an employer could not justify paying a young man a higher wage than an older lady (who in fact trained him) on the basis that this was what the employer had to pay given the state of the job market. However, in Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board[1987] IRLR 26 the House of Lords held that women NHS prosthetists who were paid 40% less than men prosthetists, who had become contracted through private practices, had no claim because it was agreed that such higher prices were necessary to attract their services. Thus, the \\"objective justification\\" was said to be an organisational necessity.cf Allonby In Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority(1992) C-127/92 the ECJ held that although a speech therapist being paid less than a male counterpart could not be justified only on the ground that this resulted from different collective agreements, if a disparity came from market forces, this was an objective justification. It has, however, been emphasised that the legislation's purpose is to achieve equal pay, and not fair wages. So in Strathclyde RC v Wallace[1998] 1 WLR 259 the House of Lords held that women teachers who had to fill in for an absent male head master were not entitled to be paid the same during that time. This was a different job. It has also been asserted that collective agreements designed to incrementally make a transition to equal pay between jobs rated as equivalent cannot be justified,Redcar and Cleveland BC v Bainbridge [2007] EWCA Civ 929, [2008] ICR 238 and can even result in liability for the union that concluded them.Allen v GMB [2008] EWCA Civ 810, [2008] IRLR 690 Unlike other protected characteristics, under EA 2010 section 13(2), direct age discrimination is open to justification on the same principles, on the basis that everyone will go through the ageing process.R (Carson and Reynolds) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37, holding that the UK government could give less money in income support and jobseekers allowance for under 25s than over 25s. This may be of questionable compatibility with Kutz-Bauer and K√ºc√ºkdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG (2010) C-555/07, [2010] IRLR 346. This has meant, primarily, that older workers can reach a compulsory retirement age set either by the workplace or the government, on the basis that it is a legitimate way of sharing work between generations.Palacios de la Villa v Cortefiel Servicios SA (2007) C-411/05, [2007] IRLR 989 and R (Age Concern (England)) v Secretary of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (2009) C-388/07, [2009] IRLR 373 =Disability and positive action= Because treating people equally is not by itself enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 14. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 6 According to Chac√≥n Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA(2006) C-13/05, [2006] IRLR 706 disabilities involve an impairment \\"which hinders the participation of the person concerned in professional life\\". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities.Equality Act 2010 (Disability) Regulations 2010 regs 3-8 list various exclusions, such as nicotine or alcohol addiction, or a propensity to start fires. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to do as much as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the \\"disability\\" if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council,[2004] UKHL 32 it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O‚ÄôHanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners[2007] EWCA Civ 283 the Court of Appeal rejected that it would be a reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible. An increasing number of EU member states, though not yet the UK, require company boards of directors to have gender quotas. For example, Finland requires that companies comply with the standard of a 50-50 gender split, or explain to the market if they do not reach the target. For characteristics other than disability, \\"hard\\" positive discrimination, through privileged contract terms, hiring and firing based on gender, race, sexuality, belief or age, or setting quotas for underrepresented groups in most jobs, is generally unlawful in the EU. This policy, however, leaves open the issue of historical disadvantage, and sub-conscious exclusion, which may not be addressed through ordinary direct and indirect discrimination claims. The EU has permitted \\"soft\\" positive action, in contrast to the United States or South Africa, where \\"affirmative action\\" operates in many workplaces.See United Steelworkers of America v Weber, 443 US 193 (1979) and the SA Employment Equity Act 1998 s 15 and Sch 4, for large employers. Lawful positive action in the EU means, in the case of hiring candidates for work, employers may select someone from an under-represented group, but only if that person has qualifications equal to competitors, with full consideration of the candidate's individual qualities.cf Kalanke v Freie Hansestadt Bremen (1995) C-450/93, [1995] IRLR 660, said in Marschall to have been a case where the employer failed to pay regard to individual qualities, by having an automatic promotion policy for women if equally qualified with male competitors. In Marschall v Land Nordrhein Westfalen(1996) C-409/95, [1996] ICR 45 a male teacher failed to get a promotion, and a woman did. He complained that the school's policy, to promote women \\"unless reasons specific to an individual candidate tilt the balance in his favour\\", was unlawful. The ECJ held the school would not be acting unlawfully if it did in fact follow its policy. By contrast in Abrahamsson and Anderson v Fogelqvist(2000) C-407/98, [2000] ECR I-05539 G√∂teborg University's policy was to hire a woman candidate unless \\"the difference between the candidates' qualification is so great that such application would give rise to a breach of the requirement of objectivity\\". A male candidate, who was not hired over two less qualified women, was successful in claiming discrimination. In addition, according to Re Badeck‚Äôs application(2000) C-158/97, [2001] 2 CMLR 6 legitimate positive action measures include quotas in temporary positions, in training, guaranteeing interviews to people with sufficient qualifications, and quotas for people working on representative, administrative or supervisory bodies such as a company's board of directors. This approach, developed initially in ECJ case law, is now reflected in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 157(4) and was put into UK law in the Equality Act 2010 sections 157-158. =Atypical work= Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives,Part-time Work Directive 97/81/EC, Fixed-Term Work Directive 99/70/EC, and the Temporary and Agency Work Directive 2008/104/EC and UK Regulations, require minimum levels of equal treatment for people with part- time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 15. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 6 Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000SI 2000/1551 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the \\"same type of contract\\" doing \\"broadly similar work\\", and are in the same establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority,[2006] UKHL 8 the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also.[2013] UKSC 6 But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.See A McColgan, 'Missing The Point?‚Äô (2000) 29 ILJ 260, 267 Atypical workers, with people who lost social security and fair incomes, were named the \\"precariat\\" class by former ILO director Guy Standing. He advocates a universal basic income to ensure security, funded through tax on wealth.G Standing, The Precariat ‚Äì The new dangerous class (2011) The Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002SI 2002/2034 cover people with contracts that purport to last for a limited duration. The Regulations (unlike the Directive appears to require) were written to only cover \\"employees\\" and not the broader group of \\"workers\\".See A McColgan, 'The Fixed Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002: Fiddling While Rome Burns?' [2003] 32 ILJ 194 In contrast, the European Court of Justice held in Mangold v Helm that equality was a general principle of EU law. This meant that a German Act which required fixed-term contracts be objectively justified after two years work, but gave no protection to workers beyond the age of 52, was unlawful.Mangold v Helm (2005) C-144/04 Likewise, the UK Regulations ban less favourable treatment of fixed-term staff without objective justification.FTER 2002 regs 3-5 Less generous than other countries, regulation 8 says if an employee has a succession of fixed term contracts lasting over 4 years, the employee is to be treated as having a permanent contract.See Adeneler v Ellinikos Organismos Galaktos (2006) C-212/04, [2006] IRLR 716, Grand Chamber holding objective justification for use of fixed-term contracts mean showing a genuine need, and measures employed are proportionate to that aim. Twenty days was too little to break continuity. In practice, UK law already regulated fixed-term work in this respect, because the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be met even if an employee has had short breaks in employment.See ERA 1996 s 235 and Ford v Warwickshire CC [1983] ICR 273 Morecambe Bay licensing was reintroduced for some employment agencies in the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. The Agency Workers Regulations 2010 provide workers some protection against less favourable treatment when they work through an employment agency. However, the right to equal treatment is limited to \\"basic working conditions\\", which is defined as pay and their working time, unless the common law, or general EU law principles are applicable.e.g. Transco plc v O‚ÄôBrien [2002] EWCA Civ 379 But an agency worker may, unlike part-time or fixed-term employees, appeal to a hypothetical comparator. This left uncertain the position of agency workers protection by the job security, child care and other rights for employees in ERA 1996.See E McGaughey, 'Should Agency Workers be Treated Differently?' (2010) LSE Legal Studies Working Paper No. 7/2010 and N Countouris, 'The Temporary Agency Work Directive: Another Broken Promise?' [2009] 38(3) ILJ 329 While the dominant view, after the UK Supreme Court decision in Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher,[2011] UKSC 41 is that an agency worker will always qualify as an employee against both the agency and end-user when they work for a wage, the English Court of Appeal had previously issued conflicting judgments on whether an agency worker should have an unfair dismissal claim against the end-employer, the agency, or both or neither.cf Dacas v Brook Street Bureau (UK) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 21 and James v Greenwich LBC [2008] EWCA Civ 35 Reflecting their vulnerable position, the regulation of agency work goes beyond anti-discrimination rights, to place a set of duties on employment agents' operations and conduct. Found in the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003SI 2003/3319 agencies are generally prohibited from charging fees to prospective workers. Various other duties include being honest in their job advertising, keeping all information on jobseekers confidential and complying with all employment laws. Originally agencies had to have licenses, and under the oversight of the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, they risked losing their licenses if found to be acting in violation of the law. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 removed the licensing requirement, but this was partially reinstated for agencies in agricultural, shellfish and packing sectors through the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. In response to the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster this established another specific regulator, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to enforce employment law in those areas. =Free movement and immigration= *Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union *Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922 *British nationality law *Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 *Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 *Immigration Act 1971 *Immigration Rules *Indefinite leave to remain *Leave to enter *UK Visas and Immigration *Immigration to Europe *Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom Job security UK unemployment tends to spike dramatically with economic crises, as the job security framework is comparatively weak. A database of the world's dismissal regulations is found at www.ilo.org. The right to secure employment, either in one's current job or in a job that utilises a person's skills in the most socially productive way, is usually seen as crucial for the success of the economy and human development.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 16-19. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 5 The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power.See H Collins, 'Market Power, Bureaucratic Power, and the Contract of Employment' (1986) 15 Industrial Law Journal 1 Consistent with minimal international standards,ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 C 158 requires a \\"valid reason\\" for terminations, with \\"reasonable notice\\" and \\"severance pay\\", and the termination must be able to be appealed to an impartial authority. Virtually every developed country, except the United States, goes far beyond this low standard. employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct.Employment Rights Act 1996 s 86 This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair.ERA 1996 s 94 This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment.ERA 1996 s 135. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes.See the Collective Redundancies Directive 98/59/EC and TULRCA 1992 ss 188-192 EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a \\"jobseekers allowance\\", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create \\"full employment\\" however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work. =Wrongful dismissal= Wrongful dismissal refers to a termination of employment which contravenes a contract's terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 17-18. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 5 This depends on construction of the contract, read in the context of the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996.Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41. See also Locke v Candy & Candy Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 1350 and McClelland v Northern Ireland General Health Services [1957] 1 WLR 594, where the House of Lords by 3 to 2 held that even though a contract had an express provision that women had to resign if they got married, read in the \\"context\\" of another provision on gross inefficiency it could not apply. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was \\"reasonable\\" essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In Creen v Wright,(1875-76) LR 1 CPD 591. See also Payzu Ltd v Hannaford [1918] 2 KB 348. Power and Savage v British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd (1930) 36 Lloyds Law Reports 205 Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month's notice, though lower class workers could probably expect much less, \\"respectable\\" employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide.Nokes v Doncaster Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week's notice before dismissal after one month's work, two weeks' notice after two years' work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks' wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper disciplinary procedure to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual disciplinary procedure is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed.Gunton v Richmond-Upon Thames LBC [1980] ICR 755 In Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys, the Supreme Court affirmed that a wrongful repudiation of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.[2012] UKSC 63 In Wilson v Racher, involving a gardener denigrated by his employer at Tolethorpe Hall, Edmund Davies LJ held employment relations require \\"a duty of mutual respect\\".[1974] ICR 428, 430 The requirements of notice and any disciplinary procedure do not apply if the employee was the one to have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general law of contract, if an employee's conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a summary dismissal, the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate,See also Laws v London Chronicle (Indicator Newspapers) Ltd [1959] 1 WLR 698, holding that an employee's failure to obey an employer's instruction was a breach of contract, but not one serious enough to justify termination without notice. also works in favour of employees. In Wilson v Racher[1974] ICR 428 a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Wilson, the gardener, told Racher \\"get stuffed, go and shit yourself\\". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a \\"Czar- serf\\" relationship, Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together,Contrast Jones v Gwent County Council [1992] IRLR 521, Hill v CA Parsons & Co Ltd [1972] Ch 305, Irani v Southampton and South West Hampshire HA [1985] ICR 590 and Mezey v South West London & St George's Mental Health NHS Trust [2010] IRLR 512 is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital,[2011] UKSC 58 the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.See Hill v CA Parsons & Co Ltd [1972] Ch 305, where an employee won reinstatement, since the real conflict was with a union attempting to enforce the closed shop rather than the employer. The primary implied term of an employment contract that may be broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd[2003] 1 AC 518 the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence at the point of dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was ¬£74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely ¬£4,560.Unfair Dismissal Compensatory Awards: Final impact assessment (2013) This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to ¬£400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc,[2004] UKHL 35, [2004] IRLR 732 a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure.Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust [2010] EWCA Civ 571, where failure to follow contractual disciplinary procedure led to a surgeon losing his career. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidencecf Reda v Flag Ltd [2002] UKPC 38, [2002] IRLR 747, stating that an express term for without cause removal cannot be overridden by an implied term of good faith, thus suggesting a default common law rule would require a good reason for removal.) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal.Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40. See also Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation [1971] 1 WLR 1578, 1581, where Lord Reid repeated: 'At common law a master is not bound to hear his servant before he dismisses him. He can act unreasonably or capriciously if he so chooses but the dismissal is valid. The servant has no remedy unless the dismissal is in breach of contract and then the servant's only remedy is damages for breach of contract.' This echoes Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] UKHL 1, [1909] AC 488. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal. =Unfair dismissal= While \\"wrongful\\" dismissal concerns breaches of the terms of an employment contract, \\"unfair\\" dismissal is a claim based on the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 94 to 134A.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 18. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 5 It governs the reasons for which an employer terminates a contract, and requires they fall into the statutory definition of what is \\"fair\\". The Industrial Relations Act 1971, following the Donovan Report 1968, set up its structure.See Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (1968) Cmnd 3623. See the Industrial Relations Bill, Second Reading, Hansard HC Deb (14 December 1970) vol 808 cols 961-1076 and Hansard HC Deb (15 December 1970) vol 808 cols 1126-247 and Third Reading, Hansard HC Deb 24 March 1971 vol 814 cols 547-706 Under ERA 1996 section 94 any employee, who is employed for over two years,ERA 1996 s 108. See R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment [2000] UKHL 12 and (1999) C-167/97 may claim for an Employment Tribunal (composed of a judge, an employer and an employee representative) to review the decision. Temporary or seasonal breaks in employment, such as for teachers who are not in class over summer, cannot break the continuity of the contract for the qualifying period, even if a contract purports to be for a fixed term.ERA 1996 s 212 and Ford v Warwickshire CC [1983] ICR 273. Also, under ERA 1996 s 97, if an employer dismisses an employee one week before a year is up without proper notice, the \\"effective date of termination\\" will still be after the one-year period and so the employee will still qualify for unfair dismissal rights. An employee is only \\"dismissed\\" if the employer has decided to end the work relationship, or if they have constructively dismissed the employee through a serious breach of mutual trust and confidence. An employee will not have a claim if they have voluntarily resigned, though a court must be satisfied that someone truly intended to forgo the legal right to sue for unfair dismissal. In Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd v Lineham[1992] ICR 183 Lineham used the toilet at work after drinking at the pub. Afterwards, in response to the manager rebuking him in front of other staff, he threw down his keys and drove off. He claimed he was dismissed, and the Tribunal agreed that at no time had Lineham resigned. By contrast in Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp[1978] ICR 221 Sharp walked off because the company welfare officer refused to let him collect holiday pay immediately. Although Sharp was in financial difficulty, this was due to his absences, and so he was not justified in leaving, and not constructively dismissed.See also Woods v WM Car Services (Peterborough) Ltd [1982] ICR 693 Under ERA 1996 section 203(1), statutory rights may not be excluded or limited, although section 203(2) and (3) still allows employers and employees to settle a legal claim, so long as the compromise agreement is made freely and with independent legal advice.cf Igbo v Johnson, Matthey Chemicals Ltd [1986] ICR 505 (CA) and Logan Salton v Durham CC [1989] IRLR 99, decided before the statutory enactment of s 203(3) It has also been held that an employee is not dismissed if the relationship is frustrated. In Notcutt v Universal Equipment Co (London) Ltd[1986] ICR 414 a man's heart attack meant he could no longer work. The employer paid no wages during the ordinary notice period, but was successful in arguing that the contract was impossible to perform and therefore void. This doctrine, applicable as a default rule in general contract law, is controversial since unlike commercial parties it will be rare that an employee has the foresight or ability to contract around the rule.See H Collins, KD Ewing and A McColgan, Labour Law: Cases and Materials (Hart 2005) 492 The Supreme Court recently emphasised in Gisda Cyf v Barratt that the \\"need to segregate intellectually common law principles relating to contract law, even in the field of employment, from statutorily conferred rights is fundamental.\\"[2010] UKSC 41 This meant that when an employee claimed unfair dismissal, after accusations of allegedly inappropriate behaviour at a private party, the three-month time limit for her claim only began running when the employer had actually notified her. The general contract law principle that notifications take effect when arriving during business hours was not even \\"a preliminary guide\\" to the interpretation of the right to a fair dismissal.[2010] UKSC 41, [37] In many EU countries, including Germany,See the Work Constitution Act 1972, the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ¬ß87 the work council which is elected by staff may prevent dismissals taking effect until court confirms them as being socially justified. UK employees remain more vulnerable, and must usually be out of work while making claims to an Employment Tribunal. Once it is established that a dismissal took place, the employer must show that its reason for dismissing the employee was \\"fair\\". Dismissal on grounds of union membership,Wilson v United Kingdom [2002] ECHR 552 or one of a number of grounds set out in sections 99 to 107 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, will be automatically unfair. Otherwise the employer has the opportunity to show the dismissal is fair if it falls within five main categories listed in ERA 1996 section 98.See Abernethy v Mott, Hay and Anderson [1974] ICR 323, [1974] IRLR 213 and Smith v Glasgow City District Council [1987] ICR 796, on the consequences of an employer failing to identify a legitimate reason for dismissal. The dismissal must have been because of the employee's capability or qualifications, because of conduct, because the employee was redundant, because continued employment would contravene a law, or because of \\"some other substantial reason\\". If the employer has an argument based on one of these categories, then the tribunal evaluates whether the employer's actual decision fell within a \\"reasonable range of responses\\", i.e. that a reasonable employer could have acted the same way.See Iceland Frozen Foods Ltd v Jones [1983] ICR 17, per Browne-Wilkinson J Thus the review standard lies in between an outright perversity, or \\"Wednesbury unreasonableness\\" test and a forthright reasonable person test. The test arguably requires Tribunals to evaluate the employer's conduct according to good enterprise practice, by analogy to the Bolam test in tort.cf Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582 in English tort law. See S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (5th edn 2009) 446 The \\"proportionality test\\" (requiring the employer's action is appropriate, necessary and reasonable in pursuit of a legitimate aim) has also been proposed as an alternative,See H Collins, KD Ewing and A McColgan, Labour Law: Law in Context (CUP 2012) 833 which would have the advantage of deferring to the employer's aim, if legitimate, but scrutinising whether its actions were proportionate. In practice, the Court of Appeal has given conflicting judgments and remains unable to articulate what the test means, begging the question of how a \\"hypothetical reasonable employer\\" standard under section 98(4)(a) should actually be applied.e.g. Orr v Milton Keynes Council [2011] EWCA Civ 62, [78], per Aikens LJ, and Turner v East Midlands Trains Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1470, [19]-[22] Elias LJ, also holding the band of reasonable responsible test would be compatible with HRA 1998 s 3 and ECHR article 8, if it were engaged. It has been repeated that Tribunals should not substitute their judgment for the employer's. However, there is considerable room for Tribunals to assess the facts and come to their own conclusions, which can only be appealed on legal grounds, and not on their judgment of good workplace relations. For example, in a conduct case, HSBC Bank plc v Madden,[2000] ICR 1283 the Court of Appeal held that it was acceptable for a Tribunal to have decided that dismissing an employee for potential involvement in theft of credit cards was fair, even though an actual police investigation turned up no evidence.cf Haddon v Van Den Bergh Foods Ltd [1999] ICR 1150, where the outgoing President of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Morison J, held the band of responses test was like a perversity test, and a full reasonableness test was the law. By contrast, in Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust,[2011] EWCA Civ 63 an employer argued a nurse who, while physically restraining a naked patient who was unconscious and having a seizure, said \\"It's been a few months since I have been in this position with a man underneath me\\" was lewd and deserved dismissal for her misconduct. The Tribunal said the dismissal was unfair and the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had competently exercised its discretion in granting the unfair dismissal claim. The absence of a role for elected worker representatives in assessing the fairness of the employer or manager's conduct in the UK contrasts to many EU member states. While courts act as a final check, it is often thought that the parties best placed to resolve disputes would be representatives of all staff members, who (unlike an employer or manager) usually have fewer conflicts of interest in dismissal disputes. ACAS, headquartered at Euston Tower, issues a binding Code of Practice on how to handle workplace disputes and potential dismissals. While some courts have chosen to be more deferential to the employer's substantive reasons for dismissal,cf Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust [2011] EWCA Civ 63, Longmore LJ, 'the employer cannot be the final arbiter of its own conduct in dismissing an employee.' they emphasise more strongly the importance of employers having a fair process. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Code of Practice (2009) explains that good industry practice for disciplinaries requires, among other things, written warnings, a fair hearing by people who have no reason to side against the employee, or with any manager involved in the dispute, and the opportunity for union representation. Often a company handbook will include its own system, which if not followed will likely mean the dismissal was unfair.West Midlands Co-op v Tipton [1986] AC 536, [1986] ICR 192 Nevertheless, in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd[1987] UKHL 8 the House of Lords held that, in a case where a van driver was told he was redundant on the spot, if an employer can show the dismissal would be made regardless of whether a procedure was followed, damages can be reduced to zero. In the Employment Act 2002, Parliament made an abortive attempt to instil some kind of mandatory minimum procedure for everybody, but after complaints from employers and unions alike that it was merely encouraging a \\"tick-box\\" culture, it was repealed in the Employment Act 2008.For an example of the operation of Employment Act 2002, which if not followed let to an automatic finding of unfair dismissal, see Cartwright v King‚Äôs College, London [2010] EWCA Civ 1146 Now if the ACAS Code is not followed, and this is unreasonable, an unfair dismissal award can be increased by 25 per cent.TULRCA 1992 s 207A and Sch A2, inserted by Employment Act 2008 s 3 Generally, under ERA 1996 sections 119 and 227, the principle for a \\"basic\\" unfair dismissal award is that, with a cap of ¬£350 per week and a maximum of 20 weeks, an employee should receive one week's pay for each year employed if aged between 22 and 40, 1¬Ω weeks if over 40 and ¬Ω a week if under 22. By ERA 1996 section 123, the employee may also be entitled to the more significant, but discretionary \\"compensatory\\" award. This should take into account the actual losses of the employee as just and equitable, based on loss of immediate and future wages, the manner of the dismissal and loss of future unfair dismissal protection and redundancy rights.Norton Tool Co Ltd v Tewson [1972] EW Misc 1 This is capped, but usually increased in line with RPI inflation. It was ¬£74,200 in 2013, though the median award of a successful claimant was merely ¬£4,560.Unfair Dismissal Compensatory Awards: Final impact assessment (2013). It was ¬£4903 in 2009‚Äì2010. See Ministry of Justice, Employment Tribunal and EAT statistics 2009-10 (3 September 2010) Very few claimants are successful in securing reinstatement, although if they are suspended from their workplace and colleagues, the evidence suggests that the experience of litigation sours the relationship so that the employee will no longer wish to return.P Lewis, 'An Analysis of Why Legislation Has Failed to Provide Employment Protection for Unfairly Dismissed Workers' (1981) 19 British Journal of Industrial Relations 316 It is therefore important that in 2011 the Supreme Court emphasised in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital that in principle an employee may secure an injunction to continue working while internal disciplinary procedures are followed.[2011] UKSC 58 Particularly given the difficulty of finding alternative employment while removed from work, it is not clear why a staff member who retains the support of his or her colleagues (as opposed to a manager who potentially has a conflict of interest) should not also be able to continue working until a dismissal is confirmed by a court.nb Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys [2012] UKSC 63, the Supreme Court confirmed that an employment relationship does not terminate until the employee accepts an employer's repudiation. =Redundancy= Redundancies are a special kind of dismissal, which attract specific regulation.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 19. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 5 Since the Redundancy Payments Act 1965,See Hansard HC Deb (26 April 1965) vol 711, cols 33-160, Second Reading of the Bill, Ray Gunter staff must receive a payment for losing their jobs if the employer no longer has an economic need for their job. This policy is designed to internalise some of the social costs that employers create if they dismiss staff, to try and disincentivise unnecessary job losses, and contribute to employees' costs in unemployment. Under ERA 1996 section 162, employees over age 40 receive 1¬Ω weeks' pay per year they had worked, employees aged 22 to 40 receive 1 week's pay per year worked, and employees age 21 or less receive half a week's pay, though the upper limit was ¬£464 per week in 2014. Dismissal for redundancy counts \\"fair\\" in substance under ERA 1996 section 98, but the employer may still carry out an unfair procedure to dismiss the redundant employees. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 139, a \\"redundancy\\" exists when an employer's demand for an employee's role ceases or diminishes.Murray v Foyle Meats Ltd [1999] UKHL 30 In situations where employees have lost their jobs, this may be straightforward. In cases where an employer uses its discretion practically to worsen the employees' position the answer may depend on the employees' contracts. In Lesney Products & Co v Nolan[1977] ICR 235 a toy company stopped giving its workers overtime. Some refused to work. They were dismissed, and the workers claimed they were redundant. Lord Denning MR held they were not made \\"redundant\\" by their terms being changed, even worsened, because \\"nothing should be done to impair the ability of employers to reorganise their work force and their times and conditions of work so as to improve efficiency.\\" Apparently, they had simply left stopped working of their own accord. This view is controversial, because if the total wage bill spent by the employer is reduced, it would follow that demand for work (reflected in the employer's willingness to pay) must also be diminished. Thus, other courts have suggested the contract terms are irrelevant, and that the test should be purely based on the economic reality of diminished demand.Safeway Stores plc v Burrell [1997] ICR 523 Employers can also argue that a dismissal is for \\"some other substantial reason\\". In Hollister v National Farmers‚Äô Union[1979] ICR 542 a farmer's refusal to accept decreased pension entitlements, after a consultation process, was said to be a \\"substantial\\" reason for dismissal. It is not clear whether worsening employees' contract terms, without their consent or collective approval, was envisaged by the Act as way to evade redundancy payments. Although workers could be redundant, the employer may still be liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd[1982] ICR 156 Browne- Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers to lose their jobs based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness.British Aerospace plc v Green [1995] EWCA Civ 26, refusal to disclose assessment forms was legitimate in absence of any specific allegations. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union,[2009] EWCA Civ 387 Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties.Taylor v Kent CC [1969] 2 QB 560 For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant.[1976] ICR 313 There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable.Optical Express Ltd v Williams [2007] IRLR 936 However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except to the extent that the employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.Collective Redundancies Directive 98/59/EC art 2 =Undertaking transfers and insolvency= Another context in which the common law left workers particularly vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 19. S Deakin and G Morris, Labour Law (2012) ch 3 In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd[1940] AC 1014 it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs.The French Code du Travail of 1928 contained the forerunner, now found in Code du Travail article L 122-12. See also, E Herz, 'The Protection of Employees on the Termination of Contracts' (1954) LXIX(4) International Labour Review, an early theory of acquired rights. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted,See Land Registration Act 2002 Sch 3, para 1. In Germany, the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch ¬ß 613a(1), corresponds to the TUD 2001 article 3. It was first introduced in 1972, by analogy with BGB ¬ß566 which contains the analogous principle that 'Kauf bricht nicht Miete', or \\"conveyances don't break leases\\". the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the \\"Acquired Rights Directive\\"), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain as if it were the old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock.[1988] UKHL 10, [1989] ICR 341 The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance.Wilson v St Helens BC and British Fuels Ltd v Baxendale [1998] UKHL 37, [1999] 2 AC 52 The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clauseCredit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Ltd v Lister [1999] ICR 794 or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.University of Oxford v Humphreys [2000] IRLR 183 An acute question for the TUPE Regulations, particularly in the years when the Conservative government was implementing a policy of shrinking the size of the public sector, was the extent they applied to jobs being outsourced, typically by a public body, like a local council, or changed between businesses in a competitive tender process for public procurement. On this point a series of ECJ decisions came to the view that there could be a relevant transfer, covered by the Directive, even where there was no contractual link between a transferor and a transferee business,S√ºzen v Zehnacker Geb√§udereingung GmbH (1997) C-13/95, [1997] ICR 662, where a cleaning lady kept her job at the same school, but a different employer had won the cleaning contract and rehired her so long as the business entity retained its \\"identity\\". In turn the \\"identity\\" of a business would be determined by the degree to which the business' factors of production remained the same before and after a sale.S√ºzen (1997) C-13/95, \\"14 in order to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of an entity are met, it is necessary to consider all the facts characterizing the transaction in question, including in particular [1.] the type of undertaking or business, [2.] whether or not its tangible assets, such as buildings and movable property, are transferred, [3.] the value of its intangible assets at the time of the transfer, [4.] whether or not the majority of its employees are taken over by the new employer, [5.] whether or not its customers are transferred, [6.] the degree of similarity between the activities carried on before and after the transfer, and [7.] the period, if any, for which those activities were suspended.\\" (numbering added) It could be that no employees were hired after an asset sale, but the sacked employees would still have a claim because all their old workplace and capital equipment was being used by the new employer. It is also relevant to what extent a business is capital or labour-intensive. So in Oy Liikenne Ab v Liskoj√§rvi(2001) C-172/99, [2001] IRLR 171 the ECJ held that it was unlikely that 45 Helsinki bus drivers' contracts were transferred, between the company that lost the contract and the new bus company that won it, even though 33 drivers were rehired, because \\"bus transport cannot be regarded as an activity based essentially on manpower\\". On the other hand, employees will benefit when a new employer offers old staff their jobs, the intention to rehire makes it more likely the court will deem there to be a transfer.RCO Support Services v Unison [2002] EWCA Civ 464 Often business transfers take place when a company has plunged into an insolvency procedure. If a company enters liquidation, which aims to wind down the business and sell off the assets, TUPER 2006 regulation 8(7) states that the rules on transfer will not apply.cf Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Slater [2007] IRLR 928 and Oakland v Wellswood (Yorkshire) Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 1094, [2010] IRLR 82 The main objective, however, in an insolvency procedure particularly since the Cork Report and the Enterprise Act 2002, is to effect rescues through the system of company administration. An administrator's task under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paragraph 3, is either to rescue the company as a going concern, rescue the business typically by finding a suitable buyer and thus save jobs, or as a last resort put the company into liquidation. If employees are kept on after an administrator is appointed for more than 14 days, under paragraph 99 the administrator becomes responsible for adopting their contracts. The liability on contracts is limited to \\"wages and salaries\\".IA 1986 s 19 and Sch B1 para 99 This includes pay, holiday pay, sick pay and occupational pension contributions, but has been held to not include compensation for unfair dismissal cases,Re Allders Department Stores Ltd [2005] BCC 289 wrongful dismissal,Leeds United AFC Ltd [2008] BCC 11 or protective awards for failure to consult the workforce before redundancies.Krasner v McMath [2005] EWCA Civ 1072, [2005] IRLR 995 If the business rescue does ultimately fail, then such money due employees achieves the status of \\"super priority\\" among different creditors' claims. The priority list in insolvency sees creditors with fixed security (typically banks) get paid first. Second are preferential creditors. Third are unsecured creditors up to a limit of ¬£600,000. Fourth are floating charge holders (usually banks again). Fifth are remaining debts to unsecured creditors (in the unlikely event that anything remains). Sixth are \\"deferred debts\\" (typically to company insiders). Last are shareholders.See IA 1986 ss 176ZA, 175, 176A, 386, Sch 6, s 74(2) Among the preferential creditors, the insolvency practitioners' fees together with adopted contracts attain super- priority. Otherwise, employees wages and pensions still have preferential status, but only up to an ¬£800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986.Insolvency Proceedings (Monetary Limits) Order 1986 (SI 1986/1996) Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897,See Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 and the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 s 2 and is justified on the ground that employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention.ILO Convention No 173 (1992) Often this limited preference is not enough, and can take a long time to realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive2008/94/EC, replacing 80/987/EC and 2002/74/EC under ERA 1996 section 166 any employeeSee McMeechan v Secretary of State for Employment [1997] ICR 549, holding an agency worker could claim; Buchan and Ivey v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1997] IRLR 80, holding the purpose of the fund did not allow managing directors to claim, but cf Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Bottrill [2000] EWCA Civ 781, holding a director who was essentially without any autonomy in a group did deserve protection. may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount claimable is the same as that for unfair dismissal (¬£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks.See Mann v Secretary of State for Employment [1999] IRLR 566 and Regeling v Bestuur van de Bedrijfsvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid (1999) C-125/97, [1999] IRLR 379 The Pensions Act 2004 governs a separate system for protecting pension claims, through the Pension Protection Fund. This aims to fully insure all pension claims.See Robins v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (2007) C-278/05, [2007] ICR 779, held that 20% insurance was not enough. Together with minimum redundancy payments, the guarantees of wages form a meagre cushion which requires more of a systematic supplementation when people remain unemployed. =Full employment= Unemployment rate 1881 to 2017. One of the most important labour rights, on which all other labour rights rest, is the \\"right to work\\" and therefore to full employment \\"at fair wages\\" and with all the hours one needs.See W Beveridge, Full Employment in a Free Society (1944) and E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 16 In international law everyone 'has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.'Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 article 23(1) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 article 6 recognises 'right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts'. The International Labour Organisation, the Employment Policy Convention 1964 (c 122) article 1 says states should 'declare and pursue, as a major goal, an active policy designed to promote full, productive and freely chosen employment.' However it does not say how this should be achieved. In the UK, three main legal policies have been used: fiscal, monetary, and insurance. First, from the White Paper on Employment Policy in 1944,White Paper, Employment Policy (May 1944) Cmd 6527 the UK government announced a strategy to spend money to counteract volatility in private investment in five-year blocks. Private spending can be prone to boom and bust, international investment can also, while consumer spending is generally more stable, and government spending can be actively managed. The government also passed the Distribution of Industry Act 1945, which ensured that investment was spread to regions as well as cities, and the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 which required larger firms to hire a quota of disabled people. Full employment, at almost zero cost to government,RCO Matthews, 'Why has Britain had full employment since the war?‚Äô (1968) 78(311) Economic Journal 555 suggests there was no massive \\"Keynesian\\" spending to maintain full employment. cf JM Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). lasted until the 1973 oil crisis when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raises petrol prices, and so made the cost of running the economy higher. This inflation was argued by economists, such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek to prove there is a natural rate of unemployment, which makes attempts to get full employment impossible. While this theory lacked evidence,cf A W Phillips (1958) 'The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861‚Äì1957' (1958) Economica. This was taken by M Friedman, 'The Role of Monetary Policy' (1968) 58(1) American Economic Review 1 to be evidence that fuller employment raises all inflation rather than just wages as Phillips had demonstrated. FA Hayek, 'Full employment, planning and inflation' (1950) 4(6) Institute of Public Affairs Review 174 argued for the same concept, without evidence. From 1979, the new Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher abandoned full employment as a goal, and triggered soaring inflation, as it began attacking organised labour. In 2019, the concept of a natural rate of unemployment, which supposedly was caused by stronger labour rights, has been abandoned by the head of the US Federal Reserve Bank.Y Li, 'The Fed chairman says the relationship between inflation and unemployment is gone' (11 July 2019) CNBC Briefly, the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 section 1 created a duty on government to report 'annually on the progress which has been made towards full employment' but this was abandoned with the 2017 UK general election. Since 2010, while there has been decreasing unemployment, there has been a large rise in under-employment and the longest cuts to workers' wages since the industrial revolution. This suggests a reluctance of the government to strengthen the incomes and bargaining power of workers if it could decrease the power of corporate capital.See M Kalecki, 'Political Aspects of Full Employment' (1943) 14(4) Political Quarterly 347 and S Webb, How the Government Can Prevent Unemployment (1912). Contrast EU soft laws in Economic Policies Recommendation (EU) 2015/1184 and the Employment Decision 2015/1848. Second, the UK government, particularly since it abandoned using investment and fiscal policy, has emphasised monetary policy. The Bank of England as the UK's central bank is able to influence private banks' lending rates by adjusting its interest rate for lending to them (the \\"Bank of England base rate\\"), by buying up assets in large quantities backed by the UK government, by changing reserve requirements, or by fixing rates. If private banks are influenced to reduced their interest rates, this stimulates more lending and borrowing, increases credit and money supply in the economy, encourages businesses to hire more people, and so can reduce employment. However, the Bank of England Act 1998 section 11 states the Bank's objectives for monetary policy are (a) to maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to 'support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.' Although the Bank of England could use monetary policy to encourage investment up to full employment it has not done so because it has also been affected by theories of \\"natural\\" unemployment, and triggering higher inflation. Third, the UK government has considerable control over unemployment through its social insurance system. Since the poor laws were abolished and national insurance was introduced,See the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832 and the National Insurance Act 1911 and National Insurance Act 1946 the government has paid people money if they cannot find work. Paying insurance was thought to impel the government to encourage full employment, while it also increases labour's bargaining power: workers need not accept any job on starvation wages, because they will have a minimum income to survive. This is part of the universal right to social security.ILO Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention 1952 (c 102). Universal Declaration on Human Rights 1948 article 22. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 article 9, 'the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance.' Today under the Jobseekers Act 1995 a 'Jobseeker's Allowance' is payable for up to 182 days if someone has made contributions for over 2 years, but for people over 25 this was only up to ¬£73.10 a week in 2019. Further, under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 sections 6-6J the Secretary of State can write rules to place conditions for work on people claiming jobseeker's allowance. In R (Reilly) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions two claimants argued that requirements to work for free were ultra vires, and also amounted to forced labour. The Secretary of State lost on the ultra vires point, but the Supreme Court declined to hold that \\"workfare\\" amounted to forced labour.[2013] UKSC 68 Nevertheless, it appears from the original conception of William Beveridge of a welfare state with Full Employment in a Free Society. Enforcement and tribunals The main method of enforcement of labour law is through the Employment Tribunal. Fees for issuing claims were scrapped following the Supreme Court judgment in R (on the application of UNISON) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51 in which they were ruled unlawful.https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2015-0233-judgment.pdf Appeals are made to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Appeals can be made only on questions of law or where the Employment Tribunal's treatment of the facts have amounted to an error of law (for example, where there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact by the Tribunal or where the Tribunal's decision was perverse).http://uk.practicallaw.com/3-376-4664#a747288 Under the Equality Act 2006,See C O‚ÄôCinneide, 'The Commission for Equality and Human Rights: A New Institution for New and Uncertain Times' (2007) Industrial Law Journal 141 a new Equality and Human Rights Commission was established, subsuming specialist bodies from before. Its role is in research, promotion and raising awareness. It does not have enforcement powers. An important part of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has been strategic litigation (advising and funding cases which could significantly advance the law) and developing codes of best practice for employers to use. In October 2014, the Liberal Democrat Party suggested that a new Workplace Rights Agency be created as an alternative method of enforcement of labour law, while in 2015 before losing his seat the former Liberal-Democrat business minister, Vince Cable, admitted that his Ministry's introduction of Tribunal fees was \\"a very bad move\\".A Grice (29 April 2015) Independent *Employment Tribunals Act 1996 *Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 ss 7-24, amending the ETA 1996 to require mandatory pre-hearing conciliation *Employment Tribunals (Increase of Maximum Deposit) Order 2012/149 art 2, increasing tribunal fees to ¬£1000 under ETA 1996 s 9(2)(a) *Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998 *Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service *Central Arbitration Committee *Health and Safety Executive *Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate *Gangmasters Licensing Authority *Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs *Equality and Human Rights Commission International labour law Since the industrial revolution the labour movement has been concerned how economic globalisation would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home.K Marx, Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress (1969) quotes \\"the extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such [unions] should be still further extended and made international.\\" Following World War One, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization founded on the principle that \\"labour is not a commodity\\", and for the reason that \\"peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice\\".Treaty of Versailles 1919, Part XIII, Section I and art 427 The primary role of the ILO has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing ILO Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out.See generally, KD Ewing, Britain and the ILO (2nd edn IER 1994) 16. Two further general working time conventions are the Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935 No 51 and the Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936 No 52 The present constitution of the ILO comes from the Declaration of Philadelphia 1944, and under the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998 classified eight conventionsThere are 189 Conventions; however, some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions Nos 2, 34, 96 and 181 all concern private employment agencies, but only Convention 181 is in force. as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos 87 and 98) abolition of forced labour (29 and 105) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182) and no discrimination at work (Nos 100 and 111). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis. As one of the few international organisations with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the WTO has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the International Labour Organization Because the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a \\"social clause\\" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that \\"the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.\\"Singapore Ministerial Declaration (13 December 1996) On this view, countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable.See KA Elliott and RB Freeman, Can Labor Standards Improve under Globalization? (Institute for International Economics 2003) While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead.e.g. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, article 13 Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 arts 7, 8, 15 and Annex II and III Duncombe, the Supreme Court found an employee of the European School, Karlsruhe in Germany was covered by UK labour rights because their employer was the UK government.[2011] UKSC 36 Because labour rights should not be undercut by a \\"race to the bottom\\", conflict of laws principles allow workers to claim rights from the more favourable jurisdiction. While the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, conflicts of laws (or private international law) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from the UK performs part of her job in other countries (a \\"peripatetic\\" worker) or if a worker is engaged in the UK to work as an expatriate abroad, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by other countries' laws, where labour rights may be less favourable than at home. In Lawson v Serco Ltd[2006] UKHL 3, [2006] 1 All ER 823 three joined appeals went to the House of Lords. Lawson worked for a multinational business on Ascension Island, a British territory as a security guard. Botham worked in Germany for the Ministry of Defence. Crofts, and his copilots, worked mostly in the air for a Hong Kong airline, though his contract stated he was based at Heathrow. All sought to claim unfair dismissal, but their employers argued they should not be covered by the territorial reach of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Lord Hoffmann held that, first, if workers are in Great Britain, they are covered. Second, peripatetic workers like Crofts would be covered if they are ordinarily working in the UK, but that this could take account of the company's basings policy. Third, if workers were expatriate the general rule was they would not be covered, but that exceptionally if there was a \\"close connection\\" between the work and the UK they would be covered. This meant that Lawson and Botham would have claims, because both Lawson and Botham's position was in a British enclave, which made a close enough connection. Subsequent cases have emphasised that the categories of expatriate worker who will exceptionally be covered are not closed. So in Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families[2011] UKSC 36 an employee of the UK government teaching in EU schools could claim unfair dismissal because their employer held their connection close to the UK. Then, in Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd[2012] UKSC 1 an employee in Libya, working for a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate Halliburton, was still covered by UK unfair dismissal rights because he was given an assurance that his contract would come under UK law. This established a close connection. The result is that access to mandatory employment rights mirrors the framework for contractual claims under the EU Rome I Regulation article 8.Rome I Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008) It is also necessary that a UK court has jurisdiction to hear a claim, which under the Brussels I Regulation articles 20 to 23,Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 requires the worker habitually works in the UK, or was engaged there. Both EU Regulations emphasise that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.See Rome I, recital 23 and Brussels I, recital 13 As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that multinational corporations have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strike internationally. However, this kind of coordination was halted in the European Union in two decisions. In Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union(2008) C-319/05 a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this \\"shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers\\". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in The Rosella, the ECJ also held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' \\"right to strike\\" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests. For this reason it has been questioned whether the ECJ's decisions were compatible with fundamental human rights, particularly the freedom of association guaranteed by article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Courtesy of the German Federal Archives (Deutsches Bundesarchiv). Znaim to the Sudeten expellees of South Moravia (Kreis Znaim). The text translates as \\"Homeland rights are human rights.\\" Heimatvertriebene (, \\"homeland expellees\\") are 12‚Äî16 million German citizens (regardless of ethnicity) and ethnic Germans (regardless of citizenship) who fled or were expelled after World War II from parts of Germany annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union and from other countries (the so-called einheitliches Vertreibungsgebiet, i.e. uniform territory of expulsionThe uniform territory of expulsion was legally defined as the Former eastern territories of Germany (lost by the First or Second World War), the former Austria-Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Cf. Federal Expellee Law, ¬ß 2 (1).), who found refuge in both West and East Germany, and Austria. Refugees who had fled voluntarily but were later refused permission to return are often not distinguished from those who were forcibly deported. By the definition of the West German Federal Expellee Law, enacted on 19 May 1953, refugees of German citizenship or German ethnicity, whose return to their home places was denied, were treated like expellees, thus the frequent general usage of the term expellees for refugees alike. Distinguished are refugees and expellees who had neither German citizenship nor German ethnicity but as a matter of fact had fled or been expelled from their former domiciles and stranded in West Germany or West Berlin before 1951. They were taken care of ‚Äì as part of the displaced persons ‚Äì by international refugee organisations until 1951 and then by West German authorities granting them the extra status of heimatloser Ausl√§nder with preferential naturalisation rules, distinct from other legal aliens or stateless people.Cf. the Gesetz √ºber die Rechtsstellung heimatloser Ausl√§nder im Bundesgebiet (shorthand: HAuslG; literally: law on the legal status of homeless foreigners in the federal territory). Occupational functionaries and other German expatriates, who had moved to German-annexed or German-occupied foreign territory only due to the war were not considered expellees by law unless they showed circumstances (such as marrying a resident of the respective area) providing for the intention to settle abroad also for the time after the war.Cf. Federal Expellee Law, ¬ß 1 (4). Besides the narrow legal definition for the Heimatvertriebene, there were also other groups accepted as Vertriebene (expellees) such as the Aussiedler. These comprised refugees and emigrants either originally of foreign citizenship but of German ethnicity, or who themselves or whose ancestors had involuntarily lost German citizenship, coming from the above-mentioned uniform territory of expulsion or from Albania, Bulgaria, China, Romania, the Soviet Union, or Yugoslavia, and arriving only after the end of general expulsions but not later as 31 December 1992.Cf. Federal Expellee Law, ¬ß 1 (2) No. 3. In a document signed in 1950 the Heimatvertriebene organisations recognised the plight of the different groups of people living in today's Poland who were resettled there by force. The Heimatvertriebene are just one (but by far the largest) of the groups of millions of other people, from many different countries, who all found refuge in today's Germany. Some of the expellees are active in politics and belong to the political right wing. Many others do not belong to any organizations, but they continue to maintain what they call a lawful right to their homeland. The vast majority pledged to work peacefully towards that goal while rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe. The expellees are still highly active in German politics, and are one of the major social groups of the nation, with around 2 million members. The president of the Federation of Expellees is a member of the Bundestag. Although expellees and their descendants were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the expellees and German civilian victims. Expellee towns As a result of the huge influx of expellees, there was a massive increase of population in some areas such as Mecklenburg (where population numbers doubled), and in some places the previous homogeneity of the population was broken by Protestant expellees moving to a purely Catholic area or conversely. The population numbers of a number of small settlements in West Germany exploded permanently due to a refugee camp on their territory or nearby. Examples of this phenomenon include Neugablonz, a quarter of Kaufbeuren in Bavaria, founded by the expellees and named after Gablonz (Jablonec nad Nisou). Neugablonz nowadays makes up a third of the town's population. An extreme example of the population explosion is Neutraubling (also in Bavaria), which had 53 inhabitants in 1947, 1300 in 1951, and 3800 in 1960. Since the refugee camps were mostly located on the sites of former hidden ammunition factories, most of these Vertriebenenst√§dte are located in a (former) forest. See also Espelkamp.

Founded in 1901 as the Academy of Idaho, ISU offers more than 280 programs at its main campus and at locations in Meridian, Idaho Falls, and Twin Falls. It is the state's designated lead institution in health professions and medical education. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". There are 48 U.S. states and 59 countries represented at ISU and 285 programs, including Master's and Doctorate programs. The student-teacher ratio is 13:1, gender of students is 44 percent male and 56 percent female. Enrollment for the fall semester in 2019 was 12,425, including 10,365 undergraduate students and 2,060 graduate students. About 59% of the students attend full-time. History On March 11, 1901, Governor Frank W. Hunt signed Senate Bill 53, to establish the Academy of Idaho, contingent upon private land donations being made for its site. Theodore F. Turner, mayor of Pocatello, settled the issue (Battle of the Blocks) of the placement of the academy. The Academy of Idaho was officially opened in Pocatello on May 1, 19012. Theodore Swanson, a member of the board of trustees, secured the services of John W. Faris as the first administrator, with the title of principal. Classes officially began in September 1902. By 1910, enrollment had reached nearly 300 students, and the academy had purchased four additional city blocks in Pocatello to help meet its growing needs. The Academy of Idaho was renamed Idaho Technical Institute in 1915. The end of World War I brought an influx of students to the school, and enrollment surged to over 1,000. The early 1920s saw the beginning of competition in intercollegiate athletics. At this time the institute adopted the Bengal as the school mascot; head football coach Ralph Hutchinson (1920‚Äì27) was an alumnus of Princeton, a school with orange and black theme colors and a tiger mascot. It was renamed again in 1927, this time as the University of Idaho‚ÄîSouthern Branch, and continued as a two-year school, overseen by an executive dean, John R. Nichols. During World War II, Idaho was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Nichols decided to leave the college, and named Carl McIntosh, an associate professor of speech, as acting executive dean in January 1947. That March, the school was elevated to four-year status and became Idaho State College.Beal and Wells, p. 208. Nichols was so impressed with McIntosh's public speaking skills that he successfully persuaded the Board of Regents to appoint McIntosh the first president of ISC. At 32 years of age, he was one of the youngest college presidents in the United States.\\"Dr. Carl W. McIntosh (1914‚Äì2009).\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. January 25, 2009. Although McIntosh was not originally interested in being an administrator, once the school became an independent college he decided he wanted to remain president and see it through its early growing pains. The college was accredited as a four-year degree granting institution in December 1948. Enrollment reached 2,000 in 1949. McIntosh left ISC in 1959 to become president of Long Beach State College, and was succeeded by Donald E. Walker. In 1963, ISC was renamed for the fifth and final time to Idaho State University, reflecting its new status as a full four-year public university. In the ensuing years, ISU continuously expanded both its enrollment and the programs it offered. The presidency of Richard Bowen, from 1985‚Äì2005, is particularly regarded as an era of growth: as of 2006, ISU had colleges in arts and sciences, business, education, engineering, health, pharmacy, and technology. However, Bowen resigned after a vote of no confidence from the faculty, who were angered by generous pay raises for administration members in the midst of calls for fiscal austerity. Arthur Vailas, former vice chancellor of the University of Houston System and vice president of the University of Houston in Texas, became president of ISU on July 1, 2006. He succeeded Michael Gallagher, who had served as interim president since Bowen's retirement in 2005. In February 2011, the ISU faculty voted no confidence in Vailas and called for his resignation. This was also followed by a vote of no confidence by the students. Although Vailas faced mounting criticism and pressure from faculty and students to step down, he refused to resign and campus tension intensified, as the Idaho State Board of Education decided to suspend the university's faculty senate. As a result, in June 2011, the American Association of University Professors censured the ISU. Vailas announced his retirement from serving as President of ISU on August 9, 2017. He will continue to serve as President of ISU until his contract expires on June 17, 2018, at which point Kevin Satterlee, who was named as the 13th President of ISU by the Idaho State Board of Education on April 5, 2018, will take over. Points of interest The elevation of its main campus in Pocatello is approximately above sea level.

Student life ISU Quadrangle in 2007 Student government is administered by the Associated Students of Idaho State University (ASISU). Each year a president and vice-president are elected by the student body to administer and oversee a variety of activities either partially or fully funded by tuition-based fees. The ASISU Senate is the association's legislative body. Made up of 20 student members elected by the students of each individual college (allocation of seats being based on enrollment of each college), the ASISU Senate is primarily responsible for allocating the ASISU budget. The Student Activities Board, formerly the ASISU Program Board, oversees most of the student activity programming on campus. The board plans concerts, movie showings, homecoming activities, athletic- related events and other activities generally associated with student life. Reed Gym features recreational facilities, including a climbing wall, swimming pool, tennis courts, and more. The Pond Student Union operates a movie theater, billiard room, and bowling alley, and hosts many student club activities. Fine arts events are regularly featured at the performing arts theater. ISU has more than 140 registered professional, academic, cultural, service and social student organizations. The cultural organizations host some of the largest events on campus with their \\"Cultural Nights\\" celebrations. There are currently four fraternity and sorority chapters that are recognized by the university. Students at ISU are represented by the Associated Students of Idaho State University (ASISU). Every year the students elect a president, vice-president, and 20 senators. ASISU has administrative oversight of the 140 student organizations and provides funding to various groups that provide student involvement, leadership and service opportunities and events. Student media on campus includes The Bengal, a weekly student-run newspaper and KISU- FM (91.1). KISU-FM broadcasts from the first floor of the Pond Student Union, serving the university and surrounding communities with alternative music, NPR programming, and live coverage of ISU women athletics.

Athletics ISU Athletics wordmark The Idaho State University Bengals compete as a member school of the Big Sky Conference in the NCAA Division I FCS. ISU won the NCAA Division I-AA national championship in football in 1981. It also won NCAA national championships in boxing as Idaho State College in 1953 and 1957. In more recent years ISU has been competitive in track and field, winning the Big Sky Conference Indoor title in 2005 and 2006. The women's track and field team won their first outdoors women's Big Sky conference in 2007 with a score of 140.5 over Weber State. Dave Nielson was named the Big Sky Coach of the Year in women's track and field, and was later named the Mountain Region's Outdoor Women's Coach of the Year. Home football games are played at Holt Arena, which has a seating capacity of 12,000 for football games and is the oldest enclosed stadium on a college campus in the United States. Holt Arena also hosts indoor track and field events. For years the Bengals enjoyed athletic rivalries with the Boise State Broncos and the University of Idaho Vandals of Moscow. However, in football these rivalries diminished significantly after both BSU and UI left the Big Sky in 1996 to move up to Division I-A. The Bengals still enjoy a healthy rivalry in basketball with both the University of Idaho, who they have dominated in recent years; and Boise State, who has dominated ISU in recent years. With the diminishment of the rivalries with both UI and BSU in football, the Weber State Wildcats of Ogden, Utah, Montana State Bobcats of Bozeman, and the Montana Grizzlies of Missoula, have become ISU's main football rivals. Idaho State also offers a rugby program that plays in Division II.

Elements of Thermodynamics, Addison-Wesley Publishing, Reading MA, p. 43.) For a simple system, with only one type of particle (atom or molecule), a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles. However, for systems which are undergoing a chemical reaction, there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process. In this case, the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved, no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of. Mathematically: \\\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j=b_i where N_j is the number of j-type molecules, a_{ij} is the number of atoms of element i in molecule j and bi is the total number of atoms of element i in the system, which remains constant, since the system is closed. There will be one such equation for each different element in the system. In thermodynamics, a closed system is important for solving complicated thermodynamic problems. It allows the elimination of some external factors that could alter the results of the experiment or problem thus simplifying it. A closed system can also be used in situations where thermodynamic equilibrium is required to simplify the situation. =In quantum physics= This equation, called Schr√∂dinger's equation, describes the behavior of an isolated or closed quantum system, that is, by definition, a system which does not interchange information (i.e. energy and/or matter) with another system.

In chemistry In chemistry, a closed system is where no reactants or products can escape, only heat can be exchanged freely (e.g. an ice cooler). A closed system can be used when conducting chemical experiments where temperature is not a factor (i.e. reaching thermal equilibrium). In engineering In an engineering context, a closed system is a bound system, i.e. defined, in which every input is known and every resultant is known (or can be known) within a specific time.

Plot A small group of Sleestak assemble in an underground trap designed to capture a pig-like creature, installing a temporary periscope to spy on the pig. Ta runs into the pig, who chases him away. Meanwhile, Will sharpens a knife at the base of High Bluff while Holly watches Rick on the pendant. Ta arrives and sees Will's knife.

Rick awakes beneath the opening into which he fell. He finds himself surrounded by Sleestak, realizing he is safe as long as he stays in the pool of light cast by the sun. Will and Holly arrive with rope to retrieve him, but are chased away by Grumpy, whose right leg slips into the cave-in while in pursuit of Spot. Watching the pendant, Holly sees that Rick has been taken to the Lost City. She and Will go to Enik and plead with him to help save Rick. Enik promises to find Rick's location, but not save him. He travels alone to the Library of Skulls, where he sees that Rick has been chained in the Nursery as food for the Sleestak hatchlings. Enik persuades the Council of the Sleestak to trade Rick for a pig like the one they had sought, then returns to the children and explains the situation. He adds that the newborn Sleestak will hatch at sunset and eat their father. Will and Holly return to the trap and cover it in branches and string it with a noose. In search of bait, they convince Ta that the noose is a swing and offer him the knife if he will sit on the swing. As Ta swings, the pig comes and charges, but falls into the trap. Will and Holly shunt the pig toward the Nursery, and the Sleestak leader returns Rick.

(IRA) in the United States is a form of \\"individual retirement plan\\",See paragraph 37 of subsection (a) of . provided by many financial institutions, that provides tax advantages for retirement savings. An individual retirement account is a type of \\"individual retirement arrangement\\"See 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.408-4. as described in IRS Publication 590, individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The term IRA, used to describe both individual retirement accounts and the broader category of individual retirement arrangements, encompasses an individual retirement account; a trust or custodial account set up for the exclusive benefit of taxpayers or their beneficiaries; and an individual retirement annuity,See, generally, subsection (b) of and 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.408-3. by which the taxpayers purchase an annuity contract or an endowment contract from a life insurance company. Types There are several types of IRAs: * Traditional IRA ‚Äì contributions are often tax-deductible (often simplified as \\"money is deposited before tax\\" or \\"contributions are made with pre-tax assets\\"), all transactions and earnings within the IRA have no tax impact, and withdrawals at retirement are taxed as income (except for those portions of the withdrawal corresponding to contributions that were not deducted). Depending upon the nature of the contribution, a traditional IRA may be a \\"deductible IRA\\" or a \\"non-deductible IRA\\". Traditional IRAs were introduced with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and made popular with the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. * Roth IRA ‚Äì contributions are made with after-tax assets, all transactions within the IRA have no tax impact, and withdrawals of contributed funds are tax-free. Named for Senator William V. Roth, Jr., the Roth IRA was introduced as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. ** myRA ‚Äì a 2014 Obama administration initiative based on the Roth IRA * SEP IRA ‚Äì a provision that allows an employer (typically a small business or self-employed individual) to make retirement plan contributions into a Traditional IRA established in the employee's name, instead of to a pension fund in the company's name. * SIMPLE IRA ‚Äì a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees that requires employer matching contributions to the plan whenever an employee makes a contribution. The plan is similar to a 401(k) plan, but with lower contribution limits and simpler (and thus less costly) administration. Although it is termed an IRA, it is treated separately. * Rollover IRA ‚Äì no real difference in tax treatment from a traditional IRA, but the funds come from a qualified plan or 403(b) account and are \\"rolled over\\" into the rollover IRA instead of contributed as cash. No other assets are commingled with these rollover amounts. * Conduit IRA ‚Äì Tool to transfer qualified investments from one account to another. In order to retain certain special tax treatments, funds may not be commingled with other types of assets, including other IRAs. The last two types, Rollover IRAs and Conduit IRAs, are viewed by some as obsolete under current tax law (their functions have been subsumed by the Traditional IRA), but this tax law is set to expire unless extended. However, some individuals still maintain these arrangements in order to keep track of the source of these assets. One key reason is that some qualified plans will accept rollovers from IRAs only if they are conduit/rollover IRAs. A self-directed IRA is the considered the same by the tax code, but refers to IRAs where the custodian allows the investor wider flexibility in choosing investments, typically including alternative investments. Some examples of these alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. While the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) has placed a few restrictions on what can be invested in, the IRA custodian may impose additional restrictions on what assets they will custody. Self-directed IRA custodians, or IRA custodians who specialize in alternative investments, are better equipped to handle transactions involving alternative investments. Some IRA custodians and some investment funds specialize in socially responsible investing, sometimes using public environmental, social and corporate governance ratings. Starting with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), many of the restrictions of what type of funds could be rolled into an IRA and what type of plans IRA funds could be rolled into were significantly relaxed. Additional legislation since 2001 has further relaxed restrictions. Essentially, most retirement plans can be rolled into an IRA after meeting certain criteria, and most retirement plans can accept funds from an IRA. An example of an exception is a non-governmental 457 plan which cannot be rolled into anything but another non-governmental 457 plan. The tax treatment of the above types of IRAs (except for Roth IRAs) are very similar, particularly for rules regarding distributions. SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs also have additional rules similar to those for qualified plans governing how contributions can and must be made and what employees are qualified to participate. Custodians Custodians can include: * Banks * Mutual fund companies, sometimes for the purpose of offering their own mutual funds * Brokerage firms, either independent or \\"captive\\" (affiliated with a specific mutual fund or insurance company) * Robo-advisors, which are web sites that use algorithms to generate investment recommendations * Life insurance companies Funding Individual retirement arrangements were introduced in 1974 with the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Taxpayers could contribute up to fifteen percent of their annual income or $1,500, whichever is less, each year and reduce their taxable income by the amount of their contributions. The contributions could be invested in a special United States bond paying six percent interest, annuities that begin paying upon reaching age 59, or a trust maintained by a bank or an insurance company. Initially, ERISA restricted IRAs to workers who were not covered by a qualified employment-based retirement plan. In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) allowed all working taxpayers under the age of 70 to contribute to an IRA, regardless of their coverage under a qualified plan. It also raised the maximum annual contribution to $2,000 and allowed participants to contribute $250 on behalf of a nonworking spouse. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 phased out the deduction for IRA contributions among workers covered by an employment-based retirement plan who earned more than $35,000 if single or over $50,000 if married filing jointly. Other taxpayers could still make nondeductible contributions to an IRA. The maximum amount allowed as an IRA contribution was $1,500 from 1975 to 1981, $2,000 from 1982 to 2001, $3,000 from 2002 to 2004, $4,000 from 2005 to 2007, $5,000 from 2008 to 2012, and $5,500 from 2013 to 2018. The maximum for tax years 2019 and 2020 is $6,000. Beginning in 2002, those over 50 years old could make an additional contribution of up to $1,000 called a \\"catch-up contribution\\". Current limitations: *An IRA can be funded only with cash or cash equivalents. Attempting to transfer any other type of asset into the IRA is a prohibited transaction and disqualifies the fund from its beneficial tax treatment. * Additionally, an IRA (or any other tax-advantaged retirement plan) can be funded only with what the IRS calls \\"taxable compensation\\". This in turn means that certain types of income cannot be used to contribute to an IRA; these include but are not limited to: ** Any unearned taxable income. ** Any tax-exempt income, apart from military combat pay. *** Social Security payments, whether retirement pensions or disability payments, may or may not be taxable, but in either case are not eligible. ** Child support payments received. (On the other hand, alimony and separate maintenance payments, if taxable, are eligible.) ** Graduate school stipends, unless they are reported on a W-2 (indicating that they were compensation for services rendered, usually teaching). *Rollovers, transfers, and conversions between IRAs and other retirement arrangements can include any asset. *2014 and 2015: the total contributions a person can make to all of their traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than the lesser amount of either: $5,500 ($6,500 if they are age 50 or older), or their earned income for the year. *This limit applies to the total annual contributions to both Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs. For example, a person aged 45, who put $3,500 into a traditional IRA this year so far, can either put $2,000 more into this traditional IRA, or $2,000 in a Roth IRA, or some combination of those. *The amount of the traditional IRA contributions that can be deducted is partially reduced for levels of income beyond a threshold, and eliminated entirely beyond another threshold, if the contributor or the contributor's spouse is covered by an employer-based retirement plan. The dollar amounts of the thresholds vary depending on tax filing status (single, married, etc.) and on which spouse is covered at work (see IRS Publication 590-A, \\"Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)\\"). Restricted investments Once money is inside an IRA, the IRA owner can direct the custodian to use the cash to purchase most types of publicly traded securities (traditional investments), and non-publicly traded securities (alternative investments). Specific assets such as collectibles (e.g., art, baseball cards, and rare coins) and life insurance cannot be held in an IRA. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) only outlines what is not allowed in an IRA. Some assets are allowed according to the IRC, but the custodians may add additional restrictions for accounts held in their custody. For example, the IRC allows an IRA to own a piece of rental property, but certain custodians may not allow this to be held in their custody. While there are only a few restrictions on what can be invested inside an IRA, some restrictions pertain to actions which would create a prohibited transaction with those investments. For example, an IRA can own a piece of rental real estate, but the IRA owner cannot receive or provide any immediate benefit from/to this real estate investment. An example of such benefit would be the use of the real estate as the owner's personal residence, allowing a parent to live in the property, or allowing the IRA account owner to fix a leaky toilet. The IRS specifically states that custodians may impose their own policies above the rules imposed by the IRS.Neither custodians nor administrators can provide advice. Many IRA custodians limit available investments to traditional brokerage accounts such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Investments in an asset class such as real estate would only be permitted in an IRA if the real estate is held indirectly via a security such as a publicly traded or non- traded real estate investment trust (REIT). Self-directed IRA custodians/administrators can allow real estate and other non-traditional assets held in forms other than a REIT, such as a piece of rental property, raw land, or fishing rights. Publicly traded securities such as options, futures or other derivatives are allowed in IRAs, but certain custodians or brokers may restrict their use. For example, some options brokers allow their IRA accounts to hold stock options, but others do not. Using certain derivatives or investments that involve leverage may be allowed by the IRC, it may also cause the IRA to pay taxes under the rules of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT). Self-directed IRAs which hold alternative investments such as real estate, horses, or intellectual property, can involve more complexity than IRAs which only hold stocks or mutual funds. An IRA may borrow or loan money but any such loan must not be personally guaranteed by the owner of the IRA. Any loan on assets in the IRA would be required to be a non-recourse loan. The loan could not be personally secured by the IRA account owner, or the IRA itself. It can only be secured by the asset in question. The owner of the IRA may not pledge the IRA as security against an outside debt. Distribution of funds Although funds can be distributed from an IRA at any time, there are limited circumstances when money can be distributed or withdrawn from the account without penalties. Unless an exception applies, money can typically be withdrawn penalty free as taxable income from an IRA once the owner reaches age 59 years and 6 months. Also, non-Roth owners must begin taking distributions of at least the calculated minimum amounts by April 1 of the year after reaching age 70. If the required minimum distribution (RMD) is not taken the penalty is 50% of the amount that should have been taken. The amount that must be taken is calculated based on a factor taken from the appropriate IRS table and is based on the life expectancy of the owner and possibly his or her spouse as beneficiary if applicable. Withdrawals are taxable unless paid to a charity after age 72; this cutoff has changed over time. Payments to charities are called Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD). At the death of the owner, distributions must continue and if there is a designated beneficiary, distributions can be based on the life expectancy of the beneficiary. There are several exceptions to the rule that penalties apply to distributions before age 59. Each exception has detailed rules that must be followed to be exempt from penalties.This group of penalty exemptions are popularly known as hardship withdrawals. The exceptions include: *The portion of unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of adjusted gross income *Distributions that are not more than the cost of medical insurance while unemployed *Disability (defined as not being able to engage in any substantial gainful activity) *Amounts distributed to beneficiaries of a deceased IRA owner *Distributions in the form of an annuity (see substantially equal periodic payments) *Distributions that are not more than the qualified higher education expenses of the owner or their children or grandchildren *Distributions to buy, build, or rebuild a first home ($10,000 lifetime maximum) *Distribution due to an IRS levy of the plan There are a number of other important details that govern different situations. For Roth IRAs with only contributed funds the basis can be withdrawn before age 59 without penalty (or tax) on a first in first out basis, and a penalty would apply only on any growth (the taxable amount) that was taken out before 59 where an exception didn't apply. Amounts converted from a traditional to a Roth IRA must stay in the account for a minimum of 5 years to avoid having a penalty on withdrawal of basis unless one of the above exceptions applies. If the contribution to the IRA was nondeductible or the IRA owner chose not to claim a deduction for the contribution, distributions of those nondeductible amounts are tax and penalty free. Bankruptcy status In the case of Rousey v. Jacoway, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 4, 2005, that under section 522(d)(10)(E) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (), a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt his or her IRA, up to the amount necessary for retirement, from the bankruptcy estate. The Court indicated that because rights to withdrawals are based on age, IRAs should receive the same protection as other retirement plans. Thirty-four states already had laws effectively allowing an individual to exempt an IRA in bankruptcy, but the Supreme Court decision allows federal protection for IRAs. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 expanded the protection for IRAs. Certain IRAs (rollovers from SEP or Simple IRAs, Roth IRAs, individual IRAs) are exempt up to at least $1,000,000 (adjusted periodically for inflation) without having to show necessity for retirement.See subsection (n) of . The law provides that \\"such amount may be increased if the interests of justice so require.\\" Other IRAs (rollovers from most employer sponsored retirement plans (401(k)s, etc.) and non-rollover SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) are entirely exempt.11 USC section 522(n); see also Internal Revenue Code of 1986 sections 408 and 408A. The 2005 BAPCPA also increased the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit for IRA deposits at banks. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has ruled that if an IRA engages in a \\"prohibited transaction\\" under Internal Revenue Code sections 408(e)(2) and 4975(c)(1), the assets in the IRA will no longer qualify for bankruptcy protection.See Willis v. Menotte (In re Willis), 424 F. App'x 80, docket no. 10-11980 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam). With respect to inherited IRAs, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in the case of Clark v. Rameker in June 2014, that funds in an inherited IRA do not qualify as \\"retirement funds\\" within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy exemption statute, 11 U.S.C. section 522(b)(3)(C).Clark v. Rameker, case no. 13-299, U.S. Supreme Court (June 12, 2014). Protection from creditors There are several options of protecting an IRA: (1) roll it over into a qualified plan like a 401(k), (2) take a distribution, pay the tax and protect the proceeds along with the other liquid assets, or (3) rely on the state law exemption for IRAs. For example, the California exemption statute provides that IRAs and self-employed plans' assets \\"are exempt only to the extent necessary to provide for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor, taking into account all resources that are likely to be available for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires\\". What is reasonably necessary is determined on a case by case basis, and the courts will take into account other funds and income streams available to the beneficiary of the plan. Debtors who are skilled, well-educated, and have time left until retirement are usually afforded little protection under the California statute as the courts presume that such debtors will be able to provide for retirement. Many states have laws that prohibit judgments from lawsuits to be satisfied by seizure of IRA assets. For example, IRAs are protected up to $500,000 in Nevada from Writs of Execution.Nevada Revised Statutes Section 21.075 - Civil Practice onecle - Court Opinions However, this type of protection does not usually exist in the case of divorce, failure to pay taxes, deeds of trust, and fraud. In accordance with the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, IRAs are protected from creditors during bankruptcy up to $1,000,000 (inflation-adjusted; $1,245,475 as of 2014). An exception is that inherited IRAs do not qualify for an exemption from the bankruptcy estate and thus federal law does not protect them from creditors in bankruptcy. Some state laws, however, may protect inherited IRAs from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing An IRA owner may not borrow money from the IRA except for a 2-month period in a calendar year. Such a transaction disqualifies the IRA from special tax treatment. An IRA may incur debt or borrow money secured by its assets but the IRA owner may not guarantee or secure the loan personally. An example of this is a real estate purchase within a self-directed IRA along with a non-recourse mortgage. According to one commentator, some minor planning can turn the 2-month period previously mentioned into an indefinite loan.IRA Loans. However, in Bobrow v. Commissioner, the US Tax Court has ruled that this approach is in violation of the US Tax Code. Income from debt-financed property in an IRA may generate unrelated business taxable income in the IRA. The rules regarding IRA rollovers and transfers allow the IRA owner to perform an \\"indirect rollover\\" to another IRA. An indirect rollover can be used to temporarily \\"borrow\\" money from the IRA, once in a twelve-month period. The money must be placed in an IRA arrangement within 60 days, or the transaction will be deemed an early withdrawal (subject to the appropriate withdrawal taxes and penalties) and may not be replaced. Double taxation Double taxation still occurs within these tax-sheltered investment arrangements. For example, foreign dividends may be taxed at their point of origin, and the IRS does not recognize this tax as a creditable deduction. There is some controversy over whether this violates tax treaties, such as the Convention Between Canada and the United States of America With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital. Inheriting If the IRA owner dies, different rules are applied depending on who inherits the IRA (spouse, other beneficiary, multiple beneficiaries, and so on). In case of spouse inherited IRAs, the owner's spouse has the following options: * treat the IRA account as his or her own, which means that he or she can name a beneficiary for the assets, continue to contribute to the IRA and avoid having to take distributions. This avoids paying the extra 10% tax on early distributions from an IRA. * rollover the IRA funds into another plan and take distributions as a beneficiary. Distributions will be determined by the required minimum distribution rules based on the surviving spouse's life expectancy. * disclaim up to 100% of the IRA assets, which, besides avoiding extra taxable income, enables their children to inherit the IRA assets * take all of the IRA assets out in one lump-sum, which can subject the spouse to federal taxes if particular requirements are not met In case of non-spouse inherited IRAs, the beneficiary cannot choose to treat the IRA as his or her own, but the following options are available: * take out the assets in a lump- sum cash distribution, which may lead the beneficiary to be subject to federal taxes that could take away a significant portion of the assets. * disclaim all or part of the assets in the IRA for up to 9 months after the IRA owner's death. * if the beneficiary is older than the IRA owner, he or she can take distributions from the account based on the IRA owner's age. In case of multiple beneficiaries the distribution amounts are based on the oldest beneficiary's age. Alternatively, multiple beneficiaries can split the inherited IRA into separate accounts, in which case the rules will apply separately to each separate account.Presti&Naegele; Newsletter How do I? Get the most from my inherited IRA? Statistics Detailed statistics on IRAs have been collected by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, in its EBRI IRA Database (Center for Research on IRAs), and various analyses performed. An overview is given in . Some highlights from the 2008 data follow: * The average and median IRA account balance was $54,863 and $15,756, respectively, while the average and median IRA individual balance (all accounts from the same person combined) was $69,498 and $20,046. The average is significantly higher than the median (over three times higher), reflecting significant positive skew ‚Äì very large balances increase the average. ** Average and median balances increased with age, reaching a maximum in the 65‚Äì69 age group, before leveling off for 70 and over. * Rollovers overwhelm contributions ‚Äì the overwhelming majority of IRA contributions, in dollar terms, were from rollovers, rather than new contributions ‚Äì over 10 times as much is added to IRAs from rollovers than new contributions. ** While many rollovers were small (28.5% were less than $5,000, and 53.1% were less than $25,000), a significant number of rollovers were quite large, with 20.2% being more than $100,000. * IRAs were divided by type as 33.6% traditional IRAs, 33.4% rollover IRAs (combined with the traditional IRAs, 67 percent), 23.4% Roth IRAs, and 9.6% SEPs and SIMPLEs. * Excluding SEPs and SIMPLEs (i.e., concerning traditional, rollover, and Roth IRAs), 15.1% of individuals holding an IRA contributed to one. The percentage was much higher for Roth IRAs: 7.2% of owners of traditional or rollover IRAs (same for contribution purposes) contributed, while 29.5% of owners of Roth IRAs contributed. * Contributions are concentrated at the maximum amount ‚Äì of those contributing to an IRA, approximately 40% contributed the maximum (whether contributing to traditional or Roth), and 46.7% contributed close to the maximum (in the $5,000‚Äì$6,000 range). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on IRAs in November 2014. This report gives the GAO's estimate on the number of taxpayers with IRAs as well as the estimated account balances. Here are some highlights from the report: * For tax year 2011 (the most recent year available), an estimated 43 million taxpayers had individual retirement accounts (IRAs) with a total reported fair market value (FMV) of $5.2 trillion. * Few taxpayers had aggregated balances exceeding $5 million as of 2011. Generally, taxpayers with IRA balances greater than $5 million tend to have adjusted gross incomes greater than $200,000, be joint filers, and are age 65 or older. * In 2014, the federal government will forgo an estimated $17.45 billion in tax revenue from IRAs, which Congress created to ensure equitable tax treatment for those not covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans. * 98.5% of taxpayers have IRA account balances at $1,000,000 or less. * 1.2% of tax payers have IRA account balances at $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. * 0.2% (or 83,529) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 * 0.1% (or 36,171) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 * <0.1% (or 7,952) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 * <0.1% (or 791) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 * <0.1% (or 314) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $25,000,000 or more =Retirement savings= While the average (mean) and median IRA individual balance in 2008 were approximately $70,000 and $20,000 respectively, higher balances are not rare. 6.3% of individuals had total balances of $250,000 or more (about 12.5 times the median), and in rare cases, individuals own IRAs with very substantial balances, in some cases $100 million or above (about 5,000 times the median individual balance). This can occur when IRA owners invest in shares of private companies, and the share value subsequently rises substantially. In November 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that stated there were an estimated 314 taxpayers with IRA account balances of greater than $25,000,000. Also that there are an estimate of 791 taxpayers with IRA account balances between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The purpose of this report was to study individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and the account valuations. There were concerns raised about whether the tax incentives encourage new or additional saving. Congress is reexamining retirement tax incentives as part of tax reform. GAO was asked to measure IRA balances and assess IRS enforcement of IRA laws. According to a study done by the National Institute on Retirement Security, titled \\"The Continuing Retirement Savings Crisis\\", 45% of working Americans do not own any retirement account assets, whether in an employer- based 401(k) type plan or an IRA. Furthermore, the typical working household has virtually no retirement savings - the median retirement account balance is $2,500 for all working-age households and $14,500 for near-retirement households.http://www.nirsonline.org/storage/nirs/documents/RSC%202015/final_rsc_2015.pdf While inflation-adjusted stock market values generally rose from 1978 to 1997, in March 2013, they were lower than during the period 1998 through 2007.\\"S&P; 500 Stock Price Index (SP500)/Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL)\\", 1960-March 2013 FRED Graph, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank This has caused IRAs to perform substantially more poorly than expected when current retirees were investing the bulk of their savings in them. In 2010, Duncan Black wrote in an opinion column in USA Today that the median household retirement account balance for workers aged 55 to 64 was $120,000, which \\"will provide only a trivial supplement to Social Security\\", but a third of households had no retirement savings at all.

It is the capital of Tiznit Province and recorded a population of 74,699 in the 2014 Moroccan census. Jewish silversmiths moved into the town and established its reputation as the center of silver and silver handicraft in Morocco. Tiznit is well known for its silver jewelry, mint, daggers and sabres. Located near the coast, Sultan Moulay Hassan settled in the area in 1881 to exert his control over dissident Berber tribes of the Souss. In 1912, Ahmed al-Hiba (El Hib), a populist rebel overthrew the French government and proclaimed himself sultan of Tiznit in the town's mosque. He conquered the Sous by uniting the tribes of the Anti Atlas Mountains. He went on to attack Marrakech but was suppressed by the French. The province of Tiznit is in the western side of the Anti-Atlas. Tiznit, some 80 km south of Agadir, is a strategic crossroads between the mountainous Tafraoute region, the Atlantic coast and the great Moroccan Sahara. Historically speaking, Tiznit was the starting point of the famous dynasty of Almoravides who came to rule Morocco from Madrasa El Ouaggaguia in Aglou (a coastal village 14 km from Tiznit). The history of the city is also linked to the particular importance the Alawite Sultans granted to the city. Sultan Moulay Hassan I visited Tiznit twice, the first time in 1882 and the second time in 1886. Among the monuments that characterize the city of Tiznit are Khalifa Palace, El M√©chouar Place and the Grand Mosque. The old Medina of Tiznit is enclosed by a wall of five historic gates: Bab Aglou, Bab el Khemis, Bab Targa, Bab el Maader and Bab Oulad Jerrar. All of these gates are of Alawite tradition and strongly resemble those of the city of Essaouira. Tiznit is the place of manufacture of the finest jewels of the South of Morocco. There are daggers, horse saddles, Fantasia rifles, anklets, pendants that women attach to their chests or foreheads all decorated with semi-precious stones and enamels. What distinguishes the city of Tiznit is its dynamic civil society. There are more than 200 associations working in a number of areas, particularly development, education, culture, philanthropy, sport, and music; a fact which makes the city the center of a remarkable cultural radiation in the south of Morocco. Also, Tiznit has a number of public facilities; there are five socio-cultural centers in the city, Mokhtar Soussi Multimedia Library, 10 sport fields for proximity, Almassira Stadium with good grass, Olympic Swimming Pool, Cinema Hall Bahia, road station, Museum of Heritage, Handicraft Complex, 4 rated hotels etc. The city council of Tiznit is highly hailed by people for the efforts it invests to keep the city a tourist attraction.

According to the organization, it had more than 38 million members as of 2018. The magazine and bulletin it sends to its members are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States. AARP was founded in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus (a retired educator from California) and Leonard Davis (later the founder of the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies). It is an influential lobbying group in the United States. AARP sells paid memberships, and markets insurance and other services to its members. History According to the group's official history, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958. AARP evolved from the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA), which Andrus had established in 1947 to promote her philosophy of productive aging, and to promote health insurance for retired teachers. After ten years, she opened the organization to all Americans over 50, creating AARP. Today, the NRTA is a division within AARP. Critics of AARP offer an alternative version of the group's origins. 60 Minutes reported in a 1978 expos√© that AARP had been established as a marketing device by Leonard Davis, founder of the Colonial Penn Group insurance companies, after he met Ethel Percy Andrus. According to critics, until the 1980s AARP was controlled by Davis, who promoted its image as a non-profit advocate of retirees in order to sell insurance to members. Possibly as a result of this report, AARP conducted a competitive bidding process, and, in 1980, shifted the insurance contracts available to members to Prudential Financial. In the 1990s, the United States Senate investigated AARP's non-profit status, with Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, then chairman of the United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy, questioning the organization's tax-exempt status in congressional hearings. According to Charles Blahous, the investigations did not reveal sufficient evidence to change the organization's status, though in an interview years later by The Des Moines Register, Senator Simpson remained \\"troubled by AARP's practices\\", calling AARP \\"the biggest marketing operation in America and money-maker\\" and an organization whose practices are \\"the greatest abuse of American generosity I witnessed in my time in the U.S. Senate\\". The organization was originally named the American Association of Retired Persons, but in 1999, it officially changed its name to \\"AARP\\" (pronounced one letter at a time, \\"ay ay ar pee\\"), to reflect that its focus was no longer American retirees. AARP no longer requires that members be retired, and there are no longer any age restrictions even for a full membership. Activities Former United States Secretary of Labor Perez at AARP's Life@50+ event in 2015 =Overview= AARP addresses issues affecting older Americans through lobbying efforts at the state and national governmental level, an activity permitted by its 501(c)(4) status. The organization says that it is non-partisan and does not support, oppose or give money to any candidates or political parties. The total revenue for 2006 was approximately $1 billion and it spent $23 million on lobbying. Middle- class security has been a major focus for the organization in recent years. AARP also provides extensive consumer information, volunteer opportunities, and events including an annual National Event & Expo. AARP volunteers packing food for older Americans in need at a packing event in Miami AARP launched Life Reimagined in May 2013, calling it a \\"first-of-its-kind series of online and offline experiences that guide people through life transitions by helping them discover new possibilities and connect with a community of people pursuing similar passions and goals\\".

The AARP Foundation's website claims the non-profit \\"wants to win back opportunity for those now in crisis, so thousands of vulnerable low-income Americans 50+ can regain their foothold, continue to serve as anchors for their families and communities, and ensure that their best life is still within reach\\". Key areas of focus are hunger, income, housing, and isolation. The Foundation's vision is \\"a country that is free of poverty where no older person feels vulnerable\\". One of the goals of the AARP Foundation is its Drive to End Hunger. In 2011, AARP and AARP Foundation formed a relationship with NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports to increase awareness of hunger in America with the No. 24 Drive to End Hunger race car and related food drives. Through the Drive to End Hunger program, AARP also sponsored Hendrick driver Kasey Kahne, beginning in 2016. =AARP Driver Safety= In 1979, AARP introduced the nation's first driver safety course geared towards older adults. AARP Driver Safety, which can be completed in a classroom setting or online, teaches defensive driving techniques and provides \\"added information on age-related cognitive and physical changes that affect driving\\". The course is instructed and promoted by volunteers throughout the U.S. In addition to course fees, the program is supported by a grant from the automobile manufacturer, Toyota. Over half million drivers completed the course in 2012 and over 15 million people completed the courses since 1979. =AARP publications and broadcasts= English-language AARP The Magazine, with a circulation of approximately 37 million and the AARP Bulletin with 30 million as of 2016, are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States. * The organization publishes AARP The Magazine (known until 2002 as Modern Maturity), a lifestyle magazine for people 50+. Established in 1958, the magazine is distributed bi-monthly to AARP members. * AARP Bulletin, subtitled \\"The Newspaper for 50-Plus America\\", is published monthly, 10 times per year. * The Journal, released by AARP's International Office, is a policy publication on health and financial security issues facing a global population. * In 2018, the digital publication titled Sisters from AARP was launched.

Health care AARP has been active in health care policy debates since the 1960s, and its recent engagement is a reflection of this long-standing involvement. AARP's public stances influenced the United States Congress' passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D, in 2003, and also influenced the Congress by resisting radical changes to Social Security in 2005.Barbara Berkman/Sarah D'Ambruoso Handbook of Social Work in Health and Aging, p. 820, Oxford University Press US, 2006 Larry N. Gerston American Federalism, p. 79, M. E. Sharpe, 2007 AARP also addressed health care issues in their campaign targeting the 2008 elections with Divided We Fail. In a 2003 editorial in the Los Angeles Times, critic Dale Van Atta wrote that AARP was doing unauthorized lobbying for its membership and was lobbying against the best interests of its membership. He said that by lobbying for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, AARP leaders had betrayed the membership. In early 2017, AARP strongly opposed the American Health Care Act of 2017, saying that older Americans would be unfairly burdened with higher premiums and smaller tax credits. =Health insurance= Approximately seven million people have AARP-branded health insurance, including drug coverage and Medigap, as of April 2007 and the association earns more income from selling insurance to members than from membership dues. In 2008, AARP began offering new health insurance products: an HMO for Medicare recipients, in partnership with UnitedHealth Group; and a PPO and \\"a high-deductible insurance policy that could be used with a health savings account\\" to people aged 50‚Äì64, in partnership with Aetna. While AARP is not an insurer, it allows its name to be used by insurance companies in the sale of products, for which it is paid a commission.Benjamin Lipson JK Lasser's Choosing the Right Long-term Care Insurance, p. 140, John Wiley & Sons, 2002 In a November 2008 editorial, The Des Moines Register and the Canada Free Press called AARP a lobbying group masquerading as a non-profit, meanwhile charging high membership fees and selling expensive private health care plans. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in 2008 that the \\"limited benefit\\" insurance plans offered by AARP through UnitedHealth provided inadequate coverage and were marketed deceptively. One plan offered $5,000 for surgery that may cost two or three times that amount. AARP markets self-branded Medigap policies. As of October 2009, Medical care reform contained a proposal to trim an associated program Medicare Advantage, which was expected to increase demand for Medigap policies. However, as cited above, AARP also brands a Medicare Advantage plan (MedicareComplete), and would also be subject to cuts under health care reform. According to an Annenberg Public Policy Center report, critics have said AARP had a conflict of interest in supporting the Act, because it \\"derives income from the sale of health and life insurance policies\\", by licensing its brand to insurance dealers such as New York Life,AARP Life Insurance Program , retrieved October 31, 2006 and would benefit financially from passage of the legislation. In 2004, BusinessWeek said questions have arisen in the past about whether AARP's commercial interests may conflict with those of its membership, and characterizes many of the funds and insurance policies that AARP markets as providing considerably less benefit than seniors could get on their own. By Raising Its Voice, AARP Raises Questions BusinessWeek, 14 March 2005, accessed 7 January 2008 =Single-payer= Single-payer advocates have criticized AARP for not supporting the single- payer or public option during the health care debate.Should universal care advocates bite their tongues on single-payer? Remapping Debate, June 8, 2011, By Mike Alberti Single-payer advocates supported H.R. 676, proposed by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI). AARP released a statement explaining to its members why the organization was not supporting H.R. 676: > Starting over with a new, \\"single-payer\\" program will not eliminate the > problems Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP currently face, such as the spiraling > costs of procedures and prescription medications, as well as technological > advances that are often not comprehensively tested to be proven safe or > effective before marketing. H.R. 676 does not address the problem of > increasing health-care costs. Rather, it allows costs to continue to grow, > which will result in unaffordable coverage. John Rother, AARP's former chief lobbyist, said the single-payer model would \\"disrupt the system that is currently in place\\" and \\"require a very significant tax increase\\". But Rother admitted that it would be possible to design a system that would avoid these problems. Since AARP's priorities now are to protect the current programs and implement the Affordable Care Act, Rother said that any effort to promote single payer would be undercutting health reform. Rother said: \\"To go to a single-payer, you do have to trust government. The climate we're in right now is a very hostile climate for something like that.\\" Rother also thought that an educational effort on the benefits of single payer would undercut the ACA. AARP has not published any material relating to single-payer health insurance on its website, in its several hundred page policy book, or through its Public Policy Institute. Approximately 60,000 AARP members quit AARP between July 1 and August 18, 2009, in a controversy that arose over AARP's support for U.S. health care reform. FOX News stated: \\"The Atlanta-based American Seniors Association, which is opposed to President Obama's health care plan, is trying to capitalize on growing public dissatisfaction with the AARP.\\" AARP spokesman Drew Nannis responded that AARP loses about 300,000 members a month on average, and the controversial 60,000 of those that had left had specified leaving over the health care debate. Nannis also stated that the AARP gained 400,000 members and that 1.5 million members renewed their memberships within the same period of time. The American Seniors Association is a for-profit organization operated by the American Seniors Association Holding Group, Inc (ASAHG, Inc). Social Security Since March 2012, AARP's \\"You've Earned a Say\\" campaign has sought to foster nonpartisan conversations about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. The Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch reported: \\"AARP took the debate about Medicare and Social Security from what it called behind closed doors in Washington to a series of town hall meetings around the country to make sure retirees have a voice in the discussion.\\"Hazard, Carol.\\"Retirees highlight Social Security, Medicare at AARP meeting\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch, Richmond, VA 20 March 2012. Retrieved on 2013-5-28. In June 2011, AARP dropped its long-standing opposition to cutting Social Security benefits. A news release emphasized that \\"AARP has not changed its position on Social Security\\". In 2005, AARP led the effort to kill President George W. Bush's plan for partial privatization. AARP now has concluded that change is inevitable, and it wants to be at the table to try to minimize the pain. John Rother, AARP's policy chief and a prime mover for the new position, said: \\"The ship was sailing. I wanted to be at the wheel when that happens.\\" AARP declined to join a coalition of about 300 unions, women's groups, and liberal advocacy organizations created to fight Social Security benefit cuts. Rother said, \\"The coalition's role was to kind of anchor the left, and our role is going to be to actually get something done\\".Key Seniors Association Pivots on Benefit Cut By LAURA MECKLER, Wall Street Journal, JUNE 17, 2011 Executive compensation, benefits, and travel Criticism has also been leveled at the salaries that AARP staff earn, and the use of first class and business class travel for short trips. According to AARP's 2014 IRS annual return, Chief Executive Officer Addison B. Rand received $1,698,289 of salary and benefits from AARP and its subsidiaries.\\"Form 990: Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax\\". AARP. Guidestar. December 31, 2014. Board members, officers, and key employees flew first class on flights longer than five hours unless business class was available. The Chief Executive Officer flew first- class on flights longer than 90 minutes. AARP reported that it had spent $8,694,890 on compensation of its officers, directors, and key employees during 2014. Charity Navigator rated the AARP Foundation overall at 91.22 out of 100 possible points (a \\"four star\\" rating), giving it a financial rating of 88.26 out of 100 (\\"three stars\\") and an accountability and transparency rating of 96.00 (\\"four stars\\") for its fiscal year 2017.

It is served by Smara Airport and Smara bus station. History The largest city in its province, Smara was founded in the Saguia el-Hamra as an oasis for travellers in 1869. In the center of the city the remains of a stone fortress can be found, the Zawiy Maalainin, which enclosed a mosque. The Maalainin lived there from 1830 until 1912. It was made a capital and religious center in 1902 by shaykh Ma al-'Aynayn, in what was then Spanish Sahara. The location of the city was intended to ensure its becoming a caravan trade hub in the sparsely populated Sahara desert. The enlargement of Smara was carried out by local Sahrawis as well as craftsmen sent by the sultan Hassan I. In 1902, shaykh Ma al-'Aynayn moved to Smara and declared it his holy capital. Among other things, he created an important Islamic library, and the town became a center of religious learning. In 1904 the shaykh declared himself an imam and called for holy war (jihad) against French colonialism, which was increasingly pressing into the Sahara at this time. During the campaign against Ma al-'Aynayn, Smara was sacked almost completely in 1913 by the French Army, and its library destroyed.\\"After a defeat of the French at Lebeyratt, Colonel Mouret mounts an attack against Smara. Leaving from Teyarett (in the north-west of Atar) on the 9th of February, he arrives in the Zemmour on the first of March to sack the holy city (Smara). He finds her empty of all people.\\" (Le Rumeur (Guy): Le Grand M√©hariste, Paris, Berger Levrault) The town was then handed over to the Spanish. In 1934 the town was once again destroyed after Sahrawi rebellions against the Spanish occupation. =The Vieuchange brothers= Reaching Ma el Ainain's mysterious Smara was the goal of the brothers Vieuchange, early 20th-century French writers and romantics. Michel Vieuchange's painful journey through the rebel-held Sahrawi lands in 1930 disguised as a Berber tribeswoman, eventually reaching Smara on 1 November 1930, and the dysentery that led to his death on the return, is documented in his journals. Comprising seven notebooks and more than 200 photographs, the account was published posthumously in 1932 as Smara: The Forbidden City (1932) by his brother Jean and became a bestseller. =After 1975= In 1975, Morocco took control of Saguia Elhamra as Spain withdrew, according to the Madrid Accords. The Moroccan army took the city from the Polisario Front in 1976. Near Tindouf, Algeria, there still exists a Sahrawi refugee camp named after Smara. It is one of the four camps of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic administration in Algeria.According to the American Refugee Committee (ARC), approximately 39,000 Sahrawi refugees live in Asward camp, from Tindouf; some 38,000 live in Dakhla camp, which is the furthest at from Tindouf; an estimated 39,000 refugees live in Laayoune camp, about from Tindouf; and more than 39,000 Sahrawi refugees live in Smara camp, which is from Tindouf. The number of refugees in the camps has, according to ARC, quadrupled since 1979. The town is controlled by the Moroccan authorities, as part of what the government terms its Southern Provinces, and enclosed by a section of the Moroccan Wall. Transport CTM, Supratours and Satas companies have daily travels from Smara to Agadir. Supratours have daily travel from Smara to Laayoune.

It is thought that about 1‚Äì5% of infected persons develop cancer as a result of the infection with HTLV-I over their lifetimes. Adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) was discovered in 1977 in Japan. The symptoms of ATL were different from other lymphomas known at the time. It was suggested that ATL is caused by the infection of a retrovirus called ATLV. Strikingly, ATLV had the transforming activity in vitro. These studies established that the retrovirus infection is the cause of ATL. The retrovirus is now generally called HTLV-I because later studies proved that ATLV is the same as the firstly identified human retrovirus called HTLV discovered by Bernard Poiesz and Francis Ruscetti and their co-workers in the laboratory of Robert C. Gallo at the National Cancer Institute. Infection with HTLV-I, like infection with other retroviruses, probably occurs for life. A patient infected with HTLV can be diagnosed when antibodies against HTLV-1 are detected in the serum. Virology HTLV-1 is a retrovirus belonging to the family retroviridae and the genus deltaretrovirus. It has a positive-sense RNA genome that is reverse transcribed into DNA and then integrated into the cellular DNA. Once integrated, HTLV-1 continues to exist only as a provirus which can spread from cell to cell through a viral synapse. Few, if any, free virions are produced and there is usually no detectable virus in the blood plasma though the virus is present in genital secretions. Like HIV, HTLV-1 predominately infects CD4+ T cells. The viral RNA is packed into the icosahedral capsid which is contained inside the protein inner envelope. The lipid outer envelope is of host cell origin but contains viral transmembrane and surface proteins. The virion is spherical in shape with a diameter of about 100 nm. Seven HTLV-1 genotypes are recognised‚ÄîHTLV-1a through HTLV-1g. It is estimated that from 10 to 20 million people worldwide are infected; 3‚Äì8 million of them are in Africa. The most widespread genotype is type A. Types B, D, E, F and G have only been isolated from Central Africa. Type C is only present in Asia. Simian HTLV-1 genotypes are interspersed in between the human genotypes indicating frequent animal-human and human-animal transmission. The only human genotype that does not have a simian relative is A. It is thought that genotypes B, D, E, F and G originated in Africa from closely related STLV about 30,000 years ago, while the Asian genotype C is thought to have originated independently in Indonesia from the simians present there. Two subtypes are found in Japan: a transcontinental subgroup and a Japanese subgroup. Epidemiology The knowledge about HTLV-1 epidemiology is limited. The highest prevalence for any country has been detected in Japan (particularly in the southwest); in 2007 around 1% of Japan's population was infected. Two studies of blood samples from 1988 and 2006-07 showed the highest number of carriers was found in people born from 1927 to 1937 (people age 8 to 18 in 1945). The reasons for this extremely high prevalence are not known. In Taiwan, in Iran, and in Fujian (a Chinese province near Taiwan) the prevalence is 0.1‚Äì1%. The infection rate is about 1% in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, where the genotype C predominates. In Europe HTLV-1 is still uncommon, although it is present in some high-risk populations, including immigrants and intravenous drug users. In Americas the virus is found in indigenous populations and descendants of African ancestry from where it is thought to have originated. The general prevalence is from 0.1 to 1%. In Africa the prevalence is not well known, but it is about 1% in some countries. HTLV-I infection in the United States appears to be about half as prevalent among IV drug users and about one-tenth as prevalent in the population at large as HIV infection. Although little serologic data exist, the prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug users in New Jersey, and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in New Orleans. HTLV-I infection in Australia is very high among the indigenous peoples of central and northern Australia, with a prevalence rate of 10‚Äì45%. HTLV-1 is believed to have been in Australia for 9,000 years, coming from a migration from Indonesia. In central Australia, around Alice Springs, an estimated 5,000 people are infected.Ancient virus lurking in remote Australia, affecting thousands of Aboriginal adults, Bridget Brennan, ABC News Online, 2018-04-24 It is also high among the Inuit of Northern Canada, in Japan, northeastern Iran. Peru, the Pacific coast of Colombia and Ecuador, and the Caribbean. Transmission HTLV-1 has three main routes of transmission. Vertical transmission is most common, through which an infected mother transmits the virus to her child. Interestingly, the risk to a fetus while inside the womb is minimal, given the virtual absence of viral particles in human plasma. Most vertical infection occurs through breastfeeding. About 25% of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers are infected, while less than 5% of children born to but not breastfed by infected mothers are infected. Sexual transmission is second-most common, whereby an individual infects another through exchange of bodily fluids. Some evidence has suggested that male-to-female transmission is more efficient than female-to-male transmission. For example, one study in Japan found a 61% transmission rate for males to females vs. a less than 1% rate for females to males. Least common is parenteral transmission through blood transfusion, with an infection rate of 44-63% estimated in one study, and needle sharing among intravenous drug users. With proper prophylaxis (e.g. breastfeeding counseling for mothers, condom use, and donor blood screening), rates of transmission can be effectively reduced. The importance of the various routes of transmission is believed to vary geographically. The research in discordant couples showed that probability of sexual transmission is about 0.9 per 100 person-years. * In Japan, the geographic clustering of infections suggest that the virus is more dependent on mother-to-child transmission. * In the Caribbean, the geographic distribution of the virus is more uniform, and it is more common among those with many sexual partners, indicating that sexual transmission is more common. Tropism The term viral tropism refers to which cell types HTLV-I infects. Although HTLV-1 is primarily found in CD4+ T cells, other cell types in the peripheral blood of infected individuals have been found to contain HTLV-1, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells and B cells. HTLV-I entry is mediated through interaction of the surface unit of the virion envelope glycoprotein (SU) with its cellular receptor GLUT1, a glucose transporter, on target cells. Associated diseases =Malignancies= Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma HTLV-1 is also associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and has been quite well studied in Japan. The time between infection and onset of cancer also varies geographically. It is believed to be about sixty years in Japan and less than forty years in the Caribbean. The cancer is thought to be due to the pro-oncogenic effect of viral RNA incorporated into host lymphocyte DNA. Chronic stimulation of the lymphocytes at the cytokine level may play a role in the development of the malignancy. The lymphoma ranges from a very indolent and slowly progressive type to a very aggressive and nearly uniformly lethal proliferative type. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma There is some evidence that HTLV-1 is a causative agent of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. =Inflammatory diseases= HTLV myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis HTLV-1 is also associated with a progressive demyelinating upper motor neuron disease known as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), characterized by sensory and motor deficits, particularly of the lower extremities, incontinence and impotence. Only 0.3 to 4% of infected individuals develop HAM/TSP, but this will vary from one geographic location to another. Signs and symptoms of HTLV myelopathy include: *Motor and sensory changes in the extremities *Spastic gait in combination with weakness of the lower limbs *Clonus *Bladder dysfunction(neurogenic bladder) and bladder cancer Other neurologic findings that may be found in HTLV include: *Mild cognitive impairment *Erectile dysfunction Arthropathy HTLV-1 is associated with a rheumatoid-like arthropathy, although the evidence is contradictory. In these cases patients have a negative rheumatoid factor. Uveitis Studies from Japan demonstrated that HTLV-1 infection may be associated with an intermediate uveitis. At onset the patients present with blurred vision and floaters. The prognosis is favorable‚Äîthe condition usually resolves within weeks. =Opportunistic infections= Individuals infected with HTLV-1 are at risk for opportunistic infections‚Äîdiseases not caused by the virus itself, but by alterations in the host's immune functions. HTLV-1, unlike the distantly related retrovirus HIV, has an immunostimulating effect which actually becomes immunosuppressive. The virus activates a subset of T-helper cells called Th1 cells. The result is a proliferation of Th1 cells and overproduction of Th1 related cytokines (mainly IFN-Œ≥ and TNF-Œ±). Feedback mechanisms of these cytokines cause a suppression of the Th2 lymphocytes and a reduction of Th2 cytokine production (mainly IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13). The end result is a reduction in the ability of the infected host to mount an adequate immune response to invading organisms that require a predominantly Th2 dependent response (these include parasitic infections and production of mucosal and humoral antibodies). In the central Australian Aboriginal population, HTLV-1 is thought to be related to their extremely high rate of death from sepsis. It is also particularly associated with bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition predisposing to recurrent pneumonia. It is also associated with chronic infected dermatitis, often superinfected with Staphylococcus aureus and a severe form of Strongyloides stercoralis infection called hyper-infestation which may lead to death from polymicrobial sepsis. HTLV-1 infection has also been associated with Tuberculosis. Treatment Treatment of opportunistic infections varies depending on the type of disease and ranges from careful observation to aggressive chemotherapy and antiretroviral agents. Adult T cell lymphoma is a common complication of HTLV infection and requires aggressive chemotherapy, typically R-CHOP. Other treatments for ATL in HTLV infected patients include interferon alpha, zidovudine with interferon alpha and CHOP with arsenic trioxide. Treatments for HTLV myelopathy are even more limited and focus mainly on symptomatic therapy. Therapies studied include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and interferon, which may produce a temporary symptomatic improvement in myelopathy symptoms. Valproic acid has been studied to determine if it might slow the progression of HTLV disease by reducing viral load. Although in one human study it was effective in reducing viral load, there did not appear to be a clinical benefit. Recently however, a study of valproic acid combined with zidovudine showed a major decrease in the viral load of baboons infected with HTLV-1. It is important to monitor HTLV patients for opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus, histoplasmosis, scabies, pneumocystis pneumonia, and staphylococcal infections. HIV testing should also be performed, as some patients may be co-infected with both viruses. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation has been investigated in the treatment of HTLV-1 disease with varied results. One case report describes an HTLV-1 infected woman who developed chronic refractory eczema, corneal injury and adult T cell leukemia. She was subsequently treated with allogenic stem cell transplantation and had complete resolution of symptoms. One year post-transplant, she has had no recurrence of any symptoms, and furthermore has had a decrease in her proviral load.

The area has been inhabited by Berbers since ancient times. Oulad Dlim is an Arab tribe of Himyari from Yemen that settled in the Sahara in the twelfth century. Dakhla was expanded by Spanish settlers during the expansion of their empire. The Spanish interest in the desert coast of Western Africa's Sahara arose as the result of fishing carried out from the nearby Canary Islands by Spanish fishers and as a result of the Barbary pirates menace. Spanish fishers were seal fur traders and hunters, fishers and whalers along the Saharan coast from Dakhla to Cabo Blanco from 1500 to the present, engaging in whaling for Humpback whales and their calves, mostly around Cape Verde, and the Gulf of Guinea in Annobon, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe islands through 1940. These fishing activities had a negative impact on wildlife, causing the disappearance or endangering of many species, particularly marine mammals and birds. The Spaniards established whaling stations with some cod fishing and trading. In 1881, a dock was anchored off the coast of the R√≠o de Oro Peninsula to support the work of the Canarian fishing fleet.The fort at Villa Cisneros in 1930 However, it was not until 1884 that Spain formally founded the watering place as Villa Cisneros, in the settlement dated in 1502 by Papal bull. It was included in the enclaves conceded to the Spanish to the east of the Azores islands. In 1884, the settlement was promoted by the Spanish Society of Africanists and funded by the government of Canovas del Castillo. The Spanish military, along with the Spanish Africanist Emilio Bonelli, claimed the coast between Cape Bojador and Cabo Blanco for Spain, founding three settlements on the Saharan coast: one in Villa Cisneros, named in honour of Francisco Cardinal Jim√©nez de Cisneros (1436-1517), the Spanish prelate who was the Grand Inquisitor during the Spanish Inquisition; and another in Cabo Blanco for seal hunting, which was given the name of Medina Gatell; and another in Angra de Cintra with the name of Puerto Badia, in honour of the Arabist and adventurer Domingo Badia. Bonelli got the native inhabitants of the peninsula de R√≠o de Oro to sign an agreement that placed them under the 'protection' of the Kingdom of Spain. Due to the presence of the three new settlements, in December that year the Spanish Government officially informed the main colonial powers assembled at the Berlin Conference that the Spanish Crown was in possession of the territory lying between Cape Bojador and Cape Blanco. During the colonial period, Spanish authorities made Dakhla the capital of the province of R√≠o de Oro, one of the two regions of what was known as Spanish Sahara. They built a military fortress and a modern Catholic church. A prison camp also existed at the fort during the Spanish Civil War at which writers such as Pedro Garc√≠a Cabrera were imprisoned. During the 1960s, the Francoist State also built Dakhla Airport, one of the three paved airports in Western Sahara. It was from Dakhla, then known as Villa Cisneros, that on January 12, 1976, General Gomez de Salazar became the last Spanish soldier to depart what until that moment had been the colony of the Spanish Sahara; faced with Moroccan and Mauritanian pressure, Spanish authorities decided to give up the territory peacefully, instead of undertaking a fight that they believed they could win but would have cost many lives on all sides. Between 1975 and 1979, Dakhla was the provincial capital of the Mauritanian province of Tiris al- Gharbiyya, as Mauritania annexed the southern portion of Western Sahara. Dakhla Airport is used as a civilian airport and by Royal Air Maroc. The 3 km runway can accommodate a Boeing 737 or smaller aircraft. The passenger terminal covers 670 m2 and is capable of handling up to 55,000 passengers per year. Dakhla was occupied by Spain from the late 19th century to 1975, when power was then relinquished to a joint administration between Morocco and Mauritania. There was a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire in 1991, but as recently as 2006, most UN member states have refused to recognise Moroccan sovereignty in the area. In 2020, Gambia, Guinea, Djibouti and Liberia opened consulates in Dakhla.  Economy = Tourism and sports = Windsurfer and the Dragon Island in the background.

Like most areas in Western Sahara, Dakhla and vicinity areas are very poor in vegetation and are mostly covered by the Sahara Desert. Unlike on land however, sea waters are or had been very rich in sea life due to the highly productive Current System of Canary flowing offshore and the renown Nouadhibou upwelling which is located nearby as well.

Barbary lion and hartebeest became extinct, and possibly local cheetah and North African elephant as well. The calm, sheltered water of the Dakhla Bay was once an ideal habitat for various forms of marine life, including marine mammals. Most of the local animals such as Mediterranean monk seals and whales (mostly North Atlantic right whales) have disappeared due to histories of slaughter and exploitation like in Cintra Bay. Atlantic gray whales were likely to be seen along the coast before extinction. On the other hand, monk seals are showing slow but certain recoveries and Ras Nouadhibou holds the world's most notable colony for this species. Nowadays, very small, remnant groups of bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic humpback dolphins are the only marine mammals still seen regularly in Dakhla Bay while there are occasional visits by some other species including orcas while cetaceans like minke, or sei, pilot whales, beaked whales, and dolphins are more common in offshore waters in today's Western Sahara. =Reptiles and others= Other than mammals, limited varieties of terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, arthropods are present here including lizards, smooth snake, Brongersma's toad, and yellow-tailed scorpion. Sea turtles are also present in the Dakhla region. Larger fish like groupers, seabasses or croakers inhabit along the coasts. Dakhla and Cintra Bay areas are considered to be spawning grounds for local sardines.

He was President Emeritus of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and President Emeritus of the Governorate of Vatican City State, having previously served as Bishop of Gaylord from 1971 to 1981 and Archbishop of Detroit from 1981 to 1990. Szoka was elevated to the cardinalate in 1988. Early life Edmund Casimir Szoka was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Casimir and Mary (n√©e Wolgat) Szoka, Polish immigrants. He has an older sister, Irene, and moved with his family in the early 1930s to Muskegon, where he did his primary studies at St. Michael School. Attracted to life as a priest at an early age, Szoka attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Grand Rapids, Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit for his junior and senior years, and then St. John's Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, Michigan to study theology. Priesthood On June 5, 1954, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Noa in St. Peter's Cathedral in Marquette, Michigan. He did pastoral work in Manistique. From 1957 to 1959, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Urbaniana University or the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. He then became secretary to Bishop Noa of Marquette, whom he accompanied to the first session of the Second Vatican Council in 1962. During this period he also served as chaplain at St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital and K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. Upon returning to the United States, Szoka did pastoral and curial work, including serving as an official of the matrimonial tribunal in Marquette until 1971. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on November 14, 1963, by Pope Paul VI. Episcopal ministry =Bishop of Gaylord= Szoka was appointed the first Bishop of Gaylord on June 11, 1971. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 20 from Cardinal John Francis Dearden, with Bishops Charles Salatka and Joseph McKinney serving as co-consecrators. A year later, the Bishops of the 4th pastoral region of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) elected him president for the period of 1972-77. At the same time, he was treasurer and secretary of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan. As Bishop of Gaylord, Szoka improved the annulment consideration process, drawing from his experience in the matrimonial tribunal in Marquette. =Archbishop of Detroit= On March 21, 1981, he was promoted to be third Metropolitan Archbishop of Detroit (eighth bishop) by Pope John Paul II. After 1981, he also served as president of the Administration Council for the provincial seminary of St. John in Plymouth, Michigan, and of SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary near Orchard Lake Village, Michigan. He was also a president of the board of directors of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan, member of the executive committee of The Catholic University of America, president of the Committee for University Relations, Administrator of the National Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, treasurer of the NCCB, and served on committees within the Conference for: human values, bishops, dioceses and provinces, and economic affairs. He faced challenges of finance and enforcing Church discipline, and welcomed John Paul II to Detroit in 1987 during his tenure as Archbishop. In 1983, he dealt with the case of Agnes Mary Mansour, a nun and the director of the Michigan Department of Community Health who worked to continue abortion services in Michigan. Szoka had given his permission for Mansour to serve the state but said she must oppose publicly funded abortion. Mansour believed abortion was tragic but should be legal, and she continued disbursing Medicaid abortion funds. Szoka appealed to Mansour's superiors in the Sisters of Mercy but the order supported her stance. Szoka referred the case to the Vatican, and Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua resolved it by ordering Mansour to resign either her government post or her orders. Mansour left the sisterhood. He was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio by John Paul II in the consistory of June 28, 1988. Rev. Joseph Gembela, pastor of St. Malachy's parish, noted that Szoka received a good deal of unjust criticism when he closed thirty churches in Detroit during 1989-90; many of which were sparsely attended. The first large-scale closing of Catholic churches in a major U.S. city, other dioceses with changing demographics have since followed suit. Roman Curia Resigning as Archbishop of Detroit on April 28, 1990, Szoka had been named President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See on January 22, 1990, and served as such to October 14, 1997. In this position, he helped manage the Vatican's financial affairs. On October 14, 1997, Cardinal Szoka was named President of the Governorate of Vatican City State, and on February 22, 2001, President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Within the Roman Curia his membership included: Secretariat of State (second section), and Causes of Saints, Bishops, Evangelization of Peoples (Congregatio de Propaganda Fide), Clergy, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (congregations). He submitted his resignation to John Paul II in 2002, at the Church's mandatory retirement age of 75, but was requested to continue working. During his rare spare time, Szoka enjoyed walking through the Vatican Gardens. Szoka was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. As Governor of the Vatican, it fell to Szoka, along with Secretary of State Angelo Sodano and Camerlengo Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo, to prepare for the cardinal electors' housing at the Domus Sanctae Marthae. Retirement It was announced on June 22, 2006, that his resignation had been accepted by Pope Benedict and that he would officially step down on September 15, 2006; he maintained all curial memberships until age 80. On what he would do after retirement, Szoka said he was interested in travel, writing, studying the Church Fathers, and continuing to provide priestly assistance to Detroit. Cardinal Szoka had fond memories of Pope John Paul II, especially in regard to his travels to Poland and to the United States: Cardinal Szoka lived in Northville, Michigan. Szoka died on August 20, 2014, of natural causes, at Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan.

Construction was begun in 1891 and completed in 1894, and it was intended to be used for only six to eight weeks of the year. Belcourt was designed in a multitude of European styles and periods; it features a heavy emphasis on French Renaissance and Gothic decor, with further borrowings from German, English, and Italian design. In the Gilded Age, the castle was noted for its extensive stables and carriage areas, which were incorporated into the main structure. Construction and the Belmont years Belcourt in 1895, shortly after completion Located on Bellevue Avenue at Lakeview Avenue, Belcourt was designed by Richard Morris Hunt for 33-year-old Oliver Belmont, who was divorced from Sara Swan Whiting and the father of a daughter, Natica, whom he denied paternity to, during the construction of his 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m¬≤), 60-room summer villa. Based on the Louis XIII hunting lodge at Versailles, Belcourt incorporated Oliver's love of pageantry, history and horses in its magnificent interior halls, salons and ballrooms. The Belmont Stakes was named for his father, August Belmont Sr., and he was known for his skill as a four-in-hand carriage driver. Belmont wanted Belcourt designed precisely to his specifications. Hunt was hesitant, but he concentrated on his guiding principle that it was his client's money he was spending. Construction cost $3.2 million in 1894, a figure of approximately $80 million in 2011 dollars. Belmont employed some thirty servants at Belcourt, with aggregate wages of approximately $100 per week. When construction finished in 1894, the entire first floor was composed of carriage space and a multitude of stables for Belmont's prized horses. Upstairs was a master bedroom with wall scenes depicting the life of a nobleman and a bathroom with Newport's first standing shower. Scheduled to open for July 4 of that year, Belcourt would remain closed for the summer season while Belmont was hospitalized in New York City, the victim of a mugging. It would be a full year until Belmont saw his completed mansion. The summer of 1895 witnessed the thirty servants of Belcourt preparing the vast estate for the arrival of its owner. Immediately, Belmont set out to inspect his extensive stables, which constitute the entire southern fa√ßade. The building was formed of a large quadrangle, with two-story wings connecting to a three-story main block (the north wing). The effect can be viewed today in the form of a large, 80-by-40-foot (24-by-12m) central courtyard with half timbers in the Norman style. The immense mansard roof is pierced by oval copper dormers and chimneys finished in the same manner as the walls. The symmetrical north fa√ßade is where the carriage entrances were located. A narrow wrought-iron balcony stretches 70 feet (20 m) on the second floor. Belmont had disdain for the nouveau riche who, in splashy displays of wealth, built ostentatious mansions between Bellevue Avenue and the Atlantic coast. As a result, guests entered Belcourt through an entrance on Ledge Road, a short road that runs parallel to Bellevue Avenue. This entrance is a few feet from the curb and the effect was that the back of Belcourt was turned to the nouveau riche on Bellevue Avenue. Inside the castle was just as magnificent and somewhat eccentric. Belmont housed his vast collection of horses and carriages on the ground floor, accessed by two huge carriage entrances on either side of the north fa√ßade. To the west of this vast area was Belmont's Francis I Renaissance-style Grand Hall and foyer, which exited onto Ledge Road. The monumental Gothic rooms with their huge stained-glass windows were emblazoned with the Belmont coat of arms. The room's original damask, blood red in color, has long since been replaced with the same fabric in gold. The Grand Staircase, now a replica of the stairs in the Cluny Museum in France, connects the Lower Grand Hall to Belmont's Upper Grand Hall on the second floor. The details are mostly the same as those of its partner room below. Myriad formal rooms open onto one another in varying periods of French style and decoration. The galleries and halls of the second floor employ the architect's trademark of vistas framing the views into various rooms. The courtyard before Alva Belmont initiated renovations that would radically reconfigure the courtyard and the interior of the home Belmont remarried his neighbor Alva Vanderbilt, the former wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt, on January 11, 1896. Eager to reshape and redesign Belcourt, Alva made changes that morphed the already eccentric character of Belcourt into a yet more eccentric hybrid mixture of styles. Alva Belmont converted the carriage room into a banquet hall and transformed a study into a boudoir, importing 18th- century French paneling. In 1899, Belcourt was the host of the nation's first automobile parade. Changes in ownership Oliver Belmont died in 1908Vanderbilt, Arthur T. Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt. Morrow, 1989, 252. and Mrs. Belmont died in France on January 26, 1933. Belcourt passed to 80-year-old Perry Belmont, the eldest Belmont child and Alva's brother-in-law. At the onset of World War II, Perry Belmont had most of the contents of Belcourt moved to his other estates as Newport was a naval base and potentially at risk of attack. Select pieces of Alva's were auctioned off, as Perry allegedly had no great love for her. In 1940, Belmont decided to rid himself of Belcourt. Negotiations commenced with George Waterman, an entrepreneur. Waterman envisioned Belcourt as an antique auto museum. The only conditions of the sale were that Waterman had to restore the castle as close as possible to Hunt's original plans. Waterman was responsible for the restoration of the third-floor roof and removal of an addition overlooking the courtyard. After paying $1,000 for the castle, Waterman was informed that zoning wouldn't allow his antique auto museum. In 1943, Waterman sold Belcourt to Edward Dunn, who never lived at Belcourt during the eleven years that he owned it (up until 1954). During the war years when many of the grand mansions were being razed or converted into various institutions, Dunn rented the stables of the rundown castle to the military to use for repairing equipment. Dunn sold Belcourt to Louis and Elaine Lorillard in 1954 for $22,500. The Lorillards, of tobacco fame, envisioned Belcourt as a seat for the Newport Jazz Festival. The lawns on Bellevue Avenue could accommodate over 10,000 and the masonry and stucco fa√ßade provided an acoustic background. The large central courtyard was the scene for concerts, with the open loggia providing further room for spectators. Inside, the massive rooms were used for workshops and lodging. However, the future for Belcourt as a permanent venue for the festival was dim due to protests from the neighbors. Belcourt had deteriorated, largely uninhabited for over two decades. In November 1956, the Lorillards sold the rundown, mostly abandoned castle to the Tinney Family. The Tinneys gothic ballroom, shown prior to furnishing and restorative work The Tinney Family, of Cumberland, Rhode Island, bought Belcourt in 1956 for $25,000. In addition to changing the name from Belcourt to Belcourt Castle, the Tinneys filled the castle with their own collection of antiques and reproductions. Included are a coronation coach, which son Donald made, and a 1701 copy of a Hyacinthe Rigaud portrait of Louis XIV, which hung in the Green Room in the Palace of the Tuileries. The centerpiece of the Tinney additions was an enormous Imperial Russian-style chandelier, which holds 13,000 rock crystal prisms and 105 lights. The chandelier hangs a few feet above the rose marble mosaic floor of the banquet hall. At the time that Belcourt was purchased in 1956, the Tinney family comprised Harold Tinney, his wife Ruth Tinney, their son Donald Tinney, and Ruth's aunt Nellie Fuller (a descendant of Mayflower passenger Edward Fuller). In 1960, Donald Tinney married Harle Hanson, who had been at Belcourt to work as a tour guide. Harle Tinney was the only surviving member of the family when Belcourt was sold in 2012. Other artifacts within Belcourt included an immense collection of Persian rugs, French royal art and furnishings, Oriental art and furnishings, and numerous religious objets d'art. Changes at Belcourt have been numerous in the years following 1956, when the Tinney family moved in. They raised the ceiling of the Organ Loft 11 feet (3.4 m) to accommodate a 26-rank tracker organ. Between 1966 and 1970, when the coronation coach was being built, an old kitchen area became a coach hall. In 1969, the open loggia became a French salon. In 1975, they transformed the north-west reception room into a chapel with the addition of German Renaissance stained glass. In the early 1980s, the Tinneys built gate piers on Bellevue Avenue and installed gates that they had acquired from the Taylor estate in Portsmouth. The overthrow was altered to make the gates the tallest of any estate entrance in Newport. In 1983, robbers attempted a million-dollar heist of Belcourt's antiques. Police recovered many artifacts but not a 14-pound silver reliquary containing a relic from the third century. The lawns contain many sculptural pieces in bronze, terra cotta, marble and stone. Depicting scenes from mythology, nymphs and cherubs, the collection is an informal contrast to the strong and robust lines of the French-style ch√¢teau. The driveways and pathways are lined with lush arborvitae, planted by the Tinneys a few years after they moved into Belcourt. Belcourt is the third largest mansion in Newport, after The Breakers and Ochre Court. The castle has been the subject of an ongoing restoration project spanning from the beginning of the Tinney family's occupation of the castle up to and including the present day. On May 26, 2009, it was reported that the then-owner of Belcourt, Harle Tinney, had put the residence up for sale. The home was put on the market for $US 7.2 million. As of June 2011, the price had been reduced twice to $US 5.1 million and then to $US 3.9 million.WDH.com Subsequently, it was taken off of the market and re-listed for sale in two parcels totaling $US 4.625 million. Tinney said she was ready to part with the home after her husband's death in 2006. On November 12, 2012, Belcourt was purchased by Carolyn Rafaelian, owner of the Cranston, Rhode Island-based company Alex and Ani, for $3.6 million. Rafaelian is currently restoring and renovating the mansion, which she reopened in summer 2014 as a tour house, art gallery, and event space under the business name Belcourt of Newport. Rafaelian reports she has already spent $5 million on renovations, including $3 million for a new roof. Belcourt as a museum The Banquet Hall features nine crystal chandeliers, the most substantial lit by 105 electric lights Belcourt was open to the public as a museum of antiquities and architectural and social history. Of the 60 rooms at Belcourt, over a dozen were viewable on tour. A visit to the castle included viewings of an English library (added in 1910 by John Russell Pope; the ceiling is a replica of the one in Haddon Hall's Long Gallery), a banquet hall, a chapel, two of three grand halls, a music room, an Empire-style dining room, a French gothic-style ballroom, two principal bedrooms, a loggia and a gallery. All of the rooms are furnished with pieces from the Tinney family collections. The first tours of Belcourt were given in 1957 and, ever since then, the castle has been a fixture on Bellevue Avenue. The collections included furnishings, art and artifacts from 33 European and Asian countries and 37 other Newport mansions. The Tinney family's enormous collection earned Belcourt a notable status within Newport's thriving tourism industry. Belcourt was also the only mansion in Newport that was both open to the public and had a private owner in residence. Harle Tinney frequently guided tours through her home and was often present to greet visitors when she was in residence. Materials Belcourt's distinctive exterior appearance was achieved through the use of brick and Westerly granite to frame the windows, doors and fields of stucco. The roof is sheathed in Pennsylvania slate and is pierced by numerous ox-eye (elliptical) dormer windows. The interior, completed by 300 imported artisans, was created of carved oak with oak and mosaic marble floors. The numerous decorative ceilings were finished with sculpted and molded plaster and carved woods such as chestnut. The walls are finished with canvas paintings, carved oak, imported paneling and pure silk damasks. The numerous exterior railings and gates are composed of wrought iron and bronze, featuring a shell motif and the monogram \\"OB.\\" The foundations are stone, brick and poured concrete with thick brick walls supporting enormous roof timbers and steel I-beams.

The two nations had signed a border treaty following the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of 1941, but Ecuador later disagreed with the treaty as it applied to the Cenepa and Paquisha areas, and in 1960 Ecuador declared the treaty null and void. Mediation efforts of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States paved the way for the opening of diplomatic conversations that ultimately led to the signing of a definitive peace agreement (the Brasilia Presidential Act) on 26 October 1998. The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to one of the longest territorial disputes in the Western Hemisphere.

Background The Cenepa War was the most recent military clash between Ecuador and Peru over a long-standing territorial dispute that dated back to the first decades of the 19th century, when both countries came into being after the Wars of Independence of the Spanish colonies in South America. In modern times there were three previous military confrontations: War Ecuadorian-Peruvian 1858, a full-scale war in 1941, the Paquisha War in 1981, both of which had seen the Peruvian military forces prevailing over the Ecuadorian military. Overview Ecuador-Per√∫ border Most of the fighting of the Cenepa war was centered around the control of several outposts located on the headwaters of the Cenepa River (see map), a highland area covered with dense Amazonian jungle, inside a 78 km-long strip of territory where the process of demarcation between Ecuador and Peru remained stalled since 1951. One of the outposts causing the dispute, called Tiwintza by the Ecuadorians, and Tiwinza by the Peruvians, came to symbolize the war because of the bitter clashes that took place around it, and the emotional importance that both sides attached to its possession. The conflict continued until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces, supervised by the MOMEP, a multinational mission of military observers from the \\"guarantor\\" countries of the 1942 Rio Protocol: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the USA. The Cenepa war ended up producing far-reaching consequences for relations between Ecuador and Peru. The military outcome of the brief conflict, no vindicating the Ecuadorian armed forces after the disappointing results of the war of 1858, 1941, 1981, and by calling to the attention of the Peruvians the need for a resolution of a problem, paved the way for a definitive settlement of the border issues. Thus, in the aftermath of the war, both nations, brokered by the \\"guarantors\\" of the Rio Protocol, entered into a long and difficult negotiation process that concluded with the signing of a Peace Treaty in 1998, and the closing of the hitherto un-demarcated stretch of common border, deep in the Amazonian rainforest. =Disputed border= Following the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of 1941, both countries had signed in 1942 a Peace Treaty known as the Rio Protocol. This treaty ‚Äî brokered by the US, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, which became known as the \\"guarantors\\" of the peace settlement ‚Äî had the main purpose of defining the hitherto badly defined borders between Ecuador and Peru. The process of demarcation, begun in mid-1942, came to a halt in 1948, when populist Ecuadorian President Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra declared the Protocol impossible to implement in the area of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor, claiming inconsistencies between the instructions of the Protocol and the geographical realities on the ground. Peru contested this view, stating that such discrepancies had already been solved in an arbitration that had taken place in 1945, and that all that had to be done was to close the border following the guidelines of the Protocol and the ruling of the 1945 arbitration By the beginning of the 1950s, the situation had come to a deadlock. For the next 46 years, a 78 km-long strip of mostly unpopulated, and little explored territory, deep in the Amazonian rainforest and almost inaccessible by land, was left undemarcated, serving as a flashpoint for recurrent diplomatic and military crisis between Ecuador and Peru. While Peru held to the view that the border in the undermarcated area ran along the heights of the Condor range, Ecuador insisted that there was no technical basis for considering that mountain range as the border between the two nations, hinting at the idea that the spirit of the Protocol, which had never mentioned the C√≥ndor range by name, would require the location of the border markers along the Cenepa river, immediately to the east of the range. The Ecuadorian stance had a symbolic meaning of its own: the Cenepa river was a small tributary of the Mara√±√≥n river, in turn a tributary of the Amazon river, to which Ecuador had always claimed the right for a sovereign access. =Events leading up to the war= Just as in the Paquisha Incident of 1981, the Cenepa War was caused by the installation by Ecuador, since 1994, of border outposts on the Cenepa River basin in eastern Cordillera del Condor (territory of Peru), with the names of Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur and Tiwinza (see the map shown in infobox). Tensions along the Condor range had been running high following a crisis that arose in July 1991 over the location of a Peruvian outpost called \\"Pachac√∫tec\\" (Pachac√∫tec Incident) inside a zone that, while 60 km north of the delimited and undemarcated area, had its own problems regarding the location of a single border marker (see map). Ecuador had protested over the location of \\"Pachac√∫tec\\" since it was, according to Ecuador, inside Ecuadorian territory, and went on to set up an outpost of its own (\\"Etza\\") right in front of it.M. Herz, Ecuador vs. Peru: Peacemaking amid rivalry, Lynne Rienner, Boulder, CO, 2002, pp. 40. Google Print. Retrieved November 5, 2005. For Peru, there was no question that both \\"Pachac√∫tec\\" and \\"Etza\\" were inside Peruvian territory. Although the crisis was defused the following month with the signing of a Pacto de Caballeros (gentlemen's agreement), by which both sides committed themselves to abandon these posts and separate their forces, the aftermath of the incident saw both countries accusing each other of violating the accord and reinforcing their military presence in the delimited and undemarcated area. New crisis Still, for the next three years, tensions were kept at manageable levels. Apart from the uneasy encounters between rival patrols, which sometimes included brief exchanges of fire, most commonly every January (anniversary of the signing of the Rio Protocol), no serious incidents happened. Then, at the end of 1994, a new crisis suddenly erupted, this time in the undemarcated border area proper, around the Condor range and the Cenepa headwaters. =\\"Base Sur\\" and a meeting of colonels= Peruvian accounts\\"As√≠ Empez√≥ el Conflicto\\" , Caretas magazine, Peru (in Spanish). Retrieved November 13, 2005. state that in November 1994, a Peruvian patrol, advancing through the Cenepa headwaters, was intercepted by an Ecuadorian patrol. Being told they had crossed into Ecuadorian territory, the Peruvians were escorted to the Ecuadorian outpost of \\"Base Sur\\", where the patrol was given supplies before continuing their journey. Afterwards, realizing Base Sur was actually in Peruvian-claimed territory,In 2001, General Vladimiro L√≥pez Trigoso, commander of the Peruvian 5th Jungle Infantry Division at the time of the war, said his troops had first found evidence that Ecuadorian troops were patrolling inside Peruvian-claimed territory in May 1994. See \\"Fujimori y Montesinos ocultaron invasi√≥n ecuatoriana\\" , La Prensa newspaper, Panam√°, July 21, 2001 (in Spanish). Retrieved November 6, 2005. the Peruvians asked the Ecuadorians for a meeting of superior officers. The meeting, which the Peruvians date to December 20 and the Ecuadorians to December 12, took place in \\"Base Sur\\", between the commanders of the opposing battalions in the area. According to Ecuadorian accounts,P. Cuvi, Al Filo de la Paz. Historias de la negociaci√≥n con el Per√∫. Dinediciones, Quito, 1999, p.55. . during the meeting the Peruvian officer called to the attention of his Ecuadorian counterpart that the presence of Ecuadorian outposts in the headwaters of the Cenepa river constituted a violation of Peruvian territory, and that therefore the posts had to be abandoned and the troops moved back to the line of the Condor range. The Ecuadorian account of the meeting also states that the Peruvian officer went on to deliver an ultimatum: if the Ecuadorians did not abandon the area by the end of the week, the Peruvians would dislodge them by force. After the meeting ‚Äî if not before it ‚Äî both Quito and Lima began to send reinforcements to the area, while further meetings between superior officers didn't manage to break the deadlock, apparently unable to reach a compromise solution. =In retrospect= It could be said that the Cenepa war had the same causes that caused the Peruvian victory in the false Paquisha of 1981, that is, the Peruvian discovery of Ecuadorian outposts on the eastern slopes of the Condor mountain range by expelled Ecuadorian troops from the territory in dispute. And further down in the Cenepa Valley, followed by the decision from to evict Ecuadorians from these places by force. The Ecuadorian Army, evidently bent on preventing any repetition of the \\"Pachac√∫tec\\" incident, and to forestall any Peruvian attempt to reach to crests of the Condor range, had gone on to establish a \\"defensive\\" perimeter on the area of Cenepa valley, with two outposts, \\"Tiwinza\\" and \\"Base Sur\\", on the Cenepa headwaters (i.e. in the eastern side of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor, in Peru's land), and a larger outpost, \\"Coangos\\", on the high ground overlooking them from the north (see map). In turn, the \\"guarantors\\" (Warrantors) military considered both Ecuadorian and Peruvian moves as offensive in character, due to the fact that, lacking official border markers, the Ecuadorian and Peruvian military had long since agreed to consider the line of the Condor range a de facto border, already considered broken by both countries since 1981. Mobilizing for war During the second half of December both sides began to hastily reinforce their military presence in and around the Cenepa valley area, laying down new minefields, preparing supply bases, and intensifying the patrolling activity. By the end of December, profiting from its internal lines of communications, the Ecuadorian Army had strengthened to a considerable degree its presence in the area, having deployed a number of units, foremost among them several Special Forces formations, as well as artillery and BM-21 multiple rocket launchers on the heights of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor. The entire Ecuadorian perimeter was covered by antiaircraft batteries and, most significantly, several teams carrying Soviet-made SA-16 Igla and British-made Blowpipe man-portable surface-to-air missiles. Meanwhile, the Ecuadorian Air Force (FAE) was frantically getting up to operational status its fleet of subsonic and supersonic jet aircraft, and adapting existing airfields in southeastern Ecuador to function as forward-deployment bases. For the Ecuadorian military, especially the Army and Air Force, the memories of the conflict of 1981 and its embarrassing outcome were still fresh, the lessons learned, and every measure was taken to avoid a similar outcome if and when the threat of war became a reality. For the Peruvian military, the mobilization process was somewhat more problematic. The Cenepa valley area was devoid of any major roads, population centers, or helicopter bases on the Peruvian side. The Peruvian Army and the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), had to organize an air-bridge to get reinforcements to the zone. Troops, heavy weapons, ammunition and supplies had to be flown in first from the Peruvian hinterland and Lima to Bagua AFB, where they were transferred to light transport aircraft for the flight to the Ciro Alegr√≠a base. From this base, the final flight to the Peruvian forward bases in the Cenepa valley, mainly Observation Post 1 (PV-1), was made aboard Peru's Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17 helicopter fleet, very often under poor weather conditions, with heavy rain and low cloud cover. Altogether, by the third week of January, both Peru and Ecuador had managed to deploy around 5,000 troops to the immediate vicinity of the delimited and undemarcated area.C. Faundes, El Conflicto de la Cordillera del C√≥ndor: Los Actores del Enfrentamiento B√©lico no declarado entre Ecuador y Per√∫. (pdf), Estudios de Defensa, Santiago de Chile, 2004 (in Spanish). Retrieved November 6, 2005. First encounters With the coming of the new year, crisis loomed in the Cenepa valley. By 8 January the Peruvian Army had deployed four patrols near Base Sur. On the night of 9 January 1995, Ecuadorian troops found and captured four Peruvian soldiers that according to the Ecuadorian accounts were supposedly reconnoitering the approaches to the Ecuadorian outpost of Cueva de los Tayos. Following the customary regulations put in place by both Armies for the handling of such instances, the so-called Cartillas de Seguridad y Confianza (Guidelines for Safety and Mutual Confidence), the captured Peruvian personnel were delivered to their own officers without further incident. Always following the Ecuadorian accounts, a subsequent incident took place two days later, on January 11, when another Peruvian patrol was detected near a place called the \\"Y\\", a point of tactical importance in the Ecuadorian lines. Shots were fired, apparently causing no casualties on either side. Open war Peruvian commandos during the war. By the third week of January, the Peruvian high command had deployed to the Cenepa area what it considered to be enough troops to clear any and all Ecuadorian troops on the Eastern side of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor. In retrospect, it is likely that Lima was expecting a repetition of the 1981 incident, unaware of the scale of the Ecuadorian deployment. Thus, as a preliminary to the attack, on 21 January Peruvian helicopters began a series of reconnaissance and troop insertion flights on the rear of the Ecuadorian positions, which continued for the next two days. The next day, 22 January, the Ecuadorians detected around twenty Peruvian troops setting up a heliport to the north and rear of the Ecuadorian forward outposts. The stepping up of the Peruvian air operations, combined with the surprise discovery of a Peruvian base on the rear of the Ecuadorian perimeter, compelled the Ecuadorian high command to take the initiative. That same day, a reinforced Special Forces company was ordered to advance undetected through the dense jungle and dislodge the Peruvians from the site, named by the Ecuadorians' \\"Base Norte\\".Herz, p. 43. Significantly, the decision to act was made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army before informing the President of the Republic, Sixto Dur√°n-Ball√©n, and his National Security Council. The Ecuadorian high command had by then interpreted the opinion of the Commander in Chief of the Peruvian armed forces, General Nicol√°s de Bari Hermoza, to respond to calls from his Ecuadorian counterpart as a signal that the Peruvian military, with or without the knowledge of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, was preparing a military operation in the Cenepa valley. The next day, the decision to act already taken, the Ecuadorian local commander informed his Peruvian counterpart that, from 24 January onwards, any Peruvian helicopter flying over Ecuadorian positions would be shot down. On the morning of Thursday, 26 January 1995, after three days of march, the Ecuadorian Special Forces detachment arrived undetected at the small Peruvian outpost \\"Base Norte\\" and launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting garrison. A fierce firefight ensued, but the Peruvians were eventually forced to disperse through the jungle, leaving behind a number of dead soldiers, as well as weapons and supplies. The Cenepa War had begun. But it was the Peruvian troops that finally evicted the Ecuadorian troops from their territory after the intense bombardment by land and air of the bases of the Cave of the Tayos, the South Base and the false Tiwinza. =Chronology of the War= The following days, the events unfolded in quick succession. Below is a complete chronological summary of the war. *24 January: Peru mobilizes troops towards Tiwinza, Ecuador engages in preparing the FAE (Ecuadorian Air Force), Ecuadorian fighter jets. *25 January: Peru militarizes a site in the Condor strip later known as Base Sur, thus provoking reaction by Ecuadorian forces, initiating the war. *26 January: Peruvian conscripts setting up a heliport in Quebrada Fashin, behind the Ecuadorian outposts built in Peru's land since 1994, are attacked by Ecuadorian Special Forces, dislodging the Peruvians from the site; the Ecuadorians name the place Base Norte.

(No ISBN). *27 January: Ecuador and Peru order general mobilization. Armored units are deployed to the Pacific coast border area, ready to act in case of a general war. Altogether, around 140,000 men were mobilized during the war. *28 January: At 7:45, the Peruvians launch the first ground assault against the Ecuadorian positions in the Cenepa headwaters. The attack is renewed at 11:05, this time with helicopters providing suppressive fire. At 09:00 a Peruvian Air Force (FAP) Bell 212 helicopter was damaged in its fuel tank by Ecuadorian fire. At 12:05, Peruvian ground attack aircraft make their first appearance over the valley, but withdraw upon being informed of the presence of FAE interceptors in the area. *29 January: In a pattern that will continue during the next days, Peruvian forces launch multiple and simultaneous attacks all over the area, in an effort to off-balance the Ecuadorian defenses. The Ecuadorians fight back at Tiwinza, Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur, and Coangos, and shoot down a Soviet-made Mi-8TV helicopter (EP-587) belonging to the Peruvian Army Aviation (AEP) becomes the first confirmed kill for the Ecuadorian MANPADS teams on the ground. At the end of the day, Peru announces having captured three Ecuadorian strongholds as a result of the day's actions, which Ecuador goes on to deny. *31 January: After a 24-hours lull in the fight, the Peruvians resume their attacks against Tiwinza, Coangos, and Cueva de los Tayos. Ecuador and Peru reject an international appeal for an immediate ceasefire. *1 February: The assaults continue, now with strong artillery support. Peruvian A-37B ground attack aircraft appear over the battlefield and bomb Ecuadorian positions. The Ecuadorian base of C√≥ndor Mirador, in the summit of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor falls also under attack. A Peruvian patrol approaching Cueva de los Tayos hits a minefield and suffers severe losses. *2 February: During the day, the FAP carries out no less than twelve ground attack sorties, in support of the ground troops assaulting Cueva de los Tayos and Base Sur. FAE interceptors, still flying from bases too far north, near Guayaquil, appear too late to find any targets. *3 February: Ecuadorian Strikemasters and A-37B ground attack aircraft appear for the first time to bomb Peruvian positions. *4 February: Peruvian Tucanos bomb Ecuadorian positions in the valley during a night bombing sortie. *6 February: The FAP begins to make use of its Canberra jet bombers to strike Ecuadorian positions. One Canberra is lost perhaps crashed into a mountain due to the bad weather conditions over the area. *7 February: In a bitter reminder of the dangers that the Cenepa valley pose for low-speed aircraft flying at low-altitudes, a FAP Mi-25 helicopter gunship is downed after being hit in quick succession by at least two (probably three) SA-16s shoulder-fired missiles. FAE A-37Bs, escorted by Kfir fighters, continue to attack Peruvian positions. One A-37B is hit by Peruvian AA fire, but manages to get back to base. *9 February: Heavy air activity. The FAP carries out no less than 16 ground attack sorties, throwing its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers into the battle. FAP Canberras carry out a night bombing mission. Mirage F.1JA (FAE-806) was one of aircraft supposedly involved in the claimed \\"shot down\\" of two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22 on 10 February 1995. *February 10: Heavy air activity continues over the battlezone. During the morning, the FAP sends in A-37Bs and Sukhoi Su-22 to strike Ecuadorian positions. The FAE steps in. At 12:42, the Ecuadorian radars pick up five enemy targets approaching for another round of attacks. Two FAE Mirage F.1JAs and two IAI Kfir C.2s are sent to intercept the incoming aircraft. In the ensuing action an A-37B subsonic aircraft is shot down by a Kfir and two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22s were claimed to be shot down by the Ecuadorian Mirage F1 respectively. Peru, however, denied that the two Sukhoi Su-22s were shot down by Mirages, stating that one was struck by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery during a low flying ground-attack mission, and the second because of an engine fire.Diario \\"El Mundo\\", edici√≥n N¬∞ 114 del 4-5 de Marzo de 1995, p. 2Cruz, Cesar. \\"Peruvian Fitters Unveiled\\".

Air Forces Monthly, March 2006, p.48. *11 February: Further Peruvian Special Forces reinforcements arrive at PV-1. As the ground war drags on, air activity over the area increases. Encouraged by the events of the day before, the Ecuadorian A-37Bs launch even bolder ground-attack missions on Peruvian positions. One FAE A-37B is hit by a Peruvian MANPADS. *12 February: Air operations continue. The Peruvians claim the destruction of one A-37B and one Kfir, both of them denied by Ecuador. *13 February: Peruvian forces launch powerful attacks against Coangos and Tiwinza, with heavy air support. One Peruvian Mi-8TV is lost to Ecuadorian fire. In the evening, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori appears before the cameras to claim the taking of Tiwinza (Tiwinza \\"I\\" Cota 1209) and total victory for Peru. However the Ecuadorians denied this claim by \\"showing the position of Tiwinza\\" by GPS, but their coordinates were false. *14‚Äì16 February: Combat continues all along the area. *17 February: In the presence of the four guarantor countries of the Rio Protocol (the US, Brazil, Chile, Argentina), Ecuadorian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marcelo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, and Peruvian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eduardo Ponce, sign a peace declaration in Brazil (Declaraci√≥n de Paz de Itamaraty), confirming a ceasefire, a separation of forces, a general demobilization, and establishing a \\"guarantors\\" peacekeeping force, the MOMEP (Military Observer Mission, Ecuador Peru), charged with supervising the separation of forces, taking over the posts of Tiwinza and Base Sur, and suggesting the limits for an eventual demilitarized zone. Ecuador and Peru pledge themselves to begin talks on the \\"pending issues\\". *21 February: The first MOMEP observers arrive to the Ecuadorian rear base of Patuca, but confused fighting rages on all-day long, preventing the observers to reach the area of the conflict. Ecuador claims Peruvian helicopters are violating the cease-fire by flying over the Ecuadorian posts. *22 February: In a day that Ecuadorians refer to as \\"Black Wednesday\\", Peruvian forces launch a strong attack on Ecuadorian positions in Cenepa valley (Tiwinza Cota 1061). According to Ecuadorian sources, fourteen of their soldiers died that day, the worst in terms of casualties for the Ecuadorian Army during the war. That afternoon and night, the Ecuadorian forces retaliate against Peruvians positions until the next day, when intense activity was detected in the Peruvian lines, identified by the Ecuadorian officers as the evacuation of the casualties caused by the offensive the night before. *February 28: After more days of confusing skirmishes, Ecuador and Peru sign the Montevideo Declaration, \\"reiterating their commitment to proceed to an immediate and effective ceasefire\\".Cuvi, pp. 225‚Äì6. Although minor incidents would continue all over the area during the next months, the Cenepa War is officially over. Aftermath By the beginning of March 1995, the MOMEP observers had entered the area and began to supervise the separation of forces. In accordance with the Treaty of Itamaraty and the Declaration of Montevideo, the Ecuadorians began to withdraw all their units to the base of Coangos, while the Peruvians were to do the same to PV-1. From there, troops would be extracted according to a schedule implement by the MOMEP. All combatants were withdrawn from the delimited and undemarcated area by May 5, 1995. A demilitarized zone came into effect on August 4 of the same year. Ecuador and Peru went on to negotiate the final demarcation of the border, in a lengthy process marked by one crisis after another, with a total war almost erupting in August 1998. Finally, on October 26, 1998, in Bras√≠lia, Jamil Mahuad, President of Ecuador, and Alberto Fujimori, President of Peru, along with the Presidents of Brazil, Argentina, and Chile; and a personal representative of the President of the United States of America, signed a Presidential Act, which proclaimed \\"the definitive resolution of the border disputes between the two nations\\".Cuvi, p. 242. In a decision that certain political sectors on both sides took as a setback, the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol determined that the boundary of the delimited and undemarcated zone was in fact the Cordillera del C√≥ndor line, as Peru had been claiming from the 1940s. While Ecuador was forced to renounce its decades-old territorial claims as Tumbes, Jaen and Maynas as well as on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as the entire western area of the Cenepa headwaters, Peru \\"gives\\" to Ecuador, as a \\"private property\\" but without sovereignty and only for commemorative and non-military events, one square kilometer of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza was located (level 1061), focal point of the war, inside the Peruvian soil, anyone born in Tiwinza will be considered Peruvian. The final demarcation of the border came into effect on May 13, 1999. =Casualties and material losses= Figures given for losses during the Cenepa War vary widely, especially regarding human casualties. Ecuadorian military sources put the casualties at 34 killed recognized by Comando Conjunto de las FFAA del Ecuador and 154 killed and wounded recognized by Asociaci√≥n de ex combatientes del Cenepa, Quito, Ecuador. As of February 2005, an Ecuadorian Cenepa war veterans' association had a membership of 131 ex-combatants, some of them with long-term health disorders caused by the war. ALDHU, a human rights NGO, has put the total number of mortal casualties for both sides at around 500. This figure was also given by Ecuadorian senior officers after the war,Herz, p. 47. reflecting the fact that Peruvians found themselves attacking well-protected Ecuadorian positions and subjected to continuous ambushes and well-aimed artillery and rocket fire from the heights of the Condor range. The aircraft and helicopter losses mentioned above represent the losses acknowledged by each side during the conflict due to enemy action or to accidents, as cited in the Air Combat Information Group Website. According to the same source, Peru may have lost up to three helicopters during the conflict, and Ecuador may have lost one attack helicopter in unclear circumstances. Faundes, citing Ecuadorian sources, puts the total of Peruvian losses at four fixed-wing aircraft and three helicopters. Both sources agree that Ecuador lost one AT-33A trainer in an accident outside the combat area, three fallen A-37 and two defective kfir cannot return to the theater of operations in the conflict. =Illegal armament sale controversy= Chile During the war, a series of Peruvian newspapers brought forth information claiming that Chile had sold armament to Ecuador during the conflict. This claim was promptly denied by Chile the following day on February 5, 1995, but admitted that they had sold weaponry to Ecuador on September 12, 1994, as part of a regular commercial exchange that had no aim against any particular nation. The source of this deal has been traced back to 1977, when the military regime of Augusto Pinochet signed an agreement with the Ecuadorian military authorities then ruling the country (headed by Alfredo Poveda) for the sale of armament by the state-run FAMAE factory. That contract was reportedly renewed around the reported time of the registered legal sale (September 1994), which led to the aforementioned shipment of military hardware to Ecuador. (in Spanish) In 1995, and due to lack of further information, Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, put a momentary end to the scandal. However, the controversy was once again ignited when General V√≠ctor Manuel Bayas, former Chief of Staff of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces during the Cenepa War, made a series of declarations in regards to the armed conflict between Peru and Ecuador. On March 21, 2005, General Bayas was asked by the Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio if Chile had sold armaments to Ecuador during the Cenepa War, to which he replied: ‚ÄúYes, it was a contract with the militaries during the conflict.\\" Furthermore, General Bayas revealed that Argentina and Russia had also sold weaponry to Ecuador during the conflict. Later that same year, on April 11, Colonel Ernesto Checa, Ecuador's military representative in Chile during the Cenepa War, stated that Chile provided Ecuador with \\"ammunition, rifles and night vision devices\\" during the war. Moreover, the Peruvian government revealed that it held knowledge that during the war at least a couple of Ecuadorian C-130 transport airplanes had landed in Chilean territory to pick up 9mm ammunition, and that the Ecuadorian Air Force had planned three more of those armament acquisition voyages to Chile. Nonetheless, the Peruvian government at that time regarded this as a minor incident due to the Chilean Sub-secretary of Foreign Relations, Mariano Fern√°ndez, telling the Peruvian ambassador in Chile, Alfonso de Rivero, on February 2, 1995, that the Chilean government would take immediate measures to stop any other possible operations of this nature. In this communication, Fern√°ndez is reported to have concurred to de Rivero's residence and revealed that only 9mm ammunition, which had been paid with anticipation, had been loaded in the Ecuadorian planes; that a Chilean lawyer representing Ecuador had demanded the fulfillment of the contract and that Ecuadorian military personnel who came on the plane asked for additional armament, only to have this petition denied; however Peruvian Caretas magazine reported that part of this information wasn't precise (without specifying which part). Apparently, the Chilean authorities were being sincere, as President Frei only took notice of the departure of the Ecuadorian Hercules planes (loaded only with ammunition) hours after they had left. Chile's response to the declarations made by General Bayas were made the following day on March 22, 2005. The government of Chile denied the claims and stated that the only registered sale of weapons to Ecuador was in 1994. Jaime Ravinet, the Chilean Minister of Defense, assured that any other armament transfer after the 1994 date had been illegal. Ravinet further stated that, after discussing the matter with his Peruvian counterpart, Roberto Chiabra, the situation had been resolved. Yet, the Peruvian government did not find the February 5, 1995, and March 22, 2005, declarations as acceptable or sufficient; and went on to send a note of protest to the Chilean government. Peru further claimed that Chile should have maintained absolute neutrality and that this alleged weapons commerce during the Cenepa War went against resolutions made by the United Nations and the Organization of American States. In the end, the whole operation was revealed to be the planning of former dictator Pinochet, then chief of the Armed Forces (until 1998). Quoting Peruvian ambassador to Chile in 1995 (de Rivero), the Chilean Sub-secretary (Fern√°ndez) \\"pointed out to me that President Frei and chancellor (foreign minister) Insulza had been deeply worried by the situation and that they were taking all the dispositions of the case to reform the military sales law\\". Reportedly, Pinochet himself later assumed direct responsibility for the shipment before the civilian authorities of his country (even if his lawyer denied it in 2005), as he still exercised considerable influence over state institutions and controlled the security apparatus, thus having power to bypass civilian controls to foreign arms sales. It is worth noting that Pinochet, who had lived in Ecuador during the second half of the 1950s as a military instructor, had a deep affection towards the country and, a couple of years later, in November‚ÄìDecember 1997, made a controversial and highly publicized visit to Ecuador where he attended a series of ceremonies and was given six military and civilian decorations by that country's civilian and military authorities. (in Spanish) (in Spanish) Argentina Argentina admitted to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President Carlos Menem between the years of 1991 and 1995. The controversy regarding the decrees came about when the weapons sold did not go to Panama, Bolivia, and Venezuela as had been accorded, but instead the weapons ended up in Croatia and Ecuador at times when both of these nations were involved in wars and prohibited from receiving international military aid. The sale Argentina gave to Ecuador included 6.500 tons of rifles, cannons, anti-tank rockets, and ammunition. Menem was taken to court for his alleged association with these illegal acts in 2001, but was acquitted by Argentina's Supreme Court; however, in October 2008 the case was re-opened, but Menem avoided being detained by Argentine authorities until 2010 when his position as senator of La Rioja. Menem claimed to have had no association with the illegal weapons trade, and further adds that this is a political persecution made by Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez and, her husband and also former Argentine president, N√©stor Kirchner. In 2013 Carlos Menem was sentenced to seven years in prison for arms-smuggling. Characteristics of the fighting in 1995 Several explanations have been brought forward to explain the outcome of the Cenepa conflict. Some of these can be briefly summarized here: *Logistics. Both during the buildup of forces and during the clashes of January and February, the Peruvian Army found itself at a logistical disadvantage. The fact that all reinforcements and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter from Ciro Alegr√≠a base, more than 110 km to the south, meant that, in general, the Ecuadorian forces went into combat better armed and supplied. Moreover, once the shooting war started, the Cenepa valley became a rather dangerous place for the Peruvian Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17 helicopters, which besides their transport duties also carried out ground-attack missions. *Force Composition. Right from the very first clashes, the Ecuadorian Army committed Special Forces units all along the combat area. In addition to the paratroopers, the Ecuadorians sent into battle a number of \\"Iwia\\" detachments ‚Äî units composed of tribal people such as the Shuar people, specialized in jungle combat and survival. Until the arrival of some elite counterinsurgency units from the south (battle-hardened by a leftist insurgency) the Peruvian forces committed to the battle were composed mostly of young and inexperienced conscripts. *Terrain. In 1995, the Ecuadorian Army fought on terrain of its own choosing. From the heights of the Condor mountain range, the Ecuadorians had a commanding view of the entire combat area. The Ecuadorian artillery -carefully camouflaged on the reverse slopes of the Condor range- could deliver precise and deadly fire upon attacking Peruvian troops. By the same token, the Ecuadorian antiaircraft batteries and SAMs located on the heights made helicopter low-level flight into the valley a dangerous proposition. *State of the opposing air forces at the outbreak of the crisis. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three Mirage 2000Ps were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers was in the same situation, with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft. Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and SEPECAT Jaguars, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del C√≥ndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made Blowpipe missiles and Russian-made SA-16 MANPADS. Nevertheless, such defences didn't stop the continuous raids of the Peruvian Air Force.

Founded 6 December 1946, it is the second youngest branch in the Norwegian forces after the Norwegian Cyber Force (). It has land, sea and air defense units, and has volunteers and conscript personnel with backgrounds from all branches. Its main focus is local defense and civil support, but it can also detach volunteers for international operations. Organization It is divided into districts (\\"HV-districts\\"), which again is divided into smaller units, typically covering a single Municipality. In a wartime situation Heimevernet will typically be used to protect the local infrastructure and population. Strength The Home Guard has a peacetime personnel number of 500. On high readiness, there are 3,000 Rapid Reaction Force personnel, 16,500 \\"Strengthening Force\\" personnel and 20,000 \\"Follow-up Force\\" personnel. The total Home Guard Force is approximately 40,000.https://forsvaret.no/hv/org/distr  Troop exchange  The Home Guard does a troop exchange with the Minnesota National Guard every year. The exchange grew from Norwegian American soldiers sent to Norway to assist resistance fighters in World War II. As part of the exchange, American Guard members are flown to V√¶rnes Air Station and Norwegians are sent to Camp Ripley. Troops complete each other's training, and tour the area. Vessel of the Naval Home Guard  The Rapid Reaction Forces  From 2005, the Home Guard has recruited for a high readiness force with better trained and equipped personnel. It is called the \\"Rapid Reaction Force\\" (Norwegian: Innsatsstyrke). This is the spearhead of the combat force that consists of specially selected, educated and equipped personnel. The force can be mobilized rapidly and is a national resource. Effort strengths contribute to national security. Soldiers often come from operational armed forces in the Armed Forces and commit themselves to a minimum of 3 years service each and can be ordered on a sharp mission in Norway. They must update and further develop their military competence continuously. They can attend a number of courses, task force missions and other defense activities. There is one Rapid Reaction Force per district, in total 3,000 men and women. The Rapid Reaction Force is the speartip of the Norwegian Home Guard, and contains flexible and mobile units. It has top priority when concerning weapons, material and training resources. The force is ready to respond within hours to acts of terrorism, bomb threats, and or other emergencies. In peacetime, the RRFs can support the police and civilian community with a variety of tasks, including providing security for the public and enforcing police regulations. The RRFs are named after operations executed during WW2 by the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (a.k.a.

In this way, each district will be able to respond to any kind of incident that could occur, without having to rely on outside help. Each district (with some variations) will have trained operators in these different types of units: * Jegertropp (Ranger platoon) * Skarpskyttertropp (Sniper platoon) * MP-tjeneste (Military Police platoon) * Hundetjenesten (K9 unit) * Stabstropp (Staff platoon ‚Äì (S-1, to S-4), transport & logistics) * Sambandstropp (Signal platoon) * Dykkerlag (Diving team ‚Äì Underwater reconnaissance, explosives-detection) * Sanitetstropp (Medical platoon) * Innsatstropper (Infantry platoons) a Light Mechanized unit has been established in district's 12, 14 and 16. this one is called Multi-Troppen (Multi Platoon).

Scottish philosopher John Haldane first coined the term in the early 1990s and has since been one of the movement's leading proponents. According to Haldane, \\"analytical Thomism involves the bringing into mutual relationship of the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the ideas and concerns shared by St Thomas and his followers\\". History The modern revival of Aquinas's thought can be traced to the work of mid-19th Century thomists, such as Tommaso Maria Zigliara, Josef Kleutgen, Gaetano Sanseverino, and Giovanni Maria Cornoldi. This movement received an enormous impetus by Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Aeterni Patris of 1879. In the first half of the twentieth century, Edouard Hugon, R√©ginald Garrigou- Lagrange, √âtienne Gilson, and Jacques Maritain, among others, carried on Leo's call for a Thomist revival. Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers. Some of the latter then began to harmonize Thomism with broader contemporary philosophical trends. Similarly, the Krak√≥w Circle in Poland used mathematical logic in presenting Thomism, which the Circle judged to have \\"a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment, etc.\\" The Circle has been said to be \\"the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars\\". Recent philosophical reception of Aquinas By the middle of the 20th century Aquinas's thought came into dialogue with the analytical tradition through the work of G. E. M. Anscombe, Peter Geach, and Anthony Kenny. Anscombe was Ludwig Wittgenstein's student, and his successor at the University of Cambridge; she was married to Geach, himself an accomplished logician and philosopher of religion. Geach had converted to Roman Catholicism while studying at Oxford, Anscombe had converted before she came up, and both were instructed in the Faith in Oxford by the Dominican Richard Kehoe, who received them both into the Church before they met one another. Kenny, an erstwhile priest and former Catholic, became a prominent philosopher at the University of Oxford and is still portrayed by some as a promoter of Aquinas (Paterson & Pugh, xiii-xxiii), though his denial of some basic Thomist doctrines (e.g. divine timelessness) casts doubt on this. Anscombe, and others such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John Finnis, can largely be credited with the revival of \\"virtue ethics\\" in analytic moral theory and \\"natural law theory\\" in jurisprudence. Both movements draw significantly upon Aquinas.

It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, folkloristics and cultural heritage, sociology and psychology, while examining aspects of the design of the game, the players in the game, and the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of video games, but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including sports, board games, etc. Before video games, game studies was rooted primarily in anthropology. However, with the development and spread of video games, games studies has diversified methodologically, to include approaches from sociology, psychology, and other fields. There are now a number of strands within game studies: social science approaches explore how games function in society, and their interactions with human psychology, often using empirical methods such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. Humanities approaches emphasise how games generate meanings and reflect or subvert wider social and cultural discourses. These often use more interpretative methods, such as close reading, textual analysis, and audience theory, methods shared with other media disciplines such as television and film studies. Social sciences and humanities approaches can cross over, for example in the case of ethnographic or folkloristic studies, where fieldwork may involve patiently observing games to try to understand their social and cultural meanings. Game design approaches are closely related to creative practice, analysing game mechanics and aesthetics in order to inform the development of new games. Finally, industrial and engineering approaches apply mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examine things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking. History It wasn't until Irving Finkel organized a colloquium in 1990 that grew into the International Board Game Studies Association, Gonzalo Frasca popularized the term ludology (from the Latin word for game, ludus) in 1999, the publication of the first issues of academic journals like Board Game Studies in 1998 and Game Studies in 2001, and the creation of the Digital Games Research Association in 2003, that scholars began to get the sense that the study of games could (and should) be considered a field in its own right. As a young field, it gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games, such as psychology, anthropology, economy, education, and sociology. The earliest known use of the term \\"ludology\\" occurred in 1982, in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's ‚ÄúDoes Being Human Matter ‚Äì On Some Interpretive Problems of Comparative Ludology.‚Äù Social science One of the earliest social science theories (1971) about the role of video games in society involved violence in video games, later becoming known as the catharsis theory. The theory suggests that playing video games in which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression, resulting in less aggression in the players real lives. However, a meta-study performed by Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman, in 2001, examined data starting from the 1980s up until the article was published. The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive behaviors. They concluded that exposure to violence in video games did indeed cause an increase in aggression. However, it has been pointed out, and even stressed, by psychologist Jonathan Freedman that this research was very limited and even problematic since overly strong claims were made and the authors themselves seemed extremely biased in their writings. More recent studies, such as the one performed by Christopher J. Ferguson at Texas A&M; International University have come to drastically different conclusions. In this study, individuals were either randomly assigned a game, or allowed to choose a game, in both the randomized and the choice conditions exposure to violent video games caused no difference in aggression. A later study (performed by the same people) looked for correlations between trait aggression, violent crimes, and exposure to both real life violence and violence in video games, this study suggests that while family violence and trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime, exposure to video game violence was not a good predictor of violent crime, having little to no correlation, unless also paired with the above traits that had a much higher correlation. Over the past 15 years, a large number of meta-studies have been applied to this issue, each coming to its own conclusion, resulting in little consensus in the ludology community. It is also thought that even nonviolent video games may lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. Anderson and Dill seem to believe that it may be due to the frustration of playing video games that could in turn result in violent, aggressive behaviour. Game designers Amy Jo Kim and Jane McGonigal have suggested that platforms which leverage the powerful qualities of video games in non-game contexts can maximize learning. Known as the gamification of learning, using game elements in non-game contexts extracts the properties of games from within the game context, and applies them to a learning context such as the classroom. Another positive aspect of video games is its conducive character towards the involvement of a person in other cultural activities. The probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production). Video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms of cultural consumption, inhibit thus value from a cultural perspective. More sociologically-informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life. For example, it has been suggested that the very popular MMO World of Warcraft could be used to study the dissemination of infectious diseases because of the accidental spread of a plague-like disease in the gameworld. \\"Ludology\\" vs \\"narratology\\" A major focus in game studies is the debate surrounding narratology and ludology. Many ludologists believe that the two are unable to exist together, while others believe that the two fields are similar but should be studied separately. Many narratologists believe that games should be looked at for their stories, like movies or novels. The ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due to the fact that a player is actively taking part in the experience and should therefore be understood on their own terms. The idea that a videogame is \\"radically different to narratives as a cognitive and communicative structure\\" has led the development of new approaches to criticism that are focused on videogames as well as adapting, repurposing and proposing new ways of studying and theorizing about videogames. A recent approach towards game studies starts with an analysis of interface structures and challenges the keyboard-mouse paradigm with what is called a \\"ludic interface\\". Academics across both fields provide scholarly insight into the different sides of this debate. Gonzalo Frasca, a notable ludologist due to his many publications regarding game studies, argues that while games share many similar elements with narrative stories, that should not prevent games to be studied as games. He seeks not \\"to replace the narratologic approach, but to complement it.\\" Jesper Juul, another notable ludologist, argues for a stricter separation of ludology and narratology. Juul argues that games \\"for all practicality can not tell stories.\\" This argument holds that narratology and ludology cannot exist together because they are inherently different. Juul claims that the most significant difference between the two is that in a narrative, events \\"have to\\" follow each other, whereas in a game the player has control over what happens. Garry Crawford and Victoria K. Gosling argue in favor of narratives being an essential part of games as \\"it is impossible to isolate play from the social influences of everyday life, and in turn, play will have both intended and unintended consequences for the individual and society.\\" The Last of Us is a video game released in 2013 that has been referred to as a narrative \\"masterpiece.\\" Proponents of the narratology side of game studies argue that The Last of Us and similar games that have followed it and preceded it, serve as examples that games can in fact tell stories. Janet Murray, in support of the Narratologist method of video game argues that \\"stories can be participatory.\\" In this argument, Murray is linking the characteristics of video games to narratives to further her point that video games should be analyzed through narratology. Michalis Kokonis argues in favor of Gonzalo Frasca's article entitled \\"Ludologists love stories too: notes from a debate that never took place,\\" which aimed to list and explain the misunderstandings, mistakes, and prejudices surrounding the narratology vs. ludology debate. Kokonis noted that \\"endorsing his [Frasca] constructivist spirit we will have to agree that the so-called Narratology vs. Ludology Dilemma is a false one and that this debate will have to be resolved, as it is of no help to the cause of establishing Computer Games Study as an autonomous and independent academic field.\\" Other areas of research As is common with most academic disciplines, there are a number of more specialized areas or sub-domains of study. =Video game pre-history= An emerging field of study looks at the \\"pre-history\\" of video games, suggesting that the origins of modern digital games lie in: fairground attractions and sideshows such as shooting games; early \\"Coney Island\\"-style pleasure parks with elements such as large roller- coasters and \\"haunted house\\" simulations; nineteenth century landscape simulations such as dioramas, panoramas, planetariums, and stereographs; and amusement arcades that had mechanical game machines and also peep-show film machines. =Games and aging= In light of population ageing, there has been an interest into the use of games to improve the overall health and social connectedness of ageing players. For example, Adam Gazzaley and his team have designed NeuroRacer (a game that improves cognitive tasks outside of the game among its 60+ year old participants), while the AARP has organized a game jam to improve older people's social connections. Researchers such as Sarah Mosberg Iversen have argued that most of the academic work on games and ageing has been informed by notions of economical productivity, while Bob De Schutter and Vero Vanden Abeele have suggested a game design approach that is not focused on age-related decline but instead is rooted in the positive aspects of older age. =Virtual economies in gaming= Massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about the real world. Markets based on digital information can be fully tracked as they are used by players, and thus real problems in the economy, such as inflation, deflation and even recession. The solutions the game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information, and experiments can be performed where the economy can be studied as a whole. These games allow the economists to be omniscient, they can find every piece of information they need to study the economy, while in the real world they have to work with presumptions. Former Finance Minister of Greece and Valve's in-house economist Yanis Varoufakis studied EVE Online and argued that video game communities give economists a venue for experimenting and simulating the economies of the future. Edward Castronova has studied virtual economies within a variety of games including Everquest and World of Warcraft. = Cognitive benefits = The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity. Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions. These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world. Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed. The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user's constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened. The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation. The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved thanks in part to video games, due to the need to operate the controller and view the screen displaying the content all at the same time. The coordination of the player is enhanced due to the playing and continuous observation of a video game since the game gives high mental stimulation and coordination is important and therefore enhanced due to the constant visual and physical movement that is produced from the playing of the video game. The playing of video games can also help increase a player's social skills. This is done by playing online multiplayer games which can require constant communication, this leads to socialization between players in order to achieve the goal within the game they may be playing. In addition it can help the users to meet new friends over their online games and at the same time communicate with friends they have already made in the past; those playing together online would only strengthen their already established bond through constant cooperation. Some video games are specifically designed to aid in learning, because of this another benefit of playing video games could be the educational value provided with the entertainment. Some video games present problem solving questions that the player must think on in order to properly solve, while action orientated video games require strategy in order to successfully complete. This process of being forced to think critically helps to sharpen the mind of the player.  Game culture  One aspect of game studies is the study of gaming culture. People who play video games are a subculture of their own. Gamers will often form communities with their own languages, attend conventions where they will dress up as their favorite characters, and have gaming competitions. One of these conventions, Gamescom 2018, had a record attendance with an estimated 370,000 attendees. eSports is making a significant impact in gaming culture. In 2018, Newzoo, a marketing analytics company reported that 380 million people will watch eSports that year. Many gamers seek to form communities to meet new people and share their love of games. In 2014, Newzoo reported that 81% of gamers attend eSport to be a part of the gaming community. \\"61% of gamers attend live events and tournaments to connect with friends that they've met and played with online.\\" Throughout the years, there has been much research on the topic of game culture, specifically focusing on video games in relation to thinking, learning, gender, children, and war. When looking at game culture, multiplayer online games are usually the base for many research. = Demographics of Gamers (in the USA) = * 75% of households have a gamer. * 65% of adults play video games. * 60% of adults play on smartphones, 52% play on a personal computer, and 49% play on a dedicated game console. * 32 is the average age of male gamers. * 34 is the average age of female gamers. * 54% of gamers are men. 46% are women.

It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in other European monarchies, all of which have abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies. The coronation usually takes place several months after the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen Elizabeth II was crowned on 2 June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6 February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months. The ceremony is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior cleric in the Church of England, of which the monarch is supreme governor. Other clergy and members of the nobility also have roles; most participants in the ceremony are required to wear ceremonial uniforms or robes and coronets. Many other government officials and guests attend, including representatives of other countries. The essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there. History =Development of the English coronation= Coronation of Harold II of England at Westminster Abbey in 1066. From the Bayeux Tapestry. The main elements of the coronation service and the earliest form of oath can be traced to the ceremony devised by Saint Dunstan for Edgar's coronation in 973 AD at Bath Abbey. It drew on ceremonies used by the kings of the Franks and those used in the ordination of bishops. Two versions of coronation services, known as ordines (from the Latin ordo meaning \\"order\\") or recensions, survive from before the Norman Conquest. It is not known if the first recension was ever used in England and it was the second recension which was used by Edgar in 973 and by subsequent Anglo-Saxon and early Norman kings.Gosling, pp. 5‚Äì7. Coronation of Henry IV of England at Westminster in 1399 A third recension was probably compiled during the reign of Henry I and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice.Strong, pp. 43‚Äì44. It remained in use until the coronation of Edward II in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings.Strong, pp. 81‚Äì82. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.Strong, p. 84. Following the start of the reformation in England, the boy king Edward VI had been crowned in the first Protestant coronation in 1547, during which Archbishop Thomas Cranmer preached a sermon against idolatry and \\"the tyranny of the bishops of Rome\\". However, six years later, he was succeeded by his half-sister, Mary I, who restored the Catholic rite.Strong, pp. 204‚Äì206. In 1559, Elizabeth I underwent the last English coronation under the auspices of the Catholic Church; however, Elizabeth's insistence on changes to reflect her Protestant beliefs resulted in several bishops refusing to officiate at the service and it was conducted by the low- ranking Bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe.Strong, p. 208. =Scottish coronations= Alexander III of Scotland at his coronation aged eight at Scone Abbey in 1249, being greeted by the royal poet who will recite the king's genealogy Scottish coronations were traditionally held at Scone Abbey, with the king seated on the Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of D√°l Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown does not seem to have been used until the inauguration of Alexander II in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy.Thomas, pp. 46‚Äì47. After the coronation of John Balliol, the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296 and taken to Westminster Abbey. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of Henry IV in 1399.Strong, pp. 75‚Äì76. Pope John XXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant James V at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of St Andrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden.Thomas, pp. 50‚Äì51. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony.Thomas, p. 53. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.Thomas, pp. 54‚Äì55. James VI had been crowned in The Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling, in 1567 and inherited the English crown in 1603. Charles I travelled north for a Scottish coronation at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh in 1633,Range, p. 43. but caused consternation amongst the Presbyterian Scots by his insistence on elaborate High Anglican ritual, arousing \\"gryt feir of inbriginge of poperie\\".Strong, p. 257. Charles II underwent a simple Presbyterian coronation ceremony at Scone in 1651, but his brother James II and VII was never crowned in Scotland, although Scottish peers attended his coronation in London, setting a precedent for future ceremonies.Strong, p. 351. =Modern coronations= Partial illustration of the State Procession prior to the Coronation of James II and Mary of Modena at Westminster, 23 April 1685 The Liber Regalis was translated into English for the first time for the coronation of James I in 1601, partly as a result of the reformation in England requiring services to be understood by the people,Gosling, p. 10. but also an attempt by antiquarians to recover a lost English identity from before the Norman Conquest.Strong, p. 244 In 1685, James II, who was a Catholic, ordered a truncated version of the service omitting the Eucharist, but this was restored for later monarchs. Only four years later, the service was again revised by Henry Compton for the coronation of William III and Mary II. The Latin text was resurrected for the 1714 coronation of the German-speaking George I, since it was the only common language between the king and the clergy. Perhaps because the 1761 coronation of George III had been beset by \\"numerous mistakes and stupidities\\",Gosling pp. 54‚Äì55 the next time around, spectacle overshadowed the religious aspect of the service. The coronation of George IV in 1821 was an expensive and lavish affair with a vast amount of money being spent on it. George's brother and successor William IV had to be persuaded to be crowned at all; his coronation at a time of economic depression in 1831 cost only one sixth of that spent on the previous event. Traditionalists threatened to boycott what they called a \\"Half Crown-nation\\".Strong, p. 401. The king merely wore his robes over his uniform as Admiral of the Fleet. For this coronation, a number of economising measures were made which would set a precedent followed by future monarchs. The assembly of peers and ceremonial at Westminster Hall involving the presentation of the regalia to the monarch was eliminated. The procession from Westminster Hall to the Abbey on foot was likewise eliminated and in its place, a state procession by coach from St James's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event. The coronation banquet after the service proper was also disposed of. When Victoria was crowned in 1838, the service followed the pared-down precedent set by her uncle, and the under-rehearsed ceremonial was marred by mistakes and accidents.Gosling p. 52 The music in the abbey was widely criticised in the press, only one new piece having been written for it and the large choir and orchestra were badly coordinated.Range, p. 224 In the 20th century, liturgical scholars sought to restore the spiritual meaning of the ceremony by rearranging elements with reference to the medieval texts,Strong, p. 470. creating a \\"complex marriage of innovation and tradition\\".Strong, p. 480. The greatly increased pageantry of the state processions was intended to emphasise the strength and diversity of the British Empire.Richards, p. 101 =Bringing coronations to the people= Queen Elizabeth I carried from her Coronation in a horse-borne litter, 15 January 1559 The idea of the need to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the ceremony a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of Richard II who was a 10-year- old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the City of London by the lord mayor, aldermen and the livery companies, and he was conducted to the Tower of London where he spent the night in vigil. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the public conduits flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in Cheapside, probably to represent the New Jerusalem, where a girl blew gold leaf over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of Charles II in 1661.Strong, pp. 133‚Äì135. Charles's pageant was watched by Samuel Pepys who wrote: \\"So glorious was the show with gold and silver that we were not able to look at it\\". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queenGosling p. 33 and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from Westminster Hall to the abbey. For the coronation of Coronation of William IV and Adelaide in 1831, a state procession from St James's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event. their coronation in 1911. It was the first time any part of the service had been photographed. In early modern coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually recorded by artists and published in elaborate folio books of engravings,Strong, p. 415. the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier.Strong, p. 432. Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for three months after the real event. In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but Sir Benjamin Stone photographed the procession into the abbey. Nine years later, at the coronation of George V, Stone was allowed to photograph the recognition, the presentation of the swords, and the homage.Strong, p. 433. The coronation of George VI in 1937 was broadcast on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and parts of the service were filmed and shown in cinemas.Rose, p. 121. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament.The Times (London). 29 October 1952. p. 4. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20 million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.Strong, pp. 433‚Äì435. =Commonwealth realms= The need to include the various elements of the British Empire in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and governors-general of the British Dominions, by then almost completely autonomous, and also by many of the rulers of the Indian Princely States and the various British Protectorates. An Imperial Conference was held afterwards.Strong, p. 437. In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the Indian Empire along with the traditional banners of the Home Nations. By 1937, the Statute of Westminster 1931 had made the dominions fully independent, and the wording of the coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.Strong, pp. 442‚Äì444. Thus since 1937, the monarch has been simultaneously crowned as sovereign of several independent nations besides the United Kingdom, known since 1953 as the Commonwealth realms. Elizabeth II was asked, for example: \\"Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?\\" Preparations Westminster Abbey has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066. =Timing= The timing of the coronation has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 and may have been intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised.Strong, pp. 6‚Äì7. Harold II was crowned on the day after the death of his predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession;Strong, p. 38. whereas the first Norman monarch, William I, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25 December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. Edward I was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. Edward II's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. Henry VI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost,Gosling, p. 5. William I's on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors,Strong, p. 36. and John's was on Ascension Day.Strong, p. 43. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date.Strong, p. 212. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England. Under the Hanoverian monarchs in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was deemed appropriate to extend the waiting period to several months, following a period of mourning for the previous monarch and to allow time for preparation of the ceremony. In the case of every monarch since and including George IV, at least one year has passed between accession and coronation, with the exception of George VI, whose predecessor did not die but abdicated. The coronation date had already been set; planning simply continued with a new monarch. Since a period of time has often passed between accession and coronation, some monarchs were never crowned. Edward V and Lady Jane Grey were both deposed before they could be crowned, in 1483 and 1553, respectively. Edward VIII also went uncrowned, as he abdicated in 1936 before the end of the customary one-year period between accession and coronation. A monarch, however, accedes to the throne the moment their predecessor dies, not when they are crowned, hence the traditional proclamation: \\"The king is dead, long live the king!\\" =Location= The Anglo-Saxon monarchs used various locations for their coronations, including Bath, Kingston upon Thames, London, and Winchester. The last Anglo-Saxon monarch, Harold II, was crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1066; the location was preserved for all future coronations. When London was under the control of rebels,Strong, p. 72. Henry III was crowned at Gloucester in 1216; he later chose to have a second coronation at Westminster in 1220. Two hundred years later, Henry VI also had two coronations; as king of England in London in 1429, and as king of France in Paris in 1431. =Coronation of consorts and others= Coronation of Henry the Young King in 1170 Coronations may be performed for a person other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father Henry II; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this is only one of two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married at the time of his coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may be performed. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and Mary II.Strong, pp. 30‚Äì31. Note: The dates of the coronations of three queens are unknown. The most recent was that of George VI and the former Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533.Strong, pp. 30‚Äì31. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, Charles II, did not have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza.Woolley, p. 199. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being crowned with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, the monarch's heir apparent, may also be crowned in a ceremony known as an investiture. Participants =Clergy= The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has precedence over all other clergy and all laypersons except members of the royal family, traditionally officiates at coronations; in his absence, another bishop appointed by the monarch may take the archbishop's place. There have, however, been several exceptions. William I was crowned by the Archbishop of York, since the Archbishop of Canterbury had been appointed by the Antipope Benedict X, and this appointment was not recognised as valid by the Pope.Hilliam, p. 16. Edward II was crowned by the Bishop of Winchester because the Archbishop of Canterbury had been exiled by Edward I.Hilliam, p. 48. Mary I, a Catholic, refused to be crowned by the Protestant Archbishop Thomas Cranmer; the coronation was instead performed by the Bishop of Winchester.Strong, p. 205. Elizabeth I was crowned by the Bishop of Carlisle (to whose see is attached no special precedence) because the senior prelates were \\"either dead, too old and infirm, unacceptable to the queen, or unwilling to serve\\".Patrick Collinson, \\"Elizabeth I (1533‚Äì1603)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2012, Finally, when James II was deposed and replaced with William III and Mary II jointly, the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to recognise the new sovereigns; he had to be replaced by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton.Strong, p. 337. Hence, in almost all cases where the Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to participate, his place has been taken by a senior cleric: the Archbishop of York is second in precedence, the Bishop of London third, the Bishop of Durham fourth, and the Bishop of Winchester fifth. =Great Officers of State= The Great Officers of State traditionally participate during the ceremony. The offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable have not been regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies. The Lord Great Chamberlain enrobes the sovereign with the ceremonial vestments, with the aid of the Groom of the Robes and the Master (in the case of a king) or Mistress (in the case of a queen) of the Robes. The Barons of the Cinque Ports also participated in the ceremony. Formerly, the barons were the members of the House of Commons representing the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19th century, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of George IV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of William IV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the barons have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies. =Other claims to attend the coronation= Many landowners and other persons have honorific \\"duties\\" or privileges at the coronation. Such rights are determined by a special Court of Claims, over which the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II. By the Tudor period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and so Henry VIII began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of the court. In 1952, for example, the court accepted the claim of the Dean of Westminster to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the Earl of Shrewsbury in his capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the Scholars of Westminster School to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of \\"Vivat! Vivat Rex!\\" were still incorporated into the coronation anthem I was glad. =Other participants and guests= Along with persons of nobility, the coronation ceremonies are also attended by a wide range of political figures, including the prime minister and all members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, all governors-general and prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms, all governors of British Crown Colonies (now British Overseas Territories), as well as the heads of state of dependent nations. Dignitaries and representatives from other nations are also customarily invited. Hereditary peers and their spouses are also invited. For Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, 8,000 guests were squeezed into Westminster Abbey and each person had to make do with a maximum of of seating. Service The general framework of the coronation service is based on the sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions, a translation and has been modified for each coronation for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of regalia, crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon textStrong, 28‚Äì29 have remained constant.Gosling, p. 5 The coronation ceremonies takes place within the framework of Holy Communion. = Recognition and oath = Edward VII taking the oath in 1902 Before the entrance of the sovereign, the litany of the saints is sung during the procession of the clergy and other dignitaries. For the entrance of the monarch, Psalm 122, I was glad, is sung. The sovereign enters Westminster Abbey wearing the crimson surcoat and the Robe of State of crimson velvet and takes his or her seat on a Chair of Estate. Garter Principal King of Arms, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Constable and the Earl Marshal go to the east, south, west and north of the coronation theatre. At each side, the archbishop calls for the recognition of the sovereign, with the words, After the people acclaim the sovereign at each side, the archbishop administers an oath to the sovereign. Since the Glorious Revolution, the Coronation Oath Act of 1688 has required, among other things, that the sovereign \\"Promise and Sweare to Governe the People of this Kingdome of England and the Dominions thereto belonging according to the Statutes in Parlyament Agreed on and the Laws and Customs of the same\\". The oath has been modified without statutory authority; for example, at the coronation of Elizabeth II, the exchange between the Queen and the archbishop was as follows: In addition to the oath, the monarch may take what is known as the Accession Declaration if he or she has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation. Once the taking of the oath concludes, an ecclesiastic presents a Bible to the sovereign, saying \\"Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.\\" The Bible used is a full King James Bible, including the Apocrypha. At Elizabeth II's coronation, the Bible was presented by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Once the Bible is presented, the Holy Communion is celebrated, but the service is interrupted after the Nicene Creed. =Anointing= After the Communion service is interrupted, the anthem Come, Holy Ghost is recited, as a prelude to the act of anointing. After this anthem, the Archbishop recites a prayer in preparation for the anointing, which is based on the ancient prayer Deus electorum fortitudo also used in the anointing of French kings. After this prayer, the coronation anthem Zadok the Priest (by George Frederick Handel) is sung by the choir; meanwhile, the crimson robe is removed, and the sovereign proceeds to the Coronation Chair for the anointing, which has been set in a prominent position, wearing the anointing gown. In 1953, the chair stood atop a dais of several steps., Image of 'Completed Coronation Theatre' at bottom. This mediaeval chair has a cavity in the base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the \\"Stone of Destiny\\", it was used for ancient Scottish coronations until brought to England by Edward I. It has been used for every coronation at Westminster Abbey since. Until 1996, the stone was kept with the chair in Westminster Abbey, but it was moved that year to Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, where it is displayed on the proviso that it be returned to Westminster Abbey for use at future coronations. Once seated in this chair, a canopy of golden cloth is held over the monarch's head for the anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter. This element of the coronation service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze; it was not photographed in 1937 or televised in 1953. The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign in the form of a cross on the hands, head, and heart. The Coronation Spoon is the only part of the mediaeval Crown Jewels which survived the Commonwealth of England. While performing the anointing, the Archbishop recites a consecratory formula recalling the anointing of King Solomon by Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest. After being anointed, the monarch rises from the Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool placed in front of it. The archbishop then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is a modified English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy. =Investing= The sovereign is then enrobed in the colobium sindonis, over which is placed the supertunica. The Lord Great Chamberlain presents the spurs, which represent chivalry. The Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by other bishops, then presents the Sword of State to the sovereign. The sovereign is then further robed, this time receiving bracelets and putting the Robe Royal and Stole Royal on top of the supertunica. The Archbishop then delivers several Crown Jewels to the sovereign. First, he delivers the Orb, a hollow gold sphere decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. The Orb is surmounted by a cross, representing the rule of Jesus over the world;Hilliam, p. 209. it is returned to the altar immediately after being received. Next, the sovereign receives a ring representing his or her \\"marriage\\" to the nation.Hilliam, pp. 212‚Äì213. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, so called because it is surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Ghost, and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, which incorporates Cullinan I, are delivered to the sovereign.Hilliam, p. 210. =Crowning= The Archbishop of Canterbury lifts St Edward's Crown from the high altar, sets it back down, and says a prayer: \\"Oh God, the crown of the faithful; bless we beseech thee and sanctify this thy servant our king/queen, and as thou dost this day set a crown of pure gold upon his/her head, so enrich his/her royal heart with thine abundant grace, and crown him/her with all princely virtues through the King Eternal Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen\\". This prayer is the translation of the ancient formula Deus tuorum Corona fidelium. The Dean of Westminster picks up the crown and he, the archbishop and several other high-ranking bishops proceed to the Coronation Chair where the crown is handed back to the archbishop, who reverently places it on the monarch's head. At this moment, the king or queen is crowned, and the guests in the abbey cry in unison three times, \\"God Save the King/Queen\\". Peers of the realm and officers of arms put on their coronets, the trumpeters sound a fanfare and church bells ring out across the kingdom, as gun salutes echo from the Tower of London and Hyde Park. Finally, the archbishop, standing before the monarch, says the crowning formula, which is a translation of the ancient Latin prayer Coronet te Deus: \\"God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness, that having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works, you may obtain the crown of an everlasting kingdom by the gift of him whose kingdom endureth for ever.\\" To this the guests, with heads bowed, say \\"Amen\\". When this prayer is finished, the choir sings an English translation of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon is followed by a rite of benediction consisting of several prayers. =Enthronement and homage= Elizabeth I wore the crown and held the sceptre and orb at the end of her coronation The benediction being concluded, the sovereign rises from the Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is seated on the throne, the formula Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth‚Ä¶ ‚Äì a translation of the Latin formula Sta et retine‚Ä¶, historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns ‚Äì is recited. After the enthronement proper, the act of homage takes place: the archbishops and bishops swear their fealty, saying \\"I, N., Archbishop [Bishop] of N., will be faithful and true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord [Lady], King [Queen] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\\" The peers then proceed to pay their homage, saying \\"I, N., Duke [Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron or Lord] of N., do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth will I bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of folks. So help me God.\\" The clergy pay homage together, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, members of the royal family pay homage individually. The peers are led by the premier peers of their rank: the dukes by the premier duke, the marquesses by the premier marquess, and so forth. If there is a queen consort, she is anointed, invested, crowned and enthroned in a simple ceremony immediately after homage is paid. The Communion service interrupted earlier is resumed and completed. =Closing procession= The sovereign then exits the coronation theatre, entering St Edward's Chapel (within the abbey), preceded by the bearers of the Sword of State, the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice and the blunt Sword of Mercy.Hilliam, pp. 211‚Äì212. While the monarch is in St. Edward's chapel, the choir recites an English translation of the hymn of thanksgiving Te Deum laudamus. St Edward's Crown and all the other regalia are laid on the High Altar of the chapel; the sovereign removes the Robe Royal and Stole Royal, exchanges the crimson surcoat for the purple surcoat and is enrobed in the Imperial Robe of purple velvet. He or she then wears the Imperial State Crown and takes into his or her hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel while all present sing the national anthem. Music The music played at coronations has been primarily classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible which have been used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for George II's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of Charles II and Thomas Tomkins for Charles I in 1621.Range, p. 282. In the 19th century, works by major European composers were often used, but when Sir Frederick Bridge was appointed director of music for the 1902 coronation of Edward VII, he decided that it ought to be a celebration of four hundred years of British music. Compositions by Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell were included alongside works by contemporary composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Stainer. Hubert Parry's I was glad was written as the entrance anthem for the 1902 coronation, replacing an 1831 setting by Thomas Attwood; it contains a bridge section partway through so that the scholars of Westminster School can exercise their right to be the first commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional \\"vivats\\" as he or she enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford's Gloria in excelsis (1911) have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, God Save the Queen (or King). Other composers whose music featured in Elizabeth II's coronation include Sir George Dyson, Gordon Jacob, Sir William Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, Sir William Walton, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born Healey Willan. Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 arrangement of Old 100th, the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the Jubilate Deo (\\"All people that on earth do dwell\\") for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world. Dress Several participants in the ceremony wear special costumes, uniforms or robes. For those in attendance (other than members of the royal family) what to wear is laid down in detail by the Earl Marshal prior to each Coronation and published in the London Gazette. = Sovereign's robes = George IV's long train was borne by the Master of the Robes and eight eldest sons of peers. The king (left) found the enormous weight of the robes very inconvenient. The sovereign wears a variety of different robes and other garments during the course of the ceremony. In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the regalia, it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch. (The present exceptions are the supertunica and Robe Royal, which both date from the coronation of George IV in 1821).Rose, p. 100. Worn for the first part of the service (and the processions beforehand): * Crimson surcoat ‚Äì the regular dress during most of the ceremony, worn under all other robes. In 1953, Elizabeth II wore a newly made gown in place of a surcoat. * Robe of State of crimson velvet or Parliament Robe ‚Äì the first robe used at a coronation, worn on entry to the abbey and later at State Openings of Parliament. It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with gold lace. Worn over the surcoat for the Anointing: * Anointing gown ‚Äì a simple and austere garment worn during the anointing. It is plain white, bears no decoration and fastens at the back. Robes with which the Sovereign is invested (worn thereafter until Communion): * Colobium sindonis (\\"shroud tunic\\") ‚Äì the first robe with which the sovereign is invested. It is a loose white undergarment of fine linen cloth edged with a lace border, open at the sides, sleeveless and cut low at the neck. It symbolises the derivation of royal authority from the people. * Supertunica ‚Äì the second robe with which the sovereign is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire. * Robe Royal or Pallium Regale ‚Äì the main robe worn during the ceremony and used during the crowning. It is a four- square mantle, lined in crimson silk and decorated with silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in the four corners. It is lay, rather than liturgical, in nature. * Stole Royal or armilla ‚Äì a gold silk scarf which accompanies the Robe Royal, richly and heavily embroidered with gold and silver thread, set with jewels and lined with rose-coloured silk and gold fringing. Worn for the final part of the service (and the processions which follow): * Purple surcoat ‚Äì the counterpart to the crimson surcoat, worn during the final part of the ceremony. * Imperial Robe of purple velvet ‚Äì the robe worn at the conclusion of the ceremony, on exit from the abbey. It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of Roman Emperors. Headwear Male sovereigns up to and including George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part of the service. Female sovereigns (and some female consorts) have traditionally worn the George IV State Diadem, first worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns as it weighs 2.23 kg (4.9 lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown. =Other members of the royal family= Certain other members of the royal family wear distinctive robes, most particularly queens consort (including dowagers) and princesses of the United Kingdom, all of whom wear purple velvet mantles edged with ermine over their court dresses. Other members of the royal family in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that royal dukes wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of ermine on the cape and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of the robe. Headwear Queens consort in the 20th century arrived at their coronation bareheaded, and remained so until the point in the service when they were crowned with their own crown. In the late 17th century and 18th century, queens consort wore Mary of Modena's State Diadem. Prior to the 20th century it was not usual for queens dowager to attend coronations, but Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother both attended the coronations of George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively, and each wore the crown, minus its arches, with which she had been crowned for the duration of the service. Princesses and princes of the United Kingdom are provided with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-patt√©e alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir- apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-patt√©e and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-patt√©e and four strawberry leaves, is used for the children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise be entitled as peers or peeresses. =Peers= An earl's coronation robes All peers and peeresses in attendance are \\"expected to wear\\" Robes of State, as described below. These robes are different to the 'Parliament Robe' (worn on occasion by peers who are members of the House of Lords); all peers summoned to attend wear the Robe of State, regardless of membership of the House of Lords, and peeresses' robes are worn not only by women who are peers in their own right, but also by wives and widows of peers. Those entitled to a collar of an order of knighthood wear it over (and attached to) the cape. Peers' robes A peer's coronation robe is a full-length cloak-type garment of crimson velvet, edged down the front with miniver pure, with a full cape (also of miniver pure) attached. On the cape, rows of \\"ermine tails (or the like)\\" indicate the peer's rank: dukes have four rows, marquesses three and a half, earls three, viscounts two and a half, and barons and lords of parliament two. Prior to the 19th century peers also wore a matching crimson surcoat edged in miniver. In 1953, \\"Peers taking part in the Processions or Ceremonies in Westminster Abbey\\" were directed to wear the Robe of State over full-dress uniform (Naval, Military, RAF or civil), if so entitled, or else over full velvet court dress (or one of the alternative styles of Court Dress, as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain's regulations). Other peers in attendance were \\"expected to wear the same if possible\\"; but the wearing of evening dress, or a black suit with white bow tie, were also permitted (as was the use of a Parliament Robe or a mantle of one of the Orders of Knighthood by those not taking part in the Processions or Ceremonies). Peeresses' robes George, 2nd Earl Harcourt by Sir Joshua Reynolds. A peeress's coronation robe is described as a long (trained) crimson velvet mantle, edged all round with miniver pure and having a cape of miniver pure (with rows of ermine indicating the rank of the wearer, as for peers). Furthermore, the length of the train (and the width of the miniver edging) varies with the rank of the wearer: for duchesses, the trains are 1.8 m (2 yds) long, for marchionesses one and three-quarters yards, for countesses one and a half yards, for viscountesses one and a quarter yards, and for baronesses and ladies 90 cm (1 yd). The edgings are 13 cm (5 in) in width for duchesses, 10 cm (4 in) for marchionesses, 7.5 cm (3 in) for countesses and 5 cm (2 in) for viscountesses, baronesses and ladies. This Robe of State is directed to be worn with a sleeved crimson velvet kirtle, which is similarly edged with miniver and worn over a full-length white or cream court dress (without a train). Headwear During the Coronation, peers and peeresses put on coronets. Like their robes, their coronets are differentiated according to rank: the coronet of a duke or duchess is ornamented with eight strawberry leaves, that of a marquess or marchioness has four strawberry leaves alternating with four raised silver balls, that of an earl or countess eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight raised silver balls, that of a viscount or viscountess has sixteen smaller silver balls and that of a baron or baroness six silver balls. Peeresses' coronets are identical to those of peers, but smaller. In addition, peeresses were told in 1953 that \\"a tiara should be worn, if possible\\". =Others= In 1953, those taking part in the Procession inside the Abbey who were not peers or peeresses were directed to wear full-dress, (naval, military, air force or civil) uniform, or one of the forms of court dress laid down in the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations for Dress at Court. These regulations, as well as providing guidance for members of the public, specify forms of dress for a wide variety of office-holders and public officials, clergy, the judiciary, members of the Royal Household, etc. It also includes provision for Scottish dress to be worn. Officers in the Armed Forces and the Civil, Foreign, and Colonial Services who did not take part in the Procession wore uniform, and male civilians: \\"one of the forms of court dress as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations for Dress at Court, or evening dress with knee breeches or trousers, or morning dress, or dark lounge suits\\". Ladies attending in 1953 were instructed to wear \\"evening dresses or afternoon dresses, with a light veiling falling from the back of the head\\". Coats and hats were not permitted but tiaras could be worn. In 1953 an additional note made it clear that \\"Oriental dress may be worn by Ladies and Gentlemen for whom it is the usual Ceremonial Costume\\". After-celebrations Since the 20th century it has been traditional for the newly crowned monarch and other members of the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park.Rose, p. 129. In 1902, Edward VII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards. George IV's coronation banquet was held in Westminster Hall in 1821; it was the last such banquet held. Historically, the coronation was immediately followed by a banquet held in Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster (which is also the home to the Houses of Parliament). The King or Queen's Champion (the office being held by the Dymoke family in connection with the Manor of Scrivelsby) would ride into the hall on horseback, wearing a knight's armour, with the Lord High Constable riding to his right and the Earl Marshal riding to his left. A herald would then make a proclamation of the readiness of the champion to fight anyone denying the monarch. After 1800, the form for this was as follows: The King's Champion would then throw down the gauntlet; the ceremony would be repeated at the centre of the hall and at the High Table (where the sovereign would be seated). The sovereign would then drink to the champion from a gold cup, which he would then present to the latter. This ritual was dropped from the coronation of Queen Victoria and was never revived. The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet. Banquets have not been held at Westminster Hall since the coronation of George IV in 1821. His coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor William IV eliminated the banquet on grounds of economy,Strong, pp. 374‚Äì375. ending a 632-year-old tradition. Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the coronation, a coronation honours list is also released before the coronation. Enthronement as Emperor of India Queen Victoria assumed the title Empress of India in 1876. A durbar (court) was held in Delhi, India on 1 January 1877 to proclaim her assumption of the title. The queen did not attend personally, but she was represented there by the Viceroy, Lord Lytton.The Times (London). 2 January 1877. p. 5. A similar durbar was held on 1 January 1903 to celebrate the accession of Edward VII, who was represented by his brother the Duke of Connaught.The Times (London). 2 January 1903. p. 3. In 1911, George V also held a durbar which he and his wife Queen Mary attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for a Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, George V was not crowned in India; instead, he wore an imperial crown as he entered the Durbar. Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the Imperial Crown of India, was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by George VI in 1948, a year after India gained independence.Hilliam, pp. 185‚Äì186. Kings of Arms Aside from kings and queens, the only individuals authorised to wear crowns (as opposed to coronets) are the Kings of Arms, the United Kingdom's senior heraldic officials. Like the peers' coronets, these crowns are only put on at the actual moment of the monarch's crowning, after which they are worn for the rest of the service and its subsequent festivities. Garter, Clarenceaux, and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms have heraldic jurisdiction over England, Wales and Northern Ireland; Lord Lyon King of Arms is responsible for Scotland. In addition, there is a King of Arms attached to each of the Order of the Bath, Order of St. Michael and St. George and the Order of the British Empire. These have only a ceremonial role, but are authorised by the statutes of their orders to wear the same crown as Garter at a coronation.See e.g. (Order of the Bath), (Order of the British Empire) The crown of a King of Arms is silver- gilt and consists of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, and inscribed with the words Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (Latin: \\"Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy\\", from Psalm 51). The Lord Lyon King of Arms has worn a crown of this style at all coronations since that of George III. Prior to that he wore a replica of the Crown of Scotland. In 2004 a new replica of this crown was created for use by the Lord Lyon.

During the inter-war years, a number of regiments were raised as part of Australia's part-time military force. These units were gradually mechanised either before or during World War II, although only a small number undertook operational service during the war. A number of Australian light horse units are still in existence today. Origins The Australian Light Horse was established as the outcome of a debate that took place in military circles in Australia in the late 19th ‚Äì early 20th centuries concerning the future of mounted troops. The example of the Franco-Prussian War illustrated that the battlefield had become dominated by massed land armies supported by artillery. For Australia the reality was vast spaces with sparse populations making it difficult to consider anything that remotely looked like the European model. The 1890s were wracked by drought and depression ensuring that none of the states were able to afford anything but the most token of armies supported by a large contingent of volunteers. The Second Boer War provided the short term answer. While Australian forces fought against the Boers in South Africa, the Boer methodology of conducting war was considered to be the answer for Australian defence. Volunteer Light Horse Regiments were established around Australia supported by the Rifle Club movement which provided semi trained reinforcements for the various formations. Should these formations be called upon to defend Australia, the local commander was charged with maintaining resistance through the use of the Commando formation which envisaged a large scale guerrilla war. The prospect of an endless and strength-sapping guerrilla war was the key deterrent factor which relied heavily upon mobile soldiers. The mounted infantry remained the key to the Australian defence posture until the Kitchener Report of 1910 which envisaged formations that could be slotted directly into an Imperial expeditionary force. The plan envisaged two mounted divisions. By the outbreak of World War I, there were 23 light horse regiments within Australia's part-time military force, consisting of 9,000 personnel. These were organised as follows: * 1st Light Horse Brigade (Queensland): 1st (Central Queensland), 2nd (Queensland Mounted Infantry), 3rd (Darling Downs), 4th (Northern Rivers Lancers) and 27th (North Queensland) Light Horse Regiments * 2nd Light Horse Brigade (New South Wales): 5th (New England) and 6th (Hunter River Lancers) Light Horse Regiments * 3rd Light Horse Brigade (New South Wales): 7th (New South Wales Lancers), 9th (New South Wales Mounted Rifles), 11th (Australian Horse) and 28th (Illawarra) Light Horse Regiments * 5th Light Horse Brigade (Victoria): 13th (Gippsland), 15th (Victorian Mounted Rifles), and 16th (Indi) Light Horse Regiments * 7th Light Horse Brigade (Victoria): 17th (Campaspe), 19th (Yarrowee), and 20th (Corangamite) and 29th (Port Phillip Horse) Light Horse Regiments * 8th Light Horse Brigade (South Australia): 22nd (South Australian Mounted Rifles), 23rd (Barossa), and 24th (Flinders) Light Horse Regiments * 25th (Western Australian Mounted Infantry) Light Horse Regiment * 26th (Tasmanian Mounted Infantry) Light Horse Regiment World War I =Formation and organisation= Australian light horse monument in Beersheeba Light horse were like mounted infantry in that they usually fought dismounted, using their horses as transport to the battlefield and as a means of swift disengagement when retreating or retiring. A famous exception to this rule though was the charge of the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments at Beersheba on 31 October 1917. In 1918, some light horse regiments were equipped with sabres, enabling them to fight in a conventional cavalry role in the advance on Damascus. However, unlike mounted infantry, the light horse also performed certain cavalry roles, such as scouting and screening, while mounted. Beersheeba, 1917 The light horse were organised along cavalry rather than infantry lines. A light horse regiment, although technically equivalent to an infantry battalion in terms of command level, contained only 25 officers and 400 men as opposed to an infantry battalion that consisted of around 1,000 men. Around a quarter of this nominal strength (or one man in each section of 4) could be allotted to horse-holding duties when the regiment entered combat. A regiment was divided into three squadrons, designated \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" (equivalent to a company), and a squadron divided into four troops (equivalent to but smaller than a platoon). Each troop was divided into about 10 four-man sections. When dismounting for combat, one man from each section would take the reins of the other three men's horses and lead them out of the firing line where he would remain until called upon. Each regiment initially had a troop of two Maxim guns but during the Gallipoli Campaign, where the light horse served dismounted, this was increased to four guns. In 1916, following the establishment of the Australian Machine Gun Corps, these were consolidated into four light horse machine gun squadrons, each with 12 Vickers machine guns, allocated at brigade level within the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades. In turn, the troops received the Lewis Gun. This was replaced by the Hotchkiss M1909 Ben√©t‚ÄìMerci√© machine gun in April 1917. Eventually they arrived in such numbers as to allow each troop to have a Hotchkiss gun, which considerably added to the mobile firepower of a regiment. Australian light horse in Jerusalem during WWI The Australian Waler horse was the common mount for the light horsemen, as it was strong and hardy, which was needed in the harsh desert climate. This was facilitated by the horses being left behind in Egypt while the light horsemen went to Gallipoli, allowing them to gradually acclimatise. Cherbourg, Queensland. Although the authorities did not welcome Indigenous men into the Australian Armed Forces, nonetheless some managed to enlist in the Australian Light Horse. Unlike in civilian life, where Indigenous men received a lower rate of pay, in the Army there was only one rate of pay. This may have been a motivation for their enlistment, in addition to other considerations, including patriotism. Several served during the Gallipoli campaign. Skilled in working with horses, and in hot climates, they were valued members of the Light Horse. =Gallipoli and the Sinai and Palestine campaign= A Sergeant of Light Horse in Palestine (George Washington Lambert, 1920) At the start of World War I, Australia committed to provide an all volunteer expeditionary force of 20,000 personnel known as the Australian Imperial Force, which would consist of an infantry division and a light horse brigade. As Australia's commitment to the war increased, the size of the light horse contingent was expanded, with a second and third light horse brigade being raised in late 1914 and early 1915. Eventually, the Australian Light Horse regiments were organised into five brigades: *1st Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Light Horse Regiments. *2nd Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 5th, 6th, 7th Light Horse Regiments. *3rd Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 8th, 9th, 10th Light Horse Regiments. *4th Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 4th, 11th, 12th Light Horse Regiments. *5th Light Horse Brigade consisted of the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments, in combination with the French 1er Regiment Mixte de Cavalerie du Levant and the New Zealand 2nd Machine Gun Squadron. The light horse regiments' first involvement in the fighting during the war came during the Gallipoli Campaign, where the troops of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades were sent to Gallipoli without their horses to provide reinforcements for the infantry. During the campaign they were used mainly in a defensive role, although the light horsemen did participate in several costly battles, such as the Battle of the Nek. After the evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula in December 1915, the light horse regiments that had been deployed were re-constituted in Egypt and in March 1916, the Australian mounted troops of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade were placed together in the Anzac Mounted Division. Mount Olivet and Mount Scopus near Jerusalem, 1918.alt=A wide angle view of an encampment on a hill, there are horses in the foreground and light coloured tents Elements of the light horse brigades also undertook a campaign against the Senussi in the western desert region of Egypt with actions commencing in late 1915 and continuing through until 1917. These actions were largely limited though, and were overshadowed by the Light Horse's involvement in the fighting against Ottoman forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. A reorganisation of the mounted troops was ordered in February 1917 leading to the formation of the Anzac Mounted Division consisting of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the British 22nd Mounted Brigade. Meanwhile, the Imperial Mounted Division was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British Yeomanry 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. The Imperial Mounted Division's name was soon changed to the Australian Mounted Division at the request of the Australian government. The arrival of more yeomanry from Salonika prompted the raising of the Yeomanry Mounted Division (6th, 8th and 22nd Yeomanry Brigades) in June 1917. The three mounted divisions and the Imperial Camel Brigade formed the Desert Mounted Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel. With the removal of most of the Yeomanry to France and the breakup of the Imperial Camel Corps, the newly formed 5th Light Horse Brigade took its place with the Australian Mounted Division. Two Indian cavalry divisions replaced the Yeomanry Division in the Desert Mounted Corps. Care of horses in the Sinai campaign In 1916, the average loss of sick horses and mules from the Sinai front was approximately 640 per week. They were transported in train loads of thirty trucks, each holding eight horses. Animals which died or were destroyed while on active service were buried from the nearest camp unless this was not practicable. In this case the carcasses were transported to a suitable site away from troops, where they were disemboweled and left to disintegrate in the dry desert air and high temperatures. Animals which died or were destroyed in veterinary units at Kantara, Ismalia, Bilbeis, and Quesna were dealt with in this way and after four days' drying in the sun, the carcases were stuffed with straw and burnt, after the skins were salved. These were sold to local contractors. =Western Front= The 13th Light Horse Regiment and one squadron of the 4th Light Horse Regiment served on the Western Front, first as divisional cavalry squadrons for the 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions, and then as the I ANZAC Corps Mounted Regiment. A squadron of the 4th provided the divisional cavalry squadron for the 1st Division and one of the 14th Light Horse Regiment for the 3rd Division. This squadron was eventually disbanded. In combination with New Zealand mounted troops, the original B and D squadrons of the 4th became part of the II ANZAC Corps Mounted Regiment. After II Anzac Corps was disbanded the regiment joined 22nd British Corps and was redesignated XXII Anzac Mounted Regiment. For a month during the battles of the 100 Days the regiment was attached to the III British Corps as the corps commander Sir Alexander Godley briefly commanded III Corps and regarded the regiment as his personal troops. After the Australian Corps was formed in November 1917, the I Anzac Corps Mounted Regiment became known as the 13th Light Horse Regiment again. The Australian squadrons of XXII Regiment were amalgamated with 13 Australian Light Horse Regiment. Post World War I The winner of the 10th Light Horse Regiment's \\"Best turned out light horseman\\" competition at the unit's annual sports day in 1943 After the war, the light horse regiments were distributed as follows: * 1st Cavalry Brigade (Toowoomba, Queensland): 2nd, 5th, 11th, 14th Light Horse Regiments * 2nd Cavalry Brigade (Maitland, New South Wales): 12th, 15th, 16th Light Horse Regiments * 3rd Cavalry Brigade (Melbourne): 8th, 13th, 20th Light Horse Regiments * 4th Cavalry Brigade (Paddington, New South Wales): 1st, 6th, 7th, 21st Light Horse Regiments * 5th Cavalry Brigade (Melbourne) (disbanded 1936): 4th, 17th, 19th Light Horse Regiments * 6th Cavalry Brigade (Adelaide): 3rd, 9th, 18th, 23rd Light Horse Regiments These cavalry brigades were organised into two cavalry divisions: the 1st and 2nd. At the outbreak of World War 2, there were 25 light horse regiments. Of these, 17 were still horsed although they had been partially mechanised, while four had been converted to machine gun regiments and two had been converted to armoured car regiments. Throughout the war, the various light horse units were converted to motorised infantry, armoured car or armoured regiments, serving mainly in the defence of Australia. As the threat of invasion passed, though, most were disbanded in 1943 or 1944 and their personnel redistributed amongst other units. By 1945, only two units remained. The first of these was the 20th Light Horse Regiment, which as the 20th Motor Regiment, served overseas, at Merauke, and was later converted into a pioneer regiment. The second unit was the 1st Light Horse Regiment, which became the 1st Tank Battalion, and as such fought in New Guinea and Borneo. Legacy * A number of Australian light horse units are still in existence today, generally as Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) cavalry units. Including the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles), 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, 10th Light Horse Regiment, and the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers. * The Memorial to the Australian Light Horse at Tamworth was unveiled by Major General Digger James on 29 October 2005. * The Australian Light Horse are commemorated by the Light Horse Interchange and sculptural installations along the M4 motorway where it is crossed by the M7 at Eastern Creek in Western Sydney. * On 28 April 2008, Australia's Governor-General Major General (ret) Michael Jeffery and Israeli President Shimon Peres unveiled a monument to the Light Horse in Beersheba, Israel. It was made by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett and was an initiative of the Melbourne-based Pratt Foundation in cooperation with the Beersheba City Council. *On 31 October 2017, the Beersheba ANZAC Memorial Center was inaugurated in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, New Zealand Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy and Beersheba Mayor Ruvik Danilovich. Also present were Peter Smaller, President of JNF Australia and Dan Springer, CEO of JNF Australia, which donated most of the funds to build the memorial center. It stands within the grounds of the British war cemetery in Beersheba, and the building resembles a horse head, commemorating tens of thousands of horses that served and died throughout the war. It also holds a small collection of war remnants dated back to the British conquest of Palestine. The ANZAC Trail from the coast retraces the cavalry's three-day path to the Battle of Beersheba. *On 26 September 2019, a life-size sculpture, 'The Aborigine and His Horse,' was dedicated at Tzemach, commemorating Aborigine ANZAC members, dubbed the \\"Queensland Black Watch\\", including cavalrymen who fought at Tzemach and Be'er Sheva. Descendants of those horsemen travelled from Australia to participate in the statue's inauguration, \\"another stage in the historic correction that Australian society is undergoing in their relations with the Aborigines.\\" * On 11 November 1966, Sir Arthur Fadden (Australian Prime Minister in 1941) unveiled a statue of Sir William Glasgow created by Brisbane sculptor Daphne Mayo; Sir William Glasgow is depicted in the uniform of an office of the Australian Light Horse. The statue was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2004 and was relocated to Post Office Square, Brisbane in 2008, adjacent to ANZAC Square, Brisbane. 95th anniversary parade, 2012 * Commemorations of the Battle of Beersheba typically occur at the memorial in Canberra every year on 31 October, with bigger gatherings on the 5-year dates. * In 1931, Dorothy Brooke, an Englishwoman living in Cairo, wrote a letter to a British newspaper, soliciting funds to euthanize the ageing army horses, who had been sold to the local Egyptians and were over 20 years old by then. She later established Brooke, an international animal welfare charity dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys and mules. * Many of the descendants of the army horses are still in use today, carrying tourists around the pyramids of Giza in Cairo, and providing transport for local Egyptians * After Egyptian tourism collapsed following the Arab Spring in 2011, animal charities such as Brooke and Egypt Equine Aid stepped in to help with the care of the horses and prevent disaster.

The 640 KiB limit was specific to the IBM PC and close compatibles; other machines running MS-DOS had different limits, for example the Apricot PC could have up to 768 KiB and the Sirius Victor 9000, 896 KiB. Memory management on the IBM family was made complex by the need to maintain backward compatibility to the original PC design and real-mode DOS, while allowing computer users to take advantage of large amounts of low-cost memory and new generations of processors. Since DOS has given way to Microsoft Windows and other 32-bit operating systems not restricted by the original arbitrary 640 KiB limit of the IBM PC, managing the memory of a personal computer no longer requires the user to manually manipulate internal settings and parameters of the system. The 640 KiB limit imposed great complexity on hardware and software intended to circumvent it; the physical memory in a machine could be organised as a combination of base or conventional memory (including lower memory), upper memory, high memory (not the same as upper memory), extended memory, and expanded memory, all handled in different ways.  Conventional memory  The Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM PC had 20 address lines and so could directly address 1 MiB (220 bytes) of memory. Different areas of this address space were allocated to different kinds of memory used for different purposes. Starting at the lowest end of the address space, the PC had read/write random access memory (RAM) installed, which was used by DOS and application programs. The first part of this memory was installed on the motherboard of the system (in very early machines, 64 KiB, later revised to 256 KiB). Additional memory could be added with cards plugged into the expansion slots; each card contained straps or switches to control what part of the address space accesses memory and devices on that card. On the IBM PC, all the address space up to 640 KiB was available for RAM. This part of the address space is called \\"conventional memory\\" since it is accessible to all versions of DOS automatically on start up. Segment 0, the first 64 KB of conventional memory, is also called low memory area. Normally expansion memory is set to be contiguous in the address space with the memory on the motherboard. If there was an unallocated gap between motherboard memory and the expansion memory, the memory would not be automatically detected as usable by DOS.  Upper memory area  The upper memory area (UMA) refers to the address space between 640 KiB and 1024 KiB (0xA0000‚Äì0xFFFFF). Three 128 KiB regions were defined in this area. The 128 KiB region between 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF was reserved for video adapter screen memory. The physical address space between 0xC0000 and 0xDFFFF was reserved for device BIOS ROMs, and special RAM usually shared with physical devices (for example, shared memory for a network adapter). The IBM PC reserved the uppermost 128 KiB of the address space from 0xE0000 to 0xFFFFF for the ROM BIOS and Cassette BASIC read-only memory (ROM). For example, the monochrome video adapter memory area ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000‚Äì0xB7FFF). If only a monochrome display adapter was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF could be used for RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory. The system BIOS ROMs must be at the upper end of the address space because the CPU starting address is fixed by the design of the processor. The starting address is loaded into the program counter of the CPU after a hardware reset and must have a defined value that endures after power is interrupted to the system. On reset or power up, the CPU loads the address from the system ROM and then jumps to a defined ROM location to begin executing the system power-on self- test, and eventually load an operating system. Since an expansion card such as a video adapter, hard drive controller, or network adapter could use allocations of memory in many of the upper memory areas, configuration of some combinations of cards required careful reading of documentation, or experimentation, to find card settings and memory mappings that worked. Mapping two devices to use the same physical memory addresses could result in a stalled or unstable system. Not all addresses in the upper memory area were used in a typical system; unused physical addresses would return undefined and system-dependent data if accessed by the processor.  Expanded memory  As memory prices declined, application programs such as spreadsheets and computer-aided drafting were changed to take advantage of more and more physical memory in the system. Virtual memory in the 8088 and 8086 was not supported by the processor hardware, and disk technology of the time would make it too slow and cumbersome to be practical. Expanded memory was a system that allowed application programs to access more RAM than directly visible to the processor's address space. The process was a form of bank switching. When extra RAM was needed, driver software would temporarily make a piece of expanded memory accessible to the processor; when the data in that piece of memory was updated, another part could be swapped into the processor's address space. For the IBM PC and IBM PC/XT, with only 20 address lines, special- purpose expanded memory cards were made containing perhaps a mebibyte, or more, of expanded memory, with logic on the board to make that memory accessible to the processor in defined parts of the 8088 address space. Allocation and use of expanded memory was not transparent to application programs. The application had to keep track of which bank of expanded memory contained a particular piece of data, and when access to that data was required, the application had to request (through a driver program) the expanded memory board to map that part of memory into the processor's address space. Although applications could use expanded memory with relative freedom, many other software components such as drivers and TSRs were still normally constrained to reside within the 640K \\"conventional memory\\" area, which soon became a critically scarce resource. The 80286 and the high memory area  When the IBM PC/AT was introduced, the segmented memory architecture of the Intel family processors had the byproduct of allowing slightly more than 1 MiB of memory to be addressed in the \\"real\\" mode. Since the 80286 had more than 20 address lines, certain combinations of segment and offset could point into memory above the 0x0100000 (220) location. The 80286 could address up to 16 MiB of system memory, thus removing the behavior of memory addresses \\"wrapping around\\". Since the required address line now existed, the combination F800:8000 would no longer point to the physical address 0x0000000 but the correct address 0x00100000. As a result, some DOS programs would no longer work. To maintain compatibility with the PC and XT behavior, the AT included an A20 line gate (Gate A20) that made memory addresses on the AT wrap around to low memory as they would have on an 8088 processor. This gate could be controlled, initially through the keyboard controller, to allow running programs which were designed for this to access an additional 65,520 bytes (64 KiB of memory in real mode. At boot time, the BIOS first enables A20 when counting and testing all of the system's memory, and disables it before transferring control to the operating system. Enabling the A20 line is one of the first steps a protected mode x86 operating system does in the bootup process, often before control has been passed onto the kernel from the bootstrap (in the case of Linux, for example). The high memory area (HMA) is the RAM area consisting of the first 64 KiB, minus 16 bytes, of the extended memory on an IBM PC/AT or compatible microcomputer. Originally, the logic gate was a gate connected to the Intel 8042 keyboard controller. Controlling it was a relatively slow process. Other methods have since been added to allow for more efficient multitasking of programs which require this wrap-around with programs that access all of the system's memory. There was at first a variety of methods, but eventually the industry settled on the PS/2 method of using a bit in port 92h to control the A20 line. Disconnecting A20 would not wrap all memory accesses above 1 MiB, just those in the 1 MiB, 3 MiB, 5 MiB, etc. ranges. Real mode software only cared about the area slightly above 1 MiB, so Gate A20 was enough. Virtual 8086 mode, introduced with the Intel 80386, allows the A20 wrap-around to be simulated by using the virtual memory facilities of the processor: physical memory may be mapped to multiple virtual addresses, thus allowing that the memory mapped at the first megabyte of virtual memory may be mapped again in the second megabyte of virtual memory. The operating system may intercept changes to Gate A20 and make corresponding changes to the virtual memory address space, which also makes irrelevant the efficiency of Gate-A20 toggling. The first user of the HMA among Microsoft products was Windows/286 2.1 in 1988, which introduced the HIMEM.SYS device driver. Starting with versions 5.0 of DR-DOS (1990) and of MS-DOS (1991), parts of the operating system could be loaded into HMA as well, freeing up to 46 KiB of conventional memory. Other components, such as device drivers and TSRs, could be loaded into the upper memory area (UMA). =A20 handler= The A20 handler is software controlling access to the high memory area. Extended memory managers usually provide this functionality. In DOS, high memory area managers, such as HIMEM.SYS had the extra task of managing A20 and provided an API for opening/closing A20. DOS itself could utilize the area for some of its storage needs, thereby freeing up more conventional memory for programs. This functionality was enabled by the \\"DOS=HIGH\\" directive in the CONFIG.SYS configuration file. =A20 gate on later processors= The Intel 80486 and Pentium added a special pin named A20M#, which when asserted low forces bit 20 of the physical address to be zero for all on-chip cache or external memory accesses. This was necessary since the 80486 introduced an on-chip cache, and therefore masking this bit in external logic was no longer possible. Software still needs to manipulate the gate and must still deal with external peripherals (the chipset) for that. 80386 and subsequent processors Intel processors from the 386 onward allowed a virtual 8086 mode, which simplified the hardware required to implement expanded memory for DOS applications. Expanded memory managers such as Quarterdeck's QEMM product and Microsoft's EMM386 supported the expanded memory standard without requirement for special memory boards. On 386 and subsequent processors, memory managers like QEMM might move the bulk of the code for a driver or TSR into extended memory and replace it with a small fingerhold that was capable of accessing the extended- memory-resident code. They might analyze memory usage to detect drivers that required more RAM during startup than they did subsequently, and recover and reuse the memory that was no longer needed after startup. They might even remap areas of memory normally used for memory-mapped I/O. Many of these tricks involved assumptions about the functioning of drivers and other components. In effect, memory managers might reverse-engineer and modify other vendors' code on the fly. As might be expected, such tricks did not always work. Therefore, memory managers also incorporated very elaborate systems of configurable options, and provisions for recovery should a selected option render the PC unbootable (a frequent occurrence). Installing and configuring a memory manager might involve hours of experimentation with options, repeatedly rebooting the machine, and testing the results. But conventional memory was so valuable that PC owners felt that such time was well-spent if the result was to free up 30 KiB or 40 KiB of conventional memory space.  Extended memory  In the context of IBM PC compatible computers, extended memory refers to memory in the address space of the 80286 and subsequent processors, beyond the 1 megabyte limit imposed by the 20 address lines of the 8088 and 8086. Such memory is not directly available to DOS applications running in the so-called \\"real mode\\" of the 80286 and subsequent processors. This memory is only accessible in the protected or virtual modes of 80286 and higher processors.

The caudal end of the spinal cord first begins to form after primary neuralation has taken place, indicating that it develops after the cranial portion of the spinal cord has developed. Following neuralation, the caudal tail begins to form a neurocele as it develops a hollow core. After this, secondary neuralation occurs in which the medullary cord begins to form and is filled with many cavities that ultimately form the lumen. The cavities formed from the initial and secondary neuralation combine to form one uninterrupted cavity. There is still speculation on the formation of the caudal cell mass in humans with arguments being made for it arising from many cavities or the continuing growth of the neurocele from the initial neuralation. The caudal cell mass will ultimately differentiate and form into many sacral structures such various nerve endings and the conus medullaris.  Role in Disease  The caudal cell mass plays a role in many diseases and abnormalities related to the spinal cord. One group of abnormalities it plays a role in are occult spinal dysraphisms. These types of abnormalities arise from specific structures formed in the caudal mass, for example if proper differentiation of the caudal mass does not occur, it could result in a type of spinal dysraphism. One example of spinal dysraphism is caudal regression syndrome. Patients suffering from caudal regression syndrome can experience a varying degree of the abnormality ranging from partial lack of the tail bone and pelvis to more significant cases where there may be paralysis and, as a result, inhibited function in the bowel and bladder. This abnormality can be caused by the caudal cell mass not developing properly due to improper differentiation, and it can lead to sacral agenesis, which is one of the hallmarks of caudal regression syndrome. Another class of abnormalities from caudal cell mass development includes caudal dysgenesis, which refers to abnormalities where the sacrum may be deformed or absent, or abnormalities in which the spinal cord and the complementary organ systems may be malformed. Some of the abnormalities that fall under this class includes currarino syndrome and sirenomelia. These genetic defects were found to have a much higher rate of incidence in births to mothers with gestational diabetes. This trend may be due to the inhibition of critical elements of morphogenesis, that are found in the extracellular matrix, or due to the presence of an abnormal hox gene. These abnormalities can be predicted ahead of time using ultrasound.

It is the primary component of resin acid, is the primary irritant in pine wood and resin, isolated from rosin (via isomerization) and is the most abundant of several closely related organic acids that constitute most of rosin, the solid portion of the oleoresin of coniferous trees. Its ester or salt is called an abietate.Lars-Hugo Norlin \\"Tall Oil\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Preparation Abietic acid is extracted from tree rosin. The pure material is a colorless solid, but commercial samples are usually a glassy or partly crystalline yellowish solid that melts at temperatures as low as . It belongs to the abietane diterpene group of organic compounds derived from four isoprene units. It is used in lacquers, varnishes, and soaps, and for the analysis of resins and the preparation of metal resinates. It is found in Pinus insularis (Khasi Pine), Pinus kesiya Royle, Pinus strobus (Eastern White Pine), and Pinus sylvestris (Scots Pine). Uses Rosin has been used for centuries for caulking ships. It is also rubbed on the bows of musical instruments to make them less slippery. In modern times methods have been developed for improving the properties of the rosin acids, which are otherwise soft, tacky, and low-melting and subject to rapid deterioration by oxidation in air. Stability is greatly increased by heat treatment. Resin acids are converted into ester gum by reaction with controlled amounts of glycerol or other polyhydric alcohols. Ester gum has drying properties and is used in paints, varnishes, and lacquers. Rosin has been used to depackage integrated circuits from their epoxy coatings. In vitro effects The 50% ethanol extracts from Resina pini of Pinus sp. (Pinaceae) showed inhibitory activity against testosterone 5Œ±-reductase prepared from rat prostate. The fraction responsible for this activity was purified, and the active constituent was isolated and identified as abietic acid which exhibited potent testosterone 5Œ±-reductase inhibitory activity in vitro. Safety Abietic acid is considered a \\"nonhazardous natural substance\\" in tall oil. In the U.S., it is listed in the Toxic Substances Control Act inventory. Abietic acid is a contact allergen; however, compounds resulting from its oxidation by air elicit stronger responses. It is soluble in alcohols, acetone, and ethers.

It flows east through Ukraine, Belarus, and Ukraine again, draining into the Dnieper. Overview The Pripyat passes through the exclusion zone established around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The city of Pripyat, Ukraine (population 45,000) was completely evacuated after the Chernobyl disaster. Pripyat has a catchment area of , of which are in Belarus. of the whole river length lies within Belarus. Location The Pripyat begins on the Volyn Hill, between the villages of Budnik and Horn Smolars of Lyubomlsky District in Ukraine. After 204 km downstream, it crosses the border of Belarus, where it travels 500 km through Polesia, Europe‚Äôs largest wilderness, within which lie the vast sandy wetlands known as the Pinsk marshes, a dense network of swamps, bogs. rivers and rivulets within a forested basin. For the last 50 kilometers the Pripyat flows again in Ukraine and flows several kilometers south of Chernobyl into the Kyiv reservoir. Geography The length of the river is 775 kilometers. The area of the pool is 114,300 km¬≤. The Pripyat valley in the upper reaches is weak, in the lower reaches it is clearer. The cave is developed all along, allocating two super-floodplain terraces. The width of the floodplain in the upper course of 2‚Äì4 km and more, in some years, is flooded for several months. In the lower reaches, the width of the floodplain reaches 10‚Äì15 km. The channel in the upper canalized; below - winding, forms meanders, elders, many ducts (one of them is combined with the lake Nobel); there are sandy islands. The width of the river in the upper reaches is up to 40 m, on the average - 50‚Äì70 m, in the lower reaches 100 - predominantly 250 m, with the entrance to the Kyiv reservoir - 4‚Äì5 km. The bottom is sandy and sandy-spruce. The slope of the river is 0.08 m / km Name etymology Max Vasmer in his etymological dictionary notes that the historical name of the river mentioned in the earliest East Slavic document, Primary Chronicle is Pripet' () and cites the opinion of other linguists that the name meant \\"tributary\\", comparing with Greek and Latin roots. He also rejects some opinions which were improperly based on the stem -pjat', rather than original .Max Vasmer, Etymological dictionary of the Russian language, article \\"–ü—Ä–∏–ø—è—Ç—å\\" in Russian translation It might also derive from the local word pripech used for a river with sandy banks.

For a quick overview of Russian pronunciation, see Help:IPA/Russian. Many languages, including English, contain words (Russianisms) most likely borrowed from the Russian language. Not all of the words are truly fluent Russian or Slavic origin. Some of them co-exist in other Slavic languages and it is difficult to decide whether they made English from Russian or, say, from Bulgarian. Some other words are borrowed or constructed from the classical ancient languages, such as Latin or Greek. Still others are themselves borrowed from indigenous peoples that Russians have come into contact with in Russian or Soviet territory. Compared to other source languages, very few of the words borrowed into English come from Russian., citing Direct borrowing first began with contact between England and Russia in the 16th century and picked up heavily in the 20th century with the establishment of the Soviet Union as a major world power. Most of them are used to denote things and notions specific to Russia, Russian culture, politics, history, especially well known outside Russia. Some others are in mainstream usage, independent of any Russian context.

Since 1979 he has referred to himself as \\"HRH Prince Michael James Alexander Stewart, 7th Count of Albany\\", stating that an ancestor used the title \\"Count of Albany\\". Lafosse also says he has the right to other noble titles including Comte de Blois, Duc d'Aquitaine and Baron Lafosse de Chatry. The author's report on an interview with Lafosse provides a full listing of his claims. The House of Stuart and Lafosse's claims The Royal House of Stuart became extinct in the male line with the death in 1807 of Henry Benedict Stuart, called \\"King Henry IX\\" by Jacobites, who succeeded his elder brother Charles Edward Stuart in 1788. Charles was survived only by an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany, and her own illegitimate son Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart and daughters. The Jacobite claim to the British throne then passed to members of various continental Catholic dynasties, most recently to Franz, Duke of Bavaria, head of the Wittelsbach dynasty. Lafosse claims that this history is inaccurate and that the Stuart line did not end with the death of Henry Benedict Stuart. Instead, Lafosse says that Charles Edward Stuart secretly obtained a papal annulment of his marriage to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern and, subsequently, in a secret ceremony, married a woman called Marguerite O'Dea d'Audibert de Lussan, Comtesse de Massillan. He says this union produced an heir in 1786, a son, Edward James Stuart, Count Stuarton, Count of Albany, from whom he says he is descended. Lafosse says he is the son of \\"HRH Princess Renee Stewart, Lady Derneley\\" (according to Lafosse, the senior descendant in the female line of Edward James Stuart), and \\"Gustave Lafosse de Chatry, 5th Baron de Chatry\\". These individuals, as well as others, are listed in an extensive genealogy presented by Lafosse as evidence that he is descended from the last Stuart King of Scotland. There is some disagreement over who Lafosse's parents and ancestors were. Lafosse says he was born on 21 April 1958 in the Ville de Bruxelles district, and that his parents were Baron Gustave Joseph Fernand Cl√©ment Lafosse and Princess Ren√©e Julienne Stewart. In 2002, Brussels authorities stated that this certificate is a forgery, and that they have a birth certificate showing that Lafosse was born in Brussels on 21 April 1958, in the Watermael-Boitsfort district to Gustave Joseph Cl√©ment Fernand Lafosse, a shopkeeper, and Ren√©e Julienne D√©e, a business employee. Peter Piniski, in The Stuarts' Last Secret, says of Lafosse's assertion: > One recent, heroically unsubstantiated claim is that Prince Charles married > in 1785 and fathered a legitimate child. This 'fact' (which has escaped the > notice of every historian for over two hundred years!), is particularly > imaginative considering the prince was married at the time, being only > separated from Louise von Stolberg-Gedern, after April 3rd 1784, who > remained under the protection of the Pope. Nor was eighteenth century Rome > the best of cities for an internationally known Roman Catholic prince to > commit bigamy. It also ignores Charles' wretchedly infirm condition from > before that date until his death three years later. Likewise does it ignore > the presence (and insult the memory) of Charles' daughter and sole heir, > Charlotte, who was daily at her father's side, nursing him right up to the > moment of his death despite her own cancer. Professing direct descent on the > female line from this 'marriage' the same claimant equally fails to provide > any evidence, proper references or verifiable source documents for his > additional assertion of descent on the male line from not one, but both > daughters of Charlotte Stuart. Professor Lenman describes all of this as: > 'The industry of Stuart charlatanism'. Lafosse has also stated that he was \\"President of the European Council of Princes\\", following Archduke Otto of Austria's tenure in that position. Archduke Otto has said that he had never been president of any such body, or a member of any such body, and that, in fact, he had never heard of it. The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland Written by Michel Lafosse, The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland: The True Story of the Royal House of Stewart and the Hidden Lineage of the Kings and Queens of Scots is a book published in Shaftesbury, England, in 1998. The book claims to provide previously unknown accounts of the life of Charles Edward Stuart, the last head of the Royal House of Stuart, during his exile from Britain. Lafosse, who claims descent from Charles, includes within the book various accounts of previously unknown marriages and births within the Royal House of Stuart, beginning with the secret annulment of the marriage of Charles Edward Stuart and Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, and his subsequent remarriage to Marguerite O'Dea d'Audibert de Lussan, Comtesse de Massillan. Present activities Although born in Belgium as Michel Roger Lafosse, he became a naturalized British citizen in the 1990s and has since used the name Michael James Alexander Stewart of Albany. In 1998, he authored The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland, within which he makes the case for his ancestral ties to the Royal House of Stuart. His website stated that he was a diplomat of the self-styledMimic Orders Federation of Autonomous Priories of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights of Malta (not the Sovereign Military Order of Malta or one of the Protestant Alliance Orders), and a cultural attach√© at the Knights of Malta's embassy in the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe in West Africa; and that he has been awarded the United Nations 2001 \\"Volunteer Service Medal\\" under the name \\"Albany\\". Lafosse claimed to be the Fons Honorum and Grand Protector of The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order in Britain and the English-speaking world. On 18 June 2006 the Sunday Mail reported that Lafosse was to be deported after having lost British citizenship because, it is alleged, he submitted a forged birth certificate. Later, on 23 July 2006, the Sunday Mail reported that, in the wake of the publicity surrounding his claims and his loss of British citizenship, Lafosse had sold up his house in Edinburgh and returned to Belgium to live with his mother. His latest book, co-authored with Walid Amine Salhab, is The Knights Templar of the Middle East: The Hidden History of the Islamic Origins of Freemasonry (2006).

Joshua Lawrence was born September 10, 1778. Lawrence (or Lawrence's) in Edgecombe County, North Carolina was named for his family. He began preaching when he was about 23 years old. He quickly became an active and influential minister in the Kehukee Baptist Association. The Kehukee Association was organized in Halifax County, North Carolina in 1765 and is generally considered the fourth oldest Baptist association in the United States1. Lawrence was often called upon to represent them at other associational meetings, and was regularly chosen to preach before the body and to serve on its committees (both before and after the separation of 1827). He was a man of limited education, but possessed natural talents of oratory and logic. He was a popular preacher among his contemporaries. Cover of Lawrence's anti-mission book The American Telescope, by a Clodhopper, of North Carolina published in 1825.In 1814, the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions was formed, which set about a controversy that would divide the Baptists in the United States. On one side were those who promoted the use of foreign and home mission societies, theological seminaries, and various church auxiliaries, and on the other side were those who rejected them as not conforming to the Scriptures. Joshua Lawrence took the position that such auxiliaries and societies were without scriptural command or example, and became one of the leading voices on the east coast against them. Hassell credits Lawrence with saving the Kehukee Association from becoming part of the missionary movement. Through his influence, the growing missionary tide, led by Elder Martin Ross, was abated and in 1827 the Kehukee Association \\"agreed that we discard all Missionary Societies, Bible Societies and Theological Seminaries,...believing these societies and institutions to be inventions of men, and not warranted from the word of God.\\" In the two years following, the Kehukee Association reaffirmed this stance against opposition, and afterward became one of the leading \\"anti-missionary\\" associations. It is today considered the oldest Primitive Baptist association in existence. In Lawrence's day, the terminology Primitive Baptist was not in common usage, and the preferred term was usually Old School Baptist, which still retains a strong usage among Primitive Baptists on the east coast. Tarboro Church (now Primitive Baptist) was organized on February 7, 1819, by elders Joshua Lawrence, Martin Ross, Thomas Billings, and Thomas Meredith. Some writings of Lawrence include Reminiscences, written in 1812, Declaration of Church Principles (1826), A Patriotic Discourse, preached on July 4, 1830, and later published, and Teeth to Teeth: Tom Thumb Tugging with the Wolves for the Sheepskin, written in 1837. Though not well known or widely read outside the Primitive Baptist movement, a few of Lawrence's writings are made available by the Primitive Baptist Library in Carthage, Illinois. Joshua Lawrence married Mary Knight. He died in January 1843. Sylvester Hassell summarized Lawrence's life in this way: \\"For more than forty years he advocated powerfully and fearlessly, both from pulpit and press, liberty of conscience, the specialty, spirituality and efficacy of God's salvation, and the unscripturalness and corruption of all the money based religious institutions of the nineteenth century, notwithstanding storms of slander and vituperation, and threats against his life, and during the latter part of his life, great physical debility and suffering.\\" (Chapter 23, History of the Church of God) References *History of the Church of God, C.

Visual Inspection, used in maintenance of facilities, mean inspection of equipment and structures using either or all of raw human senses such as vision, hearing, touch and smell and/or any non-specialized inspection equipment. Inspections requiring Ultrasonic, X-Ray equipment, Infra-red, etc. are not typically regarded as Visual Inspection as these Inspection methodologies require specialized equipment, training and certification. Quality control A study of the visual inspection of small integrated circuits found that the modal duration of eye fixations of trained inspectors was about 200 ms. The most accurate inspectors made the fewest eye fixations and were the fastest. When the same chip was judged more than once by an individual inspector the consistency of judgment was very high whereas the consistency between inspectors was somewhat less. Variation by a factor of six in inspection speed led to variation of less than a factor of two in inspection accuracy. Visual inspection had a false positive rate of 2% and a false negative rate of 23%.

Reference 2D21 tube is 2.125 inches tall (5.3975 cm). A thyratron is a type of gas-filled tube used as a high-power electrical switch and controlled rectifier. Thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard-vacuum tubes. Electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized, producing a phenomenon known as Townsend discharge. Gases used include mercury vapor, xenon, neon, and (in special high-voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times) hydrogen. Unlike a vacuum tube (valve), a thyratron cannot be used to amplify signals linearly. In the 1920s, thyratrons were derived from early vacuum tubes such as the UV-200, which contained a small amount of argon gas to increase its sensitivity as a radio signal detector, and the German LRS relay tube, which also contained argon gas. Gas rectifiers, which predated vacuum tubes, such as the argon-filled General Electric \\"Tungar bulb\\" and the Cooper-Hewitt mercury- pool rectifier, also provided an influence. Irving Langmuir and G. S. Meikle of GE are usually cited as the first investigators to study controlled rectification in gas tubes, about 1914. The first commercial thyratrons appeared circa 1928. The term \\"thyristor\\" was derived from a combination of \\"thyratron\\" and \\"transistor\\". Since the 1960s thyristors have replaced thyratrons in most low- and medium-power applications. Description Most commonly used symbols in the US and Europe of a thyratron (variations are usually related to the representation of the filament and the cathode) Thyratrons resemble vacuum tubes both in appearance and construction but differ in behavior and operating principle. In a vacuum tube, conduction is dominated by free electrons because the distance between anode and cathode is small compared to the mean free path of electrons. A thyratron, on the other hand, is intentionally filled with gas so that the distance between anode and cathode is comparable with the mean free path of electrons. This means that conduction in a thyratron is dominated by plasma conductivity. Due to the high conductivity of plasma, a thyratron is capable of switching higher currents than vacuum tubes which are limited by space charge. A vacuum tube has the advantage that conductivity may be modulated at any time whereas a thyratron becomes filled with plasma and continues to conduct as long as a voltage exists between the anode and cathode. A pseudospark switch operates in a similar regime of the Paschen curve as a thyratron and is sometimes called a cold cathode thyratron. A thyratron consists of a hot cathode, an anode, and one or more control grids between the anode and cathode in an airtight glass or ceramic envelope that is filled with gas. The gas is typically hydrogen or deuterium at a pressure of 300 to 500 mTorr (40 to 70 Pa). Commercial thyratrons also contain a titanium hydride reservoir and a reservoir heater that together maintain gas pressure over long periods regardless of gas loss. Conductivity of a thyratron remains low as long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode because the grid repels electrons emitted by the cathode. Space charge limited electron current flows from the cathode through the control grid toward the anode if the grid is made positive relative to the cathode. Sufficiently high space charge limited current initiates Townsend discharge between anode and cathode. The resulting plasma provides high conductivity between anode and cathode and is not limited by space charge. Conductivity remains high until the current between anode and cathode drops to a small value for a sufficiently long time that the gas ceases to be ionized. This recovery process takes 25 to 75 Œºs and limits thyratron repetition rates to a few kHz. Applications Rare Z806W relay tube used in elevators Low-power thyratrons (relay tubes and trigger tubes) were manufactured for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in Dekatron calculators, for voltage threshold detectors in RC timers, etc. Glow thyratrons were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even phosphorized and used as self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays. Another use of the thyratron was in relaxation oscillators. Since the plate turn-on voltage is much higher than the turn-off voltage, the tube exhibits hysteresis and, with a capacitor across it, it can function as a sawtooth oscillator. The voltage on the grid controls the breakdown voltage and thus the period of oscillation. Thyratron relaxation oscillators were used in power inverters and oscilloscope sweep circuits. One miniature thyratron, the triode 6D4, found an additional use as a potent noise source, when operated as a diode (grid tied to cathode) in a transverse magnetic field. Sufficiently filtered for \\"flatness\\" (\\"white noise\\") in a band of interest, such noise was used for testing radio receivers, servo systems and occasionally in analog computing as a random value source. The miniature RK61/2 thyratron marketed in 1938 was designed specifically to operate like a vacuum triode below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio control receivers, and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of radio controlled modelling as a hobby.George Honnest- Redlich Radio Control for Models (1950) p. 7 Wynn-Williams's scale-of-two counter using thyratrons (with permission of the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK.) Some early television sets, particularly British models, used thyratrons for vertical (frame) and horizontal (line) oscillators. Medium-power thyratrons found applications in machine tool motor controllers, where thyratrons, operating as phase-controlled rectifiers, are utilized in the tool's armature regulator (zero to \\"base speed\\", \\"constant torque\\" mode) and in the tool's field regulator (\\"base speed\\" to about twice \\"base speed\\", \\"constant horsepower\\" mode). Examples include Monarch Machine Tool 10EE lathe, which used thyratrons from 1949 until solid-state devices replaced them in 1984.http://www.lathes.co.uk/monarch/page2.html Lathes.co.uk, retrieved 2012 July 27 High-power thyratrons are still manufactured, and are capable of operation up to tens of kiloamperes (kA) and tens of kilovolts (kV). Modern applications include pulse drivers for pulsed radar equipment, high-energy gas lasers, radiotherapy devices, particle accelerators and in Tesla coils and similar devices. Thyratrons are also used in high-power UHF television transmitters, to protect inductive output tubes from internal shorts, by grounding the incoming high-voltage supply during the time it takes for a circuit breaker to open and reactive components to drain their stored charges. This is commonly called a crowbar circuit. Thyratrons have been replaced in most low and medium-power applications by corresponding semiconductor devices known as thyristors (sometimes called silicon-controlled rectifiers, or SCRs) and triacs. However, switching service requiring voltages above 20 kV and involving very short risetimes remains within the domain of the thyratron. Variations of the thyratron idea are the krytron, the sprytron, the ignitron, and the triggered spark gap, all still used today in special applications, such as nuclear weapons (krytron) and AC/DC-AC power transmission (ignitron). Example of a small thyratron R.C.A. brand 885 Triode Thyratron The 885 is a small thyratron tube, using argon gas. This device was used extensively in the timebase circuits of early oscilloscopes in the 1930s. It was employed in a circuit called a relaxation oscillator. During World War II, small thyratrons similar to the 885 were utilized in pairs to construct bistables, the \\"memory\\" cells used by early computers and code breaking machines. Thyratrons were also used for phase angle control of alternating current (AC) power sources in battery chargers and light dimmers, but these were usually of a larger current handling capacity than the 885. The 885 is a 2.5 volt, 5-pin based variant of the 884/6Q5.

The compound has many names, reflecting its long history. Chemically speaking, it is the bicarbonate salt of the ammonium ion. It is a colourless solid that degrades readily to carbon dioxide, water and ammonia. Production Ammonium bicarbonate is produced by combining carbon dioxide and ammonia: :CO2 \\\\+ NH3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí (NH4)HCO3 Since ammonium bicarbonate is thermally unstable, the reaction solution is kept cold, which allows the precipitation of the product as white solid. About 100,000 tons were produced in this way in 1997. Ammonia gas passed into a strong aqueous solution of the sesquicarbonate (a 2:1:1 mixture of (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, and H2O) converts it into normal ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3), which can be obtained in the crystalline condition from a solution prepared at about 30 ¬∞C. This compound on exposure to air gives off ammonia and reverts to ammonium bicarbonate. =Salt of Hartshorn= Compositions containing ammonium carbonate have long been known. They were once produced commercially, formerly known as sal volatile or salt of hartshorn. It was obtained by the dry distillation of nitrogenous organic matter such as hair, horn, leather. In addition to ammonium bicarbonate, this material contains ammonium carbamate (NH4CO2NH2), and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3). It is sometimes called ammonium sesquicarbonate. It possesses a strong ammoniacal smell, and on digestion with alcohol, the carbamate is dissolved leaving a residue of ammonium bicarbonate. A similar decomposition takes place when the sesquicarbonate is exposed to air.  Uses  Ammonium bicarbonate is used in the food industry as a leavening agent for flat baked goods, such as cookies and crackers. It was commonly used in the home before modern-day baking powder was made available. Many baking cookbooks, especially from Scandinavian countries, may still refer to it as hartshorn or hornsalt,Naturfag : Hornsalt √∏velse. studenttorget.no (in Norwegian) while it is known as \\"hirvensarvisuola\\" in Finnish, \\"hjortetakksalt\\" in Norwegian, \\"hjortetakssalt\\" in Danish, \\"hjorthornssalt\\" in Swedish, and \\"Hirschhornsalz\\" in German (lit., \\"salt of hart's horn\\"). Although there is a slight smell of ammonia during baking, this quickly dissipates, leaving no taste. It is used in, for example, Swedish \\"dr√∂mmar\\" biscuits and Danish \\"brunkager\\" Christmas biscuits, and German Lebkuchen. In many cases it may be replaced with baking soda or baking powder, or a combination of both, depending on the recipe composition and leavening requirements. Compared to baking soda or potash, hartshorn has the advantage of producing more gas for the same amount of agent, and of not leaving any salty or soapy taste in the finished product, as it completely decomposes into water and gaseous products that evaporate during baking. It cannot be used for moist, bulky baked goods however, such as normal bread or cakes, since some ammonia will be trapped inside and will cause an unpleasant taste. It has been assigned E number E503 for use as a food additive in the European Union. It is commonly used as an inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer in China, but is now being phased out in favor of urea for quality and stability. This compound is used as a component in the production of fire-extinguishing compounds, pharmaceuticals, dyes, pigments, and it is also a basic fertilizer, being a source of ammonia. Ammonium bicarbonate is still widely used in the plastics and rubber industry, in the manufacture of ceramics, in chrome leather tanning, and for the synthesis of catalysts. It is also used for buffering solutions to make them slightly alkaline during chemical purification, such as high-performance liquid chromatography. Because it entirely decomposes to volatile compounds, this allows rapid recovery of the compound of interest by freeze-drying. Ammonium bicarbonate is also a key component of the expectorant cough syrup \\"Senega and Ammonia\\". Reactions It dissolves in water to give a mildly alkaline solution. It is insoluble in acetone and alcohols. Ammonium bicarbonate decomposes above about 36 ¬∞C into ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water in an endothermic process and so causes a drop in the temperature of the water: :NH4HCO3 ‚Üí NH3 \\\\+ H2O + CO2. When treated with acids, ammonium salts are also produced: :NH4HCO3 \\\\+ HCl ‚Üí NH4Cl + CO2 \\\\+ H2O. Reaction with base produces ammonia. It reacts with sulfates of alkaline-earth metals precipitating their carbonates: :CaSO4 \\\\+ 2 NH4HCO3 ‚Üí CaCO3 \\\\+ (NH4)2SO4 \\\\+ CO2 \\\\+ H2O. It also reacts with alkali metal halides, giving alkali metal bicarbonate and ammonium halide: :NH4HCO3 \\\\+ NaCl ‚Üí NH4Cl + NaHCO3; :NH4HCO3 \\\\+ KI ‚Üí NH4I + KHCO3; :NH4HCO3 \\\\+ NaBr ‚Üí NH4Br + NaHCO3. Safety Ammonium bicarbonate is an irritant to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Short- term health effects may occur immediately or shortly after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate. Breathing ammonium bicarbonate can irritate the nose, throat and lungs causing coughing, wheezing and/or shortness of breath. Repeated exposure may cause bronchitis to develop with cough, and/or shortness of breath. Health effects can occur some time after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate and can last for months or years. Where possible, operations should be enclosed and the use of local exhaust ventilation at the site of chemical release is recommended. If local exhaust ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators are necessary. Wear protective work clothing and change clothes and wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to ammonium bicarbonate. Ammonium bicarbonate from China used to make cookies was found to be contaminated with melamine, and imports were banned in Malaysia following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal.

Originally founded as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, England in 1905, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva due to the unfavorable economic situation in post-war Britain, and in 1920 Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name which eventually became Rolex SA in later years. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust. Rolex SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, manufacture, distribute and service wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands. In 2018, Forbes ranked Rolex as the world's 71st most valuable brand. As of June 2019, among the world's top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, three are Rolex watches. In particular, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona currently holds the title of the second most expensive wristwatch and the third most expensive watch ever sold at auction, fetching 17.75 million US dollars in New York on October 26, 2017. Rolex is the largest manufacturer of Swiss made certified chronometers. In 2005, more than half the annual production of watches certified by Contr√¥le Officiel Suisse des Chronom√®tres (COSC) were Rolexes. To date, Rolex still holds the record for the most certified chronometer movements in the category of wristwatches. History = Early history = Rolex Submariner Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded Wilsdorf and Davis, the company that would eventually become Rolex S.A., in London, England in 1905. Wilsdorf and Davis' main commercial activity at the time involved importing Hermann Aegler's Swiss movements to England and placing them in watch cases made by Dennison and others. These early wristwatches were sold to many jewellers, who then put their own names on the dial. The earliest watches from Wilsdorf and Davis were usually hallmarked \\"W&D;\\" inside the caseback. In 1908, Wilsdorf registered the trademark \\"Rolex\\", which became the brand name of watches from Wilsdorf and Davis. He opened an office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Wilsdorf wanted the brand name to be easily pronounceable in any language, and short enough to fit on the face of a watch. He also thought that the name \\"Rolex\\" was onomatopoeic, sounding like a watch being wound. In 1914, Kew Observatory awarded a Rolex watch a Class A precision certificate, a distinction normally granted exclusively to marine chronometers. In November 1915, the company changed its name to Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. In 1919, Hans Wilsdorf moved the company from England to Geneva, Switzerland because of heavy post-war taxes levied on luxury imports and high export duties on the silver and gold used for the watch cases. In 1920 the company's name was officially changed to Montres Rolex S.A. and later to Rolex S.A. With administrative worries attended to, Wilsdorf turned the company's attention to a technical challenge: the infiltration of dust and moisture under the dial and crown, which damaged the movement. To address this problem, in 1926 Rolex developed and produced the first waterproof and dustproof wristwatch, giving it the name \\"Oyster\\". The watch featured a hermetically sealed case which provided optimal protection for the movement. Consumers at the time remained skeptical of a fully waterproof watch. As a demonstration, Rolex submerged Oyster models in aquariums, which it displayed in the windows of its main points of sale. In 1927, British swimmer Mercedes Gleitze swam across the English Channel with an Oyster on her wrist, becoming the first Rolex ambassador. To celebrate the feat, Rolex published a full-page advertisement on the front page of the Daily Mail proclaiming the watch's success during the ten hour plus swim. In 1931, Rolex patented a self-winding mechanism called a Perpetual rotor, a semi-circular plate that relies on gravity to move freely. Its system was the first wristwatch to use a 360¬∞ winding rotor and would become the basis of all future automatic watches throughout the industry. In turn, the Oyster watch became known as the Oyster Perpetual. Upon the death of his wife in 1944, Wilsdorf established the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private trust, in which he left all of his Rolex shares, ensuring that some of the company's income would go to charity. Wilsdorf died in 1960, and since then the trust has owned and run Rolex S.A. = Recent development = In December 2008, following the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Patrick Heiniger for \\"personal reasons\\", Rolex SA denied that it had lost 1 billion Swiss francs (approx ¬£574 million, $900 million) invested with Bernard Madoff, the American asset manager who pleaded guilty to an approximately ¬£30 billion worldwide Ponzi scheme fraud.Marcus Leroux. \\"Madoff casts shadow over Rolex as chief executive Patrick Heiniger quits\\". The Times. 20 December 2008. The company announced Heiniger's death on March 5, 2013. Rolex SA is owned by the private Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which is registered as a charity and does not pay corporate income taxes. In 2011, a spokesman for Rolex declined to provide evidence regarding the amount of charitable donations made by the Wilsdorf Foundation. In Geneva where the company is based, it is said to have gifted, among many things, two housing buildings to social institutions of Geneva. According to the 2017 Brand Z report, the brand value is estimated $8.053 billion. Rolex watches continue to have a reputation as status symbols. It produces more than 800,000 timepieces each year. It is said that \\"The power of the Crown is never more felt than when trying to negotiate space in a retail environment for the product of another brand\\". = Tudor SA = Wristwatch Tudor Prince Date Day, Ref.: 76200 Rolex SA offers products under the Rolex and Tudor brands. Montres Tudor (SA) has designed, manufactured and marketed Tudor watches since 6 March 1946. Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf conceived of the Tudor Watch Company to create a product for authorized Rolex dealers to sell that offered the reliability and dependability of a Rolex, but at a lower price. The number of Rolex watches was limited by the rate that they could produce in-house Rolex movements, thus Tudor watches were originally equipped with off-the-shelf movements while using similar quality cases and bracelets. Historically, Tudor watches have been manufactured by Montres Tudor SA using movements supplied by ETA SA. Since 2015 Tudor has begun to manufacture watches with in-house movements. The first model introduced with a in-house movement was the Tudor North Flag. Following this, updated versions of the Tudor Pelagos and Tudor Heritage Black Bay have also been fitted with an in- house caliber. Tudor watches are marketed and sold in most countries around the world. Montres Tudor SA discontinued sales of Tudor-branded watches in the United States in 2004, but Tudor returned to the United States market in the summer of 2013 and to the UK in 2014.  Motto and slogan  One of Rolex's company slogans is \\"A Crown for Every Achievement\\".  Watch manufacturing  Rolex GMT Master II gold and stainless steel (ref. 116713LN)Rolex mostly produced mechanical watches, but it has also participated in the development of the original quartz watch movements. Although Rolex has made very few quartz models for its Oyster line, the company's engineers were instrumental in design and implementation of the technology during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1968, Rolex collaborated with a consortium of 16 Swiss watch manufacturers to develop the Beta 21 quartz movement used in their Rolex Quartz Date 5100 alongside other manufactures including the Omega Electroquartz watches. Within about five years of research, design, and development, Rolex created the \\"clean-slate\\" 5035/5055 movement that would eventually power the Rolex Oysterquartz. Material-wise, Rolex first used its \\"Cerachrom\\" ceramic bezel on the GMT-Master II in 2005, and has since then implemented ceramic bezel inserts across the range of professional sports watches. They are available on the Submariner, Sea Dweller, Deepsea, GMT Master II and Daytona models. In contrast to the aluminum bezel which it replaced, the ceramic bezel color does not wear out from exposure to UV-light and is very scratch resistant. Rolex also uses 904L grade stainless-steel. Most Swiss watches are made with 316L grade steel. Rolex uses the higher grade, as it is more resistant to corrosion and when polished, leaves a beautiful luster. =Notable inventions and patents= Among the company's innovations are: * In 1910, the first watchmaker to earn chronometer certification for a wristwatch. * In 1926, produced a waterproof wristwatch, Rolex Oyster. But it was far from the first company to do (see, for example, the \\"Submarine Watch\\" from the First World War, which was made by Tavannes and retailed by Brook & Son in Edinburgh). Wilsdorf even had a specially made Rolex watch (the watch was called the \\"DeepSea\\") attached to the side of Trieste, which went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. The watch survived and tested as having kept perfect time during its descent and ascent. This was confirmed by a telegram sent to Rolex the following day saying \\"Am happy to confirm that even at 11,000 metres your watch is as precise as on the surface. Best regards, Jacques Piccard\\". * In 1931, a self-winding Rolex wristwatch was offered to the public (the so-called the \\"bubbleback\\" due to the large caseback). However, as with so many alleged Rolex \\"firsts\\" it was, in fact, not the first and was preceded to the market by Harwood which patented the design in 1923 and produced the first self-winding watch in 1928. This was powered by an internal mechanism that used the movement of the wearer's arm. As well as making watch winding unnecessary, it also kept the power from the mainspring more consistent, resulting in more reliable timekeeping. * In 1945, introduced a wristwatch with an automatically changing date on the dial (Rolex Datejust Ref. 4467). Again, it was not the first company to do so: Mimo made them in the 1930s -- some twenty years earlier. * In 1953, released the first wristwatch case waterproof to 100 m (330 ft) (Rolex Oyster Perpetual Submariner Ref.6204, 1953) * In 1954, produced a wristwatch which showed two time zones at once (Rolex GMT Master ref.6542, 1954) Yet again, it was not the first company to do so, as the Longines DualTime preceded the GMT by a full quarter of a century. * In 1956, made a wristwatch with an automatically changing day and date on the dial (Rolex Day-Date, 1956) = Counterfeits = Rolex watches are frequently counterfeited, and these are often illegally sold on the street and online. Counterfeit Rolex watches vary in quality: some use the cheapest of movements, while others use automatic movements, and some use an ETA movement. However, the majority of these counterfeit watches are easily identifiable by jewellers and other experts. O. J. Simpson wore a counterfeit Rolex during his 1994 murder trial. =Environmental rating= Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. There are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. Notable models In general, Rolex has three watch lines: Oyster Perpetual, Professional and Cellini (the Cellini line is Rolex's line of \\"dress\\" watches). The primary bracelets for the Oyster line are named Jubilee, Oyster, President, and Pearlmaster. The watch straps on the models are usually either stainless steel, yellow gold, white gold, or rose gold. In the United Kingdom, the retail price for the stainless steel 'Pilots' range (such as the GMT Master II) starts from GBP 5,600. Diamond inlay watches are more expensive. The book \\"Vintage Wristwatches\\" by Antiques Roadshow's Reyne Haines listed a price estimate of vintage Rolex watches that ranged between US$650 and US$75,000, while listing vintage Tudors between US$250 and US$9,000. =Most expensive pieces= Rolex Daytona chronograph stainless steel, white dial (ref. 6263) * On October 26, 2017, a Rolex Daytona (Ref. 6239) wristwatch, manufactured in 1968, was sold by Phillips in its New York auction for US$17.75 million. The watch was originally purchased by Joanne Woodward in 1968 and was given by Joanne to her husband Paul Newman as a gift. The auction price set a record at $15.5-million, plus buyer's premium of 12.5%, for a final price of $17,752,500 in New York City. As of 2018, it is the most expensive wristwatch and the second most expensive watch ever sold at auction. Notably, \\"[a]t the time that Newman gave the watch to James Cox [as a gift], the watch was selling for about $200.\\" * On May 28, 2018, a Rolex Daytona \\"Unicorn\\" Ref. 6265 was sold in auction by Phillips for US$5.937 million in Geneva, making it the second most expensive Rolex timepiece ever sold at auction (as of 2018). * The most expensive Rolex (in terms of retail price) ever produced by the Rolex factory was the GMT Ice reference 116769TBR with a retail price of US$485,350. A Forbes magazine article on the Swiss watch industry compared the retail value of Rolex to that of competing brands Corum, Universal Gen√®ve and IWC. = Air- King = Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf created the Air-King line to honor RAF pilots of the Battle of Britain, releasing the first model in 1958. By 2007, the 1142XX iteration of the Air-King featured a COSC-certified movement in a 34mm case, considered by some a miniaturized variant of the 39mm Rolex Explorer as both watches featured very similar styling cues; the 34mm Air-King lineup was the least expensive series of Oyster Perpetual. In 2014 the Air- King was dropped, making the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 the entry-level Rolex line. In 2016 Rolex reintroduced the Air-King, available as a single model (number 116900), largely similar to its predecessors but with a larger 40mm case, and a magnetic shield found on the Rolex Milgauss; indeed the new 40mm Air-King is slightly cheaper than the 39mm Explorer (the Explorer lacks the magnetic shield but its movement has Paraflex shock absorbers that are not found in the Air-King's movement). =Oyster Perpetual= The name of the watch line in catalogs is often \\"Rolex Oyster ______\\" or \\"Rolex Oyster Perpetual ______\\"; Rolex Oyster and Oyster Perpetual are generic names and not specific product lines, except for the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 and Oyster Perpetual Date 34.The Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch is a direct descendant of the original watertight Rolex Oyster watch created in 1926. Within the Oyster Perpetual lineup, there are three different movements; the 39 features the Caliber 3132 movement with the Parachrom hairspring and Paraflex shock absorbers (the Oyster Perpetual 39 is a less sporty variant of the Rolex Explorer 39mm as they share the same case, same bracelet and buckle, same bezel and same movement, with a different dial and different hands), while the 34 and 36 models have the Caliber 3130 featuring the Parachrom hairspring, and the smallest 28 and 31 models have Calibre 2231. The Oyster Perpetual Date 34 (or simply Date 34) adds a date display and date movement, plus the options of a white gold fluted bezel and diamonds on the dial. Certain models from the Date and Datejust are almost identical, however the Datejust have 36 mm and 41 mm cases paired with a 20 mm bracelet, compared to the Date's 34 mm case and 19 mm bracelet. Modern versions of the Oyster Perpetual Date and Datejust models share Rolex's 3135 movement, with the most recent change to the 3135 movement being the introduction of Rolex's \\"parachrom bleu\\" hairspring, which provides increased accuracy. As the Date and Datejust share a movement, both have the ability to adjust the date forward one day at a time without adjusting the time; this feature is not confined to the Datejust. Compared to the Date, the Datejust has a much wider range of customization options, including other metals beyond stainless steel, various materials for the dial, and optional diamonds on the dial and bezel. The Datejust II, which was released in 2009, has a bigger case (41mm diameter) than the standard Datejust and it also features an updated movement, being only available in steel with white, yellow or rose gold on an Oyster bracelet. In 2016, Rolex released the Datejust 41, which has the same 41mm diameter case as the Datejust II, however the Datejust 41 has smaller indexes and a thinner bezel compared to the Datejust II. = Professional collections = Rolex Sea Dweller Deepsea with 3,900 m depth rating (ref. 116660) Rolex produced specific models suitable for the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. Early professional models included the Rolex Submariner (1953) and the Rolex Sea Dweller (1967). The latter watch has a helium release valve, co-invented with Swiss watchmaker Doxa, to release helium gas build-up during decompression. The Explorer (1953) and Explorer II (1971) were developed specifically for explorers who would navigate rough terrain, such as the world-famous Mount Everest expeditions. Indeed, the Rolex Explorer was launched to celebrate the successful ascent of Everest in 1953 by the expeditionary team led by Sir John Hunt. The 39 mm Rolex Explorer was designed as a \\"tool watch\\" for rugged use, hence its movement has Paraflex shock absorbers which gives them higher shock resistance than other Rolex watches. The 42mm Rolex Explorer II has some significant differences from the 39mm Explorer; the Explorer II adds a date function, and an orange 24-hour hand which is paired with the fixed bezel's black 24-hour markers for situations underground or around the poles where day cannot be distinguished from night. Another iconic model is the Rolex GMT Master (1955), originally developed at the request of Pan Am Airways to provide its crews with a dual time watch that could be used to display GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), which was the international time standard for aviation at that time (and still is) and was needed for Astronavigation during longer flights.  Historic events  = POWs and the Great Escape = By the start of World War II Royal Air Force pilots were buying Rolex watches to replace their inferior standard-issue watches. However, when captured and sent to prisoner of war (POW) camps, their watches were confiscated. When Hans Wilsdorf heard of this, he offered to replace all watches that had been confiscated and not require payment until the end of the war, if the officers would write to Rolex and explain the circumstances of their loss and where they were being held. Wilsdorf was in personal charge of the scheme.Time on your hands by James Cockington, The Sydney Morning Herald, 27 September 2006 As a result of this, an estimated 3,000 Rolex watches were ordered by British officers in the officer camp Oflag VII-B in Bavaria alone. This had the effect of raising the morale among the allied POWs because it indicated that Wilsdorf did not believe that the Axis powers would win the war. American servicemen heard about this when stationed in Europe during WWII and this helped open up the American market to Rolex after the war. On 10 March 1943, while still a prisoner of war, Corporal Clive James Nutting, one of the organizers of the Great Escape, ordered a stainless steel Rolex Oyster 3525 Chronograph (valued at a current equivalent of ¬£1,200) by mail directly from Hans Wilsdorf in Geneva, intending to pay for it with money he saved working as a shoemaker at the camp.Times online For sale: Rolex sent by mail order to Stalag Luft III by Bojan Pancevski in Vienna 12 May 2007 The watch (Rolex watch no. 185983) was delivered to Stalag Luft III on 10 July that year along with a note from Wilsdorf apologising for any delay in processing the order and explaining that an English gentleman such as Corporal Nutting \\"should not even think\\" about paying for the watch before the end of the war. Wilsdorf is reported to have been impressed with Nutting because, although not an officer, he had ordered the expensive Rolex 3525 Oyster chronograph while most other prisoners ordered the much cheaper Rolex Speed King model which was popular because of its small size. The watch is believed to have been ordered specifically to be used in the Great Escape when, as a chronograph, it could have been used to time patrols of prison guards or time the 76 ill-fated escapees through tunnel 'Harry' on 24 March 1944.Madoff ‚ÄòPrisoner‚Äô Rolex Sale Won‚Äôt Calm Swiss Time Town‚Äôs Ire Quote: \\"The prisoners involved in the mass breakout from Stalag Luft III in March 1944, depicted in the Steve McQueen film \\"The Great Escape\\", may have used the watches to time the movements of guards as they dug tunnels out of the camp, Antiquorum said.\\" Eventually, after the war, Nutting was sent an invoice of only ¬£15 for the watch, because of currency export controls in England at the time. The watch and associated correspondence between Wilsdorf and Nutting were sold at auction for ¬£66,000 in May 2007, while at an earlier auction in September 2006 the same watch fetched A$54,000.Australian auction house Through Internet Archive Nutting served as a consultant for both the 1950 film The Wooden Horse and the 1963 film The Great Escape. Both films were based on actual escapes which took place at Stalag Luft III. It was also reported that in November 2013 the Rolex Speed King owned by Flight Lieutenant Gerald Imeson during the Great Escape was sold for ¬£60,000.Sun on Sunday. 10 November 2013 =Murder investigation= In a famous murder case, the Rolex on Ronald Platt's wrist eventually led to the arrest of his murderer, Albert Johnson Walker‚Äîa financial planner who had fled from Canada when he was charged with 18 counts of fraud, theft, and money laundering. When the body was found in the English Channel in 1996 by a fisherman named John Coprik, a Rolex wristwatch was the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex and identified the owner of the watch as Ronald Platt. In addition, British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar. Since the Rolex movement was fully waterproof and had a reserve of two days of operation when inactive, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error.Discovery Channel Documentary on Ronald Platt's murder Sponsorship In tennis, Rolex is the official timekeeper of Wimbledon, the Australian Open, the US Open, and the French Open, all four Grand Slams. In golf, it is the official time keeper for two of the four majors, The Open Championship and the U.S. Open, as well as the PGA Tour and European Tour; the presenting sponsor for one of the five senior majors, The Senior Open Championship; and the official sponsor of the Women's World Golf Rankings.Rolex Yacht-MasterRolex is the title sponsor to the 24 Hours of Daytona, from which the Daytona model takes its name, along with the Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2013, Rolex became the official timekeeper to the FIA Formula 1 motor racing championship. Rolex has also been the official timekeeper to the Le Mans 24 Hours motor race since 2001. Ex-Formula 1 driver Sir Jackie Stewart has advertised Rolex since 1968. Others who have done so for some years include Arnold Palmer, Roger Penske, Jean Claude Killy, and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.\\"Video: Racing Legend Sir Jackie Stewart Talks Rolex At Pebble Beach 2014\\".

Both Rolex and Smiths had claimed to the first to the summit and while feasible (eg if Hillary and/or Tenzing had carried both or if one had a Smiths and the other a Rolex) it was later admitted by Mr. R. A. Winter, Director of the Rolex Watch Co., Ltd that Hillary was only wearing one watch at the summit, \\"and that a Smiths watch.\\" He goes on to congratulate Smiths \\"on the fact that their Smiths de Luxe ordinary wind wrist watch reached the summit with Sir Edmund Hillary.\\" (BHI's Horological Journal, Letters, October 1953, 651) Also on the year 1953, one or several Rolex Oyster Perpetual (ref. 6098) watches have been given to members of the Italian expedition \\"Sesto Continente\\", an exploration in the Red Sea, either underwater and on coasts of the surrounding countries- The expedition, organized and directed by Bruno Vailati, has been filmed in the homonymous documentary that was shot in the Red Sea and the Dahlak Islands and presented at the 15th Venice International Film Festival in 1954. The expedition included commander Raimondo Bucher as director of the sports section, accompanied by his wife Enza, Italian underwater hunting champion, Silverio Zecca, known as the amphibious man, the painter Priscilla Hastings, who would make her own works directly on the sea bed, the journalist Gianni Roghi, the hydrobiologists Francesco Baschieri Salvadori and Luigi Stuart Tovini of the University of Rome, dr. Alberto Grazioli, expedition doctor, film operator Masino Manunza and photographer Giorgio Ravelli. The Sesto Continente is a (edited 1954) film directed by Folco Quilici during the \\"National Underwater Expedition in the Red Sea\\" well organized by Bruno Vailati, the first in color in the history of Italian underwater cinema. The Rolex Oyster watches have been precious, and perfectly proper for the hard job to dive for thousand hours. Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh had a specially designed experimental Rolex Oyster Perpetual Deep-Sea Special strapped to the outside of their bathyscaphe during the 1960 Challenger Deep / Mariana Trench dive to a world-record depth of . When James Cameron conducted a similar dive in 2012, a specially designed and manufactured Rolex Oyster Perpetual Sea-Dweller Deep Sea Challenge watch was being \\"worn\\" by his submarine's robotic arm. Rolex is currently partnered with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences as a founding supporter of the upcoming Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which will explore the history of film. The brand has also partnered with four Oscar-winning film directors - Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron, Alejandro G. Inarritu and Martin Scorsese - in a campaign aimed to inspire the next generation of filmmakers to pursue their craft. Mercedes Gleitze was the first British woman to swim the English Channel on 7 October 1927. However, as John E. Brozek (author of The Rolex Report: An Unauthorized Reference Book for the Rolex Enthusiast) points out in his article \\"The Vindication Swim, Mercedes Gleitze and Rolex take the plunge\\", some doubts were cast on her achievement when a hoaxer claimed to have made a faster swim only four days later. Hence Gleitze attempted a repeat swim with extensive publicity on 21 October, dubbed the \\"Vindication Swim\\". For promotional purposes, Hans Wilsdorf offered her one of the earliest Rolex Oysters if she would wear it during the attempt. After more than 10 hours, in water that was much colder than during her first swim, she was pulled from the sea semi-conscious seven miles short of her goal. Although she did not complete the second crossing, a journalist for The Times wrote \\"Having regard to the general conditions, the endurance of Miss Gleitze surprised the doctors, journalists and experts who were present, for it seemed unlikely that she would be able to withstand the cold for so long. It was a good performance\\". As she sat in the boat, the same journalist made a discovery and reported it as follows: \\"Hanging round her neck by a ribbon on this swim, Miss Gleitze carried a small gold watch, which was found this evening to have kept good time throughout\\". When examined closely, the watch was found to be dry inside and in perfect condition. One month later, on 24 November 1927, Wilsdorf launched the Rolex Oyster watch in the United Kingdom with a full front page Rolex advert in the Daily Mail. The Vienna Herald described the 1969 Apollo moon landing as: 'an event almost as significant as the time a woman swam most of the English Channel with a waterproof watch on.'  The Rolex Institute  The Rolex Institute was created by the brand to help support specific people and events in line with the brand's values, through two distinct programs. The first is the Rolex Awards for Enterprise. Founded in 1976 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Oyster watch, the awards recognise and support enterprising individuals from around the globe who initiate projects aimed at making the world a better place. Winners receive a cash grant to advance their projects, along with international media coverage. (Rolex Awards for Enterprise). The second is the Rolex Mentor and Prot√©g√© Arts Initiative, a biennial philanthropic programme launched in 2002 that brings together gifted young artists with globally recognised masters in the fields of architecture, dance, film, literature, music, theatre and visual arts, for a year of creative collaboration and one-to-one. (Rolex Mentor and Prot√©g√© Arts Initiative)  Rolex.org  Rolex.org is the website for the brand's philanthropic arm, whose goal is to positively impact future generations within the fields of science, the arts and the environment. The website, in complement to but entirely separate from the brand's commercial site, aims to be a source of inspiration and education, presenting Rolex's past and present initiatives in support of individuals and organisations from around the world. The keyword \\"Perpetual\\" is regularly repeated throughout the website, evoking Rolex's Oyster Perpetual watch collection while underlying the brand's commitment to preserving humanitarian domains.

Bomarzo is a town and comune of the province of Viterbo (Lazio, central Italy), in the lower valley of the Tiber. It is located east-northeast of Viterbo and north-northwest of Rome.  History  The city's current name is a derivation of Polymartium, first mentioned in the Historia Langobardorum by Paulus Diaconus. The etymology \\"polis martium\\", city of Mars, suggests a Roman origin. However, archeological evidence for a Roman city has not been found so far. It was a historical fiefdom of the Orsini family, whose castle is at the edge of the densely built town, until it was sold to Ippolito Lante Montefeltro della Rovere in 1645. Lante was elevated to the title of Duke of Bomarzo.  Main sights  Bomarzo's main attraction is a garden, usually referred to as the Bosco Sacro (Sacred grove) or, locally, Bosco dei Mostri (\\"Monsters' Grove\\"), named after the many larger-than-life sculptures, some sculpted in the bedrock, which populate this predominantly barren landscape. A sphinx at the entrance of the Park of the Monsters. It is the work of Pier Francesco Orsini, called Vicino (1528-1588), a condottiero or mercenary and a patron of the arts. He was greatly devoted to his wife Giulia Farnese, daughter of Galeazzo Farnese, Duke of Latera, (not to be confused with her maternal great-aunt Giulia Farnese) and when she died, he created the gardens. The design has been attributed to Pirro Ligorio, a well known architect and antiquarian of the time. The park of Bomarzo was intended not to please, but to astonish, and like many Mannerist works of art, its symbolism is arcane; for example, one large sculpture is of one of Hannibal's war elephants, which mangles a Roman legionary, and another is a statue of Ceres lounging on the bare ground, with a vase of \\"fruits of the earth\\" perched on her head. The many monstrous statues appear to be unconnected to any rational plan and appear to have been strewn almost randomly about the area, sol per sfogare il Core (\\"just to set the heart free\\") as one inscription on an obelisk says. Enigmatic verses in Italian by Annibale Caro, Bitussi and Cristoforo Madruzzo, some of them now eroded, were inscribed onto stone beside the sculptures. The reason for the layout and design of the garden is largely unknown: perhaps they were meant as a foil to the perfect symmetry and layout of the great Renaissance gardens nearby at Villa Farnese at Caprarola and Villa Lante at Bagnaia. Next to a formal exedra is a tilting building, the so-called Casa Storta or Twisted House. A small octagonal temple was added about twenty years later to honor Orsini's wife, Giulia Farnese. During the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, the garden became overgrown and neglected but in the 1970s a program of restoration was implemented by the Bettini family, and today the garden, which remains private property, is a major tourist attraction. In recent years, a number of the stone sculptures have had fences put around them. The surreal nature of the Parco dei Mostri appealed to Jean Cocteau and the great surrealist Salvador Dal√≠, who discussed it at great length. The poet Andr√© Pieyre de Mandiargues wrote an essay devoted to Bomarzo. Niki de Saint Phalle was inspired by Bomarzo when she created her Tarot Garden in Tuscany. The story behind Bomarzo and the life of Pier Francesco Orsini are the subject of a novel by the Argentinian writer Manuel Mujica L√°inez (1910‚Äì1984), Bomarzo (1962). Mujica L√°inez himself wrote a libretto based on his novel, which was set to music by Alberto Ginastera (1967). The opera Bomarzo premi√®red in Washington in 1967 but in Argentina it was banned by the military dictatorship. The Dutch magic-surrealist painter Carel Willink used several of the park's statue groups in his paintings, including The Eternal Cry and Balance of Forces. A mystery novel by Linda Lappin, Signatures in Stone (2013), investigates the symbolism of the Sacred Grove, its relation to the myth of Persephone, and recent theories concerning the designer of the park.

He, along with his sister-wife Izanami, are the last of the seven generations of primordial deities that manifested after the formation of heaven and earth. Izanagi and Izanami are held to be the creators of the Japanese archipelago and the progenitors of many deities, which include the sun goddess Amaterasu, the moon deity Tsukuyomi and the wild storm god Susanoo. Name His name is given in the Kojiki (ca. 712 CE) both as Izanagi-no-Kami (‰ºäÈÇ™ÈÇ£Â≤êÁ•û) and Izanagi-no-Mikoto (‰ºäÈÇ™ÈÇ£Â≤êÂëΩ), while the Nihon Shoki (720 CE) refers to him as Izanagi-no-Mikoto, with the name written in different characters (‰ºäÂºâË´æÂ∞ä). The names Izanagi (Izanaki) and Izanami are often interpreted as being derived from the verb izanau (historical orthography: izanafu) 'to invite', with -ki / -gi and -mi being taken as masculine and feminine suffixes, respectively. Phillipi, Donald L. (1969). Kojiki. Tokyo: University of Tokyo Press. p. 482.Chamberlain (1882). Section II.‚ÄîThe Seven Divine Generations. Shiratori Kurakichi proposed an alternative theory which instead sees the root iza- (or rather isa-) to be derived from isao (historical orthography: isawo) meaning 'achievement' or 'merit'. Mythology The first group of primordial deities, the kotoamatsukami, and the seven generations of kami (kamiyonanayo) that emerged after them =In the Kojiki= The birth of the land The Kojiki portrays Izanagi and his younger twin sister Izanami as the seventh and final generation of deities that manifested after the emergence of the first group of gods, the Kotoamatsukami, when heaven and earth came into existence.Chamberlain (1882). Section II.‚ÄîThe Seven Divine Generations. Receiving a command from the other gods to solidify and shape the earth (which then \\"[resembled] floating oil and [drifted] like a jellyfish\\"), the couple use a jeweled spear to churn the watery chaos. The brine that dripped from the tip of the spear congealed and turned into an island named Onogoro (Ê∑§ËÉΩÁ¢ÅÂëÇÂ≥∂).Chamberlain (1882). Section III.‚ÄîThe Island of Onogoro. The two descended to the island and, setting up their dwelling, erected a 'heavenly pillar' (ame no mihashira) on it. Izanagi and Izanami, realizing that they were meant to procreate and have children, then devised a marriage ceremony whereby they would walk in opposite directions around the pillar, greet each other and initiate intercourse. After Izanami greeted Izanagi first, Izanagi objected that he, the man, should have been the first to speak. True enough, the first offspring that resulted from their union, the 'leech-child' Hiruko, was considered imperfect and set adrift on a boat of reeds. Izanagi and Izanami then also begat the island of Awa (Ê∑°Â≥∂ Awashima), but this too was not counted among their rightful progeny.Chamberlain (1882). Section IV.‚ÄîCourtship of the Deities The Male-Who- Invites and the Female Who-Invites. The 'Eight Great Islands' (Â§ßÂÖ´Ê¥≤ ≈åyashima) of Japan begotten by Izanami and Izanagi Izanagi and Izanami then decided to repeat the ritual, with Izanagi greeting Izanami first. This time, their union was a success, with Izanami giving birth to the various islands that comprise the Japanese archipelago, which include the following eight islands (in the following order): *Awaji-no-Ho-no-Sawake (Ê∑°ÈÅì‰πãÁ©Ç‰πãÁã≠Âà•Â≥∂) *The double-named island of Iyo (‰ºä‰∫à‰πã‰∫åÂêçÂ≥∂ Iyo-no-Futana-no-Shima, modern Shikoku) *The triple islands of Oki (Èö†‰ºé‰πã‰∏âÂ≠êÂ≥∂ Oki-no-Mitsugo-no-Shima) *Tsukushi (Á≠ëÁ¥´Â≥∂, modern Kyushu) *Iki (‰ºä‰ºéÂ≥∂) *Tsushima (Ê¥•Â≥∂) *Sado (‰ΩêÂ∫¶Â≥∂) *≈åyamato-Toyoakitsushima (Â§ßÂÄ≠Ë±äÁßãÊ¥•Â≥∂, modern Honshu)Chamberlain (1882).

Izanami, however, was badly injured and eventually died after giving birth to the fire god Kagutsuchi.Chamberlain (1882). Section VII.‚ÄîRetirement of Her Augustness The Princess-Who-Invites. In an act of grief and rage, Izanagi killed Kagutsuchi with his 'ten-grasp sword'. More gods manifest into existence out of Izanami's excreta, Kagutsuchi's blood and mutilated remains, and Izanagi's tears.Chamberlain (1882). Section VIII.‚ÄîThe Slaying of the Fire-Deity.Phillipi (1969). pp. 48‚Äì60. Descent into Yomi Izanagi, wishing to see Izanami again, went down to Yomi, the land of the dead, in the hopes of retrieving her. Izanami reveals that she had already partaken of food cooked in the furnace of the underworld, rendering her return impossible. Izanagi, losing his patience, betrayed his promise not to look at her and lit up a fire, only to find that Izanami is now a rotting corpse. To avenge her shame, Izanami dispatched the gods of thunder, the \\"hags of Yomi\\" (‰∫àÊØçÈÉΩÂøóË®±Â£≤ Yomotsu-shikome), and a horde of warriors to chase after him. To distract them, Izanagi threw the vine securing his hair and the comb on his right hair-knot, which turned into grapes and bamboo shoots that the hags devoured. Upon reaching the pass of Yomotsu Hirasaka (ÈªÑÊ≥âÊØîËâØÂùÇ, the 'Flat Slope of Yomi'), Izanagi took three peaches from a nearby tree and repelled his pursuers using them. He then declared the peach fruit to be divine and bade it to grow in the land of the living to help people in need. When Izanami herself came in pursuit of him, Izanagi sealed the entrance to Yomi using a huge boulder. Izanami then pronounces a curse, vowing to kill a thousand people each day, to which Izanagi replies that he will then beget a thousand and five hundred people everyday to thwart her.Chamberlain (1882). Section IX.‚ÄîThe Land of Hades.Phillipi (1969). pp. 61‚Äì67. Purification (Misogi) Izanagi purifying himself (misogi) by immersing in a river (Natori Shunsen) Izanagi, feeling contaminated by his visit to Yomi, went to \\"[the plain of] Awagihara (i.e. a plain covered with awagi) by the river-mouth of Tachibana in Himuka in [the island of] Tsukushi\\" and purified himself by bathing in the river; various deities came into existence as he stripped off his clothes and accoutrements and immersed himself in the water. The three most important kami, the \\"Three Precious Children\\" (‰∏âË≤¥Â≠ê mihashira no uzu no miko or sankishi) - the sun goddess Amaterasu ≈åmikami, the moon deity Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, and the impetuous god Susanoo-no-Mikoto - were born when Izanagi washed his left eye, his right eye, and his nose, respectively.Chamberlain (1882). Section X.‚ÄîThe Purification of the August Person.Phillipi (1969). pp. 68‚Äì70. Izanagi and Susanoo Izanagi divides the world among his three children: Amaterasu was allotted Takamagahara (È´òÂ§©Âéü, the \\"Plain of High Heaven\\"), Tsukuyomi the night, and Susanoo the seas.Chamberlain (1882). Section XI.‚ÄîInvestiture of the Three Deities; The Illustrious August Children. Susanoo did not perform his appointed task and instead kept crying and howling \\"until his beard eight hands long extended down over his chest,\\" causing the mountains to wither and the rivers to dry up. After saying to his father that he wished to go to his mother's land, Ne-no-Katasu-Kuni (Ê†πÂ†ÖÂ∑ûÂõΩ, the 'Land of Roots'), a furious Izanagi then expelled Susanoo \\"with a divine expulsion,\\" after which he disappears from the narrative.Chamberlain (1882). Section XII.‚ÄîThe Crying and Weeping of His Impetuous-Male-Augustness.Phillipi (1969). pp. 71‚Äì73. =In the Nihon Shoki= While the first generations of kami including Izanagi and Izanami are implied in the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki's main narrative to have manifested independent of each other, one variant cited in the Shoki instead describes them as the offspring of Aokashikine-no-Mikoto (ÈùíÊ©øÂüéÊ†πÂ∞ä), another name for the goddess Ayakashikone-no-Mikoto, of the sixth of the first seven generations of gods. Another variant meanwhile portrays Izanagi as the offspring of a deity named Awanagi-no-Mikoto (Ê≤´Ëï©Â∞ä) and the fifth-generation descendant of the primordial deity Kuninotokotachi-no-Mikoto. In the Shoki's main narrative, the couple first begets the following eight islands after performing the marriage ceremony (in the following order): *Awaji (Ê∑°Ë∑ØÊ¥≤), which \\"was reckoned as the placenta, and their minds took no pleasure in it\\" *≈åyamato-Toyoakitsushima (Â§ßÊó•Êú¨Ë±äÁßãÊ¥•Ê¥≤) *The double-named island of Iyo (‰ºäË±´‰∫åÂêçÊ¥≤) *Tsukushi (Á≠ëÁ¥´Ê¥≤) *Oki (ÂÑÑÂ≤êÊ¥≤) and Sado (‰ΩêÂ∫¶Ê¥≤), born as twins *Koshi (Ë∂äÊ¥≤), what is now known as the Hokuriku region *≈åshima (Â§ßÊ¥≤), identified with the island of Su≈ç-≈åshima in Yamaguchi Prefecture *Kibi-no-Kojima (ÂêâÂÇôÂ≠êÊ¥≤), identified with the Kojima Peninsula in southern Okayama Prefecture (formerly the province of Kibi) Both ≈åshima and Kibi-no-Kojima are not reckoned among the eight great islands in the Kojiki, instead being identified as being born after them. The other remaining islands, such as Tsushima (ÂØæÈ¶¨Â≥∂) and Iki (Â£±Â≤êÂ≥∂), are said to have been produced by the coagulation of the foam in sea water (or freshwater). Parallels Izanagi's visit to his wife Izanami in Yomi-no-kuni somewhat parallels the Greek Orpheus's visit to Eurydice in the underworld, but a more striking resemblance is his wife's inability to return after eating the food in hell, matched by Persephone of Greek myth.Although these are all coincidences it's still strange because Japan had not had any connection with the west at that time let alone Greece.

The band is credited for helping to shape the sound and style of Californian hardcore punk. The group gained national prominence after an infamous 1981 performance on Saturday Night Live. Frontman Lee Ving has been the band's only constant member. Since its formation, the band has gone through various lineup changes, and at one point even featured Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass. The classic FEAR lineup existed from 1978‚Äì1982, and was composed of Ving, guitarist Philo Cramer, bassist Derf Scratch and drummer Spit Stix. History =1970s= Fear was formed in 1977 by singer/guitarist Lee Ving and bassist Derf Scratch, who recruited guitarist Burt Good and drummer Johnny Backbeat. In 1978, Fear released the single \\"I Love Livin' in the City\\". Shortly after this, Good and Backbeat left the band and were replaced by Philo Cramer and Spit Stix. =1980s= Film director Penelope Spheeris met Ving and Stix while they were hanging handbills on telephone poles in Los Angeles on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. After a brief discussion, she asked if they wanted to be in a documentary about the Los Angeles punk scene, The Decline of Western Civilization (1981). In the film, Fear performed a set in which they baited members of the audience with personal attacks, sexist and homophobic slurs, and offbeat humor, inspiring some audience members to come on stage to fight them. At the time, Spheeris was married to Slash Records president Bob Biggs who, later that year, signed a recording deal with Fear. Spheeris's documentary brought the band to the attention of John Belushi, who lobbied successfully to get the band a spot as a musical guest on the 1981 Halloween episode of his former show Saturday Night Live. Belushi had originally offered Fear the soundtrack for his major motion picture Neighbors. The film's producers eventually forced Fear off the project, and Belushi got them the infamous SNL gig as compensation. The band's appearance included a group of slamdancers, among them Belushi, Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat (and later Fugazi), Tesco Vee of the Meatmen, Harley Flanagan and John Joseph of the Cro- Mags, and John Brannon of Negative Approach. The show's director originally wanted to prevent the dancers from participating, so Belushi offered to be in the episode if the dancers were allowed to stay. The end result was the shortening of Fear's appearance on TV. They started their second song by saying, \\"It's great to be in New Jersey\\", drawing boos from SNL's New York live audience. Fear played \\"I Don't Care About You\\", \\"Beef Bologna\\", \\"New York's Alright If You Like Saxophones\\", and started to play \\"Let's Have a War\\" when the telecast faded into commercial. The slamdancers left ripe pumpkin remains on the set. Cameras, a piano and other property were damaged. After their SNL appearance, which resulted in $20,000 in damage, some clubs chose not to hire the band. Fear also appeared in the 1981 rotoscope animated film American Pop, directed by Ralph Bakshi. Ving performed under the name Lee James Jude. Additionally that year, Josie Cotton released the hit song \\"Johnny Are You Queer\\". The song was based on Fear's song \\"Fetch me One More Beer\\", written by Philo Cramer and John Clancy.Destroy All Movies!!! The Complete Guide to Punks on Film, Zach Carlson / Bobby and Larson Paine, who were managing The Go-Gos, re-worked the song with new lyrics and gave it to them, but after a falling out forbid the band from playing it and gave it to Cotton. In several interviews Cotton has suggested that the songs title and was lifted from lyrics in the Fear song, though she has also stated that Fear's version of it went ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fuckin‚Äô queer‚Äù,, which is consistent with Fear's demo of the song. When Fear found out a variation of their song had become popular, a meeting regarding the publishing rights of the song was arranged between them and the Paines. The two sides decided the winner of a coin toss would get the publishing rights to the song, which the Paines won. In 1982, Fear released their debut album The Record. After touring in support of the album, Ving fired Scratch. Eric Feldman (of Captain Beefheart, Pere Ubu, and later PJ Harvey and Frank Black) briefly filled in on bass before he was replaced by Flea. Flea left the band and was replaced by Lorenzo Buhne. On July 3, 1983, Fear performed at the \\"Rock Against Reagan\\" protest concert at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. along with the Dead Kennedys, MDC, Toxic Reasons, the Crucifucks and others. In the summer of 1983 through early 1984, while Stix was touring Europe with Nina Hagen, Chuck Biscuits was supposed to replace him, but Stix returned and Biscuits never played any shows with Fear. With Ving producing, the band recorded their second album More Beer in 1985 in just two days, supposedly. However, according to a representative from Enigma Records, it took a full year, as quoted in a March 1986 issue of Spin. =1990s= Live...For the Record, a live album of a 1985 performance, was released in 1991. Shortly afterwards, bassist Will \\"Sluggo\\" MacGregor was hired. After 1991‚Äì93 North American tours, Fear disbanded. Cramer and Stix left the band, citing disputes with Ving over finances, his right wing beliefs, and his lack of empathy. For the next two years, Ving performed in Austin, Texas as Lee Ving's Army. This eventually became the new Fear lineup, including Ving backed by LVA members Sean Cruse (guitar), Scott Thunes (bass) and Andrew Jamiez (drums). In 1995, Fear released the Have Another Beer with Fear album, followed by American Beer (2000), which featured Ving and Jamiez along with new members Richard Presley and Mando Lopez. The album included new recordings of several previously unreleased older Fear songs, as well as some new compositions. Richard Presley and Mando Lopez then began playing with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal in the Breeders. =2000 ‚Äì present= Fear (with Ving as the only original member) performed in the annual Warped Tour in 2008, and at South by Southwest in 2012. A re-recording of 1982's The Record was released in late 2012. In 2018, the band reunited with Cramer and Stix, and added former AFI bassist Geoff Kresge and former Viva Hate guitarist Eric Razo.

The MSA group received input from both transceiver and equipment manufacturers during the definition process. XENPAK has been replaced by more compact devices providing the same functionality. History The XENPAK MSA was publicly announced on March 12, 2001 and the first revision of the document was publicly released on May 7, 2001. The most recent revision of the MSA, Issue 3.0, was published on September 18, 2002. The result covered all physical media dependent (PMD) types defined by the IEEE at that time for 802.3ae 10GbE. Although the XENPAK agreement received early support, its modules were thought to be overly large for high density applications. , vendors generally changed to use XFP modules for longer distances, and Enhanced small form-factor pluggable transceivers, known as SFP+ modules, for higher densities. The newer modules have a purely serial interface, compared to the four \\"lane\\" XAUI interface used in XENPAK. Description XENPAK modules were supplied for physical layer interfaces supporting multi-mode and single mode fiber optic cables and InfiniBand copper cables with connectors known as CX4. Transmission distances vary from to for fiber and up to on CX4 cable. Newer XENPAKs using the 10GBase-LX4 standard operated using multiple wavelengths on legacy multi-mode fibres at distances of up to , eliminating the need to reinstall cable in a building when upgrading certain 1 Gbit/s circuits to 10 Gbit/s. Replacement form factors The XENPAK form factor was initially supported by numerous network equipment manufacturers and module makers. However, advances in technology led to more compact form factors for 10 Gigabit Ethernet applications. Soon after the standard was introduced in 2001, two related standards emerged: XPAK and X2. These two standards have the same electrical interface as XENPAK (known as XAUI) but different mechanical properties. The XPAK group was announced on March 19, 2002, first published their specification on May 24, 2002, and version 2.3 on August 1, 2003. The X2 group was announced on July 22, 2002, and published their specification on February 13, 2003. Issue 3.0 of the XENPAK MSA was transferred to the Small Form Factor committee as document INF-8474 on September 18, 2002. The XENPAK MSA website existed through the end of 2008.  Use with modern optics  As of 2014, adapters are available which permit use of any modern SFP+ 10Gb optic in a XENPAK interface.

Biography  Dobson was born in Beijing, China. His maternal grandfather was Hiram Harrison Lowry, his mother was a musician, and his father taught zoology at a university. He and his parents moved to San Francisco, California in 1927. His father accepted a teaching position at Lowell High School and taught there until the 1950s. Dobson spent 23 years in a monastery, after which he became more active in promoting astronomy. = Time at the monastery = As a teen, Dobson became a ‚Äúbelligerent‚Äù atheist. He said: ‚ÄúI could see that these two notions cannot arise in the same being: ‚Äòdo unto others as you would that they do unto you‚Äô and ‚Äòif you're not a good boy, it's into hell for keeps.‚Äô... They must be spoofing us. So I became an atheist, a belligerent atheist. If anybody started a conversation about the subject, I was a belligerent atheist.‚ÄùJohn Dobson: Amateur Astronomy's Revolutionary Over time Dobson became interested in the universe and its workings. He earned a masters degree in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1943, working in E. O. Lawrence's lab. In 1944 he attended a lecture by a Vedantan swami. Dobson said the swami ‚Äúrevealed to him a world he had never seen.‚Äù That same year Dobson joined the Vedanta Society monastery in San Francisco, becoming a monk of the Ramakrishna Order. ‚ÄúOne of John's responsibilities at the monastery was to reconcile astronomy with the teachings of Vedanta. That job led him to build telescopes on the side. He took to wheeling them around outside the monastery, fascinating the neighbors who would congregate around him.‚Äù Dobson's interest in telescope building was in part to better understand the universe, and in part to inspire in others a curiosity about the cosmos. To this end, he often offered assistance and corresponded about his work with those outside the monastery. Telescope building was not part of the curriculum at the monastery, however, and much of his correspondence was written in code so as to attract less attention. For instance, a telescope was referred to as a \\"geranium\\", which is a type of flower. A \\"potted geranium\\" referred to a telescope in a tube and rocker, while a \\"geranium in bloom\\" referred to a telescope whose mirror was now aluminized. Eventually Dobson was given the option of ceasing his telescope building or leaving the order. He chose to stop building telescopes so that he could remain at the monastery. But one day another monk wrongly accused him as missing and reported him to the head swami. Dobson was expelled in 1967. However, he maintains that the accusation was not the true reason for his expulsion. The true reason, he contends, was a result of a misunderstanding. The head swami read a paper that was presumably written by Dobson that contradicted the reconciliation of science with Vedanta, and the swami thought Dobson had rejected the swami's teachings. = Amateur astronomy = Having left the order in 1967, Dobson in 1968 co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers, an amateur astronomy organization that aims to popularize astronomy among people on the street, along with Bruce Sams and Jeffery Roloff. Sams had built a large telescope but because at the time he was only 12, he was not eligible for membership in the only local club ‚Äì the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers ‚Äì thus the ‚ÄúSan Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers‚Äù was begun. It was also at this time that Dobson's simple form of telescope ‚Äì which came to be known as the Dobsonian ‚Äì became well known after he started teaching classes to the public on how to make your own telescope. He was later asked to speak at the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood, and continued to spend two months there each year teaching telescope and cosmology classes. He spent two more months at his home in San Francisco, and spent most of the rest of each year traveling as an invited guest for astronomical societies, where he spoke about telescope building, sidewalk astronomy, and his views of cosmology and the scientific establishment. =Amateur cosmology= Dobson claimed the Big Bang model did not hold up to scrutiny, and instead advocated a non-standard cosmology; a ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù Steady State model of the universe, where matter in the universe is forever expanding outward, but matter also ‚Äúrecycles‚Äù over time via quantum tunneling. In an essay entitled, ‚ÄúOrigins‚Äù, Dobson also argued that such a universe could allow for life to be ubiquitous and ever-present. =Honours= In 2004, the Crater Lake Institute presented Dobson with its Annual Award for Excellence in Public Service for pioneering sidewalk astronomy in the national parks and forests, ‚Äúwhere curious minds and dark skies collide‚Äù. In 2005, the Smithsonian magazine listed Dobson as among 35 individuals who have made a major difference during the lifetime of that periodical. = Death = Dobson died while in Providence / Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California on January 15, 2014. He was 98.  Promotion of astronomy  = The Dobsonian telescope = amateur-built Dobsonian style telescopes on display at Stellafane in the early 1980s Dobson was most notable for being the originator and promoter of a design for a large, portable, low-cost reflecting telescope, the \\"Dobsonian telescope\\". The design is a very simple, low cost alt-azimuth mounted Newtonian telescope that employs common materials such as plywood, formica, PVC closet flanges, cardboard construction tubes, recycled porthole glass, and indoor-outdoor carpet. This type of simplified altazimuth mount is also commonly referred to in amateur astronomical circles as a \\"Dobsonian mount\\". Using this construction method makes the typical Dobsonian telescope large, portable, inexpensive, very stable, and easy to manufacture. The design revolutionizedJack Hitt, Bunch of Amateurs: A Search for the American Character, Crown/Archetype - 2012, pages 231-234Antony Cooke, Visual Astronomy Under Dark Skies: A New Approach to Observing Deep Space, Springer Science & Business Media - 2006, page 156Neil English, Classic Telescopes: A Guide to Collecting, Restoring, and Using Telescopes of Yesteryear, Springer Science & Business Media - 2012, page 127 the sheer size of telescopes available to amateur astronomers with the optical diameters unheard of before their appearance.James Mullaney, A Buyer's and User's Guide to Astronomical Telescopes and Binocular, page 38 The design is named after Dobson because he is credited for being the first person to have combined all these construction techniques in a single telescope design. He was reluctant to take credit, however, pointing out that he built it that way because it was all he needed. In his own words, he jokes that he was \\"too retarded\\" to build a more sophisticated telescope with an equatorial telescope mount. With its simplicity of construction and use, the Dobsonian has become a very popular design today, particularly for large amateur telescopes. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, in Washington D.C., uses a Dobsonian telescope in the museum's public observatory alongside other solar telescopes. = Sidewalk astronomers = Dobson co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers in coordination with two other people, having cheaply constructed several telescopes that were easy to use, including a telescope that was built for approximately US$300. Rather than have regular meetings, the organization simply set up telescopes on the sidewalk during clear evenings, offering to show and explain the night sky to people passing by. The telescope which Dobson used most frequently on the streets of San Francisco, was a classic 9-inch aperture Dobsonian, with a typical porthole glass mirror of outstanding optical quality, made by one of his own students in a mirror making class. This telescope was portable enough that it could be taken by Dobson from his residence to many busy street corners in San Francisco, using the city's Muni public transportation. Appropriately nicknamed \\"Tumbleweed\\", since it traveled randomly about to numerous public observing locations, this 9-inch telescope is now shared among many astronomy clubs and organizations around the world, allowing people everywhere to observe the heavens with such an iconic instrument, just as Dobson would have wished. Unexpectedly, the Sidewalk Astronomers were invited to the Riverside Telescope Makers' meeting in 1969. The Dobsonian telescope brought by the Sidewalk Astronomers was unconventional, because most telescopes at such meetings tended to be smaller, on equatorial mounts, and designed for astrophotography rather than optical viewing. Surprisingly and controversially at the time, Dobson's telescope tied in first prize for best optics. It was also awarded the runner up prize for mechanics, despite the mechanics of the telescope and its mount being relatively simple. Sidewalk Astronomers has since become a prominent organization, recognized for its taking of astronomy to the public via \\"sidewalk astronomy\\". The current organization has members throughout the world, and continues to promote public service astronomy by putting telescopes on street corners in urban areas. Members of the organization also visit national parks giving slide show presentations, providing telescope viewing, and explaining the universe.  Publications by John Dobson  Dobson's first book was published with a unique plywood binding. Dobson authored the 1991 book How and Why to Make a User-Friendly Sidewalk Telescope () with editor Norman Sperling. This book helped popularize what came to be known as the Dobsonian mount, and treats the \\"why\\" as importantly as the \\"how\\". It covers Dobson's background and his philosophy on astronomy and the universe, and his belief in the importance of popular access to astronomy for proper appreciation of the universe. Dobson has also published Beyond Space and Time (2004) () and The Moon is New (2008) ().  John Dobson in the media  Dobson's life and ideas are the subject of the 2005 documentary A Sidewalk Astronomer. He was also featured in the PBS series The Astronomers, and appeared twice on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Dobson also appears as one of the speakers in Universe: The Cosmology Quest, a documentary about non-standard cosmological theories.

It is marketed as a prescription drug under the trade name Xenical by Roche in most countries, and is sold over-the-counter as AlliStylized with a lowercase a on the packaging, and a bar over the i (that is, \\"allƒ´\\"), but capitalized conventionally in the manual. by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom and the United States. Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a lipase inhibitor, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use in conjunction with a healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet. Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug. The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting weight loss is definite but modest. Pooled data from clinical trials suggest that people given orlistat in addition to lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about more than those not taking the drug over the course of a year. Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure and appears to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, whether from the weight loss itself or other effects. It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do. Benefits aside, however, orlistat is noted for its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes referred to as treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it has been listed as an S3 medication‚Äîavailable from a pharmacist without a prescription‚Äîsince 2000.  Medical uses  Orlistat is used for the treatment of obesity. The amount of weight loss achieved with orlistat varies. In one-year clinical trials, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body fat. After orlistat was stopped, a significant number of subjects regained weight‚Äîup to 35% of the weight they had lost. It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do. Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively).  Contraindications  Orlistat is contraindicated in: * Malabsorption * Hypersensitivity to orlistat * Reduced gallbladder function (e.g. after cholecystectomy) * Pregnancy and breastfeeding * Anorexia and Bulimia * Use caution with: obstructed bile duct, impaired liver function, and pancreatic disease  Side effects  The primary side effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools with excessive flatus due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), fecal incontinence and frequent or urgent bowel movements. To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere in the region of 15 grams per meal. The manual for Alli makes it clear that orlistat treatment involves aversion therapy, encouraging the user to associate eating fat with unpleasant treatment effects.From page 12 of the Alli Companion Guide, 2007 edition: \\"They can be an incentive to keep from eating more fat than you really intend to.\\" Side effects are most severe when beginning therapy and may decrease in frequency with time; For label updates see FDA index page for NDA 020766 It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated with long-term compliance with a low-fat diet. Free full text with registration On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication. An analysis of over 900 orlistat users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury was more than triple that of non-users. The putative mechanism for this effect is postulated to be excessive oxalate absorption from the gut and its subsequent deposition in the kidney, with excessive oxalate absorption being a known consequence of fat malabsorption. An April 2013 study published in the British Medical Journal looked at 94,695 patients receiving orlistat in the UK between 1999 and 2011. This study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded: :The incidence of acute liver injury was higher in the periods both immediately before and immediately after the start of orlistat treatment. This suggests that the observed increased risks of liver injury linked to the start of treatment may reflect changes in health status associated with the decision to begin treatment rather than any causal effect of the drug. = Long-term = Despite a higher incidence of breast cancer amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data‚Äîthe analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat‚Äîa two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them. There is evidence from an in vitro study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, can induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth. Fecal fat excretion promotes colon carcinogenesis. In 2006 the results of 30-day study were published indicating that orlistat at a dosage of 200 mg/kg chow administered to rats consuming a high-fat chow and receiving two 25 mg/kg doses of the potent carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine produced significantly higher numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) colon lesions than did the carcinogen plus high-fat chow without orlistat. ACF lesions are believed to be one of the earliest precursors of colon cancer. = Precautions = Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited by the use of orlistat. A multivitamin tablet containing vitamins A, D, E, K, and beta-carotene should be taken once a day, at bedtime, when using orlistat. = Interactions = Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of ciclosporin (also known as \\"cyclosporin\\" or \\"cyclosporine\\", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an immunosuppressive drug frequently used to prevent transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly. Orlistat can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. The MHRA has recently suggested that Orlistat could theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medications.  Mechanism of action  Crystallographic structure of human fatty acid synthase (rainbow color, N-terminus = blue, C-terminus = red) inhibited by orlistat (space-filling model; carbon = grey, oxygen = red, nitrogen = blue).; Orlistat works by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination is through the feces. Orlistat was also recently found to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of Orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets. Orlistat also shows potential activity against the Trypanosoma brucei parasite. At the standard prescription dose of 120 mg three times daily, before meals, orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed. Higher doses do not produce more potent effects.  Legal status  Packaging of orlistat (Xenical) 120 mg capsules, as sold in Canada Orlistat has historically been available by prescription only, and this situation continues in Canada. In Australia, the European Union, and the United States, certain formulations of orlistat have been approved for sale without a prescription. = Australia and New Zealand = In Australia and New Zealand, orlistat has been available as a \\"Pharmacist Only Medicine since 2000. In 2007 the Committee decided to keep orlistat as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to- consumer Xenical advertising, stating this \\"increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to consumers...this in turn had the potential to result in inappropriate patterns of use\\". = United States = On 23 January 2006, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 11 to 3 to recommend the approval of an OTC formulation of orlistat, to be marketed under the name alli by GlaxoSmithKline. Approval was granted on 7 February 2007, and alli became the first weight loss drug officially sanctioned by the U.S. government for over-the-counter use. Consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen opposed over-the-counter approval for orlistat. Alli became available in the U.S. in June 2007. It is sold as 60 mg capsules‚Äîhalf the dosage of prescription orlistat. = European Union = On 21 January 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted approval for the sale of orlistat without a prescription. = Generic formulations = U.S. patent protection for Xenical, originally to end on 18 June 2004, was extended by five years (until 2009) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The extension was granted on 20 July 2002, and expired on 18 June 2009.\\"Drug Patent Expirations in June 2009\\". DrugPatentWatch.com, in Generic orlistat is available in Iran under the brand Venustat manufactured by Aburaihan Pharmaceutical co., in India, under the brands Orlean (Eris), Vyfat, Olistat, Obelit, Orlica and Reeshape. In Russia, orlistat is available under the brand names Xenical (Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche), Orsoten/Orsoten Slim (KRKA d. d.) and Xenalten (OBL-Pharm). In Austria, orlistat is available under the brand name Slimox. In Malaysia, orlistat is available under the brand name Cuvarlix and is marketed by Pharmaniaga. Society and culture =Cost= At times, such as in spring 2012, orlistat has come into short supply, with consequent price increases because of nonavailability of one of the drug's components. = Counterfeit products = In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert stating that some counterfeit versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no orlistat, and instead contain the weight-loss drug sibutramine. The concentration of sibutramine in these counterfeit products is at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.

It celebrated the recovery of France after the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War. Construction Aerial view of the Exposition Universelle of 1878 The buildings and the fairgrounds were somewhat unfinished on opening day, as political complications had prevented the French government from paying much attention to the exhibition until six months before it was due to open. However, efforts made in April were prodigious, and by 1 June, a month after the formal opening, the exhibition was finally completed. F√©lix du Temple's 1874 Monoplane was displayed at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. This exposition was on a far larger scale than any previously held anywhere in the world. It covered over , the main building in the Champ de Mars and the hill of Chaillot, occupying . The Gare du Champ de Mars was rebuilt with four tracks to receive rail traffic occasioned by the exposition. The Pont d'I√©na linked the two exhibition sites along the central all√©e. The French exhibits filled one-half of the entire space, with the remaining exhibition space divided among the other nations of the world. Germany was the only major country which was not represented, but there were a few German paintings being exhibited. The United States exhibition was headed by a series of commissioners, which included Pierce M. B. Young, a former United States Congressman and major general in the Confederate States Army and Floyd Perry Baker, a Kansas newspaper editor, as well as other generals, politicians, and celebrities. The United Kingdom, British India, Canada, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Cape Colony and some of the British crown colonies occupied nearly one-third of the space set aside for nations outside France. The United Kingdom's expenditure was defrayed out of the consolidated revenue; each British colony defrayed its own expenses. The UK display was under the control of a royal commission, of which the Prince of Wales was president. Displays Souvenir ribbon from the exhibition The completed head of the Statue of Liberty was showcased. The exhibition of fine arts and new machinery was on a very large and comprehensive scale, and the Avenue des Nations, a street 730 metres in length, was devoted to examples of the domestic architecture of nearly every country in Europe and several in Asia, Africa and America. The \\"Gallery of Machines\\" was a metallic building, an industrial showcase of low transverse arches, designed by the engineer Henri de Dion (1828‚Äì78). Many of the buildings and statues were made of staff, a low-cost temporary building material invented in Paris in 1876, which consisted of jute fiber, plaster of Paris, and cement. On the northern bank of the Seine River, an elaborate palace was constructed for the exhibition at the tip of the Place du Trocad√©ro. It was a handsome \\"Moorish\\" structure, with towers 76 metres in height and flanked by two galleries. It had a Cavaill√©-Coll organ which was inaugurated with a concert in which Charles Marie Widor played the premiere of his Symphony for Organ No. 6. The building stood until 1937. On 30 June 1878, the completed head of the Statue of Liberty was showcased in the garden of the Trocad√©ro palace, while other pieces were on display in the Champs de Mars. Among the many inventions on display was Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. Electric arc lighting had been installed all along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, and in June, a switch was thrown and the area was lit by electric Yablochkov arc lamps, powered by Z√©nobe Gramme dynamos. Thomas Edison had on display a megaphone and phonograph. International juries judged the various exhibits, awarding medals of gold, silver and bronze. One popular feature was a human zoo, called a \\"negro village\\", composed of 400 \\"indigenous people\\". And Augustin Mouchot's solar-powered engine converting solar energy into mechanical steam power, he won a Gold Medal in Class 54 for his works, most notably the production of ice using concentrated solar heat. Henry E. Steinway exhibited a grand piano which \\"attracted extraordinary attention\\". =Awards= * Gold award for painting: Jan Matejko, for The Hanging of the Sigismund Bell, Union of Lublin and Wac≈Çaw Wilczek. * Gold award for photography: Aim√© Dupont * Gold award for playing cards: New York Consolidated Card Company https://www.amusedbyjokersami.com/2020/08/my-new-york- consolidated-card-company.html https://www.wopc.co.uk/usa/nyccc/index Attendance Over 13 million people paid to attend the exposition, making it a financial success. The cost of the enterprise to the French government, which supplied all the construction and operating funds, was a little less than a million British Pounds, after allowing for the value of the permanent buildings and the Trocadero Palace, which were sold to the city of Paris. The total number of persons who visited Paris during the time the exhibition was open was 571,792, or 308,974 more than came to the French metropolis during 1877, and 46,021 in excess of the visitors during the previous exhibition of 1867. In addition to the general impetus given to French trade, the revenue from customs and duties from the foreign visitors increased by nearly three million sterling compared with the previous year. Concurrent with the exposition, a number of meetings and conferences were held to gain consensus on international standards. French writer Victor Hugo led the Congress for the Protection of Literary Property, which led to the eventual formulation of international copyright laws. Similarly, other meetings led to efforts to standardize the flow of mail from country to country. The International Congress for the Amelioration of the Condition of Blind People led to the worldwide adoption of the Braille System of touch-reading. In people thought Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's time travel novel El Anacron√≥pete starts with a lecture in the Exposition. Eoin Colfer's novel Airman begins with its protagonists (Conor Broekhart) birth at the Exposition. Artefacts The Paris firm of Gruel and Engelmann was known for its deluxe bookbindings. The Book of Hours is a Gothic Revival example, the celebrated Paris jeweler Alexis Falize (1811-1898) has created a relief showing the Adoration of the Magi, surrounded by fantastic animals derived from the amusing, marginal decoration found in some medieval manuscripts. The filigree and granular work is of exceptional quality. Since the binding does not contain a book, it may have been produced solely for the firm's display at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878.

The ship was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the American Civil War Battle of Antietam (Maryland). Antietam was commissioned in January 1945, too late to serve actively in World War II. After serving a short time in the Far East, she was decommissioned in 1949. She was soon recommissioned for Korean War service, and in that conflict earned two battle stars. In the early 1950s, she was redesignated an attack carrier (CVA) and then an antisubmarine warfare carrier (CVS). After the Korean War she spent the rest of her career operating in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. From 1957 until her deactivation, she was the Navy's training carrier, operating out of Florida. Antietam was fitted with a port sponson in 1952 to make her the world's first true angled-deck aircraft carrier. However, she received no major modernizations other than this, and thus throughout her career largely retained the classic appearance of a World War II Essex-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1963, and sold for scrap in 1974. Construction and commissioning Antietam was one of the \\"long-hull\\" Essex-class ships. The keel was laid on 15 March 1943 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The ship was launched on 20 August 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Millard E. Tydings, the wife of Senator Tydings of Maryland. Antietam was commissioned on 28 January 1945, with Captain James R. Tague in command. Service history =World War II and occupation of Japan= The aircraft carrier completed fitting out at Philadelphia until 2 March 1945, when she got underway for her shakedown cruise. The ship arrived in Hampton Roads on 5 March and conducted operations from Norfolk until 22 March, when she stood out of Chesapeake Bay bound for Trinidad in the British West Indies. At the conclusion of her shakedown cruise, Antietam returned to Philadelphia on 28 April to begin post-shakedown availability. She completed repairs on 19 May and departed Philadelphia that same day. After a three-day stop at Norfolk, the warship resumed her voyage to the Panama Canal in company with , , and . She arrived at Crist√≥bal on 31 May, transited the Panama Canal the next day, and continued her voyage up the coast to San Diego. She stopped at San Diego from 10‚Äì13 June before beginning the first leg of her transpacific voyage. Antietam arrived in Pearl Harbor on 19 June and remained in the Hawaiian Islands conducting training missions until 12 August. On that day, she shaped a course for the western Pacific. Three days out of Oahu, she received word of the Japanese capitulation and the consequent cessation of hostilities. Thus, by the time of her arrival in Eniwetok Atoll on 19 August, her mission changed from combat to occupation support duty. On 21 August, she exited the lagoon in company with and a screen of destroyers bound for Japan. En route, she suffered some internal damage which forced her into port at Apra Harbor, Guam, for inspections. The inspection party deemed the damage minimal; and the carrier remained operational, resuming her course on 27 August. By that time, however, her destination had been changed to the coast of the Asian mainland. She stopped at Okinawa between 30 August and 1 September, and arrived in Chinese waters near Shanghai the following day. The aircraft carrier remained in the Far East for a little more than three years. The Yellow Sea constituted her primary theater of operations while her air group provided support for the Allied occupation of North China, Manchuria, and Korea. During the latter stages of that assignment, her airmen conducted surveillance missions in that area as a result of the civil war in China between communist and nationalist factions which later resulted in the expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's forces from mainland China and the establishment of Mao Zedong's communist People's Republic of China. Throughout the period, however, she did depart the Yellow Sea on occasion for visits to Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and the Marianas. Early in 1949, she concluded her mission in the Orient and headed back to the United States for deactivation. She was decommissioned on 21 June 1949.Naval Cover Museum: Antietam (CVS 36) =Korean War= Antietam returning from Korea in March 1952 Antietam remained in reserve at Alameda, California, but after Communist forces from North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, she began reactivation preparations on 6 December and went back into commission on 17 January 1951, with Captain George J. Dufek in command. Initially, the carrier conducted shakedown training and carrier qualifications along the California coast, first out of Alameda and ‚Äì after 14 May ‚Äì out of San Diego. She made one voyage to Pearl Harbor and back to San Diego in July and August before departing the latter port on 8 September and heading for the Far East. Antietam arrived in the Far East later that fall and, by late November, began the only combat deployment of her career. During that tour, she made four cruises with Task Force 77 (TF 77), in the combat zone off the coast of the Korean peninsula. In between fighting assignments, she returned to Yokosuka, Japan. During each of those periods, her air group carried out a variety of missions in support of United Nations forces combating North Korean aggression. Those missions included combat air patrol, logistics interdiction, particularly against railroad and highway traffic, reconnaissance, antisubmarine patrols, and night heckler missions. From late November 1951 to mid-March 1952, Antietams air group flew nearly 6,000 sorties of all types. She returned to Yokosuka on 21 March 1952 at the conclusion of her fourth cruise with TF 77 to begin preparations for her voyage back to the United States. =Later years= Night carrier operations on Antietam The aircraft carrier returned home in April and rejoined the Pacific Reserve Fleet briefly. She was reactivated later that summer and, in August, transited the Panama Canal to join the Atlantic Fleet. In September, the warship entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations. In October, she was redesignated an attack aircraft carrier, CVA-36. In December 1952 Antietam emerged from the yard as the world's first carrier with a true angled flight deck. The principle had been tried on other carriers with lines painted on an axis deck. Antietams deck was based on a rudimentary sponson. The installation allowed for true angle deck tests, including arrested landings.Friedman, Norman U.S. Aircraft Carriers (1983) Naval Institute Press p.264 Trials with British and US units proved during trials to be superior to the usual fore-aft deck. She operated out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, until the beginning of 1955. During the intervening years, she participated in numerous fleet and independent ship's exercises. Detachment #39 from VC-4, NAS Atlantic City was sent out on the Antietam on June 9, 1953. The stated purpose was to show off the canted deck capabilities to the Royal Navy. There were two aircraft with pilots and 13 enlisted men. The two Douglas F3D Skyknights were piloted by Lt. Jg. Bruce B. Sheppard and Lt. Jg. Eric H. Steentofte. The enlisted radar operators were Aviation electronics technician third class (AT3) Ron Ames and AT3 Jim Abbott. In those days the Navy didn't have Radar Operators yet. They used enlisted radar techs to fly the right seat as radar operators. There were multiple flying days on the trip across. The pilots had a gunnery run and strafed the sea until the 20 mm guns jammed. Daily flights continued until arrival at Portsmouth. Two days of flight operation took place with all sorts of Royal Navy aircraft making touch and go's. The F3D's were used to give Royal Navy VIP's catapult shots and arrested landings. The VC-4 pilots were air lifted back to the states on July 3 and the F3D's were off loaded and flown back to Atlantic City from Rhode Island. After August 1953, during which time she was redesignated an Anti-submarine warfare carrier (ASW), CVS-36 Antietam concentrated up on honing her hunter/killer skills. Post-sea trials In January 1955, she embarked upon a voyage to the Mediterranean Sea where she served with the 6th Fleet until March. Resuming duty with the Atlantic Fleet ASW forces, she operated along the eastern seaboard until the fall of 1956. In October of that year, she cruised to the waters of the eastern Atlantic for NATO ASW exercises and goodwill visits to ports in Allied countries. She ran aground off Brest, France, on 22 October 1956, but was refloated undamaged. While the carrier was in Rotterdam, the Suez crisis broke out in the eastern Mediterranean. Antietam cut short her visit to the Netherlands and headed for the Mediterranean to bolster the 6th Fleet during the evacuation of American citizens from Alexandria, Egypt. At the end of that assignment, she conducted ASW training exercises with Italian naval officers embarked before returning to Quonset Point on 22 December. Sea Hawk on Antietam in 1953 After resuming operations along the eastern seaboard early in 1957, Antietam was assigned on 21 April 1957 to training duty with the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Mayport however, served as her home port because ships of her draft could not then enter port at Pensacola. For almost two years the aircraft carrier operated out of Mayport training new Navy pilots and conducting tests on new aviation equipment‚Äîmost noteworthy on the Bell automatic landing system during August 1958. She also participated in annual Naval Academy midshipmen cruises each summer. In January 1959, after the deepening of the channel into Pensacola had been completed, Antietams home port was changed from Mayport to Pensacola. For the remainder of her active career, the carrier operated out of Pensacola as an aviation training ship. The deck of the Antietam served as the launching pad for the stratospheric balloon flight of Commander Malcolm D. Ross and Lieutenant Commander Victor A. Prather, both of the United States Navy, on 4 May 1961. This flight set an absolute official altitude record for manned balloons of . The flight took place over the Gulf of Mexico. During recovery, Prather slipped from the rescue helicopter's lifting harness, fell into the ocean, and died from his injuries onboard Antietam. Commander Ross was successfully recovered. On two occasions, she provided humanitarian services to victims of hurricane damage. The first came in September 1961 when she rushed to the Texas coast to provide supplies and medical assistance to the victims of Hurricane Carla. The second came just over a month later when she carried medical supplies, doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel to British Honduras to help the victims of Hurricane Hattie. Otherwise, she spent the final four years of her naval career in routine naval aviation training duty out of Pensacola. On 23 October 1962, Antietam was relieved by sister ship as aviation training ship at Pensacola and was placed in commission, in reserve, on 7 January 1963. Berthed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she remained in reserve until May 1973 when her name was struck from the Navy List. On 28 February 1974, she was sold to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corp. for scrapping.

She was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the Battle of Lake Champlain in the War of 1812. Commissioned on 3 June 1945, Lake Champlain did not participate in World War II, but did serve as a transport, bringing troops home from Europe as part of Operation Magic Carpet. Like many of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, but was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s, and redesignated as an attack carrier (CVA). She participated in the Korean War but spent the rest of her career in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. In the late 1950s, she was redesignated as an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was the prime recovery ship for the first manned Project Mercury mission (Freedom 7), the second unmanned Gemini mission (Gemini 2), and for the third manned Gemini (Gemini 5) space mission. Lake Champlain had a unique modernization history. She was the only Essex-class ship to receive the SCB-27 conversion which was a rebuild of the superstructure, flight deck and other features but without also receiving the SCB-125 conversion which would have given her an angled flight deck and hurricane bow. Therefore, she had the distinction of being the last operational US aircraft carrier with an axial flight deck. Lake Champlain was decommissioned in 1966 and sold for scrap in 1972. Construction and commissioning Lake Champlain was one of the \\"long-hull\\" Essex-class ships. She was laid down in Drydock No. 8http://www.usgwarchives.net/va/portsmouth/shipyard/nnyblog7.htm at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 March 1943. The hull was launched from drydock on 2 November 1944. Lake Champlain commissioned on 3 June 1945 under the command of Captain Logan Ramsey.United Press, \\"Eighteenth Carrier of Essex Class Launched\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Monday 4 June 1945, Volume 51, page 2. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Warren Austin, wife of Senator Austin of Vermont. Service history =Operation Magic Carpet= USS Lake Champlain in August 1945 After shakedown and visits to New York and Philadelphia, Lake Champlain was assigned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty to repatriate US military personnel. She departed Norfolk for England on 14 October, and arrived at Southampton on the 19th where she embarked veterans and returned them to New York. She set a speed record, averaging 32.048 kn, for crossing the Atlantic on 26 November 1945 when she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, having completed a run from Gibraltar, a distance of 3360.3 nautical miles, in 4 days, 8 hours, 51 minutes. This record stood until surpassed by in the summer of 1952. Lake Champlain was laid up in the reserve fleet at Norfolk on 17 February 1947. =Korean War= Lake Champlain was needed again for the Korean War. In August 1950, she began her SCB-27A modernization program at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She recommissioned on 19 September 1952. A shakedown cruise in Cuban and Haitian waters lasted from 25 November to 25 December 1952. The carrier departed Mayport, Florida, for Korea on 26 April 1953 via the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and South China Sea. Lake Champlain became the largest ship to date to transit the Suez Canal. She moored at Yokosuka, Japan, on 9 June 1953. Lake Champlain in 1953‚Äì54. As flagship of Carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77), she sailed from Yokosuka on 11 June and arrived off western Korea on 14 June. The carrier's air group immediately launched sorties cratering runways; assaulting enemy troops; attacking trenches, bunkers, gun positions; and giving close air support to hard pressed ground forces. Her planes also escorted B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers on their way to enemy targets. Lake Champlain continued to strike at the enemy until the truce was signed on 27 July. Relieved by on 11 October, Lake Champlain headed toward the South China Sea arriving Singapore on 24 October. Bidding farewell to the Pacific Ocean on 27 October, she steamed toward home, touching at Colombo, Port Said, Cannes, and Lisbon before arriving Mayport, Florida, on 4 December 1953. =Postwar years= NATO, Middle East and reclassification In the years that followed, Lake Champlain made several cruises to the Mediterranean, participating with NATO forces. On 25 April 1957, in response to tensions between Jordan's king and parliament (see 1957 alleged Jordanian military coup attempt), she joined elements of her fleet in a high-speed run to the vicinity of Lebanon, where she backed King Hussein. King Hussein ended Jordan's constitutional democracy, dissolving political parties, dismissing municipal councils, censoring the press, imposing military curfew, and culling the military of dissenting elements. The tensions eased and Lake Champlain returned to Mayport on 27 July. Converted to an antisubmarine carrier and reclassified (CVS-39) on 1 August, Lake Champlain trained off the eastern seaboard to master her new role. Lake Champlain was near the island of Majorca when the Spanish city of Valencia was devastated by floods on the night of 14 October 1957. The American ambassador to Spain, John Davis Lodge, requested that Lake Champlain provide assistance for rescue operations. The ship's Chickasaw helicopters undertook numerous rescue missions, and the ship's crew fought in the \\"mud battle\\" that followed the disaster. She departed Bayonne, New Jersey, on 8 February 1958 for another Mediterranean cruise returning to Mayport, Florida, on 30 October. After a yard overhaul, she departed for the Mediterranean on 10 June and visited Spain, Denmark, and Scotland, before returning to Mayport on 9 August. The carrier operated off Florida and in the Caribbean until 15 June 1958, when she sailed on another Mediterranean cruise returning to her newly assigned home port, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 4 September. The carrier operated out of Quonset Point until 29 June 1960, when she made a midshipmen's cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia, returning on 12 August. Beginning on 7 February, she made a cruise to the Caribbean, returning on 2 March. Project Mercury HUS-1 helicopter from Lake Champlain recovering the Freedom 7 capsule Lake Champlain was selected as the prime recovery ship for America's first manned space flight. She sailed for the recovery area on 1 May, and was on station on 5 May when Commander Alan Shepard was recovered, along with his spacecraft Freedom 7, after splashdown some down range from Cape Canaveral. Helicopters from the carrier visually tracked the descent of the capsule and were over it two minutes after splashdown. They recovered Shepard and the Freedom 7 capsule, delivering them safely to Lake Champlains flight deck. During retrieval, the vessel was under the command of then-Captain Ralph Weymouth. There were some complications in retrieval, as the helicopters that were to retrieve Alan Shepard from the craft did not have the explosive squibs required to cut the Mercury craft's radio antenna. The Mercury craft's antenna was designed to help locate the craft if it landed out of visual tracking range. The antenna would have gotten in the way of retrieving Shepard from the craft if it had deployed; fortunately, it had a malfunction and was unable to deploy. Caribbean and Cuban blockade For the next year, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. In June 1962, she and her escorts embarked First and Third Class Regular NROTC Midshipmen for a summer training cruise from NAS Quonset Point to offshore training areas, Canadian Forces Base Halifax, Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, and Kingston, Jamaica, where she represented the US at the island's celebration of its independence on 3 August. The midshipmen acted as tour guides for visitors aboard and provided an honor guard ashore for then-VP Lyndon Johnson's speech in a local park. USS Lake Champlain as an anti-submarine carrier in 1960. On 24 October, Lake Champlain joined in a classic exercise of sea power ‚Äî the quarantine of Cuba, where the Soviet Union was constructing bases for offensive missiles. To block this grave threat, U.S. warships deployed throughout the western Atlantic, choking off the flow of military supplies to Cuba and enforcing American demands for the withdrawal of the Russian offensive missiles. After the American demands were substantially complied with, Lake Champlain sailed for home on 23 November via St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and arrived Quonset Point on 4 December 1962. For the next few months the carrier was in New England waters for operations and overhaul. In September 1963, while she was on a cruise to Guantanamo Bay, her training schedule was interrupted when she was ordered to Haiti to relieve distress caused by Hurricane Flora. Her helicopters located homeless victims and flew them food and medical supplies. North Atlantic and Project Gemini Lake Champlain returned to Quonset Point on 9 November for operations in New England waters. She visited Bermuda briefly in spring of 1964 and steamed to Spain in the fall for landings near Huelva. She sailed on 6 November from Barcelona for the United States, touched at Gibraltar and arrived at Quonset Point on 25 November. The first half of 1965 found Lake Champlain performing training duties and conducting exercises up and down the East Coast, and on January 19, 1965, was the recovery ship for the unmanned Gemini 2 mission. For FY 1966, the Navy proposed a modernization program for Lake Champlain. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara refused to authorize the proposal, citing the limited effectiveness of anti-submarine carriers. Lake Champlain completed her last major duty on 29 August 1965 when she served as the primary recovery ship for Gemini 5. Shortly afterward, she sailed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she commenced inactivation. She was decommissioned on 2 May 1966 and was laid up in the Reserve Fleet. The 24-year-old Lake Champlain was stricken from the Navy List on 1 December 1969, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 28 April 1972.

The ship was the first US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named after Valley Forge, the 1777‚Äì1778 winter encampment of General George Washington's Continental Army. Valley Forge was commissioned in November 1946, too late to serve in World War II, but saw extensive service in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. She was reclassified in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), then to an antisubmarine carrier (CVS), and finally to an amphibious assault ship (LPH), carrying helicopters and Marines. As a CVS she served in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She was the prime recovery vessel for an early unmanned Mercury space mission. After conversion to an LPH she served extensively in the Vietnam War. Valley Forge was awarded eight battle stars for Korean War service and nine for Vietnam War service, as well as three Navy Unit Commendations. Although she was extensively modified internally as part of her conversion to an amphibious assault ship, external modifications were minor, so throughout her career Valley Forge retained the classic appearance of a World War II Essex-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1970, and sold for scrap in 1971. Construction and Commissioning The citizens of the Philadelphia Area in 1945 bought over $76,000,000 worth of E Bonds during the Seventh War Loan Drive to pay for Valley Forge‚Äîequal to $ million today. School children of Philadelphia sold $7,769,351 of these bonds (). The ship was one of the \\"long-hull\\" , laid down on 7 September 1944 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Like all long-hull Essex-class ships, she was long overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the extreme and at the waterline. Her draft was at standard load and full load. As designed, her displacement was standard and full load. For propulsion, the ships in her class had eight Babcock & Wilcox boilers producing steam at and delivering . She used four Westinghouse geared turbines connected to four diameter propellers. She was design for a maximum speed of and a range of at . During sea trials, her engines produced and she attained . She carried of fuel oil and of aviation gasoline. For armament, she was originally equipped with a battery of twelve /38 caliber guns, eight mounts of four 40-mm Bofors guns and 46 20-mm Oerlikon cannon. She was protected by of armor on the hangar and protective decks while her belt armor was thick. Protective bulkheads had of armor. The conning tower had of Special Treatment Steel (STS) on the top and there was of STS on the sides of the pilot house. The steering gear had a deck. Her flight deck was and her hangar deck was by high. She was equipped with two elevators, each with a capacity of , two flight deck aircraft catapults, and the Mark IV arresting gear. She was designed to carry 36 fighter aircraft, 36 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers but this changed through her career as her mission and naval aircraft changed. Her design complement was 268 officers and 2363 men. By the end of the war, the Essex-class carriers had a complement of 3385 officers and men. Being one of the youngest Essex-class carriers, Valley Forge did not receive the SCB-27 or SCB-125 modifications that her older sisters received. She maintained the World War II-style straight flight deck throughout her life. Her armament was changed in 1954 with her conversion to an antisubmarine carrier CVS-45. Her 20 mm Oerlikon cannon were removed and she carried the original twelve /38 caliber guns and a total of 72 40 mm Bofors guns. She was launched on 18 November 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Vandegrift (n√©e Strode), wife of Alexander A. Vandegrift the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Valley Forge was commissioned on 3 November 1946, with Captain John W. Harris in command. As a commissioning gift, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presented Valley Forge with the finest State Silver Service ever presented to the Navy. The service was designed and made by Philadelphia silversmiths in 1904 and was originally placed aboard . The elaborate service was decorated in tradition with Neptune, sea horses and dolphins as well as historic scenes and personalities and a State seal. Service history =1947‚Äì1950= Following fitting out, on 16 Jan 1947 the first eleven aircraft landed on Valley Forge. A Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Commander H. H. Hirshey, the Commanding Officer of VF5B was the first to land on the new carrier. The next day, 96 aircraft and personnel from Air Group 5 were taken aboard. The carrier got underway on 24 January for shakedown training, which took her, via Naval Station Norfolk, to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, and the Panama Canal Zone. She completed the cruise on 18 March and returned to Philadelphia for post- shakedown overhaul. The ship left Philadelphia on 14 July, headed south, and transited the Panama Canal on 5 August and a message was sent to Commander Air Pacific (ComAirPac) - \\"USS Valley Forge reporting for duty\\". She arrived at her new home port, Naval Base San Diego on 14 August and joined the United States Pacific Fleet. Round the World Cruise Following the embarkation of Air Group 11 and intensive air and gunnery training in coastal waters, the aircraft carrier ‚Äì flying the flag of Rear Admiral Harold L. Martin, Commander of Task Force 38 (TF 38) ‚Äì got underway for Hawaii on 9 October. The task force devoted almost three months to training operations out of Naval Station Pearl Harbor before sailing for Australia on 16 January 1948. After a visit to Sydney, the American warships conducted exercises with units of the Royal Australian Navy and then steamed to Hong Kong. During a voyage from the British crown colony to Tsingtao, China, orders arrived directing the task force to return home via the Atlantic with her escorting destroyers. The ship continued the round-the-world trip with calls at Hong Kong, Singapore, and Trincomalee, Ceylon. On 21 March 1948 at 0800, she was at 18-43'N and 64-33'E - halfway around the world. She visited the Persian Gulf and anchored off the ARAMCO refinery in Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia as a gesture of goodwill from the American government. On 25 March, the ship's complement \\"manned the rail\\" for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and officers attended a banquet given by Crown Prince of Damman. Rounding the Arabian peninsula, she became the largest aircraft carrier and the longest ship at that time to transit the Suez Canal. On 6 April she joined with the Mediterranean Fleet carrier , cruisers , , , and six destroyers for three days of sea exercises. After a call at Gibraltar and then entering the Atlantic Ocean, she set a course to Bergen, Norway. On 29 April, she moored in Bergen after a trip through the treacherous fjords with snow squalls reducing visibility to less than 100 ft at times. The crew paraded through the main part of the city, causing concern, as this was the way the German occupation entered in World War II. On 1 May, a \\"Mayday\\" parade and celebration was held; unfortunately for the crew, all local pubs were closed. Air Group 11 flew in parade formation over the Capital City of Oslo, spelling the name of King Haakon VII. The ship was underway 4 May for Portsmouth, England; the historic base of the Royal Navy. After firing a 21-gun salute while passing the imposing , the ship was moored near , Admiral Nelson's flagship. The Commander of 6th Fleet authorized 72-hour staggered liberty pass for all hands. Underway 13 May to New York; on 22 May entered the Lower New York Bay. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Louis Denfield, who was instrumental in initiating the World cruise, was welcomed aboard for a visit. Underway 27 May for the Panama Canal, she arrived 11 June in San Diego Bay. In July 1948, new squadrons joined Valley Forge bringing with them the Navy's newly introduced aircraft, the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, and the Navy's first jet fighters, the McDonnell F2H Banshee and the Grumman F9F Panther. These squadrons gave new capabilities to the ship. Intensive air operations and additional training and exercises commenced with the new aircraft. =Korean War= Valley Forge deployed to the Far East, departing the west coast on 1 May 1950. While anchored in Hong Kong harbor on 25 June, the warship received the news that North Korean forces had attacked across the 38th parallel into South Korea. Departing Hong Kong the next day, the carrier steamed south to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, where she provisioned, fueled, and set her course for Okinawa. On 28 June, Valley Forge became flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet and formed Task Force 77 with cruiser and six destroyers. On 30 June, Task Force 77 rendezvoused with ships of the Royal Navy including the cruiser , the carrier , and two British destroyers, under the command of Rear Admiral Andrews, RN. The first carrier air strike of the Korean War was launched from Valley Forges flight deck on 3 July 1950. Successive waves of A-1 Skyraiders and F4U Corsairs struck the North Korean airfield at Pyongyang bombing hangars, fuel storages, parked aircraft, and railroad marshaling yards while F9F Panthers, flying top cover, downed two Yak-9s and damaged another. This was the world's first combat strike by jet aircraft. In spite of attempts by United Nations forces to stop the steady flow of North Korean infantry and armor, the North steadily pushed the South Koreans back into a tenuous defense perimeter around Pusan. On 18 September 1950, the American landing at Inchon outflanked the North Koreans while United Nations forces broke out of the perimeter to the south. After the landing at Inchon, the tide of battle changed and Korean, American, and other allied troops pushed northward and crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. Air Group 5 made numerous daily strikes against North Korean targets. Troop concentrations, defensive positions, and supply and communications lines were repeatedly bombed by the A-1 Skyraiders and the F9F Panthers and F4U Corsairs delivered rocket and cannon fire. Over 5,000 combat sorties delivered of bombs and rockets between 3 July and 19 November 1950. During this time, Valley Forge maintained a high operational record as she steamed up and down the coast of Korea, a distance equal to twice around the world. Second Deployment Returning to San Diego for overhaul, Valley Forge arrived on the west coast on 1 December, only to have sailing orders urgently direct her back to Korea. In the interim, between the carrier's leaving station and her planned overhaul, Chinese forces had entered the war, launching a powerful offensive which sent United Nations troops retreating back to the south. Accordingly, Valley Forge hurriedly embarked a new air group, about 100 planes and 10 helicopters; replenished, of provisions and stores and of ammunition were loaded in record time of three days; and sailed on 6 December for the Far East. Rendezvousing with Task Force 77 three days before Christmas of 1950, Valley Forge recommenced air strikes on the 23rd and continued for three months of concentrated air operations against the advancing Chinese and North Korean forces. The first offensive air operations consisting of close air support missions assisting soldiers and marines on the ground. F4U Corsair and A-1 Skyraider pilots struck at troop concentrations, supply dumps, bridges, gun emplacements and railroad equipment. The United Nation forces were able to move north again on the Korean Peninsula and up to the 38th parallel. During her second deployment, the ship launched some 2,580 sorties in which her planes delivered some of bombs. On 29 March the Valley Forge turned east and began her voyage back home again to San Diego, after spending almost ten continuous months in Korean waters, arriving at North Island on 7 April.Associated Press, \\"Flyingest Navy Pilots Return\\", ‚Äò'The Sun-Telegram'‚Äô, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 8 April 1951, Volume IV, Number 52, page 3. The ship, needing long-awaited yard repairs, sailed to Bremerton, Washington and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she underwent a major overhaul. Third Deployment Valley Forge returned to San Diego on 10 Aug 1951, ready for a new assignment with the Pacific Fleet. Air Group 1 embarked and she became the first U.S. carrier to return for a third Korean deployment. On 11 December, Valley Forge launched her first air strikes in railway interdiction - keep supplies from reaching enemy front lines. Rockets, cannon fire, and bombs from the ship's air group, and those of her sister ships also on station, hammered at North Korean railway targets ‚Äì lines, junctions, marshaling yards, and rolling stock. By June, Valley Forges Skyraiders, Corsairs, and Panthers had severed rail lines in at least 5,346 places. She returned to her homeport in San Diego on 3 July 1952. Fourth Deployment In October 1952, she was reclassified an attack carrier and redesignated CVA-45. Again, in October 1952 she stood out and headed for the Far East. She now had become the only U.S. carrier to return to the Korea combat zone four times. On 2 January 1953, she began the new year with strikes against Chinese supply dumps and troop billeting areas behind the stalemated front lines. While the propeller-driven Skyraiders and Corsairs delivered tons of bombs on their targets, the jet Panthers conducted flak-suppression missions using a combination of cannon fire and rockets to knock out troublesome enemy gun sites. This close teamwork between old and new style planes made possible regular strikes against Korea's eastern coastlines and close-support missions to aid embattled Marine or Army forces on the battle lines. Valley Forge air groups dropped some of bombs on the enemy before the ship left the Korean coast and returned to San Diego on 25 June 1953. =1954‚Äì1960= After a west-coast overhaul, Valley Forge was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet and reclassified ‚Äì this time to an antisubmarine warfare support carrier ‚Äì and redesignated CVS-45. She was refitted for her new duties at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and then rejoined the Fleet in January 1954. The carrier soon got underway to conduct exercises to develop and perfect the techniques and capabilities needed to carry out her new duties. Conducting local operations and antisubmarine warfare exercises, Valley Forge operated off the east coast through late 1960, varied by a visit to England and the eastern Atlantic for exercises late in 1954. Her operations during this period also included midshipman and reservists' training cruises and occasional visits to the Caribbean. Helicopter Landing Carrying out training operations out of Guantanamo Bay in 1957, Valley Forge accomplished an American naval \\"first\\" in October, when she embarked the ship's landing party and twin-engined HR2S-1 Mojave helicopters. Experimenting with the new concept of \\"vertical envelopment\\"; first pioneered by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines during the Suez Crisis in 1956; Valley Forges helicopters air-lifted the landing party to the beachhead and then returned them to the ship in the U.S. Navy's first ship-based air assault exercise. In March she again joined ships of the Amphibious Force for a major amphibious landing exercise, LANTPHIBEX 1-58. She off loaded nearly 1,400 Marines, landing them ashore from troop-carrying helicopters. Antisubmarine Warfare Task Group ALFA, formation portrait of the anti-submarine group's ships and aircraft, taken during 1959 exercises in the Atlantic. On 1 April 1958, Rear Admiral John S. Thach hoisted his two-star flag to the carrier's main as the ship became flagship of Task Group Alpha (TG Alpha). This group, built around Valley Forge, included eight destroyers, two submarines, and one squadron each of antisubmarine helicopters and airplanes; a detachment of airborne early warning airplanes, modified A-1 Skyraiders called \\"guppies\\" because of their bulging ventral Radomes; and a land-based Lockheed P-2 Neptune. A significant development in naval tactics, TG Alpha concentrated solely on developing and perfecting new devices and techniques for countering the potential menace of enemy submarines in an age of nuclear propulsion and deep-diving submersibles. Observing the New Year (1958‚Äì1959) at sea, the carrier was steaming in very heavy weather when she was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with a merchant ship. Heavy seas severely damaged the forward portion of the flight deck, requiring her to proceed to the New York Naval Shipyard for repairs. To ready her for service as quickly as possible, a corresponding section was taken from the flight deck of the inactive carrier , berthed at Bayonne, New Jersey. The damaged section was cut away from flight deck and the Franklin deck piece installed in its place. A bronze plaque was mounted on the newly replaced deck section to commemorate how the Franklin was damaged in action off Japan in April 1945. Operation Skyhook Valley Forge remained engaged in operations with TG Alpha through the early fall of 1959, when she then entered the New York Naval Shipyard for repairs. The ship returned to sea on 21 January 1960, bound for maneuvers in the Caribbean. During her ensuing operations, the carrier served as the launching platform for Operation Skyhook. This widely publicized scientific experiment involved the launching of three of the largest balloons ever fabricated, carrying devices to measure and record primary cosmic ray emissions at an altitude of between above the Earth's surface. Following a deployment in the eastern Mediterranean Valley Forge returned to Norfolk to resume local operations on 30 August, continuing antisubmarine exercises as flagship of TG Alpha through the fall of 1960. Mercury Program On 19 December, the carrier acted as the primary recovery ship for the Mercury- Redstone 1A unmanned space capsule, the first flight of the Redstone rocket as part of Project Mercury. Her helicopters retrieved the capsule, launched from Cape Canaveral, after its successful 15-minute flight and splashdown. Two days later off Cape Hatteras, in response to an SOS, Valley Forge sped to the aid of the tanker SS Pine Ridge, which had broken in two during a storm. While the survivors of the stricken ship clung to the after half of the tanker, the carrier's helicopters shuttled back and forth to pick up the men in distress. Soon, all 28 survivors were safe on board Valley Forge. =1961‚Äì1964= Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 6 March 1961 for overhaul and modification to an amphibious assault ship, Valley Forge was reclassified as LPH-8 on 1 July 1961 and, soon thereafter, began refresher training in the Caribbean. She returned to Hampton Roads in September and trained in the Virginia capes area with newly embarked, troop-carrying helicopters. In October, the ship ‚Äì as a part of the Atlantic Fleet's ready amphibious force ‚Äì proceeded south to waters off Hispaniola and stood by from 21‚Äì25 October and from 18‚Äì29 November to be ready to evacuate any American nationals from the Dominican Republic of needed during the struggle for power in the months following the assassination of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo. After returning home late in the year, Valley Forge sailed from Norfolk on 6 January 1962, bound for Long Beach and duty with the Pacific Fleet. At the end of three months of training off the west coast, the amphibious assault ship steamed westward for duty in the Far East with the United States Seventh Fleet. With the flag of the Commander, Ready Amphibious Task Group, 7th Fleet at her main, Valley Forge closed the coast of Indochina under orders to put ashore her embarked Marines. In Laos, communist Pathet Lao forces had renewed their assault on the Royal Laotian Government and the latter requested President John F. Kennedy to land troops to avert a feared, full-scale communist invasion of the country. The amphibious assault ship airlifted her Marines into the country on 17 May and, when the crisis had abated a few weeks later, carried them out again in July. For the remainder of 1962, the ship operated in the Far East before returning to the west coast of the United States to spend the first half of 1963 in amphibious exercises off the coast of California and in the Hawaiian Islands. Valley Forge entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 1 July 1963 for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul, including the installation of improved electronics and facilities for transporting and handling troops and troop helicopters. Putting to sea again on 27 January 1964, the newly modernized assault ship rejoined the fleet and, following local operations and training, departed Long Beach for another WestPac deployment. She stopped at Pearl Harbor and Okinawa, en route to Hong Kong, and then steamed to Taiwan. In June, she joined ships of other SEATO navies in amphibious exercises and then visited the Philippines, where in July she was awarded the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\". =Vietnam War= Valley Forge in 1964 On 2 August 1964, North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Valley Forge then spent 57 days at sea off the Vietnamese coast in readiness to land its Marines if required. Returning to Long Beach on 5 November, Valley Forge made two round-trip voyages to Okinawa carrying marines and aircraft before commencing a WestPac deployment in the South China Sea in late 1965. With a Marine landing force embarked and flying the flag of Commander, Amphibious Squadron 3, Valley Forge conducted intensive training exercises in the Philippines while preparing for service in Vietnam. In mid-November, the amphibious assault ship stood by in reserve during Operation Blue Marlin and then airlifted its marines ashore for Operation Dagger Thrust and Operation Harvest Moon before spending the Christmas season in Okinawa. After embarking a fresh Marine battalion and a medium transport helicopter squadron, it sailed for South Vietnam on 3 January 1966. Following pauses at Subic Bay and Chu Lai, Valley Forge arrived off the Vietnamese coast on 27 January and, two days later, launched its landing forces to take part in Operation Double Eagle. Remaining on station off the coast, the ship provided logistic and medical support with inbound helicopters supplying the men ashore and outbound helicopters evacuating casualties for medical treatment back on the ship. Reembarking its landing team on 17 February, Valley Forge proceeded northward, while its Marines rested. The second phase of \\"Double Eagle\\" commenced two days later, and the ship's Marines again went ashore via helicopter to attack enemy concentrations. By 26 February, the operation had drawn to a close, and Valley Forge reembarked its Marines and sailed for Subic Bay. Following a round trip to ƒê√† N·∫µng, the carrier steamed back to the west coast for an overhaul and local training along the California coast before again deploying to WestPac. Upon its return to Vietnamese waters, the ship took part in operations off ƒê√† N·∫µng before it again returned to the United States at the end of the year 1966. After undergoing a major overhaul and conducting training off the west coast, Valley Forge returned to the Far East again in November 1967 and took part in Operation Fortress Ridge, launched on 21 December. Air-landing its troops at a point just south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the ship provided continual supply and medical evacuation (Medevac) services for this \\"search and destroy\\" operation aimed at eliminating People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units which threatened American and South Vietnamese troops. The completion of this operation on the day before Christmas 1967 did not mark the end of Valley Forges operations for this year, however, as it was again in action during Operation Badger Tooth, near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã in northern South Vietnam. Upkeep at ƒê√† N·∫µng preceded its deployment to its new station off ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, where it provided her necessary resupply and MedEvac support for Allied troops operating against PAVN forces. Operation Badger Catch, commencing on 23 January 1968 and extending through 18 February, supported the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base, at the mouth of the Th·∫°ch H√£n River south of the DMZ, before the ship set course for Subic Bay and much-needed maintenance. Valley Forge in 1968 Subsequently, returning to Vietnam, Valley Forge operated as \\"Helo Haven\\" for Marine helicopter units whose shore bases had come under attack by PAVN ground and artillery fire. During Operation Badger Catch II, from 6 March ‚Äì 14 April, Marine helicopters landed on board the carrier while their land bases were being cleared of PAVN troops. Following a routine refit at Subic Bay, the ship took part in Operation Badger Catch III from 28 April ‚Äì 3 June. It then moved to ƒê√† N·∫µng and prepared for Operation Swift Saber which took place from 7‚Äì14 June. Landing Exercise Hilltop XX occupied the ship early in July. Then Valley Forge transferred its Marines and helicopters to and headed home via Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor. She reached Long Beach on 3 August. Following five months on the west coast which included local operations and an overhaul, the amphibious assault ship returned to the Far East for the last time departing Long Beach on 30 January 1969. At San Diego, it embarked a cargo of Marine Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters for delivery to transport squadrons in Vietnam. The ship stopped at Pearl Harbor and paused near Guam while one of its helicopters carried a stricken crewman ashore for urgent surgery. It loaded special landing-force equipment at Subic Bay and embarked the Commander, Special Landing Forces Bravo and a squadron of Marine Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight transport helicopters. On 10 March, the carrier began operating in support of Operation Defiant Measure, steaming off ƒê√† N·∫µng as its helicopters flew missions \\"on the beach\\". This was completed by 18 March, and Valley Forge debarked its helicopters before steaming to Subic Bay for upkeep. After its return to ƒê√† N·∫µng on 3 May, the ship reembarked its helicopters as well as part of a battalion landing team of Marines who had been taking part in fighting ashore. The carrier continued to operate in the ƒê√† N·∫µng area during the weeks that followed, its helicopters flying frequent support missions, and its Marines preparing for further combat landings. During late May and early June, Valley Forge received visits from Secretary of the Navy John Chafee and Vice Admiral William F. Bringle, Commander 7th Fleet. It offloaded its Marines at ƒê√† N·∫µng on 10 June and embarked a battalion landing team for transportation to Okinawa, where it arrived on 16 June. The landing team conducted amphibious exercises with Valley Forge for 11 days and boarded the ship for a voyage to Subic Bay where they continued the training process. Valley Forge returned to the ƒê√† N·∫µng area on 8 July and resumed flying helicopter support for Marine ground forces in the northern I Corps area. The ship took evasive action to avoid an approaching typhoon and then began preparations for an amphibious operation. Operation Brave Armada began on 24 July with a helicopter-borne assault on suspected Vi·ªát C·ªông and PAVN positions in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. Valley Forge remained in the Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i‚ÄìChu Lai area to support this attack until its completion on 7 August. It then steamed to ƒê√† N·∫µng to debark its Marines. General Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., the Commandant of the Marine Corps, visited Valley Forge that same day. The ship sailed for Okinawa on 13 August arriving four days later and debarking its helicopter squadron before getting underway again to evade another typhoon. It proceeded to Hong Kong, and on 22 August, received a message announcing its forthcoming inactivation. It returned to ƒê√† N·∫µng on 3 September to load material for shipment to the United States and sailed that evening for U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka for three days of upkeep before leaving the Far East. Decommissioning Valley Forge in Subic Bay during February 1969 Valley Forge got underway from Yokosuka on 11 September 1969 and anchored at Long Beach on 22 September. After leave and upkeep, she offloaded ammunition and equipment at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach and Naval Base San Diego. The ship returned to Long Beach on 31 October to prepare for decommissioning. This process continued through the new year; and on 15 January 1970, Valley Forge was placed out of commission. Her name was struck from the Navy List on the same day. After the failure of attempts to raise funds for using the ship as a museum, she was sold on 29 October 1971 to the Nicolai Joffre Corporation, of Beverly Hills, California, for scrap. Awards Valley Forge was awarded eight battle stars for Korean War service and nine for Vietnam War service, as well as three Navy Unit Commendations. Silent Running film location While at Long Beach, from 14‚Äì28 February 1971, the interior of the aircraft carrier was used as a shooting location for filming the 1972 science fiction film Silent Running. The central location of the film is a long space-bound cargo freighter, carrying six large geodesic domes, under which the last forests of an environmentally-devastated Earth are kept. The producers of the film were searching for pre-existing locations which could represent the cargo deck, control rooms, and living quarters of a fictional \\"space freighter.\\" Building sets on Hollywood sound stages would have been prohibitively expensive, so in order to minimize the impact on the film's minimal budget, various large interior locations were investigated, including warehouses, cargo ships, and oil tankers. After contacting the United States Navy with a query about the use of aircraft carriers, the producers were directed to several decommissioned Essex-class carriers awaiting scrapping at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, including the USS Valley Forge, and fellow carriers and . The type of location proved to be perfect for the film, the Valley Forge was selected, and a deal was struck with the Navy. In honor of the filming location, the space freighter of the film was christened Valley Forge. The carrier's hangar deck was featured in the film as a cargo hold, which was repainted and filled with polystyrene modules representing futuristic cargo containers. Her flight command area was heavily modified to represent the control room and living quarters of the fictional space ship crew. Bulkheads were cut out and replaced with wider passageways to allow for camera and actor movement. Set pieces, computer consoles, and various props were moved in to dress the ship as the space freighter. The production crew was allowed to do anything they wanted with the ship, as long as no metal was removed. All power and water had to be imported, as the crew was not allowed to use ship power. Filming was hampered by the tight confines of the carrier, necessitating several innovations in the filming process. Eight months after filming wrapped, Valley Forge was sold for scrap in October 1971. In fiction USS Valley Forge can be seen in the Belgian comic Buck Danny, created by Jean-Michel Charlier and Victor Hubinon. The pilot lands on her for the first time in the thirteenth episode, \\"A Plane Has Not Returned\\" (1954), and remains based on her for several following episodes.

She was launched on 5 September 1945, after the end of World War II, and sponsored by the wife of the Governor of Kentucky. During her career, Philippine Sea served first in the Atlantic Ocean and saw several deployments to the Mediterranean Sea as well as a trip to Antarctica as a part of Operation Highjump. Sent to the Korean Peninsula at the outbreak of the Korean War, she sent aircraft in support of United Nations ground troops, first during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and then during the Inchon Landings and the Second Battle of Seoul. She subsequently supported UN troops during the surprise Chinese attack and the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. Philippine Sea saw three tours to Korea during the war, receiving nine battle stars for her service. For the remainder of her service, she operated primarily out of San Diego and San Francisco, seeing several deployments to the Far East and being redesignated an anti-submarine warfare carrier. She was decommissioned on 28 December 1958 and sold for scrap in 1970. Construction Philippine Sea was the last of the 24 ships to be completed, among the largest and most numerous capital ships produced for World War II. CV-47 was ordered simultaneously to and in June 1943. Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers aboard Philippine Sea during her cruise in the Mediterranean in 1948. The ship was one of the \\"long-hull\\" designs of the class, which had begun production after March 1943. This \\"long- hull\\" variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a \\"clipper\\" form. The increased rake and flare provided deck space for two quadruple mounts; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire. Of the Essex-class ships laid down after 1942, only followed the original \\"short-hull\\" design. The later ships have been variously referred to as the \\"long-bow units\\", the \\"long-hull group\\", or the \\"Ticonderoga class\\". However, the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long-hull and short-hull members of the Essex class, and applied postwar refits and upgrades to both groups equally. The ship was powered by eight 600 psi Babcock & Wilcox boilers, and Westinghouse geared steam turbines that developed 150,000 shaft horsepower that turned four propellers. Like other Essex-class carriers, she had a maximum speed of . The ship's cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000. Like other \\"long-hull\\" Essex-class carriers, Philippine Sea had a displacement of . She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The ship was powered by steam turbines with a designed range of . While Essex-class carriers typically had a designed maximum speed of , Philippine Sea only made on sea trials. The ship had a total crew complement of 3,310. Like other Essex-class ships, she was armed with twelve 38-caliber 5-inch (127 mm) dual purpose guns arrayed in four twin and four single mountings, as well as 8 quadruple Bofors 40 mm guns and a variable number of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Unlike her sisters, however, Philippine Sea substituted additional Bofors guns for the Oerlikons with forty-four guns arrayed in 10 quadruple and two double mounts. The keel of CV-47 was laid down 19 August 1944 at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Massachusetts. Originally, the ship was to be named in honor of the Wright brothers, but following the 19 June 1944 Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Navy decided that the ship be named after the battle, and on 13 February 1945, she was renamed. Construction on the ship continued throughout the summer of 1945, but Philippine Sea was not completed at the time of V-E Day. The ship was launched on 5 September 1945, only days after V-J Day and the end of World War II. She was christened by the wife of Governor of Kentucky Albert \\"Happy\\" Chandler.  Service history  Philippine Sea commissioned on 11 May 1946, when Rear Admiral Morton Deyo placed the ship under the command of Captain Delbert Strother Cornwell at the Boston Navy Yard in South Boston, Massachusetts. The ship remained drydocked at the yard for two weeks before sailing for Naval Air Station Quonset Point on 13 June. However, a shortage of men following the post-World War II demobilization forced her to remain at reduced operational status until 23 September when she embarked for sea trials. Returning from trials on 27 September, the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 20, which flew two squadrons of Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft as well as a squadron each of Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and Grumman TBM-3E Avenger torpedo bombers, about 90 aircraft total. She left port 30 September and commenced training en route to Norfolk, Virginia. CVG-20 Commander Robert M. Milner made the first takeoff from the carrier on 1 October aboard a Bearcat. Philippine Sea departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard 12 October for Cuban waters where she conducted an abbreviated shakedown cruise and training exercises for CVG-20's Grumman F8F Bearcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers until 20 November. Following these trials, Philippine Sea was assigned to Operation Highjump. She returned to Quonset and disembarked CVG-20 before sailing for Boston for repairs and alterations. She then headed to Norfolk where Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd boarded her and she took on six Douglas R4D-5 Skytrain transports, two Stinson OY-1 Sentinel liaison aircraft, and a Sikorsky HO3S-1 helicopter along with cargo, spare parts, skis and Task Force 68 personnel. She left Norfolk 29 December and stood out of Hampton Roads 2 January 1947 en route to Antarctica. Philippine Sea passed through the Panama Canal 8 January and cleared Balboa by 10 January. By 12 January the ship had crossed the equator in an elaborate ceremony, but on 22 January its HO3S-1 was lost due to pilot error, though the crew was recovered. Two days later, it met the remaining ships of Task Force 68. The ship arrived on station on 29 January, from Little America, and launched its R4Ds in the next few days to explore the Antarctic. Commander William M. Hawkes and Byrd both disembarked from Philippine Sea aboard the aircraft to begin their expedition. After her aircraft departed, Philippine Sea returned to Quonset, passing through Balboa again on 22 February and arriving back in port on 27 February. Philippine Sea at alt=A color photo of an aircraft carrier at sea from a distance In late March, the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 9, which flew two squadrons of Gruman F8F Bearcats and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters as well as a squadron each of SB2C Helldivers and TBM Avengers, and a detachment of HO3S helicopters for a total of about 100 aircraft. She completed her shakedown cruise at Guantanamo Bay until late May. She continued sea trials in the area until 1 July when she arrived at Gravesend Bay, New Jersey, for refit. She was refitted for most of the year at New York Naval Shipyard and Bayonne, New Jersey through 15 November 1947 before conducting trials and training around Quonset and Guantanamo Bay through February 1948. That month, she became flagship of Carrier Division Four led by Rear Admiral Ralph E. Jennings, who established his command aboard her on 4 February. On 20 February she departed for her first deployment in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman's 6th Fleet. Here she logged 8,534 flight hours, including 85 hours of night operations. She returned to Quonset 26 June and for repairs to her catapult machinery. She spent the remainder of the year as a part of the Operational Development Force testing new carrier aircraft doctrine, and her pilots logged 750 hours in 670 carrier controlled approach tests and 314 successful landings. On 22 October she was sent to the North Atlantic to conduct cold-weather landing tests and tested problem landing scenarios along the Arctic Circle until 23 November 1948. alt=A black and white photo of an aircraft carrier and a battleship in the background. In January 1949, Philippine Sea returned to Carrier Division Four under Rear Admiral Joseph J. Clark and embarked Carrier Air Group 7 for another tour in the Mediterranean, which had a similar fighter complement. She sailed 4 January with the aircraft carrier and supporting ships. There, she conducted joint exercises with carriers of the British fleet. She returned in late May and began an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. On 18 August, Captain Raymond R. \\"Raoul\\" Waller was assigned as her commanding officer.USS Philippine Sea Commanding Officers http://www.navsource.org/archives/02/47co.htm That fall, the ship returned to the Caribbean to shake down with its new upgrades, this time with Carrier Air Group 1. For the rest of the year, she continued fleet exercises in the North Atlantic and testing for new jet engine powered fighter aircraft to test their abilities to operate on aircraft carriers. Operating again from her base at Quonset Point, Philippine Sea spent early 1950 qualifying new carrier pilots. During February and most of March, she took part in more fleet exercises throughout the Atlantic. During April and May 1950 she conducted demonstration cruises for guests of the Secretary of the Navy, the Armed Forces Industrial College, Air War College, and the Armed Forces Staff College. On 24 May 1950, Philippine Sea sailed from Norfolk through the Panama Canal, arriving at her new home port of San Diego to join the Pacific Fleet. She was replaced in the Atlantic Fleet by . She was scheduled to begin a tour in the Far East in October 1950 before she was called to combat duty. = Korean War = alt=An aircraft carrier tied to two smaller ships while moving. With the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, Philippine Sea was ordered to Naval Base Pearl Harbor. She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 5 July with Carrier Air Group 11 embarked, flying four squadrons of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The ship departed for Japan on 24 July. Leaving Pearl Harbor, Philippine Sea sailed at full speed for the Western Pacific, reaching Okinawa on 4 August. During this time, she took command of Carrier Division One. She was the third aircraft carrier to arrive in Korea, as her sister ship as well as had arrived in July. By the time Philippine Sea arrived in Korea, the UN forces had established superiority in the air and sea. AD-4 Skyraider takes off from Philippine Sea for a sortie to Korea in the fall of 1950.alt=A propeller- driven aircraft prepared to take off aboard an aircraft carrier deck. Philippine Sea arrived in Korean waters on 1 August, and became flagship of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She immediately began launching air strikes against strategic targets, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People's Army. Her first strikes were against Iri, Mokpo, and Kunsan. The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but the intensity of the battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines. They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, Philippine Sea was in action continuously. She was put in a rotation of continuous action with Valley Forge to assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times. Following the beginning of The Great Naktong Offensive on 31 August, the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter. The ship sent sorties to defend Masan during the Battle of Masan, in spite of being from the area. The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks. With the other carriers of Task Force 77, Philippine Sea targeted rail and communication centers around North Korean-controlled Seoul to Wonsan in September. The strikes were part of a deception plan to draw North Korean attention away from the UN force massing for an attack on Inchon. Stationed in the Yellow Sea, she sent numerous air attacks on Inchon and Wolmi-do in preparation for Operation Chromite. The day of the operation, 15 September, Philippine Sea dispatched planes far inland to destroy North Korean positions and prevent reinforcements from countering the Inchon landings. Following the initial assault, she continued to provide close air support for the thrust inland to recapture Seoul. During this time, she was joined by . They were part of a massive invasion force of some 230 ships and hundreds of aircraft. Grumman F9F-2 Panther after landing blind. F9F-2 Miracle Landing On 17 September 1950 a pair of Grumman F9F-2 Panthers launched from the deck of Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.http://www.historynet.com/miracle-landing-off-korea.htm Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield turned out to be little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River.Aviation History magazine March 2014 page 54 Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from \\"passengers\\" on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20 mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to \\"clothesline\\" low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 secondshttp://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/g430000/g439862l.htm Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship and with the help of LSO Lt.j.g.\\"Les\\" Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion. F9F Panther fighters aboard Philippine Sea during a snow storm off the Korean Peninsula in November 1950. Air Group 2 in formation aboard Philippine Sea after the carrier's return from its first tour in Korea in early 1951. In November 1950 when China surprised the United Nations ground troops with an unexpected counterattack from the Yalu River by the People's Liberation Army, Philippine Sea planes saw heavy action. The US Navy had sent Valley Forge and several other ships away from Korea, expecting the conflict to end, and so the unprepared forces remaining in the area were heavily engaged. Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu River, the four carriers' Panthers, Skyraiders and Corsairs provided close air support for the trapped X Corps at Chosin Reservoir. Though the increasingly cold weather proved a problem for Philippine Sea, the ship continued to support the troops as they tried to evacuate from the reservoir and then cleared the path for their retreat to Hungnam. The carriers provided support with hundreds of aircraft sorties as 150,000 UN troops and civilians were evacuated, and then destroyed the port. During this support, Valley Forge and Philippine Sea were tightly clustered with and and commanders worried that they would be a target for air attack by North Korean MiG-15 fighters, prompting a large screen of 32 destroyers. For the rest of 1950 and early 1951, she launched numerous attacks against Chinese forces around the 38th Parallel hoping to slow their advance as UN troops retreated. With only brief stops for repair and rest, the carrier continued numerous sorties against Chinese targets. On 25 February, command of Task Force 77 was transferred to Valley Forge. During this time, the cold weather hampered operations and blizzards occasionally shut them down completely. Putting into Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan, in late March 1951 for repair and refit, Philippine Sea exchanged Air Group 11 for Carrier Air Group 2 from Valley Forge, a group which consisted mostly of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The same date as the transfer on 28 March, Philippine Sea became flagship of Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, the commander of the 7th Fleet. Returning to the Sea of Japan in April, Philippine Sea led Task Force 77 as well as other ships of the 7th Fleet through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea. From the Formosa Strait, planes flew in parades over Formosa as part of a show of support for the newly formed nation of Taiwan, in an effort to boost morale of the nation. She steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to UN forces throughout early 1951 as they faced repeated offensives by the Chinese. alt=A black and white photo of a large aircraft carrier with aircraft filling its deck. Philippine Sea completed her first deployment to Korea and arrived at San Francisco on 9 June 1951. It conducted refits, repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued for the remainder of the year. On 19 December, she was the site of a test for an emergency nuclear weapon assembly, the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship. The ship departed from San Diego on 31 December 1951. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952, Philippine Sea continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea, arriving 20 January 1952 with Carrier Air Group 11, which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair, about 100 aircraft. During this tour, the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized, and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets, including the 23 June attack on the Sui-ho Dam in conjunction with Boxer, Princeton, and , and sending aircraft against targets in Pyongyang. Philippine Sea returned to San Diego in August 1952. Her designation was changed to CVA, denoting an \\"attack aircraft carrier\\" in October. With five more Corsair squadrons of Carrier Air Group 9 embarked, she began a third cruise to the Far East early in December 1952 with about 100 aircraft. In this third tour in Korea, Philippine Sea focused primarily on interdiction attacks against rail and communication lines in North Korea, hoping to limit supplies to the front lines. The North Korean offensive, begun at the same time truce talks began at Panmunjom, marked the beginning of a series of \\"round the clock\\" air sorties designed to weaken North Korean and Chinese front line troops and support UN troops when under attack. This mission continued until an armistice was signed in the summer of 1953, resulting in the de jure cessation of open warfare. =Post-Korea= Following the end of her tour in Korea, the ship arrived in Alameda Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, on 14 August 1953 to offload Air Group 9, then entered drydock at Hunters Point in San Francisco for overhaul. On 9 January 1954, Philippine Sea once more began training off the coast of San Diego. She then steamed west on 12 March, for her fourth tour in the Far East. She operated out of U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay near Olongapo, The Philippines. She was part of Carrier Division 3 and operated alongside around French Indochina. A fleet review at Long Beach, California, in 1956. Philippine Sea moored alongside and . As an anti-submarine carrier, her complement consists of numerous helicopters. The most significant event of the tour occurred in late July 1954. Chinese airplanes had shot down a Douglas DC-4 passenger aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific Airways near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast. The Chinese military had believed it to be a Taiwanese military airplane. Philippine Sea was ordered into the area as part of a search mission to recover some of the 19 on board. While engaged in the search mission, a flight of the ship's Douglas AD Skyraiders was attacked by two Chinese fighter aircraft. The Skyraiders returned fire and shot down the airplanes. Later this came to be known unofficially as the \\"Hainan Incident\\". Following this duty, the ship sailed for Hawaii, where she was used as a prop in the movie Mister Roberts. The ship returned to San Diego on 18 November.Associated Press, ‚ÄúParade of Navy Ships to Bring Thousands Home From Pacific,‚Äù San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 19 November 1954, Volume LXI, Number 69, page 4. Remaining in the area for four months, Philippine Sea conducted several training operations off the California coast. She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 en route to Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan for most of 1955, with Air Task Group 2 consisting of VF-123, VF-143 and VA-55, VF-123 flying the F9F-2 Panther jet fighter-bomber, VF-143 flying the Grumman F9F-6 Cougar jet fighter, and VA-55 flying the AD-6 Skyraider propellor attack bomber. During this time, she made trips to Hong Kong, Keelung and Formosa. On 23 November, she was redesignated as a CVS, or an anti-submarine warfare carrier. Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen S2F Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955. Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for upkeep, and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of southern California. In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations. In March 1957, she sailed for the western Pacific on a sixth tour to the area with the HSS-1s and S2Fs of VS-21, VS-23, and VS-37. She was there for two months before returning to San Diego and resuming training missions off the west coast in summer 1957. In November 1957, she found some debris of Pan Am Flight 7, an airline flight that disappeared en route to Hawaii. In January 1958, she steamed west on her last 7th Fleet deployment. Remaining six months, she returned to San Diego on 15 July and commenced inactivation. She was decommissioned 28 December 1958 and berthed with the United States Reserve Fleet at Long Beach, California. She was redesignated AVT-11, an auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship, on 15 May 1959. After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 December 1969 and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971 to Zidell Explorations Corporation in Portland, Oregon. Philippine Sea received nine battle stars for Korean War service. During her career, she logged 82,000 launches, including 33,575 catapult shots, and 82,813 landings. In April 1987, a new was launched, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser. An organization was also formed of veterans who had served aboard the ship, the Philippine Sea Association.

The music was composed by Philippe Gentil and the lyrics were written by Jean-Georges Prosper. The anthem is short and briefly describes the luscious landscape of Mauritius. It also mentions the qualities of its people: peace, justice, and liberty. The national anthem is composed in English and was first played during the Independence Day of 12 March 1968. The Labour Party ruled Mauritius from the time of independence in 1968 to 1982. The opposing Mauritian Militant Movement won the 1982 election. The party decided to establish Mauritian Creole as the national language and wanted to sing the national anthem in Creole during the 15th Independence Day on 15 March 1983. The move was sternly opposed by the alliance partners; the party lost power in 1983. Background Mauritius was a British Colony from 1810 and became an independent state on 12 March 1968, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Mauritius, represented as head of state by the Governor-General. The last governor, Sir John Shaw Rennie, served as the first governor-general until 27 August 1968. A Competition was held to choose the best anthem and Jean Georges Prosper, a popular poet won the competition and \\"Motherland\\" was chosen as the anthem. The music was later composed by police band musician Philippe Gentil. During the announcement of independence, the flag of the United Kingdom was lowered by Lieutenant D.E. Wenn from the British side, and the flag of Mauritius was hoisted by Inspector Palmyre of the Special Mobile Force (SMF) from the Mauritian side. \\"God Save the Queen\\", the anthem of Britain was played for the last time, while \\"Motherland\\" was played for the first time. It was followed by firing of 31 salvos in the harbour and a loud cheer from the crowd. Anthem > Glory to thee, Motherland O Motherland of mine. Sweet is thy beauty, Sweet > is thy fragrance, Around thee we gather As one people, As one nation, In > peace, justice and liberty. Beloved Country, May God bless thee For ever and > ever.

Pays bien-aim√©, Que Dieu > te b√©nisse Pour toujours et √† jamais. Aftermath Critics consider that the national anthem failed to inspire the people during not so prosperous times of the economy when communalism and casteism made headway. There is a strong criticism in sections of media that though the anthem states unity as the prime strength of the nation, the nation stands divided even after 40 years of independence. Unity described as the strength of the nation as quoted as \\"as one people as one nation\\" is also posted as a challenge the country faces at the face of globalization. The harmony and cultural mix of different religious communities of the country are also not seen united in the nation. The unrest during 1969 clashes between Muslims and Creoles and the football tournaments till 1980 conducted on community basis are commonly quoted to show the indifference.

Background and education The fifth son of Henry Vansittart (died 1770), the Governor of Bengal, Vansittart was born in Bloomsbury, Middlesex, and raised in Bray, Berkshire. Educated at Christ Church, Oxford, he took his degree in 1787, and was called to the bar at Lincolns Inn. From the early 1770s he was living with his mother at 60 Crooms Hill, Greenwich. Political career Vansittart began his public career by writing pamphlets in defence of the administration of William Pitt, especially on its financial side, and in May 1796 became Member of Parliament for Hastings, retaining his seat until July 1802, when he was returned for Old Sarum. In February 1801 he was sent on a diplomatic errand to Copenhagen, and shortly after his return was appointed joint Secretary to the Treasury, a position which he retained until the resignation of Henry Addington's ministry in April 1804. Owing to the influence of his friend, the Duke of Cumberland, he became Chief Secretary for Ireland under Pitt in January 1805, resigning his office in the following September. With Addington, now Viscount Sidmouth, he joined the government of Charles James Fox and Lord Grenville as Secretary to the Treasury in February 1806, leaving office with Sidmouth just before the fall of the ministry in March 1807. During these and the next few years Vansittart's reputation as a financier was gradually rising. In 1809 he proposed and carried without opposition in the House of Commons thirty-eight resolutions on financial questions, and only his loyalty to Sidmouth prevented him from joining the cabinet of Spencer Perceval as Chancellor of the Exchequer in October 1809. He opposed an early resumption of cash payments in 1811, and became Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Earl of Liverpool succeeded Perceval in May 1812. Having forsaken Old Sarum, he had represented Helston from November 1806 to June 1812; and after being member for East Grinstead for a few weeks, was returned for Harwich in October 1812.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  When Vansittart became Chancellor of the Exchequer the country was burdened with heavy taxation and an enormous debt. Nevertheless, the continuance of the Napoleonic Wars compelled him to increase the customs duties and other taxes, and in 1813 he introduced a complicated scheme for dealing with the sinking fund. In 1816, after the conclusion of peace, a large decrease in taxation was generally desired, and there was an outcry when the Chancellor proposed only to reduce, not to abolish, the property or income tax. The abolition of this tax, however, was carried in parliament, and Vansittart was also obliged to remit the extra tax on malt, meeting a large deficiency principally by borrowing. He devoted considerable attention to effecting real or supposed economies with regard to the national debt. He carried an elaborate scheme for handing over the payment of naval and military pensions to contractors, who would be paid a fixed annual sum for forty-five years; but no one was found willing to undertake this contract, although a modified plan on the same lines was afterwards adopted. Vansittart became very unpopular in the country, and he resigned his office in December 1822. His system of finance was severely criticised by William Huskisson, Tierney, Brougham, Hume and Ricardo. On his resignation Liverpool offered Vansittart the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Accepting this offer in February 1823, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Bexley, of Bexley in the County of Kent, in March, and granted a pension of ¬£3000 a year. He resigned in January 1828. In the House of Lords, Bexley took very little part in public business, although he introduced the Spitalfields Weavers Bill in 1823, and voted for Catholic Emancipation in 1824. He took a good deal of interest in the British and Foreign Bible Mission, the Church Missionary Society and kindred bodies, funded Kenyon college and seminary on the US western frontier (the seminary is now named Bexley Hall in his honour) and assisted in founding King's College London.Bexley and Coburn Halls at Kenyon College website. Retrieved on 8 September 2006. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1822. He was also one of the Vice-Presidents of the American Colonization Society, whose aim was to repatriate African freedmen in the United States to the African continent.The African Repository, American Colonization Society, 1842, Volumes 18‚Äì19, p. 54 Family Lord Bexley married the Hon.

He withdrew from public life in the spring of 1809 to take her on rest cures at Malvern and Torquay.Vansittart, Nicholas, first Baron Bexley (1766‚Äì1851), politician, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Background Spring Rice was born into a notable Anglo-Irish family, which owned large estates in Munster.Joseph Jackson Howard, 'Spring', '‚ÄôThe Visitation of Suffolk'‚Äô (Whittaker and Co, 1866), 165‚Äì206. He was one of the three children of Stephen Edward Rice (d.1831), of Mount Trenchard House, and Catherine Spring, daughter and heiress of Thomas Spring of Ballycrispin and Castlemaine, County Kerry, a descendant of the Suffolk Spring family.Read this book A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies by John Burke He was a great grandson of Sir Stephen Rice (1637‚Äì1715), Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and a leading Jacobite Sir Maurice FitzGerald, 14th Knight of Kerry.David Henry Burton, Cecil Spring Rice: A Diplomat's Life (Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1990), 21. His only married sister, Mary, was the mother of the Catholic converts Aubrey Thomas de Vere, poet, and the Liberal Member of Parliament, Sir Stephen de Vere, 4th Baronet. Spring Rice's grandfather, Edward, had converted the family from Roman Catholicism to the Anglican Church of Ireland, to save his estate from passing in gavelkind. Spring Rice was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later studied law at Lincoln's Inn, but was not called to the Bar. His family was politically well-connected, both in Ireland and Great Britain, and he was encouraged to stand for Parliament by his father-in-law, Lord Limerick. Political career Spring Rice first stood for election in Limerick City in 1818 but was defeated by the Tory incumbent, John Vereker, by 300 votes. He won the seat in 1820 and entered the House of Commons. He positioned himself as a moderate unionist reformer who opposed the radical nationalist politics of Daniel O'Connell, and became known for his expertise on Irish and economic affairs. In 1824 he led the committee which established the Ordnance Survey in Ireland.Rachel Hewitt, 'Ensign of Empire', Map of a Nation: A Biography Of The Ordnance Survey (Granta Books, 7 July 2011) Spring Rice's fluent debating style in the Commons brought him to the attention of leading Whigs and he came under the patronage of the Marquess of Lansdowne. As a result, Spring Rice was made Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department under George Canning and Lord Goderich in 1827, with responsibility for Irish affairs. This required Spring Rice to accept deferral of Catholic emancipation, a policy which he strongly supported.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/rice- thomas-1790-1866 Spring Rice then served as joint Secretary to the Treasury from 1830 to 1834 under Lord Grey. Following the Reform Act 1832, he was elected to represent Cambridge from 1832 to 1839. In June 1834, Grey appointed Spring Rice Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, with a seat in the cabinet, a post he retained when Lord Melbourne became Prime Minister in July. A strong and vocal unionist throughout his life, Spring Rice led the Parliamentary opposition to Daniel O'Connell's 1834 attempt to repeal the Acts of Union 1800.'Rice, Thomas Spring, Lord Monteagle', in A Compendium of Irish Biography (1878) In a six-hour speech in the House of Commons on 23 April 1834 he suggested that Ireland should be renamed 'West Britain'.http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=26179&back;= In the Commons, Spring Rice also championed causes such as the worldwide abolition of slavery and the introduction of state-supported education. The Whig government fell in November 1834, after which Spring Rice attempted to be elected Speaker of the House of Commons in early 1835. When the Whigs returned to power under Melbourne in April 1835, Spring Rice was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Chancellor, Spring Rice had to deal with crop failures, a depression and rebellion in North America, all of which created large deficits and put considerable strain on the government. His Church Rate Bill of 1837 was quickly abandoned and his attempt to revise the charter of the Bank of Ireland ended in humiliation. Spring Rice, unhappy as Chancellor, again tried to be elected as Speaker, but failed. He was a dogmatic figure, described by Lord Melbourne as \\"too much given to details and possessed of no broad views\\".Dictionary of National Biography ‚Äì Spring Rice Upon his departure from office in 1839, Spring Rice had become a scapegoat for the government's many problems. That same year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Monteagle of Brandon, in the County of Kerry, a title intended earlier for his ancestor Sir Stephen Rice. Lord Monteagle of Brandon was also Comptroller General of the Exchequer from 1835 to 1865, despite Lord Howick's initial opposition to the maintenance of the office. Monteagle differed from the government regarding the exchequer control over the treasury, and the abolition of the old exchequer was already determined upon when he died. From 1839 he largely retired from public life, although he occasionally spoke in the House of Lords on matters generally relating to government finance and Ireland. He vehemently opposed John Russell, 1st Earl Russell's policy regarding the Irish famine, giving a speech in the Lords in which he said the government had \\"degraded our people, and you, English, now shrink from your responsibilities.\\" Outside Parliament In addition to his political career, Spring Rice was a commissioner of the state paper office, a trustee of the National Gallery and a member of the senate of the University of London and of the Queen's University of Ireland. Between 1845 and 1847, he was President of the Royal Statistical Society. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Geological Society. In May 1832 he became a member of James Mill's Political Economy Club. Spring Rice was well regarded in Limerick, where he was seen as a compassionate landlord and a good politician. An advocate of traditional Whiggism, he strongly believed in ensuring society was protected from conflict between the upper and lower classes.R. Brent, 'Liberal Anglican politics: whiggery, religion, and reform, 1830‚Äì1841' (1987) Although a pious Anglican, his support for Catholic emancipation won him the favour of many Irishmen, most of whom were Roman Catholic. He led the campaign for better county government in Ireland at a time when many Irish nationalists were indifferent to the cause.Mark Callanan, Justin F. Keogan, Local Government in Ireland: Inside Out (Institute of Public Administration, 1 January 2003), 16. During the Great Famine of the 1840s, Spring Rice responded to the plight of his tenants with benevolence. The ameliorative measures he implemented on his estates almost bankrupted the family and only the dowry from his second marriage saved his financial situation. A monument in honour of him still stands in the People's Park in Limerick. Even so, Spring Rice's reputation in Ireland is not entirely favourable. In a book regarding assisted emigration from Ireland (a process in which a landlord paid for their tenants' passage to the United States or Australia), Moran has suggested that Spring Rice was engaged in the practice. In 1838, he is recorded as having 'helped' a boat load of his tenants depart for North America, thereby allowing himself the use of their land. However, Spring Rice is also recorded as having been in support of state-assisted emigration across the British Isles, suggesting that his motivation was not necessarily selfish.Spring Rice, Thomas (1790‚Äì1866), of Mount Trenchard, nr.

He was just 21 at the time, and this marriage prematurely ended his university career. It produced five sons and three daughters: *Hon. Theodosia Alicia Ellen Frances Charlotte Spring Rice (died 2 January 1891), married Sir Henry Taylor in 1839. *Hon.

He was High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1837. *Hon. Charles William Thomas Spring Rice (10 Jan 1819 ‚Äì 13 July 1870), married Elizabeth Marshall in 1855. He was Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. *Hon. Edmund Henry Francis Louis Spring Rice (31 Mar 1821 ‚Äì 16 January 1887), married Margaret Little in 1870. *Hon.

After his first wife's death in 1839, Monteagle married secondly Marianne, daughter of the Leeds industrialist John Marshall, in 1841. This union brought much needed money into the family, allowing Spring Rice to maintain his Mount Trenchard estate in Ireland and a London house. Upon Lord Monteagle of Brandon's death in February 1866, aged 75, he was succeeded in the barony by his grandson Thomas Spring Rice, the son of his eldest son Hon. Stephen Edmund Spring Rice.

He was the 15th president of the University of Oregon (UO), serving from 1994 to 2009. His tenure as president was the second-longest after John Wesley Johnson. He was the first native Oregonian to run the UO. Frohnmayer previously served as Oregon Attorney General from 1981 to 1991, and subsequently served as dean at the University of Oregon School of Law before serving as president of the university. He served in an \\"of counsel\\" attorney role with the Oregon law firm, Harrang Long Gary Rudnick P.C.  Early life and education  David Braden Frohnmayer was born in Medford, Oregon. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1962. He attended Wadham College, Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, and received his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.  Political career  Frohnmayer, a Republican, served three terms in the Oregon House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981, representing southern Eugene. = Oregon Attorney General = Frohnmayer in 1984 Frohnmayer was elected as Oregon Attorney General in November 1980, defeating Democrat Harl H. Haas, Jr., and was sworn into office on January 5, 1981. He was re-elected in 1984, when he defeated former State Sen. Vernon Cook (D), and 1988, when he was nominated by both the Democratic and Republican parties, and defeated Fred Oerther, the Libertarian nominee. Frohnmayer served as Attorney General until his resignation on December 31, 1991, when he became Dean of the University of Oregon School of Law. As Attorney General, one of his most notable cases involved leading the prosecution of members of the Rajneesh movement (followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.)  Supreme Court Litigation  Frohnmayer prevailed in six out of the seven cases that he took to the United States Supreme Court: Oregon v. Kennedy (1982), Oregon v. Bradshaw (1983), Oregon v. Elstad (1985), Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe (1985), Whitely v. Albers (1986), and Employment Division v. Smith (1990). His one unsuccessful Supreme Court case was Tower v. Glover (1984). = 1990 gubernatorial election = Frohnmayer was the Republican nominee for Governor of Oregon in 1990. Popular Democratic incumbent‚Äìand former UC Berkeley School of Law classmate‚ÄìNeil Goldschmidt withdrew after Frohnmayer's campaign manager, Donna Zajonc, said \\"...you've got to believe that the best family will win\\" at a news conference,‚ÄúThe 30-Year Secret‚Äù Willamette Week, May 12, 2004. which was then reported by Jeff Mapes in The Oregonian. Zajonc's statement was interpreted at the time as a threat to use Goldschmidt's collapsing marriage as a political issue. Goldschmidt quickly withdrew from the race, an event that was considered one of the \\"great mysteries in Oregon politics\\" until 2004, when Goldschmidt admitted to having a sexual relationship with a minor in the 1970s. Frohnmayer subsequently lost the election to Barbara Roberts, the Democrat who was nominated after Goldschmidt's withdrawal, in a three-way race that included independent, Oregon Citizens Alliance-backed candidate Al Mobley.  Academic career  Frohnmayer taught law at the University of Oregon from 1971 to 1981, before he became state attorney general, and returned to the university as law school dean on January 1, 1992. He was appointed president of the university in 1994. Frohnmayer announced his retirement as president on April 29, 2008, and was succeeded on July 31, 2009 by Richard Lariviere. Frohnmayer's tenure was widely acclaimed; The Register- Guard's editorial \\"Retiring from the University he Remade\\" opined that \\"Dave Frohnmayer has steered the University of Oregon through grim and changing times and he's leaving a different and stronger institution.\\" The Oregonian called Frohnmayer's presidency \\"one of the most remarkable higher education performances in Oregon history.\\" During his tenure as president, he established an enduring relationship between the university and Phil Knight and Nike, which has continued to provide significant financial support to the university's athletic program. In April 2000, students protesting labor conditions at Nike blocked Frohnmayer from leaving his office, until they were arrested. Later in April, the University joined the Workers Rights Consortium. In response, Knight retracted a $30 million donation. After Frohnmayer withdrew the university from the consortium in February 2001, Knight restored his donation.  Family and personal life  Frohnmayer met Lynn Johnson, a native of Grants Pass, Oregon and returned Peace Corps volunteer, while working in Washington, D.C. as executive assistant to Robert Finch, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Nixon administration. They married and returned to Oregon, where they raised their five children -- Kirsten, Mark, Katie, Jonathan, and Amy -- in Eugene. In 1983, during Frohnmayer's first term as Oregon's Attorney General, daughters Kirsten and Katie were diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, a rare and life-threatening recessive genetic illness. Their third daughter Amy, born in 1987, also inherited the disease. Lynn and Dave together founded the FA Family Support Group in 1985 to help share disease and treatment information with other families afflicted by the illness and in 1989 established the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund to fund research that would lead to a cure. All three Frohnmayer daughters died of complications related to Fanconi anemia: Katie in 1991 at age 12, Kirsten in 1997 at age 24, and Amy Frohnmayer Winn in 2016 at age 29. Frohnmayer was also a founding Director of the National Marrow Donor Program and served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Frohnmayer's familial upbringing was heavily influenced by his father Otto's dedication to the law and public service and his mother MarAbel's love of music. His elder sister, Mira, had a distinguished career as a vocalist and music professor. His brother, John, served as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts under the administration of President George H.W. Bush and briefly challenged incumbent senator Gordon Smith in the 2008 election as an independent. His late brother, Philip, who resided in New Orleans, Louisiana, was professor of music at Loyola University. In 2005, the University of Oregon's MarAbel B. Frohnmayer Music Building was named in honor of his mother.Inside Oregon - For the University of Oregon Community Death On March 10, 2015, Frohnmayer died of prostate cancer, aged 74. \\"I am heartbroken at the loss of my wonderful and brilliant friend Dave Frohnmayer,\\" Gov.

(16 January 187518 February 1913), born in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, Mexico, was a participant in the Mexican Revolution against Porfirio D√≠az along with other members of his wealthy family. Madero's brother, Francisco I. Madero, was president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. During the coup d'√©tat in Mexico City known as Ten Tragic Days, Gustavo Madero was arrested, released to followers of conspirator F√©lix D√≠az, and killed by a mob. A borough in Mexico City is named after Gustavo A. Madero Early life Born as one of fifteen children on January 16, 1875, in Parras de la Fuente, located between Torre√≥n and Saltillo in the state of Coahuila, Gustavo Madero grew up in one of the richest families of Mexico.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 84 The Madero family had settled in Northern Mexico in the early nineteenth century. Grandfather Evaristo had founded the Compa√±√≠a Industrial de Parras. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the Madero family business extended from vineyards, cotton, and textiles, to mining, milling, smelting, ranching, and banking. Gustavo went to high school at the Colegio San Juan, a Jesuit school in Saltillo. For further high school studies and to learn English, the two oldest Madero brothers, Gustavo and Francisco attended Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland but stayed only for a year.Stanley R. Ross, Francisco I. Madero: Apostle of Democracy, Columbia University Press, New York, NY, 1955, p. 6 In 1887, made possible with the financial support of his father, Gustavo and his older brother Francisco moved to France where they attended the Lycee of Versailles and finally received a baccalaureate. Gustavo went on to study business management at Hautes √âtudes Commerciales in Jouy-en- Josas, near Paris. After the two brothers settled back in Mexico, Gustavo joined Francisco as confidante and chief of staff for a run at the presidency of Mexico. Mexican Revolution There were many divisions within the Madero family; some of its members wished for a peace agreement, hoping to avoid the problems that the civil war would bring to their businesses and investments. Talks were arranged in New York with Jos√© Yves Limantour, the finance minister of the D√≠az government, but these failed as the revolution continued and peace negotiations broke down. Financing his brother's revolution required serious funding. Gustavo through family contacts went to New York in 1910. His main contact was the Washington lawyer and lobbyist Sherburne Hopkins. For a fee of $50,000 Gustavo signed him on to represent and promote the revolutionary movement his brother Francisco led against the Dictator Porfirio Diaz.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 100 Hopkins brought the New York financiers Henry Clay Pierce and Charles Ranlett Flint on board. Both had financial interest in the Mexican railroads and oil. Their main competitors, John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil and Viscount Cowdray of the El Aguila Oil Company supported the Diaz regime. Thus, in the spring of 1911, the rivalry between international oil barons and the help of Sherburne Hopkins allowed Gustavo to raise the funds needed to depose the aging dictator of Mexico. After the success of the revolution, Gustavo remained his brother's closest confidante, although he did not hold public office. One of the most important tools of Gustavo's power between May 1911 and February 1913 was the Mexican Secret Service which he headed. Originally established and financed by Sherburne Hopkins, Gustavo through his lieutenant Felix A. Sommerfeld put down the most serious challenges to Francisco Madero's government. In the fall of 1911, Bernardo Reyes, an exiled general and competitor for the presidency in 1910, rose in revolt from San Antonio, Texas. The uprising fizzled by Christmas and Reyes was arrested.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 160 A few months later, another disgruntled revolutionary, Pascual Orozco who had fought alongside Madero to defeat Diaz, challenged the government in a massive uprising that covered much of northern Mexico. Again, Gustavo sent Sommerfeld to the border. The Mexican secret service cooperated closely with agents of the American Bureau of Investigations, customs and military officials to put down the uprising.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 192 Another uprising in Veracruz in the fall of 1912, this time headed by Felix Diaz, a relative of the deposed dictator, also fell victim to the efficient secret service under Gustavo's control. In the process, however, Gustavo made many serious enemies. Felix Diaz and Bernardo Reyes plotted their next moves from their jail cells. Victoriano Huerta, the army chief who the Mexican president fired for disloyalty on Gustavo's advice, seethed with resentment. The Ten Tragic Days In February 1913, the final push of the reactionary forces to push out the democratically elected Mexican government took shape. Felix Diaz, Bernardo Reyes and a host of members of the old regime plotted to take control of Mexico City first and then the entire country. As the assault started on February 9, Rees and Diaz marched on the presidential palace. In a shootout with troops Gustavo had frantically assembled in the early morning hours, Reyes was killed.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 235 Madero's secretary of war Lauro Villar Ochoa was seriously injured. The president appointed Victoriano Huerta, who professed undivided loyalty to Madero to replace him. However, Gustavo quickly uncovered the participation of Huerta in the conspiracy. On February 17, he arrested Huerta and brought him before the president.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 246 Against Gustavo's advice, Huerta remained in charge of the military. The Madero government collapsed the next day. On February 18 the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, Victoriano Huerta and F√©lix D√≠az signed an agreement cementing the coup d'√©tat, titled the Pact of the Embassy. Gustavo was ambushed and arrested inside the Gambrinus restaurant just before lunch.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, p. 248 Two hours later, President Francisco Madero became a prisoner of the putchists. Followers of D√≠az sought to have Francisco and Gustavo Madero turned over to them. The President was kept by Huerta, since his resignation from the presidency was needed to give a veneer of legality to the coup d'etat. Gustavo Madero was turned over and taken to the arsenal of the Ciudadela. That night Gustavo was set upon and brutally murdered by a mob over of a hundred federal soldiers on the orders Manuel Mondrag√≥n, the new government's secretary of war. The mob desecrated Madero's body, extracting his glass eye and passing it around.Ross, Stanley. Francisco I. Madero: Apostle of Democracy. New York: Columbia University of Press 1955, pp. 312-13. News of Gustavo's death was kept from the President, as the usurpers pressured him to resign.Ross, Francisco I. Madero, p. 315. Gustavo had been Francisco Madero's closest advisor. \\"As the go-to person [for the president] he endured endless accusations of influence peddling and bribery... Besides the alleged corruptibility of Gustavo, the complaint alluded to the power of the President's brother.\\"Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A.

It is located in the center-east of the district and is the smallest of the city's boroughs. The area's history began in 1309 when the island of Iztacalco, in what was Lake Texcoco, was settled in 1309 by the Mexica who would later found Tenochtitlan, according to the Codex Xolotl. The island community would remain small and isolated through the colonial period, but drainage projects in the Valley of Mexico dried up the lake around it. The area was transformed into a maze of small communities, artificial islands called chinampas and solid farmland divided by canals up until the first half of the 20th century. Politically, the area has been reorganized several times, with the modern borough coming into existence in 1929. Today, all of the canals and farmland are dried out and urbanized as the most densely populated borough and the second most industrialized. Historic center Although the borough is completely urbanized, there are still traces of the area's rural past, especially in the historic center, which corresponds to the original island in the former Lake Texcoco. This zone is still divided into six neighborhoods called barrios: Santa Cruz, La Asunci√≥n, San Miguel, Los Reyes, Zapotla, San Francisco Xicaltongo y Santiago, along with an area called Santa Anita Zacatlalmanco Hu√©huetl. Most of these lie along the Calzada de la Viga. This area was designated as a \\"Barrio M√°gico\\" by the city in 2011. The Barrio de Santa Cruz contains some of the oldest structures of the entire borough. One of these is the Capilla de Santa Cruz, located on a small street called Amador Aztl√°n. It has a Salomonic main portal with vegetative designs. It is only one level topped with a vaulted niche. Inside, there is a silver leaf main altar with a notable wood cross covered in silver and decorated with the image of the Passion of Christ and the date of 1748. The chapel was declared a historic monument in 1972. The Ermita de la Cruz is on Calle Agricultures. It was constructed by the Franciscans in the early 16th century and listed as a historic monument in 1955. The interior contains a crucified Christ done in pea cane paste. It also has an oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This barrio also contains a number of houses and other structures from the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the Barrio de la Asunci√≥n next door is home to the most important plaza and the church of the borough. The plaza is called either Plaza Miguel Hidalgo or Plaza San Matias, located between the parish of San Mat√≠as and Calzada de la Viga. It is of two levels with a number of trees and has a traditional kiosk in the center. It also has two important monuments, one of the Aztec glyph still used to designate the area and one of a bust of Miguel Hidalgo from 1870. The parish and former monastery of San Mat√≠as were begun in the 16th century. The main portal contains the main entrance, which consists of a richly decorated arch and two columns. Above it is an eight-sided choir window, and above that is a pediment in the form of a truncated triangle. Above this is a crest. There is one bell tower is Baroque. To the left of the facade, there is a dome over a chapel area, which is decorated with human figures and other elements. The interior contains chandeliers, arches and the main altar that features a marine shell. Saint Matthew continues to be the patron saint of the Iztacalco. The Barrio de Santiago is marked by the Santiago Ap√≥stol Church from the 18th century. It has a fa√ßade nearly without curves and almost square, covered in tezontle stone. On each side of the facade, there is a slim bell tower. The main entrance is marked by a simple arch of sandstone which contains a seashell and supported by two pilasters. Above this entrance, there is a clock. The interior is bright due to the many stained glass windows. The borough Borough offices The borough of Iztacalco is located in the east-center of the Federal District of Mexico City bordering Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa and Benito Ju√°rez boroughs, as well as the Mexico State municipality of Nezahualcoyotl . It is the smallest of the city's boroughs. The territory is divided into thirty eight neighborhoods called ‚Äúcolonias‚Äù or ‚Äúbarrios‚Äù along with 220 major apartment complexes. The borough hall is located on Avenida Rio Churubusco in the Ramos Mill√°n neighborhood. Seventy one percent of the borough is occupied by residencies, commerce and service establishments. Fifty-four percent of the territory is purely residential, down from 61% in 1980.%. There are 99,577 housing units, almost all of which are constructed of cinderblock and concrete. The average housing unit has 4.1 occupants. Many of these constructions are in some state of deterioration, which includes sixty percent of major housing complexes, as well as sixty percent of a type of housing situation, called a ‚Äúvecindad.‚Äù Mixed-use zones, with residences, offices, service and certain industries have increased from 8.6% to 17%. Eleven percent is dedicated to industry. Ninety percent of the land is paved over with only about two percent considered to be green space. Over 97% have basic services such as gas, electricity, garbage, and drainage. The Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca sports complex is located on Avenida R√≠o Piedad in Colonia Magdalena Mixhuca. It contains boasts professional-level playing fields, swimming pools, running tracks and gyms. The Palacio de los Deportes, also called the Domo de Cobre (‚Äúthe Copper Dome‚Äù) is located on Avenida R√≠o Churubusco and Viaducto Miguel Alem√°n in Colonia Granjas M√©xico. Connected to the complex is the Escuela Nacional de Entrenadores Deportivos and the Escuela Superior de Educaci√≥n F√≠sica. As a private concert venue, it has hosted such acts as Aerosmith, Robbie Williams, The Cure and Shakira . The Autodromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez, with adjoining Foro Sol is located on Avenida Viaducto Piedad in Colonia Magdalena Mixhuca. The Foro Sol has also hosted major concerts. The La Viga Lienzo Charro (rodeo ring) is located on Guadalupe Street in Colonia Pantitl√°n. The main annual festival in the borough is the anniversary of the parish of San Matias in August, celebrating its establishment as the Franciscan monastery. It features the ‚Äúcharros of Iztacalco‚Äù who are based at the Lienzo Charro de la Viga, a tradition based from the 19th century. Other important days include the festival dedicated to Saint Sebastian in January in the Barrio de Zapotla, Carnival in some neighborhoods, the Procession of the Holy Burial on Good Friday and a pre Hispanic festival called Ue-izkal-ilhuitl, or the spring equinox . The borough also hosts an annual youth event called the Festival Juventud. In 2011, this event included two days of rock and ska music at the Faro Iztacalco. It included bands such as Skandalo, Maskatesta and Los Korukos . Geography and environment Hydrology map of the borough The borough extends over 21.8 km2 or 2,317.4 hectares, all of which is urbanized. It accounts for 1.75% of the total territory of the Federal District, and is the smallest of the 16 boroughs. The land is flat and located on the lakebed of Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico at an altitude of 2,235 meters above sea level. Today, however, the lake in this area has dried completely and the canals, wetlands and lake of the territory have completely disappeared. The climate is considered to be semi arid and temperate, with only the area bordering Benito Ju√°rez and Iztapalapa considered to be semi moist with rains in the summer. Overall, the borough is the driest in the Federal District, with an annual rainfall of not over 600 to 700mm per year. With over 90% paved over, there are no wild habitats left in the borough. Of the 2.34% dedicated to green space, most of these are traffic islands on major thoroughfares. There are only two parks in the borough. The Urbano-Ecol√≥gico School-Park is located on Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza in Colonia Agr√≠cola Oriental, near the border of Iztapalapa. This park has less than one hectare. The other large green space is the parkland around the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports Center, which has been reforested with eucalyptus trees. Demographics Iztacalco is the most densely populated borough in Mexico City. As of 2005, the population was 395,025, with most being from the lower middle to lower classes. There are small communities of middle-class families in Reforma Iztaccihuatl, Militar Marte and Viaducto Piedad. Despite its density, the overall population of the borough has been dropping between one and two percent since 1990, but still about twenty percent of the current population moved into here from elsewhere in Mexico. The population is expected to continue decreasing. There are about 5400 people who speak an indigenous language, with thirty eight different indigenous ethnicities present. About 1,100 of these speak some form of Nahuatl, followed by Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Mazateca, Mazahua and Totonaca. About 91% of the population is Catholic with about seven percent belonging to Protestant or Evangelical churches. History Atrium and facade of the San Mat√≠as parish and former monastery \\"Paseo de la Viga con la iglesia de Iztacalco\\" (Paseo de la Viga with the church of Iztacalco), 1706 oil from Pedro Villegas. While the most accepted interpretation of Iztacalco (from Nahuatl) is ‚Äúhouse of salt,‚Äù others have been proposed such as ‚Äúplace of white houses.‚Äù Originally, the name was written ‚ÄúIxtacalco‚Äù but its current spelling was adopted in the second half of the 20th century. The crest or seal of the borough is the Aztec glyph which has been used to designate the place since at least the time of the Mendocino Codex, which depicts the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and ‚Äúsalt‚Äù interpretations of the name. It contains a sun shining over a house. Inside the house, there is a grain of salt and two markings that represent raindrops‚Äô tracks. Because it was originally an island well within Lake Texcoco, Iztacalco was settled by humans later than the rest of the Valley of Mexico . The history of Iztacalco begins in 1309. The Xolotl Codex states that Iztacalco was one of the people's last stops before they finally settled Tenochtitlan. The island was conquered and subject to the dominion of Texcoco as part of the territory of the Triple Alliance. From the beginning, inhabitants made a living by extracting salt from the brackish waters of the surrounding lake. This salt was consumed until the very early 20th century. Just after the Conquest, the area belonged to a territory called San Juan de Dios ruled directly from Mexico City. A small monastery dedicated to Saint Matthew was constructed in which lived no more than two monks, with no more than 300 indigenous. As the area was very sparsely populated, these monks did not establish satellite parishes, except for the San Antonio hermitage, built for the feast day of this saint. In the middle of the 17th century, baptisms began to be recorded in the area, which then consisted of the main community and eight surrounding neighborhoods called barrios. Through the colonial period, Iztacalco was on an island, which impeded its growth. It had only 296 residents in its barrios of Asunci√≥n, Santa Cruz, Santiago, San Miguel and Los Reyes. From the colonial period to the 19th century, various drainage projects in the Valley of Mexico eventually dried Lake Texcoco, creating firm land that would connect the former island of Iztacalco to the rest of the area. The dry land from the lake was formed mostly through the creation of chinampas on which were grown flowers and vegetables. However, from the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th, Iztacalco had a number of canals crisscrossing it, the main one being Canal de la Viga, earlier known as the Acequia Real. The canal extended for 1,560 meters and was thirty meters wide. This made Iztacalco an important strategic transit point between what is now the historic center of Mexico City and the agricultural areas to the south and east such as Chalco and Xochimilco . One of the main docks here was at Zacatlalmanco, which had an important market attached to it. The first steamship passed by here in 1850 which connected Mexico City and Chalco. The canal had a number of pedestrian bridges over it, such as the La Garita. These bridges also doubled as regulators for the canal's waters due to the floodgates on their supporting arches. The canal also functioned as rural getaway for Mexico City dwellers, especially on Sundays. Until, mid century, the borough area remained rural with small houses of adobe and/or reeds/small branches. Small canoes called trajineras carried cargo and passengers among the various docks on this canal. The canals were filled with aquatic birds such as herons and a local species called chichicuilotes. It was also the scene of one of the most popular festivals of the 19th century, the Viernes de Dolores (Friday of the Virgin of Sorrows), also known as the Fiesta de las Flores (Festival of the Flowers). Starting in 1915, due to health concerns, the canal was closed to traffic and filled into become current major road, with the process completed in the 1930s. Street scene in Iztacalco in late 1800s. Photo by William Henry Jackson. Plaza in front of a church in Ixtacalco, pre-1900 Through the 19th century, the community of Iztacalco and Mexico City would remain entities mostly separated by farmland and chinampas. This was also true of a number of communities which are now part of the borough such as Mixiuhca, Zacatlalmanco, La Magdalena, Santa Ana and San Matias. Up until the 20th century, the territory remained a maze of chinampas divided by canals large and small with carp and even snakes. In 1855, the districts and municipalities of the Federal District were reorganized, with the municipality of Iztacalco consisting of the communities of San Mat√≠as, San Juanico, Santa Anita, Magdalena Atlacolpa, Asunci√≥n Aculco, Santa Cruz, Santiago, San Miguel, La Asunci√≥n, San Sebasti√°n Zapotla, Los Reyes, San Francisco, San Antonio Zacahuisco as well as two ranches called Cedillo and De la Viga or De la Cruz Metlapalco. In the mid 19th century, the area's population was dominated by indigenous peoples. In 1892, there was land redistribution among the families of the area, consisting of 255 hectares what belonged to three ranches. At the end of the 19th century, Iztacalco was part of the Tlalpan prefecture with a population of about 2800. In 1900, it became part of the prefecture of Guadalupe Hidalgo, one of the six the Federal District was divided into at the time. In 1929, the current borough was formed. The urban sprawl of Mexico City began to reach the borough in the first decades of the 20th century. As the canals were filled in, they were converted into the primary roadways which still remain today. Canal de la Viga is now Calzada de la Viga. The first industries in the area were established in the middle of the 20th century as the area was at the city's periphery, but its proximity to the historic center made its urbanization quick. The first industries in the areas were those making cardboard boxes, cushions, furniture, chemicals and food processing. The installation of factories and housing developments changed Iztacalco from rural to completely urban in less than four decades. Since the 1930s and especially since the 1950s, land became divided into housing lots as the canals and swamp was drained into dry land. Most of this housing was for the working classes. These include neighborhoods such as La Cruz, Pantitl√°n and Granjas M√©xico to house workers for factories built in the same areas. Citizens of the borough began directly electing borough officials in 2000, these include the borough president and the borough's two representative's to Mexico City's government. Today, some of the most dangerous neighborhoods of the city are located in this borough. Economy Iztacalco is ranked ninth in economic marginalization in the Federal District with over 32% considered to be living in poverty. Over 85% are considered to be at least moderately economically marginalized, the highest in the district. As of 2007, about 55% of the population over the age of twelve is employed either in the formal or informal economy, with most of these between the ages of 35 and 39. About 48% of those in the total workforce do not have work in the formal economy. Well over half the workforce is male but the percentage of women has been rising since 1990. 0.1% work in agriculture, 20.9% work in mining, construction and manufacturing, and 75.7% work in commerce and services. Eleven percent of the borough and 11.7% of establishments are dedicated to industry and manufacturing, the second highest percentage in the District. The Ciudad Deportiva de la Magdalena Mixihuca is the second largest industrial zone in the Federal District. Just under 50% of establishments are in commerce and just over 37% are in services, but there are no major office buildings. The borough has eleven hotels, one five-star, two four-star and four three-star. Transportation The borough has 53.8 km of primary roadway, 5.7% of the total for the Federal District with 6,082,261m2 of paved surface. Major thoroughfares include the Viaducto R√≠o de la Piedad which borders the borough on the north going east-west and connecting to the Mexico City-Puebla highway. It is bordered on the east by the Anillo Perif√©rico, with the Circuito Interior passing through the center. Near the old village of Iztacalco is Eje 3 Oriente and Calzada de la Viga. Other important roads include Eje 2, Eje 6 Sur, Eje 1 Oriente and Eje 5 Oriente. Four lines of the Metro pass through the borough: Line 9, Line 1, Line 4 and Line 8. Three of these lines meet at Metro Pantitl√°n, a major hub of the transport system and a major connecting point for busses heading east into the State of Mexico. There are four lines of the trolleybus and Metrob√∫s Line 2 passes through as well. ;Metro stations *Viaducto *Santa Anita *Coyuya *Iztacalco *Ciudad Deportiva *Puebla *Pantitl√°n *Agr√≠cola Oriental *Canal de San Juan Education There are twenty three public day care centers, run by various governmental agencies. There are 147 kindergartens, with 63 of these run by the delegation. There are 128 public primary schools. There are fifty five public middle schools, thirty five of which are general studies and twenty are geared to vocational instruction. There are thirteen private middle schools. High schools include Plantel 2 de la Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (UNAM), la Preparatoria Iztacalco, dependiente del Instituto de Educaci√≥n Media Superior del Distrito Federal (IEMS-DF) and Plantel 3 del Colegio de Bachilleres Metropolitano. There are five centers dedicated to special education and nine centers that work with special needs children in the regular school system. There are fourteen vocational schools above the middle school level. It has eleven public libraries, mostly serving elementary school aged children. It has ten ‚Äúcasas de cultura‚Äù which mostly serve only the neighborhoods in which they are found. 3.1% of the population is illiterate. To combat high dropout rates, the government of Mexico City offers stipends to families of school aged children as long as the children remain enrolled in public schools. The Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingenier√≠a y Ciencias Sociales y Administrativas (UPIICSA) del Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional is located in the borough, which offers majors in engineering, computer science and administration. The Escuela Normal de Educaci√≥n F√≠sica trains physical education teachers.

It was directed by Stuart B. Marks. Gameplay The game puts the player in the role of a cyber-tank designer and programmer. Given a limited budget, the player must design a tank that can defeat a series of ever more challenging opponent tanks. Each successful design yields a higher security clearance and a larger budget, ultimately resulting in an OMEGA clearance and an unlimited budget. The focus of the game is not on the combat but on game programming the tank itself. Tanks are programmed using a built-in text editor that allows the player to use various artificial intelligence script commands, similar in structure to BASIC. These commands permit control of various aspects of the tank, and also allows teams of tanks to communicate and coordinate actions. While commands exist that enable a range of control over the tank, successful designs tend to be automated. Decision making is an important part of the design process, as the programming must reflect the equipment placed on the tank. Code was cross-platform, so Apple, Commodore, and IBM users could compete against each other. Origin operated a bulletin board system for Omega owners. Reception Compute! praised Omega, stating that it made writing code for tanks easy and fun for those new to programming. Russell Sipe of Computer Gaming World in 1989 gave the game a positive review, noting its similarities and improvements over RobotWar. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two of five stars, stating that \\"Programmer love this 'simulation' [but] it's all geek to me\\".

It was created in 1970, joining the historic areas of Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya along with a number of notable neighborhoods such as Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec. With landmarks such as Chapultepec Park and the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, it is the second most visited borough in Mexico City after Cuauht√©moc, D.F. where the historic center of Mexico City is located. Tacubaya and Tacuba both have long histories as independent settlements and were designated as ‚ÄúBarrios M√°gicos‚Äù by the city for tourism purposes. Geography and environment The borough is located in the northwest Federal District of Mexico City, just west of the historic center. The borough is divided into eighty one neighborhoods called colonias. The largest of these is Bosques de las Lomas at 3.2km2, and the smallest is Popo Ampliaci√≥n with only .33km2. It is bordered by the boroughs of Azcapotzalco, Cuauht√©moc, Benito Ju√°rez, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and Cuajimalpa with the State of Mexico bordering it on the west side. It has a territory of 47.68km2 which is 3.17 percent of the total Federal District. The borough consists of an area which used to the west bank of Lake Texcoco, with three major zones, Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya. The geography of the borough includes canyons, hills and mesas associated with the Sierra de las Cruces, most present in the southwest bordering Cuajimalpa. In the northeast, mostly defined by the Circuit Interior road, is the most important elevation, the Cerro de Chapultepec at 2,260masl. The area today is almost completely developed with green spaces mostly limited to parks. The largest green space is Chapultepec Park at 2.2 km2. Parque Lineal was the former rail line of the Ferrocarril de Cuernavaca. The strip was converted into a park in 2011. Where the park crosses Lago Constanza Street in Colonia An√°huac, there are often cultural events held. One of the newest parks in the borough is located on Lago Caneguin in Colonia Argentina, created over a former roadway called Ruta 100. The unnamed park has 10,000 meters of surface area, kiosk, gymnasium, bicycle path, multipurpose room, parking, rain water containment system and child care center. It serves about 40,000 area residents. In 2008, reforestation efforts were undertaken, beginning at the Ca√±itas Park. While there were important rivers here such as Remedios, today there are no longer any free flowing currents of water. The climate is semi moist and temperate with annual rainfall varying between 700 and 800mm. The average annual temperature is 15C with lows in the winter about 8C and highs around 19C. Certain areas of the borough have problems with the stability of the ground due to old abandoned underground mines. These areas include the Am√©rica, Daniel Garza, 16 de Septiembre, Daniel Garza Apliaci√≥n and Observatorio neighborhoods, which are particularly affected, but the problem also is found in El Capul√≠n, Monte Sol and Ex Hacienda de Pedregal. The number of people living in these areas is estimated at over 25,000, and about 500 families living in very high risk areas. Abandoned mines have also been detected in Tacubaya, Lomas Altas, Bosque de las Lomas and even under Chapultepec Park. Demographics and socioeconomics Early 20th-century house in Polanco As of 2005, the borough had 106,005 residences of which 25,308 were freestanding houses, 54,079 were apartments and the rests of other types. This total number grew to a total of 123,910. About eighty percent of homes are owned by their residents and not rented. Around 95% have basic services such as electricity and running water. While the borough contains mostly working class areas in and around Tacuba and Tacubaya, the southwest contains some of the most exclusive colonias of the borough. While most of the borough is residential, the population of the borough has dropped from 650,497 in 1960 to 372,889 in 2010. It is now the twelfth most densely occupied borough of sixteen. Just over eighty eight percent identify themselves as Catholic. The borough has 112 preschools, 160 primary schools, 79 middle schools, seven vocational/technical high schools and 49 high schools. The borough has an educational program called ‚ÄúFaros del Saber‚Äù (Lighthouses of Knowledge), which began in 2001. There are nine installations related to the program: each dedicated to a different field, such as ecology and science and technology, and each designed to promote these fields to the youth of the borough through workshops and various events. The main library of the program is part of CONACULTA and is designed to promote reading. The borough also offers classes to youth and adults in basic computer technology. Main thoroughfares include Paseo de la Reforma, Calzada M√©xico Tacuba, the Anillo Perif√©rico, Avenida V Palmas and Avenida Constituyentes. Numerous bus and Metro lines pass through here, with the major transportation hub centered in Metro Tacubaya, where Lines 1, 7 and 9 converge. The borough is also home to the Observatorio bus station, which mostly serves buses heading west to Toluca and other destinations. The working population is 45.4% of the total. Overall socioeconomic marginalization of the borough is ranked very low. The borough is the second most visited by tourists in Mexico City according to the Secretary of Tourism of the Federal District, receiving just under 13% of total visitors in 2006. The borough has nineteen major hotels, and five of the six best hotels in the city. Its major, upscale restaurants and entertainment centers are located in Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec. Five star hotels include the Presidente Intercontinental, the Marriott and Niko, all located on Paseo de la Reforma next to Chapultepec Park. Commercial centers include eighteen traditional markets, the upscale shopping corridor along Avenida Presidente Masarik in Polanco and various malls. Bases for unlicensed taxis and areas crowded with unregulated street vendors is a major problem, especially around Christmas time. Most street- vending occurs in the Tacuba, Tacubaya, Chapultepec, Argentinas, Lomas and Polanco neighborhoods. A number of stationary public markets have problems with abandoned stalls. This is occurs in the Tacuba, An√°huac Anexo, An√°huac Zone and El Chorrito markets. The main reason that these markets struggle is competition from supermarkets, but the deterioration of the buildings is another factor. History Map of Lake Texcoco with Tenochtitlan and the three main settlements of Miguel Hidalgo, Tacuba, Chapultepec and Atlacuihuayan (Tacubaya) on the west bank The borough is named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who began the Mexican War of Independence . The borough was created by fusing various former municipalities such as Tacuba, Tacubaya and the Chapultepec Park area along with the neighborhoods such as Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec, Bosques de las Lomas, Popotla, Las Pensil, La Argentina, America, Santa Julia and Observatorio. The center of the borough is considered to be Chapultepec Park. Until the 20th century, Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya had separate histories, all part of the Federal District of Mexico City during most of this entity's existence under various arrangements. In 1899, the Federal District was divided into the municipality of Mexico and six prefectures, one of which was Tacubaya. This arrangement was reconfirmed in 1917. In 1928, the Federal District was reorganized as a department under the direct control of the federal government. The territory was reorganized into Mexico City proper and thirteen boroughs: Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Azcapotzalco, Iztacalco, General Anaya, Coyoac√°n, San √Ångel, La Magdalena Contreras, Cuajimalpa, Tlalpan, Iztapalapa, Xochimilco, Milpa Alta and Tl√°huac. The city proper was divided into twelve districts. What is now Miguel Hidalgo, was part of Mexico City proper. In 1970, the city area was subdivided into four parts, Cuauht√©moc, Venustiano Carranza, Benito Ju√°rez and Miguel Hidalgo. Borough map with 1970 divisions The various political arrangements to the present day have been a result of the growth of Mexico City proper. Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya in the pre Hispanic period were located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, just west of the island where the Aztecs established Tenochtitlan. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish established their capital in Tenochtitlan, renaming it Mexico City. Constant flooding problems, almost forced the Spanish to move the capital to Tacubaya in the early 17th century; however, it was decided to drain and fill in the lake instead. This effort would extend over the colonial period and well after Independence. Drainage of the lake would create land on which Mexico City grew. At the beginning of the 20th century, the very edge of Mexico City has reached the villages of Tacuba and Tacubaya. During the first third of this century, the country estates, farmland and ranches between Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mexico City proper were turned into subdivisions for housing, with roads and other paved areas taking over empty fields. From the 1930s, population growth and development increased with the establishment of industrial and commercial areas. In the 1940s, the Polanco area between Chapultepec and Santa Julia was developed. Various public and private enterprises were installed along the avenues of Ej√©rcito Nacional and Marina Nacional. The Secretary of Defense made its home at Lomas de Sotelo. On the far west of the borough large cemeteries such as Pante√≥n Franc√©s, General Sancturum, Pante√≥n Ingl√©s and Pante√≥n Espa√±ol were opened. One reason for the westward expansion was that wealthy families were abandoning the historic center of Mexico City for newer areas. This began with areas such as Colonia Roma and Condesa, but later they would move to Polanco. This movement west still continues into the Lomas area. Chapultepec Lake view in the first section of Chapultepec Facade of the National Anthropology Museum The center of the borough is Chapultepec Park. Chapultepec Park, more commonly called the \\"Bosque de Chapultepec\\" (Chapultepec Forest) in Mexico, is the largest city park in Latin America, measuring in total just over 686 hectares. The area has been considered special since long in the pre Hispanic period when it was a ceremonial site and later a retreat for Aztec emperors. There is also evidence of settlements here by the Chichimecas and Toltecs. The Mexicas lived here at before they were expelled by Azcapotzalco. After finally establishing Tenochtitlan, the Mexicas or Aztecs considered Chapultepec sacred. The first aqueduct from there to Tenochtitlan/Mexico City was built by Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Later Moctezuma Xocoyotzin had fish tanks and gardens constructed on the site. And Nezahualcoyotl had a palace constructed at the base of the hill. After the Conquest, Hern√°n Cort√©s tried to take this land for himself but Charles V denied this and made the area the heritage of Mexico City because it contained many of the springs that provided the city with potable water. The second and third sections of Chapultepec were opened in 1962 and 1974 respectively, with the third section from part of the lands which were an old paper factory. The two most important museums are the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a and the Chapultepec Castle National History Museum. These and most of the rest of the museums in the first section are located along Paseo de la Reforma. Of all of the museums in the park, the most famous is the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, considered to be one of the greatest archeological museums in the world. The museum has a number of antecedents beginning from the colonial period, but the current institution was created in the 1960s with the building and grounds designed by architect Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez. This museum has an area of 44,000m2 and 25 exhibit halls with sections devoted to each of the major pre-Hispanic civilizations in Mexico including the Aztec, Maya, Toltec and Olmec. The permanent collection is so large, that it is possible to spend an entire day to see it. There are also temporary exhibits as well. The Castle of Chapultepec is on Chapultepec Hill on which the park is historically centered. Construction of this castle was begun in the 1780s and includes towers and merlons, not for defense, but to give the structure a more royal feel. In 1847, the Castle was the scene of the Battle of Chapultepec and the suicide of the ‚ÄúNi√±os H√©roes‚Äù or Boy Heroes. A monument to these boys is located at the foot of Chapultepec Hill. From the 19th in to the 20th centuries, this structure was used as the official residence of Mexico's heads of state until this was changed to Los Pinos in the 1930s. Residents included Maximiliano I of Mexico, who had Paseo de la Reforma, which passes through Chapultepec Park, built to connect the area with the center of the city. Today, it is home to the National History Museum. Other features of the park include the Chapultepec Zoo, two artificial lakes with a lake house (Casa del Lago) and various pre Hispanic ruins including the remains of the Baths of Moctezuma, which was used until the 19th century when the area's springs dried up. Neighborhoods Neighborhoods (colonias) in the borough include Bosques de las Lomas, Lomas de Chapultepec, Granada, Ampl. Granada, Pensil, Polanco, San Miguel Chapultepec, and the two formerly independent municipalities of Tacuba and Tacubaya. =Tacuba= Remnants of the \\"Tree of the Sad Night\\" in the Popotla neighborhood, historically part of Tacuba Tacuba was called Tlacopan in the pre Hispanic period. Tacuba is derived from the former Nahuatl name ‚ÄúTlacopan‚Äù and means place of the jarilla plant. It was conquered by Azcapotzalco which placed Totoquihuatzin as governor. When the Tenochtitlan and Texcoco decided to ally against Azcapotzalco, Tlacopan did not resist and for this reason is considered to be the third of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Tacuba's importance led to the construction of a causeway over the lake linking it with Tenochtitlan. Today, this causeway still exists as a major thoroughfare called Calzada Mexico-Tacuba. During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs succeeded at one point in expelling the Spanish from Tenochtitlan in an event called La Noche Triste (The Sad Night). Cort√©s and his men fled towards Tacuba on the road that still connects it with the historic center of Mexico City. One year later, Cort√©s returned to Tenochtitlan to conquer it for good. At the intersection of the Mexico-Tacuba Road and Mar Blanco is a still surviving Montezuma cypress tree. According to legend, this is the tree under which Cort√©s wept. The last ruler of Tacuba was Tetlepanquetzal, who was tortured by Cort√©s, who suspected that he was hiding treasure. Over the pre Hispanic ceremonial site, the Franciscans constructed a church dedicate to the Archangel Gabriel. By 1632, the area had sixty haciendas and by the end of the 18th century, 28 villages with Tacuba proper having twelve neighborhoods. The main river through here was the Remedios, which was the main supply of water. In addition, to agriculture, the area was also an important supplier of lumber and sandstone for construction. By 1794, the area had 45 villages. In the first third of the 20th century, three important schools were established in Tacuba. The Colegio Militar was moved to Popotla in 1913, closed during the Mexican Revolution and reopened in 1920. The Escuela Nacional de Maestros (National Teachers College) was opened in 1925 along with the Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria de UNAM. In 1937, the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional was opened in Casco de Santo Tom√°s. Since the mid 20th century, Tacuba proper has declined with problems such as crime and sanitation issues. Tacuba has major problems with uncontrolled street vending and public transportation, prostitution and other crime. Rehabilitation of Tacuba is under a program designated RENACE (rebirth) . Nave of the San Gabriel Parish The church and former monastery of San Gabriel is located next to the Tacuba Metro station. The main entrance to the atrium has a stone gate with three arches. The small atrium is mostly paved with a few trees. The fa√ßade is mostly Baroque with the portal marked the two grooved Doric columns and topped by a frieze with vegetative design done in relief. It has one bell tower with two levels also in Baroque. The side portal faces Calzada Mexico- Tacuba. It also has an arched entryway, but marked with wavy grooved pilasters and topped with a niche. Part of the former cloister is also preserved. The interior is focused on the main altar, which is gilded and has twelve colonial era paintings of the Virgin Mary and various saints along with Salomonic columns. In the center is an image of the crucified Christ and the top has an image of God, the Father. One other feature of the church is an image of the Child Jesus called the ‚ÄúNi√±o futbolista‚Äù (Football playing child), named such because it is dressed in the uniform of Mexico's national team when it plays in the World Cup . The Monastery of San Joaqu√≠n was founded in 1689 by the Carmelites and conserves its original architecture. It was an important school for young priests. The Tacuba area is home to a neighborhood called Popotla. Here are the remains of a Montezuma cypress, under which it is said that Hern√°n Cort√©s sat and wept after being run out of Tenochtitlan during La Noche Triste in 1520. Next to the plaza where this tree is found, there is an old mansion whose east side has a mural called ‚ÄúNoche de la Victoria‚Äù (Night of the Victory) done in 2010. Also here is the parish called Pronto Socorro. Further east along the Calzada Tacuba-Mexico, there is the Colegio Militar, next to the Metro stop of the same name. This school was founded in 1823 and operated until 1976. Today it is the site of the Universidad del Ej√©rcito y Fuerza A√©rea which still trains part of Mexico's military. =Tacubaya= Overlooking market from Avendia Observatorio, present day Edificio Ermita In the Aztec period, Tacubaya was called Atlacuihuayan, ‚Äúplace where the river twists‚Äù in Nahuatl and only a way station for travelers. In 1590 after the Spanish conquest, The Dominicans founded a monastery and church called San Jos√© de Tacubaya. The area remained rural with orchards, important grain mills and abundant water from its three main rivers of Piedad, Morales and Xola, attracting the wealthy to build country homes here. Some development began in the mid 19th century, and mansion building reached its height here in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 19th century, the municipality of Tacubaya consisted of Tacubaya proper and the villages of La Piedad, Mixcoac, Santa Fe and Santa Luc√≠a, along with a number of haciendas and ranches. In 1888, Tacubaya had just over 9,000 inhabitants and at the beginning of the 20th, it had 20,000. By the 20th century the urban sprawl of Mexico City reached Tacubaya and its rural nature ended. Its rivers were encased and its springs dried up. The historic center of Tacubaya still has some of its country mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries and earlier, such as the Casa de la Bola (House of the Ball) which belonged to the Count De la Cortina until 1783. Only the cloister of the original former monastery of Santo Domingo still exists, and its church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Purification whose main feast day is Candelaria (Candlemas), giving it the alternate name of the Parish of Candlemas. Outside of the historic center, there are several landmarks. Edificio Ermita is one of the first skyscrapers in Mexico City, constructed in 1930 in Art Deco style by architect Juan Segura. The Luis Barrag√°n House and Studio was the home of one of the country's most renowned architects, built in the early 20th century. Much of Tacubaya is now working class. One major transportation problem is the overcrowding of unregulated vendors, especially around the Tacubaya Metro station.

He and Martina Rozells were the parents of William Light, founder of Adelaide in South Australia. Early years Light was baptised in Dallinghoo, Suffolk, England on 15December 1740. His mother was given as Mary Light. Taken in by a relative, the nobleman William Negus, he attended Woodbridge Grammar School from 1747. Researchers initially believed Light to be the illegitimate son of William Negus, but according to author No√´l Francis Light Purdon, the six-times great-grandson of Francis Light, Negus received payment for looking after him and acting as his guardian throughout his education. Career =Naval career= Light began his service in the Royal Navy as a surgeon's servant on HMS Mars in February 1754. He started an apprenticeship in the Royal Navy in 1759 (aged 19) on HMS Captain, before being transferred after a few months to the newly-commissioned HMS Dragon. He was a midshipman on HMS Arrogant in 1761 before ending his service with the navy in 1763. It was in the navy that he met James Scott, who would later play an important part in his life and business dealings. =In the colonies= His movements between 1763 and 1765 are not recorded, but it seems that he managed to amass enough of a fortune to bequeath a considerable amount of property in a will to William Negus and three other men. Thalang, Siam In 1765 Light embarked the East India Company's ship Clive, captained by John Allen, bound for Madras and Bombay. In India, he secured command of a \\"country ship\\" belonging to Madras trading firm Jourdain, Sulivan & Desouza, the Speedwell. Setting up a base in Thalang in Siam (also known as Salang and Jung/JunkCeylon, now Phuket province, in Thailand), he traded there, in Aceh (now an Indonesian province) and the Malay Peninsula, learning the local languages. Basing himself in Thalang, he met Martina Rozells, and together they set up a trading post in Kuala Kedah. Full text at archive.org. He soon gained an influential position with the Sultan of Kedah. For about ten years he had his headquarters in Thalang, where he revived a failed French trading post. While in Thalang he learned to speak and write several languages, including Malay and Thai, and became family friends with Than Phu Ying Chan and her husband, the Governor of Thalang. Later, in 1785, he warned the island administrators of an imminent Burmese attack. Light's warning enabled the islanders, led by Chan and her sister Mook, to prepare for Thalang's defence and subsequently repel the Burmese invasion. In 1785, after the death of the Governor of Thalang, his widow Pia Pimons and other relatives proposed that Light assume the position; however the King of Siam, Rama II, thwarted the proposal. Penang Light's interest in Penang had begun in 1771, when he proposed the idea of a British settlement in the neighbourhood of the Malay Peninsula to Warren Hastings, the East India Company's Governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal). He suggested that the island of Penang might serve as a \\"convenient magazine for the Eastern trade\\" but at that time his idea gained no ground. In 1776‚Äì7, Light arranged a large shipment of firearms for the Siamese Kingdom of Thonburi, ruled by Taksin the Great. Whereas his previous suggestion had brought no result, following the war that ended in the Peace of 1783 with France and Spain during which Britain had struggled with France for naval superiority, Light's suggestion took on a new significance. In 1786, on behalf of the British East India Company, Light leased Penang Island from Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah (who had succeeded Muhammad Jewa in 1778 as leader of Kedah Sultanate), for the price of 6,000 Spanish dollars per annum. Under the administration of Governor-general Sir John Macpherson, Light was entitled Superintendent and put in charge of the settlement, styled Dewa Raja by the Malays, on 1 July 1786; thus marking the beginning of British expansion into the Malay States, and into British colonisation in Southeast Asia. The new colony was very sparsely populated at this time: it was described as \\"one vast jungle of nearly 107 square miles, with a population of only fifty-eight souls\\". Pirates had to be discouraged from landing, and forests were cleared. George Town (named after George III) was established, and when two EIC ships appeared on the coast, Light took the opportunity of inviting the ships and crews to attend the declaration of the new colony of Prince of Wales Island on 11 August 1786, being the eve of the Prince of Wales's birthday. The Sultan, however, was bound under the Southeast Asian mandala political model in fealty to the King of Siam. Light had exceeded his authority with a promise of military aid should the Burmese or Siamese invade, despite the fact that Sultan Abdullah asked him not to land until the military aid had been confirmed in London. Thus, when the Sultan's land was invaded and no aid was forthcoming, the Sultan attempted to take back the island as a refuge in 1790. The multicultural colony of Penang became extraordinarily successful from its inception and Light served as Superintendent of the settlement until his death in October 1794, apart from between 21 Nov 1789 and 9 Feb 1790, when John Glass acted in his place. page- url By 1789 there were about 10,000 inhabitants, and by 1795, 20,000. Family tree of the Capel family descendants of Light Accounts of his actions seem to indicate that he was a fair-minded and honourable man. In 1790, he asked for a higher salary, in order to allow him to live without having to engage in trade (by which he may have enriched himself, but possibly compromise his role). This led to his business partnership with James Scott being dissolved. In 1794, he recommended that a proper system of justice should be instituted in Penang, as it should not be within the powers of the Superintendent to dispense \\"arbitrary judgement\\". Death and legacy Tomb of Francis Light in Penang's Protestant Cemetery Light died from malaria on 21 October 1794 See page-url. and was buried at the Old Protestant cemetery at Northam Road (now Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah) in George Town. He remembered his friends James Scott, William Fairlie and Thomas Pegou in his will. A bronze statue, sculpted by F.J. Wilcoxson and cast at Burton's Foundry in Thames Ditton, bears Francis Light's name but was actually modelled on the features of his son William, there being no portrait of Francis to use. Erected in 1936 to celebrate 150 years since George Town was founded, it stands at Fort Cornwallis in George Town. Light Street, within the UNESCO World Heritage Site in George Town, is named after him. Convent Light Street, Penang's oldest girls' school, founded in 1852, is located along the street. He was respected by his British peers as a fair and honourable man and admired for his achievements, which included keeping the Siamese and Dutch at bay. He was a skilled negotiator and cared for the welfare of the people both in his colony and old friends in Thalang, sending rice when the island was hit by famine. He spoke the local languages and partially assumed the local dress, earning the love of the residents of Penang. Family =Martina Rozells= Light had three daughters and two sons with Martina (sometimes spelt Martinha) Rozells (possibly born Thong Di),Martina she is referred in one source as Martinha Thong Di but took her mother‚Äôs name of Rozells. whose origins and status are the subject of debate. She has been variously recorded as being of Portuguese or French extraction on one side, and of Siamese or Malay on the other. She was also rumoured to have been a princess, possibly given to Light as a reward, or the island as her dowry, although other sources state that the princess was sent to enlist Light's aid on behalf of the Sultan.Leslie James, (2005) On The Trail of Francis Light, Founder of Modern Penang Two contemporaries of Light, historian William Marsden (who says that she was the daughter of the Sultan of Kedah), and Captain Elisha Trapaud (who describes the wedding of Light to a princess of the Sultan's family, bestowed upon him as a mark of the prince's gratitude) seem to confirm the story that she was of noble blood. However, John Crawford, later First Resident of Singapore, said in 1820 that Martina was not a princess, but a Portuguese woman from Siam, and Steuart points out that there is no evidence that Trapaud knew Light when the couple began living together. Other contemporary accounts name her as the daughter of the 19th Sultan of Kedah (Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II), by a lower-ranking wife of mixed Thai- Portuguese ancestry. She may have adopted her mother's name to emphasise her ancestry and \\"high birth\\". She was probably one of many Portuguese Eurasian Catholics who had fled religious persecution in southern Siam and to Kedah. There were a number of Rozells registered at George Town in 1788. There was also a Martinha (no surname) shown as being of Siam, with a son William, of Kedah. Steuart posits that Martina was the same person as the \\"Nonya\\" who took part in the earliest negotiations with the Sultan in 1770-1. This would support the idea that she was not a princess, but nevertheless had strong connections with both Siam and Kedah and therefore a useful person to employ in negotiations between the Sultan and the British at Aceh. If they were legally married, Light did not declare it. However, it was against East India Company rules to marry a Catholic and, as Martina was Catholic, Light may have tried to avoid dismissal by never declaring his marriage. He did leave her his considerable property. Either way, they cohabited for at least 22 years before his death. Light's business partners, James Scott and William Fairlie, were the executors of Light's will, and some versions of events have suggested that these two cheated Rozells out of some of her inheritance, namely their family residence and land, the Suffolk Estate. She did however inherit a bungalow in Penang. The EIC paid Rozells a pension, but she did not get justice with regard to her property in the British courts. Although she was regarded as Light's wife among the Eurasians and Thai community, she was not regarded as his official wife by the British. Rozells married a John Timmer at a ceremony at the chapel in Fort Cornwallis in 1799. =Family life, offspring = Light and his family lived in the first home built on the Suffolk Estate, four west of George Town. Their home was described as a \\"simple Anglo-Indian Garden House style of timber and attap construction\\", built within his pepper estate. (After Light's estate was settled in 1805, William Edward Phillips built a grand Georgian-styled mansion called Suffolk Park.) His eldest son, Colonel William Light, was the first Surveyor General of the Colony of South Australia; William is famous for choosing the site of the colony's capital, Adelaide, and designing the layout of the streets and parks in the Adelaide city centre, North Adelaide and the Adelaide Park Lands. The other son, Francis Lanoon Light II, was born in Penang in 1791, married a Javanese woman, Charlotte Aboni, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. He died in 1823. His descendants are the Capel family in Malaysia. Their daughters were named Sarah, Mary and Ann (aka \\"Lukey\\"). They all married in Calcutta. Sarah married General James Welsh, an EIC officer in the Madras Army. Mary married a wealthy indigo plantation owner, George Boyd,It must have been her wedding that her brother William attended. and Ann married a physician, Charles Hunter. By 1818, Welsh observed that his wife and her siblings had seen all of their mother's property disappear. In the arts In October 2019, co-commissioned by Adelaide's OzAsia festival and Penang's George Town Festival, a play was created and staged by Australian writer/director Thomas Henning in collaboration with Malaysian duo TerryandTheCuz, named Light. Rather than presenting a straight historical narrative, the play explores the personal circumstances first of Light and his pivotal role in Penang's modern history, and then of his son William in Adelaide. The roles of the women in their lives are interrogated, as well as the various colonial, trade and personal ambitions of the British government, the East India Company and individuals in their lives. It shows how their lives were influenced by global politics, in particular the rise of the British Empire in the Eastern hemisphere. The life of Martina Rozells is also brought to life.

Retrieved on August 16, 2010. The prison in Jackson was destroyed during the Civil War, and the state did not replace it for decades. Instead, the state conducted convict leasing, leasing prisoners to third parties for their labor. The lessees held custody of the inmates and provided their room and board, often substandard. The state made substantial amounts of money from these arrangements, which created an incentive to have minor infractions criminalized in order to arrest more people and sentence them. Increasing the number of crimes for which persons could be arrested, such as vagrancy, resulted in an increased pool of prisoners to lease out, as many could not raise enough cash to pay fines or fees that were sometimes imposed. Most prisoners were freedmen; the state used this system to extract labor from former slaves and keep them suppressed socially.Slavery by Any Other Name The state officially changed its policy at the end of the 19th century, saying that prisoners sentenced by the State could no longer be hired or leased by third parties, effective after December 31, 1894. After ending the convict leasing system, the State of Mississippi began to acquire property to build prisons. The state bought the Rankin Farm in 1895 in Rankin County, from Jackson; it is now the site of the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. Later the state purchased the Oakley Farm, located in Hinds County, from Jackson. The state government purchased land in Sunflower County in January 1901, where it developed the Parchman Farm (now Mississippi State Penitentiary).\\"Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) Photo Collections .\\" Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Retrieved on August 12, 2010. The prison properties were largely self-sufficient, raising their own crops and livestock, as well as commodity crops such as cotton for the state to sell. All the labor was by prisoners. The state Department of Corrections was established in 1976 to oversee the existing Mississippi state prisons.Oshinsky, David M.: Worse Than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice. Free Press, 1997. p. 249. Both federal and state laws were passed during various campaigns of \\"wars on crime\\" and \\"wars on drugs;\\" not only were new behaviors criminalized, but politicians supported mandatory sentencing and lengthier sentences. By the end of the 20th century, Mississippi had one of the largest state prison systems in the country, with a rising number of persons incarcerated even as crime rates fell. A disproportionate number and percentage of African Americans and other people of color have been incarcerated under these policies. In addition to the major state prisons, the state developed many community detention centers for prisoners with lower security classifications. They were provided as workers to numerous locales, in part to prepare them for reintegration into society after release. Because of the dramatic climb in the number of prisoners and demand for space, the state legislature authorized MDOC to enter into contracts with for-profit prison management companies for the construction and operation of private prisons in the state. By the early 21st century, the state had contracts with operators of six private prisons. Civil rights groups and prisoner advocates have filed class-action suits in efforts to improve prison conditions and protect prisoner rights. As a result of such a suit against Unit 32 (Death Row lockdown unit) at Mississippi State Penitentiary, the state and the ACLU worked out a settlement in 2006 that changed processes and dramatically reduced the use of punitive solitary confinement in the state. In 2009 and 2014, the state passed legislation to provide more flexibility in sentencing and parole of certain classes of prisoners, reducing the prison population and returning non-violent offenders earlier to their families and communities. =Rise of private prisons= Changes in sentencing laws dramatically increased the prison population. In 1995 the state legislature passed a law requiring all prisoners to serve 85% of their sentence. The prison population more than doubled from 1995 to 2007, from 11,250 to 22,800, far outstripping capacity of the three state prisons.JFA Institute Dept of Justice, with assistance by MDOC, \\"Reforming Mississippi‚Äôs Prison System\\" , for the Public Safety Performance Project, the Pew Center on the States; 2008 Beginning in the late 20th century, the state dealt with the rising need to incarcerate individuals by contracting with private prison management companies, who built and operated a total of six prisons for state prisoners in Mississippi. Corrections Corporation of America and Cornell Companies were two early contractors; the latter was acquired by GEO Group in 2010, which took over its three contracts in Mississippi. Prisoners and their families made numerous complaints about conditions in these facilities, citing high rates of violence and sexual abuse, rampant drugs, lack of medical care and education, and other problems. Class action suits were filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project against two private facilities with the most egregious conditions: they filed suit against Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in 2010. This case was settled in federal court in 2012, requiring the state to quickly transfer youth offenders to a state-run facility to be operated according to juvenile justice standards. They were transferred to Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. In addition, the state was prohibited from using solitary confinement for any youthful offender. WGCF was converted to be used for adults only. MDOC ended its contract with GEO Group, awarding a 10-year contract to Management and Training Corporation for Walnut Grove and two other private facilities, effective July 1, 2012. The court supervision of conditions at WGCF was extended because of two prison riots in 2014. Due to declining need, the state closed the prison in September 2016. The ACLU and SPLC filed suit against the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, established for prisoners with serious mental illness, in 2013. The class-action suit at East Mississippi Correctional Facility is proceeding; the court affirmed the status of the plaintiffs in 2015. =Sentencing, control and parole reforms= At the same time, the state was seeking to reduce the prison population. Studies had found that minor reductions in length of sentence did not affect the rate of recidivism, showing that prisoners could be paroled earlier for certain types of crimes without affecting public safety.Institute, Dept of Justice, \\"Reforming Mississippi‚Äôs Prison System\\", pp. 3-4 In 2008, the state passed SB 2136, to enable non-violent prisoners to again be eligible for parole after they had served 25% of their sentence. The new law was estimated to affect \\"approximately 4,500 inmates, or about 25% of the 22,800 total population. A unique feature of SB 2136 was that it was applied retroactively in order to have an immediate impact on the prison population and to ensure equity in the sentencing process. About 3,000 inmates or 12% of the total population had already met their time-served requirement and were immediately eligible for parole consideration.\\" To aid prison officials and parole boards in assessing candidates, the Bureau of Justice Assistance developed a science-based risk assessment instrument to apply. By August 2009, some 3100 prisoners had been paroled from prison. The Board's use of the new risk assessment instrument resulted in their having a higher rate of parole approval. The parole revocation rate has not changed, and in the first year, only 5 of the people returned to prison for new crimes, a rate of 0.2% that was a fraction of the national rate of 10.5%.Institute, Dept of Justice, \\"Reforming Mississippi‚Äôs Prison System\\", p. 5 Legislative amendments have been passed in 2009 increased the ability of MDOC to reduce the number of prisoners; one of these authorized the department to place most \\"persons convicted of most drug crimes to be placed under house arrest with electronic monitoring. =Closing of private facilities= Both the state and private prison operators have had difficulty maintaining staffing in prisons because of low wages and high turnover. By 2011, MDOC operated below capacity due to the success of its efforts to reduce the prison population. As of 2011, the state prisons were below capacity by more than 2,000 spaces. With private prisons included, that was about 4,000 beds below capacity.Crisp, Elizabeth. \\"Early release strategies produce empty prison beds.\\" The Clarion-Ledger. October 1, 2011. Retrieved on October 6, 2011. MDOC closed the Delta Correctional Facility in January 2012, and Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in September 2016. By early 2017 Mississippi had no state prisoners at the for-profit Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility; the prison operator CCA had contracts with California and other states to house their prisoners at this privately owned site. By March 2017, MDOC was using only three privately run prisons for its inmates. In early 2017, Interim Commissioner Pelicia Hall (appointed in March 2017 as Commissioner) conducted raids for contraband at these private prisons, collecting much material. She is determined to reduce the traffic in contraband, which contributes to corruption in the prisons, including among the guards and staff. =Operation Mississippi Hustle= As a result of a five-year statewide investigation known as Operation Mississippi Hustle, in November 2014 the federal Department of Justice announced indictments of former Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps (who resigned the day before) and Cecil B. McCrory, a businessman and former Republican state legislator, on 49 counts of corruption, bribery and kickbacks.\\"MDOC official: Corruption \\"deep and wide\\"\\" (Archive); Jerry Mitchell, 6 November 2014, The Clarion-Ledger Newspaper reports have indicated widespread corruption related to contracts for prison services, and within the prisons themselves. This includes millions paid in bribes related to awarding of state contracts, drugs and other contraband being smuggled into facilities by the guards, sex between staff and inmates, and other abuses. Epps was charged with receiving $1.47 million in bribes and kickbacks, related to $800 million worth of state contracts made over about a decade. Both Epps and McCrory pleaded guilty in 2015 and cooperated with investigators on identifying others responsible. Eight other indictments followed, with one waived and more expected. Defendants include consultant and businessman Robert Simmons, who was sentenced to 87 months; former mayor of Walnut Grove, Mayor William Grady Sims, who was prosecuted earlier and sentenced to 7 months; former legislator and Republican businessman Sam Waggoner, former Harrison County Supervisor William Martin, who committed suicide before arraignment; former Alcorn County warden and Democratic state Senator Irb Benjamin, Dr. Carl Reddix, Terese Malone, Mark Longoria, and Guy \\"Butch\\" Evans.

In 2013, the agency budget for prisons was about $389 million, according to the Brookings Institution. Journalist Jerry Mitchell explored the consensus by experts who have found that the state could keep more people out of prison by stressing good education from a young age, and recommended improving schools in poor rural areas rather than building prisons. African Americans are incarcerated at a rate three times that of whites in the state but could be helped by good education from a young age.\\"Mississippi 'addicted to incarceration'\\"; Jerry Mitchell, 25 October 2014, The Clarion-Ledger Prison guards start at just twelve dollars an hour. They receive just six week's training. =Recidivism= Nationwide, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (of the US Department of Justice) says that about three-quarters of those released from prison are arrested again in the next five years. That figure spans a wide range of actions for which a person may be arrested. Mississippi measures its recidivism differently: whether a person released from prison is convicted of another crime and imprisoned within three years. Based on those criteria, its recidivism rate is about 33%. Its parolees have had considerable success after the state officials adopted a risk assessment instrument in 2009, to evaluate which candidates for parole under a new law designed to reduce the prison population of persons convicted of non- violent crime.

Collins English Dictionary Ukrainian and , Halychyna; ; Czech and ; ; ; ; , Galitsiya; Galitsiye) is a historical and geographic region between Central and Eastern Europe.See also: It was once the small Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia and later a crown land of Austria- Hungary, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, which straddled the modern-day border between Poland and Ukraine. The area, named after the medieval city of Halych, was first mentioned in Hungarian historical chronicles in the year 1206 as Galici√¶. In 1253 Prince Daniel of Galicia was crowned the King of Rus () or King of Ruthenia following the Mongol invasion in Ruthenia (Kyivan Rus). In 1352 the Kingdom of Poland annexed the Kingdom of Galicia and Volhynia as the Ruthenian Voivodeship (). The nucleus of historic Galicia lies within the modern regions of western Ukraine: the Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts near Halych. In the 18th century, territories that later became part of the modern Polish regions of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Subcarpathian Voivodeship and Silesian Voivodeship were added to Galicia. It covers much of such historic regions as Red Ruthenia (centered on Lviv) and Lesser Poland (centered in Krak√≥w). Galicia became contested ground between Poland and Ruthenia from medieval times, and in the 20th century between Poland and Ukraine. In the 10th century, several cities were founded in Galicia, such as Volodymyr and Jaroslaw, whose names mark their connections with Grand Princes of Kyiv. There is considerable overlap between Galicia and Podolia (to the east) as well as between Galicia and south-west Ruthenia, especially in a cross-border region (centred on Carpathian Ruthenia) inhabited by various nationalities. Origins and variations of the name Map of the Principality of Halych in the 13th century, which formed the nucleus of what later became Galicia Annexation of the Kingdom of Ruthenia by the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars Andrew II, King of Hungary from 1205 to 1235, claimed the title ' (\\"King of Galicia and Lodomeria\\") ‚Äì a Latinised version of the Slavic names Halych and Volodymyr, the major cities of the principality of Halych-Volhynia, which the Hungarians ruled from 1214 to 1221. Halych-Volhynia had cut a swathe as a mighty principality under the rule of Prince Roman the Great (Roman Mstislavich) from 1170 to 1205. After the expulsion of the Hungarians in 1221, Ruthenians took back rule of the area. Roman's son Daniel of Galicia (Prince of Galicia until 1255) was crowned king of Halych-Volhynia in 1253. About 1247 Daniel of Galicia founded Lviv (), named in honour of his son Leo I, who later moved the capital northwestwards from Halych to Lviv in 1272. The Ukrainian name ' () (' in Polish, in Russian, ' in Latin) comes from the Khwalis or Kaliz who occupied the area from the time of the Magyars. They were also called ' in Greek, and ' () in Ukrainian. Some historians speculated that the name had to do with a group of people of Thracian origin (i.e. Getae) Galicia and Lodomeria at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine who during the Iron Age moved into the area after the Roman conquest of Dacia in 106 CE and may have formed the Lypytsia culture with the Venedi people who moved into the region at the end of Le T√®ne period (La T√®ne culture). The Lypytsia culture supposedly replaced the existing Thracian Hallstatt (see Thraco-Cimmerian) and Vysotske cultures. Connection with Celtic peoples supposedly explains the relation of the name \\"Galicia\\" to many similar place names found across Europe and Asia Minor, such as ancient or Gaul (modern France, Belgium, and northern Italy), Galatia (in Asia Minor), the Iberian Peninsula's Galicia, and Romanian . Some other scholars assert that the name Halych has Slavic origins ‚Äì from halytsa, meaning \\"a naked (unwooded) hill\\", or from halka which means \\"jackdaw\\". Max Vasmer points to Russian galitsa, an adjectival form meaning \\"jackdaw\\" ‚Äì see Galich in Russisches Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch (1950‚Äì1958). (The jackdaw featured as a charge in the city's coat of arms Halych coat of arms: 14th century and later also in the coat of arms of Galicia-Lodomeria. Coat of arms of Galicia-Lodomeria The name, however, predates the coat of arms, which may represent canting or simply folk etymology). Although Ruthenians drove out the Hungarians from Halych-Volhynia by 1221, Hungarian kings continued to add ' to their official titles. In 1349, in the course of the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars, King Casimir III the Great of Poland conquered the major part of Galicia and put an end to the independence of this territory. Upon the conquest Casimir adopted the following title: > Casimir by the grace of God king of Poland and Rus (Ruthenia), lord and heir > of the land of Krak√≥w, Sandomierz, Sieradz, ≈Åƒôczyca, Kuyavia, Pomerania > (Pomerelia). . Following the death of Casimir in 1370, Poland entered into a personal union with Hungary (1370‚Äì1382) and Ruthenia (Galicia) came under the rule of a Ruthenian lord, Vladislaus II of Opole, appointed by the King of Hungary. Later Galicia was ruled for a short time by various Hungarian voivodes of Ruthenia. Under the Jagiellonian dynasty (Kings of Poland from 1386 to 1572), the Kingdom of Poland revived and reconstituted its territories. In place of historic Galicia there appeared the Ruthenian Voivodeship. In 1526, after the death of Louis II of Hungary, the Habsburgs inherited the Hungarian claims to the titles of the Kingship of Galicia and Lodomeria, together with the Hungarian crown. In 1772 the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, used those historical claims to justify her participation in the First Partition of Poland. In fact, the territories acquired by Austria did not correspond exactly to those of former Halych- Volhynia ‚Äì the Russian Empire took control of Volhynia to the north-east, including the city of Volodymyr-Volynskyi () ‚Äì after which Lodomeria was named. On the other hand, much of Lesser Poland ‚Äì and (1772‚Äì1918), (1772‚Äì1809), (1795‚Äì1809), and (1846‚Äì1918) ‚Äì became part of Austrian Galicia. Moreover, despite the fact that Austria's claim derived from the historical Hungarian crown, \\"Galicia and Lodomeria\\" were not officially assigned to Hungary, and after the of 1867, the territory found itself in Cisleithania, or the Austrian-administered part of Austria-Hungary. The full official name of the new Austrian territory was the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria with the Duchies of and Zator. After the incorporation of the Free City of Krak√≥w in 1846, it was extended to Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, and the Grand Duchy of Krak√≥w with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator (). Each of those entities was formally separate; they were listed as such in the Austrian emperor's titles, each had its distinct coat-of-arms and flag. For administrative purposes, however, they formed a single province. The duchies of Auschwitz () and Zator were small historical principalities west of , on the border with Prussian Silesia. Lodomeria, under the name Volhynia, remained under the rule of the Russian Empire ‚Äì see Volhynian Governorate.

In Roman times, the region was populated by various tribes of Celto-Germanic admixture, including Celtic-based tribes ‚Äì like the Galice or \\"Gaulics\\" and Bolihinii or \\"Volhynians\\" ‚Äì the Lugians and Cotini of Celtic, Vandals and Goths of Germanic origins (the Przeworsk and P√∫chov cultures). During the Great Migration period of Europe (coinciding with the fall of the Roman Empire), a variety of nomadic groups invaded the area,Tadeusz Sulimirski, The Sarmatians, vol. 73 in series \\"Ancient People and Places\\", London: Thames & Hudson, 1970. but overall, the East Slavic tribes White Croats and Tivertsi dominated the area since the 6th century until were annexed to Kyivan Rus in the 10th century. In the 12th century, a Rurikid Principality of Halych (Halicz, Halics, Galich, Galic) formed there, which merged at the end of the century with the neighbouring Volhynia into the Principality of Halych Volhynia. Galicia and Volhynia had originally been two separate Rurikid principalities, assigned on a rotating basis to younger members of the Kyivan dynasty. The line of Prince Roman the Great of Vladimir- in-Volhynia had held the principality of Volhynia, while the line of Yaroslav Osmomysl held the Principality of Halych (later adopted as Galicia). Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was created following the death in 1198 or 1199 (and without a recognised heir in the paternal line) of the last Prince of Galicia, Vladimir II Yaroslavich; Roman acquired the Principality of Galicia and united his lands into one state. Roman's successors would mostly use Halych (Galicia) as the designation of their combined kingdom. In Roman's time Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia's principal cities were Halych and Volodymyr-in-Volhynia. In 1204, Roman captured Kyiv, while being in alliance with Poland, he signed a peace treaty with Hungary and established diplomatic relations with the Byzantine Empire.Roman Mstyslavych ‚Äì Encyclopaedia of Ukraine Reconstruction of the historic border (1772‚Äì1918) between Austrian Galicia and Austrian Silesia in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça In 1205, Roman turned against his Polish allies, leading to a conflict with Leszek the White and Konrad of Masovia. Roman was subsequently killed in the Battle of Zawichost (1205), and his dominion entered a period of rebellion and chaos. Thus weakened, Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia became an arena of rivalry between Poland and Hungary. King Andrew II of Hungary styled himself ', Latin for \\"king of Galicia and Vladimir [in- Volhynia]\\", a title that later was adopted in the House of Habsburg. In a compromise agreement made in 1214 between Hungary and Poland, the throne of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was given to Andrew's son, Coloman of Lodomeria. In 1352, when the principality was divided between the Polish Kingdom and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the territory became subject to the Polish Crown. With the Union of Lublin in 1569 Poland and Lithuania merged to form the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted for 200 years until conquered and divided up by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In 1772 with the partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, the south-eastern part of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was awarded to the Habsburg Empress Maria- Theresa, whose bureaucrats named it the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, after one of the titles of the princes of Hungary, although its borders coincided but roughly with those of the former medieval principality.Larry Wolff, The Idea of Galicia: History and Fantasy in Habsburg Political Culture (Sanford University Press, 2012), p. 1 Known informally as Galicia, it became the largest, most populous, and northernmost province of the Austrian Empire until the dissolution of that monarchy at the end of World War I in 1918, when it ceased to exist as a geographic entity. Siege of Przemy≈õl in 1915 During the First World War, Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the Central Powers. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier battle in the opening months of the war.Buttar, Prit. Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914. Oxford, UK; New York, NY: Osprey Publishing, 2016. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive. In 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored Republic of Poland, which absorbed the Lemko-Rusyn Republic. The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the \\"West Ukrainian People's Republic\\". During the Polish-Soviet War the Soviets tried to establish the puppet-state of the Galician SSR in East Galicia, the government of which after a couple of months was liquidated. The fate of Galicia was settled by the Peace of Riga on 18 March 1921, attributing Galicia to the Second Polish Republic. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized on 15 May 1923.French: Les Alli√©s reconnaissent √† la Pologne la possession de la Galicie, Chronologie des civilisations, Jean Delorme, Paris, 1956. The Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of Volhynia made up about 12% of the Second Polish Republic population, and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving rise to the militant underground Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. People Peasants and Jews from Galicia, c. 1886 In 1773, Galicia had about 2.6 million inhabitants in 280 cities and market towns and approximately 5,500 villages. There were nearly 19,000 noble families, with 95,000 members (about 3% of the population). The serfs accounted for 1.86 million, more than 70% of the population. A small number were full-time farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions. Galicia had arguably the most ethnically diverse population of all the countries in the Austrian monarchy, consisting mainly of Poles and \\"Ruthenians\\"; the peoples known later as Ukrainians and Rusyns, as well as ethnic Jews, Germans, Armenians, Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Roma and others. In Galicia as a whole, the population in 1910 was estimated to be 45.4% Polish, 42.9% Ruthenian, 10.9% Jewish, and 0.8% German.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University ofToronto Press. Pg. 424. This population was not evenly distributed. The Poles lived mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians predominant in the eastern region (\\"Ruthenia\\"). At the turn of the twentieth century, Poles constituted 78.7% of the whole population of Western Galicia, Ruthenians 13.2%, Jews 7.6%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.2%. The respective data for Eastern Galicia show the following numbers: Ruthenians 64.5%, Poles 21.0%, Jews 13.7%, Germans 0.3%, and others 0.5%.Piotr Eberhardt.

(2003). The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 134 Linguistically, the Polish language was predominant in Galicia. According to the 1910 census 58.6% of the combined population of both western and eastern Galicia spoke Polish as its mother tongue compared to 40.2% who spoke a Ruthenian language.Anstalt G. Freytag & Berndt (1911). Geographischer Atlas zur Vaterlandskunde an der √∂sterreichischen Mittelschulen. Vienna: K. u. k. Hof-Kartographische. \\"Census December 31st 1910\\" The number of Polish-speakers may have been inflated because Jews were not given the option of listing Yiddish as their language.Timothy Snyder. (2003).The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press, pg. 134 The Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to by the region of Germany where they originated (such as Saxony or Swabia). For inhabitants who spoke different native languages, e.g. Poles and Ruthenians, identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualism blurred the ethnic divisions again. Religiously, Galicia was predominantly Christian. Catholicism was practiced in two rites. Poles were Roman Catholic, while Ukrainians belonged to the Greek Catholic Church. Judaism represented the third largest religious group, and notably, Galicia was the center of Hasidism. Economy The new state borders cut Galicia off from many of its traditional trade routes and markets of the Polish sphere, resulting in stagnation of economic life and decline of Galician towns. Lviv lost its status as a significant trade centre. After a short period of limited investments, the Austrian government started the fiscal exploitation of Galicia and drained the region of manpower through conscription to the imperial army. The Austrians decided that Galicia should not develop industrially but remain an agricultural area that would serve as a supplier of food products and raw materials to other Habsburg provinces. New taxes were instituted, investments were discouraged, and cities and towns were neglected.P. R. Magocsi. (1983). Galicia: A Historical Survey and Bibliographic Guide.

Patterns of European Industrialisation: The Nineteenth Century. pg. 230. Conversion from 1970 to 2010 dollars here and according to Norman Davies, could be considered \\"the poorest province in Europe\\". =Oil and natural gas industry= Rail lines of Galicia before 1897 Near Drohobych and Boryslav in Galicia, significant oil reserves were discovered and developed during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The first European attempt to drill for oil was in B√≥brka in western Galicia in 1854. By 1867, a well at Kleczany, in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters. On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borys≈Çaw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened. British engineer John Simeon Bergheim and Canadian William Henry McGarvey came to Galicia in 1882. In 1883, their company, MacGarvey and Bergheim, bored holes of 700 to 1,000 meters and found large oil deposits. In 1885, they renamed their oil developing enterprise the Galician- Karpathian Petroleum Company (), headquartered in Vienna, with McGarvey as the chief administrator and Bergheim as a field engineer, and built a huge refinery at Maryampole near Gorlice, south of Tarnow. Considered the biggest, most efficient enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole was built in six months and employed 1000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the oil and natural gas industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of petroleum enterprises to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borys≈Çaw of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the \\"Polish Baku\\", the oil fields of Borys≈Çaw and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borys≈Çaw had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13. Galicia was the Central Powers' only major domestic source of oil during the Great War.

His mother was a Shoshone Indian known as Sacagawea. He spoke French and English and learned German and Spanish during his six years in Europe from 1823 to 1829. He spoke Shoshone and other western American Indian languages, which he picked up during his years of trapping and guiding. Jean Baptiste was the son of Sacagawea, a Shoshone, and her French Canadian husband Toussaint Charbonneau, the former who worked as a guide and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jean Baptiste was born at Fort Mandan in North Dakota. In his early childhood, he accompanied his parents as they traveled across the country. The expedition co-leader William Clark nicknamed the boy Pompey (\\"Pomp\\" or \\"Little Pomp\\"). After the death of his mother, he lived with Clark in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended St. Louis Academy. Clark paid for his education. Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau also had a second child, a daughter named Lizette Charbonneau; however, because she receives only occasional mention in Clark's papers, her life remains unclear beyond her third birthday.Bot generated title --> Charbonneau and Sacagawea appear on the United States Sacagawea dollar bronze one dollar coin. He is the second child depicted on United States currency. Pompeys Pillar on the Yellowstone River in Montana and the community of Charbonneau, Oregon are named for him. Childhood =Lewis and Clark Expedition= Jean Baptiste Charbonneau was born to Sacagawea, a Shoshone, and her husband, the French Canadian trapper Toussaint Charbonneau, in early 1805 at Fort Mandan in North Dakota. This was during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which wintered there in 1804‚Äì05. The senior Charbonneau had been hired by the expedition as an interpreter and, learning that his pregnant wife was Shoshone, the captains Lewis and Clark agreed to bring her along. They knew they would need to negotiate with the Shoshone for horses at the headwaters of the Missouri River. Meriwether Lewis noted the boy's birth in his journal: The infant traveled from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean and back, carried along in the expedition's boats or upon his mother's back. His presence is often credited by historians with assuring native tribes of the expedition's peaceful intentions, as they believed that no war party would travel with a woman and child. =After the expedition= In April 1807, about a year after the end of the expedition, the Charbonneau family moved to St. Louis, at Clark's invitation. Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea departed for the Mandan villages in April 1809 and left the boy to live with Clark. In November 1809, the parents returned to St. Louis to try farming, but left again in April 1811\\\\. Jean Baptiste continued to reside with Clark. Clark's two-story home, built in 1818, contained an illuminated museum long by wide. Its walls were decorated with national flags and life-size portraits of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, Indian artifacts, and mounted animal heads. Upon visiting the museum, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a geologist and ethnographer, wrote, As a boy, Charbonneau learned from the vast collection. Clark paid for Charbonneau's education at St. Louis Academy, a Jesuit Catholic school (now called St. Louis University High School), although the expense was considerable for the time. The school's single classroom was then located in the storehouse of Clark's friend, the trader Joseph Robidoux. Brothers James and George Kennerly paid for Charbonneau's supplies for 1820 and were reimbursed by Clark: *January 22, 1820: payment to J. E. Welch for the two-quarters tuition of J. B. Charbonneau, a half-Indian boy, and firewood and ink. Amount = $16.37 *April 1, 1820: to J. & G. H.

Honor√© for lodging, boarding, and washing from 1 July to 30 September at $15.00 per month. Amount = $45.00 *March 31, 1822: to Louis Tesson Honore for boarding, lodging and washing of J. B. Charbonneau, a half Indian.. From June through September 1820 and in 1822, Jean Baptiste boarded with Louis Tesson Honor√©, a Clark family friend and member of his church, Christ Episcopal.. The general had helped organize the church in 1819. They lived in St. Ferdinand Township in St. Louis County, Missouri near Charbonneau's father's of land. Adult life On June 21, 1823, at age eighteen, Charbonneau met Duke Friedrich Paul Wilhelm of W√ºrttemberg, the nephew of King Friedrich I Wilhelm Karl of W√ºrttemberg.. Charbonneau was working at a Kaw Indian trading post on the Kansas River near present-day Kansas City, Kansas. Wilhelm was traveling in America on a natural history expedition to the northern plains with Jean Baptiste's father as his guide. On October 9, 1823, he invited the younger Charbonneau to return to Europe with him, which was agreed upon. The two set sail on the Smyrna from St. Louis in December 1823\\\\. Jean Baptiste lived at the duke's palace in W√ºrttemberg for nearly six years, where he learned German and Spanish and improved his English and French. The latter was still the dominant language of St. Louis, which had first enabled his conversations with the Duke. According to a 1932 translation of Wilhelm's journal by the historian Louis C. Butscher, Wilhelm wrote that Charbonneau was \\"‚Ä¶a companion on all my travels over Europe and northern Africa until 1829.\\". In 2001, Albert Furtwangler, PhD, questioned the accuracy of Butscher's German translation, noting two more recent translations of the duke's journals, and suggests that Charbonneau's role in Wilhelm's court may have been less intimate than Butscher's perhaps romanticized account implied... Charbonneau may have been hired as a servant, rather than invited as a companion. As support, he notes the apparent lack of further contact between the two men after Charbonneau's return to America. However, lack of contact in itself does not mean Charbonneau was a hired hand. Such an act may have been an insult to Clark, which the duke likely would have avoided... As with many aspects of his life, little is known for certain about Charbonneau's time in Europe. Children Parish records in Wuerttemberg show that while there, Charbonneau fathered a child with Anastasia Katharina Fries, a soldier's daughter. The baby, Anton Fries, died about three months after his birth. Nearly two decades later, while in California as an alcalde or magistrate, Charbonneau was recorded as being the father of another child. On May 4, 1848, Maria Catarina Charguana was born to Margarita Sobin, a Luise√±o woman, and Charbonneau. Sobin, 23 at the time, traveled to Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a near Los Angeles for the infant girl's baptism, performed on May 28, 1848, and recorded by Father Blas Ordaz as entry #1884. Margarita Sobin later married Gregory Trujillo, and some of their descendants may be members of the La Jolla Band of Mission Indians.\\"Maria Catarina Charguana, child of Margarita Sobin,\\" First Book of Baptisms. May 28, 1848, entry #1884, Plaza Church, Los Angeles, California Trapper and hunter 7th Baronet of Blair, 1837, by Alfred Jacob Miller In November 1829, Charbonneau returned to St. Louis, where he was hired by Joseph Robidoux as a fur trapper for the American Fur Company, to work in Idaho and Utah.. He attended the 1832 Pierre's Hole rendezvous while working for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. There he fought in the bloodiest non-military conflict that preceded the Plains Indian wars, which began in 1854. From 1833‚Äì1840 Charbonneau worked in the fur trade in the Rocky Mountain Trapping System. with other mountain men, such as Jim Bridger, James Beckwourth and Joe Meek.United States National Park Service: \\"Jean Baptiste Charbonneau,\\" The Lewis and Clark Journey of Discovery From 1840‚Äì42 he worked from Fort Saint Vrain, floating bison hides and tongues down the South Platte River to St. Louis. On one of the voyages, he camped with Captain John C. Fr√©mont on his cartographic expedition. In 1843, he guided Sir William Drummond Stewart, a Scottish baronet, on his second long trip to the American West, which was a lavish hunting expedition.. Seeking employment again, in 1844 Charbonneau went to Bent's Fort in Colorado, where he was a chief hunter, and worked also as a trader with southern Plains Indians. William Boggs, a traveler who met him, wrote that Charbonneau \\"‚Ä¶wore his hair long, [and] was‚Ä¶very high strung‚Ä¶\\" He reported, \\"‚Ä¶it was said Charbonneau (sic) was the best man on foot on the plains or in the Rocky Mountains.\\"Hafen LeRoy, \\"The W.M. Boggs Manuscript About Bent's Fort, Kit Carson, the Far West and Life Among the Indians,\\" The Colorado Magazine 7 (March 1930): pp. 45-69 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War In October 1846, Charbonneau, Antoine Leroux and Pauline Weaver were hired as scouts by General Stephen W. Kearny. Charbonneau's experience with military marches, such as with James William Abert in August 1845, along the Canadian River, and his fluency in Indian languages qualified him for the position. Kearny directed him to join Colonel Philip St. George Cooke on an arduous march from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to San Diego, California, a distance of . Their mission was to build the first wagon road to Southern California and to guide some 20 huge Murphy supply wagons to the west coast for the military during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. A contingent of soldiers made up of some 339 Mormon men and six Mormon women, known as the Mormon Battalion, were the builders of that new road over the uncharted southwest from Santa Fe to San Diego and Los Angeles. A memorial to the historic trek of the Mormon Battalion and their guide Charbonneau has been erected at the San Pedro River, one mile (1.6 km) north of the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border near the present-day town of Palominas, Arizona. Other monuments or historic markers are in Tucson, Arizona and in California at Box Canyon near Warner Springs, at Temecula, at Old Town San Diego and at Fort Moore in Los Angeles. Colonel Cooke's diary mentions Charbonneau some 29 times from November 16, 1846, to January 21, 1847. Eight of the twenty wagons reached Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, four miles (6 km) from today's Oceanside, California, and the leaders counted the expedition as a success. Cooke wrote of the Mormon Battalion, \\"History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry.\\". Known as Cooke's Road or the Gila Trail but more currently known as the Mormon Battalion Trail, the wagon road was used by settlers, miners, stagecoaches of the Butterfield Stage line and cattlemen driving longhorns to feed the gold camps. Parts of the route became the Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 66\\\\. Currently, the Boy Scouts of America gives an award for those who hike sections of this historic trail. In February 1848, knowledge gained about the region was used as the basis of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which established the United States-Mexico border in December 1853, following the Mexican-American War. Alcalde In November 1847, Charbonneau accepted an appointment from Colonel John D. Stevenson as alcalde (mayor) at Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. This position made him the only civilian authority, a combined sheriff, lawyer and magistrate, in a post- war region covering about . From 1834‚Äì50, the lands were owned by rancheros through legally questionable land grants. The rancheros hired local American Indians, mainly Luise√±o, to do agricultural work. Many functioned in virtual servitude, and some rancheros paid them only with liquor. Trying to correct abuses and also facilitate post-war control, in November 1847, Colonel Richard Barnes Mason, the territorial governor, ordered Charbonneau to force the sale of a large ranch owned by the powerful Jose Antonio Pico, whose family was politically connected. His brother Pio Pico had been the last governor of California under Mexico.See this page for . On January 1, 1848, Mason banned the sale of liquor to Indians. Such ordinances attacked the foundation of ranchero power and ability to do business. Eventually, the changes led to United States civilian control of California. Although Charbonneau was assisted by Captain J. D. Hunter as he negotiated with Pico, he saw that local resistance would make enforcing Mason's orders difficult. Charbonneau resigned his post in August 1848 and was soon followed by Hunter. California statehood on September 9, 1850, ended the post-war difficulties. Gold mining In September 1848, Charbonneau arrived in Placer County, California at the American River, near what is now Auburn. Arriving early in what became known as the California Gold Rush, he joined only a handful of prospectors. Panning was not done during the hard Sierra Nevada winter or spring runoff, so in June 1849, he joined Jim Beckwourth and two others at a camp on Buckner's Bar to mine the river at the Big Crevice. This claim \\"‚Ä¶was shallow and paid well\\".. Charbonneau lived at a site known as Secret Ravine, one of 12 ravines around Auburn. A successful miner, he kept working in the area for nearly sixteen years. A measure of his success was that Charbonneau could afford the mining region's highly inflated cost of living. For example, at a time when a good wage in the West was $30 per month, it cost $8‚Äì16 per day to live in Auburn. Transiency was high but Charbonneau was still there in 1860, working as the hotel manager at the Orleans HotelEighth Decennial Census, 1860 in Auburn. By 1858, many miners had left the California fields for other gold rushes. In April 1866, he departed for other opportunities at age 61. He may have headed for Montana to prospect for gold, although sites such as at Silver City and DeLamar in Idaho Territory were much closer. Death Inskip ruins It is not clear exactly why Charbonneau left Auburn, California, but the recessionary local economy was certainly a motivation. Before leaving he visited the Placer Herald newspaper and visited with an editor, who wrote later in his obituary, \\"...he was about [his purpose was] returning to familiar scenes\\".. Some of those \\"familiar scenes\\" may have been where he had lived and worked as a mountain man east of the Great Basin. His destination also may have been the Owyhee Mountains, where rich placer deposits were discovered in May 1863. Or perhaps he sought to reach Alder Gulch near Virginia City, Montana, because it had produced $31 million in gold by late 1865. Other possible destinations were the Bannock, Montana gold strikes or‚Äîas noted above‚Äîthe mines at Silver City (formerly Ruby City), Delamar or Boonville.. His route and travel method likely took him on a stagecoach over Donner Summit and east along the well- traveled Humboldt River Trail to Winnemucca, Nevada, then north to army Camp McDermitt at the Idaho border. Passing the camp in rugged terrain, the men reached an Owyhee River crossing at present-day Rome, Oregon, where an apparent accident occurred and Charbonneau went into the river. The accident's cause is unknown, but there are several possibilities. He may have been on a stagecoach operated by the Boise-Silver City-Winnemucca stage company that began its route in 1866 out of Camp McDermitt and in crossing the river, the coach sank. Or he may have been on horseback and fallen off the river bank or slipped out of the saddle while crossing. The Owyhee River in snow melt may have turned into whitewater. Other possibilities are he was injured on the land journey, inhaled alkali dust, or fell ill from drinking contaminated water. The ill Charbonneau was taken to Inskip Station in Danner, Oregon, built in 1865, about from the river and west of Jordan Valley. It is now a ghost town. The former stagecoach, mail stop and general store served travelers to Oregon and the California gold fields. It had its own well, and Charbonneau may have deteriorated from drinking the water. After his death there, his body was taken one-quarter mile north and interred at 42.9518¬∞N 117.339¬∞W, which is about southwest of Ontario. Charbonneau died on May 16, 1866. A death notice was sent by an unknown writer, likely one of two fellow travelers on the journey east, to the Owyhee Avalanche newspaper and it said he died of pneumonia.. This is the first documented evidence of his death. The Placer Herald obituary writer opined that he succumbed to the infamous \\"Mountain Fever\\", to which many illnesses in the West were attributed. Memorial to Charbonneau at Ft. Washakie His gravesite, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is on of land. (It is near the abandoned Anderson General Store, which is intact and appears to be in 1940s condition.) Now contained within the Ruby Ranch, the site was donated to Malheur County, Oregon by the owners. The gravesite has three historical markers. In 1971 the Malheur County Daughters of the American Revolution placed a marker. In 1973 the Oregon Historical Society installed a marker, reading: In 2000, a third marker was dedicated by the Lemhi Shoshone tribe. As the son of Sacagawea, a Northern Shoshone who lived in the Lemhi Valley, Charbonneau is considered one of their people. Earlier in the twentieth century, Dr Grace Raymond Hebard of the University of Wyoming, a political economist, not a historian or anthropologist, argued that Charbonneau died and was buried at the Shoshone Wind River Indian Reservation. Dr. Charles Eastman, a Santee Sioux and not of the Shoshone language group, did research that attempted to establish that Charbonneau's mother Sacagawea died at the reservation on April 9, 1884. Some believe that Charbonneau died in 1885 and was buried next to her. Memorials in their names were erected in 1933 at Ft. Washakie.Note: See photo of Charbonneau's memorial on this page, which gives his death as 1885 and states he was buried west of that site in the Wind River Mountains. Eastman did his research in 1924‚Äì25, interpreting oral history. But his translation has been superseded by documentary evidence for both Charbonneau and Sacagawea. In 1964 an edited nineteenth-century journal was published stating that Sacagawea died much earlier, on December 20, 1812, of a \\"putrid fever\\" (possible following childbirth) at Fort Manuel Lisa on the Missouri River.Luttig, John. Journal of a Fur-Trading Expedition on Upper Missouri, 1812‚Äì13, ed. Stella Drumm, New York: Argosy-Antiquarian Ltd., 1964 Four 19th-century documents support this earlier date, including a statement by William Clark years after the 1805‚Äì07 Lewis and Clark expedition that \\"Sacajawea was dead.\\".

It began life as a busy commercial and industrial area just to the west of the central city. After World War II, Syracuse's central city became less and less populated as more housing and business facilities were built in the suburbs. In the 1980s, plans were first made to transform the languishing district into a small shopping/arts/nightlife district surrounding the former Syracuse Armory. These plans came to fruition during the 1990s, when new stores and restaurants opened, and several new buildings were constructed in a compatible style to the middle and late 1800s and early 1900s architecture dominating the district. Current day Today, Armory Square is the home of some of Syracuse's better restaurants, at least two coffeehouses, a radio station company, dozens of small shops selling everything from band instruments to used records to women's clothing, several bars and nightclubs, Urban Outfitters, Armory Massage Therapy, a newly restored upscale hotel, and two tattoo parlors. A number of professional firms are also located in Armory Square, including Eric Mower and Associates, O'Brien & Gere, and the Sugarman Law Firm. The area is popular with students from Syracuse University and Le Moyne College. Its borders are generally considered to be the circular road around the armory (Jefferson Street) to the south, Onondaga Creek to the west, Washington Street to the north, and Clinton Street to the east. Armory Square is also home to the Shot Clock Monument. A paved multi-use trail, the Onondaga Creekwalk, connects the neighborhood with Onondaga Lake.http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/syracuse_creekwalk_opens_conne.html In June 2009 the book Then and Now: Armory Square was published by Arcadia Publishing. Written by Robert J. Podfigurny and George W. Curry, the book contains side by side historic and current pictures of historic buildings in Armory Square along with information about the buildings, architecture, past tenants, and more. Historic pictures were contributed in part by the Onondaga Historical Association. Vintage postcard of the Armory Armory Square Historic District Forty-six industrial and commercial buildings make up the Armory Square Historic District. West Fayette Street is the northern boundary of the district, the rear property lines of the buildings on South Clinton Street the eastern boundary. The southern boundary is a raised railroad track, while the western boundary includes the buildings on Walton Street. The buildings in the district include the Armory, a railroad station, hotels, warehouses and commercial buildings. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. and Accompanying 36 photos from 1983 = Contributing properties = {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"width:98%\\" ! ! width=\\"18%\\" Landmark name ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Image !Date Built !Style !Location ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Description -- !     1874   307-09 South Clinton Street  5 stories; brick commercial building; segmental window arches; fifth story added 1885 -- !     1874   311-13 South Clinton Street  4 stories; brick commercial building; recessed windows; fancy cornice -- !

It lies along Danner Road off U.S. Route 95 west of Jordan Valley. Jordan Creek flows by Danner. History The old Idaho-Oregon-Nevada highway ran through Danner, following the route of the Skinner Toll Road which opened the area for settlement in 1863. Danner is the location of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau's resting place. He was the youngest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition as the infant son of Sacagawea. Charbonneau died here in 1866 at the age of 61 after developing pneumonia while passing through the area. His burial site was located, marked and fenced off through the efforts of Danner residents Kirt and Johanna Skinner, and it was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 1973. Charbonneau's resting place lies among five other resting places near the \\"Inskip Station\\", a fortified stone ranch house that operated as a stage station in the 1860s. Inskip's property was later known as the Ruby Ranch. A plaque marks the remains of Inskip Station within sight of the resting place of Charbonneau. A town had been platted and promoted as Ruby Townsite by Harley J. Hooker, who sold land for $1.25 per acre when the Jordan Valley Irrigation District began constructing an irrigation dam and canal system near Danner about 1910.Skinner, p. 116 The proposed agricultural town never grew as anticipated, however, since the high desert's harsh climate did not allow farmers to produce a wide enough range of crops. Hooker built a single story lava rock office building in Danner about 1915. After his death in 1919 it was used as the Danner community hall for a number of years. It became unsafe and was demolished a few years ago. The name of the community comes from John H. Danner, an early area settler. The Postal Service denied an application to call the post office Ruby for the nearby Ruby Ranch, but in 1920 the post office name Danner was approved. The post office operated until 1942. By the 1930s, Danner had a general store run by Jesse Anderson, a Danish immigrant. The building he constructed is still standing today, a half mile south of the site of Inskip Station. Climate According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Danner has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps.

She was later selected for conversion into a command ship in 1963‚Äì1964, but instead of becoming a command ship she was converted to the Major Communications Relay Ship Arlington (AGMR-2) in 1965. Saipan was laid down on 10 July 1944 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, launched on 8 July 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John W. McCormack, and commissioned on 14 July 1946, Capt. John G. Crommelin in command. Service history =Commissioned= Commissioned 11 months after the close of World War II, Saipan trained student pilots out of Pensacola, Florida, from September 1946 to April 1947 when, reassigned to Norfolk, Virginia, as homeport, she departed the Gulf of Mexico; participated in exercises in the Caribbean; then proceeded to Philadelphia for overhaul. In November, she returned to Pensacola; but, in late December, after training midshipmen, steamed back to the east coast to serve with the Operational Development Force. In February 1948, however, her work in jet operational techniques, carrier support tactics, and electronic instrument evaluation was interrupted briefly. From the 7th to the 24th, she was engaged in transporting the United States delegation to the Venezuelan Presidential inauguration and back. On her return, she conducted local operations off the Virginia Capes, and in April, after a visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, she resumed work for the Operational Development Force. On 18 April, she also relieved as flagship of Carrier Division 17 (CarDiv 17). =Fighter Squadron 17A= On 19 April, she departed Norfolk for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where, on 3 May, she embarked Fighter Squadron 17A. Three days later, all squadron pilots had qualified in FH-1 Phantom jets. The squadron had become the first carrier-based jet squadron. Back at Norfolk by the end of the month, Saipan was relieved of flagship duties. In June, she returned to New England waters; and, in July, she commenced overhaul at Norfolk. In December, she resumed local operations. On 24 December, she was ordered to embark two of the Navy's latest type helicopter, the XHJS-1, and three Marine Corps HRP-1 helicopters and proceeded north to Greenland to assist in the rescue of eleven airmen downed on the ice cap. Departing Norfolk on Christmas Day, she arrived off Cape Farewell on 28 December and prepared to launch the helicopters as soon as weather allowed. On 29 December however, a C-47, equipped with jet assist takeoff and skis, landed on the ice, took on the marooned airmen and made it out again. Saipan then returned to Norfolk, arrived on 31 December, and sailed again on 28 January 1949. Steaming south, she conducted exercises out of Guantanamo Bay into March and returned to Hampton Roads on 10 March. From 11‚Äì19 March, she conducted operations for the development force; then made a reserve training cruise to Canada. At the end of May, she again commenced work for the Operational Development Force. Three months later, she conducted her second reservist cruise of the year, then qualified Royal Canadian Navy pilots in carrier landings. From November 1949- March 1951, Saipan remained on the east coast, operating from the Virginia Capes south. On 6 March 1951, she got underway as flagship, CarDiv 14, and sailed for duty with the Sixth Fleet. Deployed for three months, she plied the waters of the western Mediterranean until the end of May, then headed for home. On 8 June, she was back at Norfolk, whence she resumed operations in the western Atlantic from Greenland to the Caribbean. For over two years, Saipan continued Second Fleet operations, interrupting them for midshipman cruises during the summers of 1952 and 1953 and for an overhaul. In October 1953, she departed the east coast and steamed for the Panama Canal and the Pacific. On 30 October, she arrived at San Diego, whence she continued on to Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, and duty off the coast of Korea in support of the uneasy truce agreement. FH-1 Phantom of VF-17A on Saipan, May 1948. Assigned to TF 95, Saipan was primarily engaged in surveillance and reconnaissance missions along the coast and in inspection patrols of the islands just south of the 38th parallel. In January 1954, she interrupted her patrols to provide air support for Japanese manned LSTs ferrying former Chinese POWs from Inchon to new homes on Taiwan. In early February, she participated in amphibious exercises in the Ryukyus, then returned to Inchon to stand by in the event she was needed for an evacuation of Indian troops from Panmunjom. In March, amphibious exercises took her to the Bonins. She then returned to Japan, but instead of resuming truce patrols, she took on 25 AU-variant Corsairs and five H-19A helicopters at Yokosuka and steamed south. On 18 April, VMA-324 pilots flew the AUs off her flight deck and landed them at Tourane (now Danang) Air Base, to support the French A√©ronavale fighting at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in the latest days of the First Indochina War. There the aircraft were turned over to French forces. Later in the day, Saipan entered the harbor, offloaded spare parts and maintenance personnel, and departed for Manila. On 20 April, she delivered the helicopters to Air Force personnel in the Philippines; and, at the end of the month, she resumed operations off the coast of Korea. On 8 May, Saipan put into Sasebo, and, through the 24th, remained in Japanese waters. On the 25th, she got underway to return to Norfolk via the Suez Canal. On 20 July, she completed her round the world cruise. Hurricane Hazel In October, Saipan again sailed south to the Caribbean. Arriving as Hurricane Hazel hit the Greater Antilles, razing areas of Hispaniola, the carrier was immediately assigned to relief work. From 13‚Äì20 October, she delivered food and medical supplies and personnel to isolated areas of Haiti; then, after being honored by the Haitian government, she returned to Norfolk. On 1 November, she entered the shipyard there for overhaul, and, in April, resumed operations with a cruise to the Caribbean. In June, she was again attached to the aviation training center at Pensacola; and, through the summer, conducted qualification exercises. At the end of September, she was ordered to Mexico to again assist in hurricane relief work. From 1-9 October, her helicopters evacuated survivors, flew in rescue personnel, and distributed food, water and medical supplies, primarily in the flooded Tampico area. On 12 October, she returned to Pensacola, where she remained until April 1957. Between her two training stints from 1946‚Äì1947 and 1955‚Äì1957, carrier pilots were trained on , and . On the first of that month, she sailed for Bayonne, New Jersey, where she began inactivation and was decommissioned on 3 October 1957. Converted Reclassified AVT-6 on 15 May 1959, Saipan remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until March 1963. She then entered the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company yard at Mobile, Alabama, to begin conversion to a command ship. Very briefly designated CC-3, she was instead reclassified as Major Communications Relay Ship AGMR-2 on 1 September 1964 while still undergoing conversion. On 8 April 1965, she was renamed Arlington, in honor of Arlington County, Virginia, the site of one of the Navy's first radio stations; and, on 12 August 1966, she completed her conversion. As Arlington (AGMR-2), she sailed for Norfolk where she was recommissioned on 27 August 1966. Fitting out occupied the remainder of the year. In January 1967, she conducted shakedown exercises in the Caribbean, and, in February, she sailed for the Bay of Biscay and exercises off northern Europe. At the end of March, she returned to Norfolk, whence in April, she again steamed to the Caribbean. On her return to the Hampton Roads area, she prepared for deployment to the western Pacific. =Vietnam= Departing Norfolk on 7 July 1967, the communications ship transited the Panama Canal and proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, and Subic Bay, when, with , she rotated on station off Vietnam. During her first patrol in the Tonkin Gulf from 21 August to 18 September 1967, she provided reliable message handling facilities for ships of the 7th Fleet in support of combat operations; and, in addition, assisted ships in repairing and better utilizing their electronic equipment. On returning to the Philippines after her first patrol, Arlington received a new satellite communications terminal; and, on 2 October, she departed Subic for Taiwan. USS Arlington (AGMR-2), 1967. There for only three days, she continued on to Tonkin Gulf, where she resumed her communications relay duties. At the end of the month, she shifted south to provide communications support to ships in the \\"Market Time\\" area off South Vietnam. After 34 days on station, she spent five days in Hong Kong, then returned to Subic Bay, whence she steamed to Tonkin Gulf in early December 1967 for her third \\"Yankee Station\\" communications patrol. On 27 December, she departed the area and headed north. On 4 January 1968, she arrived at Yokosuka, and, on 19 January, she got underway to return to Vietnam. Arriving back on \\"Yankee Station\\" on 24 January 1968, she departed again on 26 January, participated in exercises in the Sea of Japan; then returned to \\"Yankee Station.\\" On station from 13 February to 10 March, she returned to Yokosuka on 14 March, remained until 3 April, and resumed operations in Tonkin Gulf on 10 April. A visit to Sydney followed completion of her April patrol; but, by mid-June 1968, she was back on station. From 20-22 July, she again visited Hong Kong, then sailed for Yokosuka. Manned Spacecraft Recovery Force Between the end of August and mid-November 1968, she completed two more tours on \\"Yankee Station\\", and in early December, she got underway for Pearl Harbor. There at mid-month, she conducted communications tests; and, on 18 December, she departed Hawaii in TF 130, the Manned Spacecraft Recovery Force, Pacific. Acting as primary landing area communications relay ship, she participated in the recovery of Apollo 8 and returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 December 1968. Two days later, she sailed for the Philippines, and, on 17 January 1969, she resumed direct communications support for naval units in Tonkin Gulf. On 6 February, she departed \\"Yankee Station,\\" and, after upkeep at Yokosuka, conducted operations off southern Japan and in the Ryukyus. Toward the end of March, she sailed for Hong Kong, whence she returned to Vietnam. Remaining on station from 6 to 14 April 1969, she tested her Apollo communications equipment, and, on the 15th, headed back to Pearl Harbor. On 2 May, she arrived in Hawaii and once again joined TF 130\\\\. Again assigned as primary landing area communications relay ship, she departed Pearl Harbor on 11 May and steamed for the Apollo 10 recovery area, some 2,400 miles south of Hawaii. On 26 May, the capsule was recovered and the assigned ships returned to Hawaii. From there, Arlington proceeded to Midway Atoll where she provided communications support for the Nixon-Thieu conference on 8 June 1969, and, the next day, she sailed west. On 27 June 1969, the communications ship returned to the Vietnamese coast. On 7 July, however, she was ordered east for her third Apollo recovery mission. Arriving in the recovery area on 21 July, she tested her equipment; and, on the following day, moved to Johnston Island. On 23 July, she embarked President Richard Nixon for an overnight visit; and, on 24 July, supported the recovery of Apollo 11. Crew and capsule successfully recovered, Arlington headed for Hawaii, whence she steamed to the west coast. =Deactivation and decommissioning= On 21 August 1969, she arrived, for the first time, at her homeport, Long Beach, and four days later shifted to San Diego to begin inactivation. She was decommissioned on 14 January 1970 and berthed with the Inactive Fleet at San Diego. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 15 August 1975, and was sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 1 June 1976.

It is the second ship named \\"Wright\\". The first was named for Orville Wright; the second honored both Wright brothers: Orville and Wilbur. Construction Wright was laid down on 21 August 1944, at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 1 September 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Harold S. Miller, a niece of the Wright brothers, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 9 February 1947, with Captain Frank T. Ward in command. Service history Wright departed Philadelphia on 18 March 1947 and stopped briefly at Norfolk, Virginia, en route to the Naval Air Training Base at Pensacola, Florida. After her arrival there on 31 March, Wright soon commenced a rigorous schedule of air defense drills and gunnery practice while acting as a qualification carrier for hundreds of student pilots at the Naval Air Training Base, relieving Saipan. Wright would embark on 40 operational cruises‚Äîeach of between one and four days' duration off the Florida coast. In addition, the carrier embarked a total of 1,081 naval reservists and trained them in a series of three two-week duty tours. On 3 September 1947, Wright embarked 48 Midshipmen for temporary training duty and later welcomed 62 Army officers when she stood out to sea on 15 October, in company with to let her guests observe flight operations in the Pensacola area. The exercises included the catapulting of Grumman F6F Hellcats for rocket-firing operations. That exercise was her last prior to her departure from Pensacola on 24 October, to return north. She arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard soon thereafter and from 1 November to 17 December, underwent post-shakedown repairs and alterations before she returned to Pensacola two days before Christmas, where she resumed her regular schedule of pilot qualification training under the operational control of the Chief of Naval Air Training, Commander Air Atlantic. Wright spent the year 1948 engaged in those pilot carrier qualification operations, before she put into the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 26 January 1949, to commence a four-month overhaul. She was relieved as training carrier by . Leyte at Quonset Point, c.1950 Following refresher training in Cuban waters, Wright returned to Norfolk on 1 August 1949, and four days later shifted to Newport, Rhode Island, for two weeks of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training in the Narragansett Bay area with submarines and destroyers. She also visited New York City before taking up a steady schedule of carrier qualifications, air defense tactics, and exercises out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, Key West, and Pensacola. But for 10 days of maneuvers with the 2d Task Fleet from 21 to 31 October 1949, she continued that duty until 7 January 1951, when she embarked the last increment of personnel from Fighter Squadron 14 (VF-14) for temporary duty. Service with 6th Fleet Wright sailed from Norfolk, on 11 January 1951, with a fast carrier task group and reached Gibraltar on 21 January, for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Wright's first Mediterranean deployment took her from Gibraltar to Oran, Algeria. She proceeded thence to Augusta Bay, Sicily; Suda Bay, Crete; Beirut, Lebanon; and Golfe Juan, France‚Äîher replenishment and liberty ports during the never-ending cycle of fleet training and readiness exercises with the 6th Fleet. Departing Golfe Juan on 19 March, Wright made port at Newport on 31 March 1951. The carrier later entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and underwent an overhaul there before she took part in Atlantic Fleet maneuvers out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; engaged in ASW tactics and carrier operations in Narragansett Bay, received further repairs at the Boston Naval Shipyard, and participated in a convoy exercise that ran from 25 February to 21 March 1952; and ranged from Newport to waters of the Panama Canal Zone and Trinidad in the British West Indies. As flagship for Carrier Division 14, Wright sailed on 9 June 1952, in company with four destroyers forming Task Group (TG) 81.4 for ASW operations along the Atlantic seaboard until 27 June, when the ships arrived at New York City. Returning to Quonset Point on 1 July, Wright trained units of the organized Naval Reserve concurrently with hunter‚Äìkiller tactics and pilot training in operations out of Narragansett Bay until 26 August. On that day, she set course from Quonset Point and later rendezvoused with Vice Admiral Felix Stump's 2d Task Fleet en route to northern Europe for combined defense exercises and maneuvers with naval units of other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) navies. En route, Wright, escorted by Forrest Royal, was detached to ferry men and gear of Marine Night Fighter Squadron (VMF(N)) 114 to Port Lyautey, Morocco, an operation she completed on 4 September. Two days later, Wright and her escort rejoined the task force; and they reached the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on 10 September. Three days later, Wright put to sea with two British destroyers acting as her plane guard for NATO Operation Mainbrace. She conducted air defense maneuvers and tactics evolutions with the British carriers and en route to Rotterdam, Netherlands, where the force arrived on 25 September. On 29 September, Wright departed Rotterdam, bound for the United States, and arrived at Newport on 9 October. That day, she embarked Rear Admiral W. L. Erdman, Commander, Carrier Division 4, and spent the next few months engaged in carrier qualification duties in waters ranging from Newport to the Virginia Capes, before she began her second deployment to the Mediterranean. She reached Golfe Juan on 21 February 1953, and operated with the 6th Fleet until 31 March, when she sailed for home, via the Azores. Wright returned to Newport, and after a rigorous schedule of training in Narragansett Bay, sailed on 5 May, for the Gulf of Mexico. During that training cruise, she visited Houston, Texas, where she hosted some 14,000 visitors on 16 and 17 May. Returning to Quonset Point on 28 May, Wright operated locally for another month before shifting south for a stint of operations out of Mayport, Florida. Service with 7th Fleet Wright was overhauled at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 31 July to 21 November 1953, and then conducted refresher training in Cuban waters from 4 January to 16 February 1954. Next, after departing Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 5 April, Wright sailed for Norfolk, Virginia where she took on necessary stores and supplies in preparation for her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. On 20 April, Wright set sail for the Western Pacific via the Panama Canal; San Diego, California; and Pearl Harbor‚Äîand reached United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, on 28 May. The carrier, with Marine Attack Squadron 211 embarked, operated with the 7th Fleet off both coasts of Korea and also off Okinawa before she visited Hong Kong from 24 to 30 September. Departing Yokosuka on 15 October, Wright arrived at San Diego on the last day of October and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where she remained until 23 February 1955. At that point, Wright was attached to CarDiv 17, Pacific Fleet, and operated locally out of San Diego until 3 May, when she put to sea as part of TG 7.3‚Äîformed around the flagship ‚Äîfor the atomic test, Operation Wigwam, carried out in Pacific waters. Returning to the West Coast on 20 May, Wright subsequently cruised to Pearl Harbor briefly before she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 14 July to commence preparation for inactivation. After shifting to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 17 October, for the final phase of preservation for inactivation, Wright was decommissioned at Puget Sound on 15 March 1956, and assigned to the Bremerton group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Reclassification USS Wright as CC-2 off Southern California in September 1963 During her time in reserve, Wright was reclassified on 15 May 1959, an auxiliary aircraft transport, AVT-7. However, she never served in that role but remained inactive until 15 March 1962, when she was taken to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for conversion to a command ship and reclassified as CC-2. The conversion‚Äîwhich lasted a year‚Äîincluded extensive alterations to enable the ship to function as a fully equipped mobile command post afloat for top-echelon commands and staff for strategic direction of area or worldwide military operations. Facilities were built into the ship for worldwide communications and rapid automatic exchange, processing, storage, and display of command data. A portion of the former hangar deck space was utilized for special command spaces and the extensive electronics equipment required, while a major portion of the flight deck was utilized for specially designed communications antenna arrays. In addition, facilities were provided to enable the ship to operate three helicopters. Recommissioned at Puget Sound on 11 May 1963, Capt. John L. Arrington II, in command, Wright (CC-2) operated locally on trials and training evolutions in the waters off the Pacific Northwest until 3 September, when she departed Seattle and proceeded to San Diego, which she reached three days later. For the next three weeks, the ship trained in nearby waters before she returned to Puget Sound on 30 September to commence her post-shakedown availability. Following those repairs and alterations‚Äîwhich took up all of the month of October and most of November‚ÄîWright prepared to shift to her new home port, Norfolk. She departed Seattle on 26 November, stopped briefly at San Diego three days later to embark civilian engineers and personnel who were to conduct surveys of communications and-air conditioning equipment, and was steaming south off the coast of northern Mexico when she picked up a distress message from the Israeli merchantman , on 1 December. Wright altered course and rendezvoused with Velos later that same day. The command ship's medical officer was flown across to the Israeli ship and treated a seaman suffering from kidney stones. Upon completion of that mission of mercy, Wright resumed her voyage to Balboa. Transiting the Panama Canal on 7 and 8 December, Wright steamed via St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and moored at the Hampton Roads Army Terminal on 18 December. After a subsequent brief operational period off the Virginia Capes, Wright entered port on 21 December, and remained there through Christmas and New Year's. NECPA duties For the next six years, Wright operated out of Norfolk, training to perform her assigned mission as the National Emergency Command Post Afloat. Regular overhauls performed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard saw the ship receiving the repairs and alterations that continually improved her capabilities to carry out her task. She operated primarily off the Virginia Capes, but ranged as far north as Bar Harbor, Maine, and as far south as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay. Her other ports of call included Newport, Fort Lauderdale and Port Everglades, Florida; Boston; New York City; Annapolis; Philadelphia; Norfolk; and Guant√°namo Bay. As part of NECPA duties, she alternated on alert status with .USAF Historical Division: \\"The Air Force and the Worldwide Military Command and Control System 1961‚Äì1965 There were highlights and breaks from the cycle of periods in port and at sea. From 11 to 14 April 1967, Wright lay at anchor off the coast of Uruguay, providing a worldwide communications capability in support of President Lyndon B. Johnson as he attended the Latin American summit conference at Punta del Este. On 8 May 1968, Wright went to the aid of after that amphibious assault ship had suffered a machinery failure and had gone dead in the water, south of Norfolk. Wright towed the helpless assault ship before other ships arrived on the scene to help out. Later that same year, Wright received the coveted Captain Edward F. Ney Memorial Award in the large mess afloat category. That award is given annually to the ship that maintains the highest food standards. During the Pueblo crisis in February 1969, Wright, while en route to Port Everglades, Florida, was hurriedly recalled to Norfolk and, upon her arrival there, stood by, on alert. Decommissioning Ultimately decommissioned on 27 May 1970, Wright was placed in reserve at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 1 December 1977, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 1 August 1980.

The ship also served in the First Indochina War under French Navy temporary service as Bois Belleau. Originally laid down as the New Haven (CL-76), she was finished as an aircraft carrier. Reclassified CV-24 on 16 February 1942 and renamed Belleau Wood on 31 March 1942 in honor of the Battle of Belleau Wood in World War I. She was launched on 6 December 1942 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, and sponsored by Mrs. Thomas Holcomb, wife of the Commandant of the Marine Corps. She was commissioned on 31 March 1943, with Captain A. M. Pride in command. During the war, she was reclassified CVL-24 on 15 July 1943. Service history =United States Navy= After a brief shakedown cruise, Belleau Wood reported to the Pacific Fleet, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 26 July 1943. After supporting the occupation of Baker Island (1 September) and taking part in the Tarawa (18 September) and Wake Island (5‚Äì6 October) raids, she joined TF 50 for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands (19 November‚Äì4 December 1943).

Belleau Wood operated with TF 58 during the seizure of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, Marshall Islands (29 January‚Äì3 February 1944), Truk raid (16‚Äì17 February); Saipan-Tinian-Rota-Guam raids (21‚Äì22 February); Palau-Yap-Ulithi-Woleai raid (30 March‚Äì1 April); Wakde and Sawar Airfield raids to neutralize the danger of air attack during the Battle of Hollandia landings in New Guinea (22‚Äì24 April); Truk-Satawan-Ponape raid (29 April‚Äì1 May); occupation of Saipan (11‚Äì24 June), 1st Bonins raid (15‚Äì16 June), Battle of the Philippine Sea (19‚Äì20 June); and 2nd Bonins raid (24 June). During the Battle Of the Philippine Sea, Belleau Woods planes sank the Japanese carrier . After an overhaul at Pearl Harbor (29 June‚Äì31 July 1944), Belleau Wood rejoined TF 58 for the last stages of the occupation of Guam (2‚Äì10 August). She joined TF 38 and took part in the strikes in support of the occupation of the southern Palaus (6 September‚Äì14 October); Philippine Islands raids (9‚Äì24 September); Morotai landings (15 September); Okinawa raid (10 October); northern Luzon and Formosa raids (11‚Äì14 October); Luzon strikes (15 and 17 October‚Äì19 October), and the Battle off Cape Enga√±o (24‚Äì26 October). On 30 October, while Belleau Wood was patrolling with her task group east of Leyte, she shot down a Japanese kamikaze plane which fell on her flight deck aft, causing fires which set off ammunition. Before the fire could be brought under control, 92 men had either died or were missing. After temporary repairs at Ulithi (2‚Äì11 November), Belleau Wood steamed to Hunters Point, California, for permanent repairs and an overhaul, arriving on 29 November. She departed San Francisco Bay on 20 January 1945 and joined TF 58 at Ulithi on 7 February. From 15 February‚Äì4 March, she took part in the raids on Honsh≈´ Island, Japan, and the Nansei Shoto, as well as supporting the landings on Iwo Jima. She also took part in the 5th Fleet strikes against Japan (17 March‚Äì26 May) and the 3rd Fleet strikes (27 May‚Äì11 June). After embarking Air Group 31 at Leyte (13 June‚Äì1 July), she rejoined the 3rd Fleet for the final strikes against the Japanese home islands (10 July‚Äì15 August). The last Japanese aircraft shot down in the war was a Yokosuka D4Y3 \\"Judy\\" dive bomber which was shot down by Clarence \\"Bill\\" A. Moore, an F6F pilot of \\"The Flying Meat-Axe\\" VF-31 from Belleau Wood. Belleau Wood launched her planes on 2 September for the mass flight over Tokyo, Japan, during the surrender ceremonies. She remained in Japanese waters until 13 October. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 28 October, she departed three days later with 1,248 servicemen for San Diego. She remained on \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, returning servicemen from Guam and Saipan to San Diego, until 31 January 1946. During the next year, Belleau Wood was moored at various docks in the San Francisco area, undergoing inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Alameda Naval Air Station on 13 January 1947. Belleau Wood received the Presidential Unit Citation and 12 battle stars during World War II. =French Navy= She remained in reserve until transferred to the French Navy under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act on 5 September 1953. In French service, she sailed under the name Bois Belleau (literal translation of \\"Belleau Wood\\"). In April 1954, the carrier departed from the Toulon French Naval Base, Toulon toward French Indochina in order to replace . She arrived around 20 May in Halong Bay. Although the critical Battle of Dien Bien Phu was over, her US-built fighters and bombers were immediately used by the French forces, as the war was not over. After peace with the Viet Minh, the Geneva Conference was signed on 21 July 1954. Bois Belleau sailed for France, where she then joined the Algerian War. Bois Belleau was returned to the United States in September 1960, stricken from the Navy List on 1 October 1960, and scrapped. Significance of the name The ship was named in memory of the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood, in which United States soldiers and Marines of the American Expeditionary Forces, defeated German troops after nearly four weeks of intense fighting. According to United States Marine Corps lore, the German defenders referred to them as Teufelshunde (literally, \\"Devil Dogs\\") and it was this moniker that became the ship's mascot, and one of the nicknames for US Marines (Devil Dog).

Cowpens, named for the Battle of Cowpens of the Revolutionary War, was launched on 17 January 1943 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, in Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Bradford Spruance (n√©e Halsey, daughter of Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr.) and commissioned on 28 May 1943 by Captain R. P. McConnell. She was reclassified CVL-25 on 15 July 1943. Cowpens completed her active service at the end of 1946. Service history =World War II= 1943 Departing Philadelphia, on 29 August 1943, Cowpens arrived at Pearl Harbor on 19 September to begin the active and distinguished war career which was to earn her a Navy Unit Commendation. She sailed with Task Force 14 for the strike on Wake Island on 5‚Äì6 October, then returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for strikes on the Marshall Islands preliminary to invasion. She sortied from Pearl Harbor 10 November to launch air strikes on Mille and Makin atolls from 19 to 24 November, and Kwajalein and Wotje on 4 December, returning to her base on 9 December. 1944 Joining Task Force 58, Cowpens sailed from Pearl Harbor on 16 January 1944 for the invasion of the Marshalls. Her planes pounded Kwajalein and Eniwetok the last 3 days of the month to prepare for the assault landing on 31 January. Using Majuro as a base, the force struck at Truk on 16‚Äì17 February and the Mariana Islands on 21‚Äì22 February before putting into Pearl Harbor on 4 March. Returning to Majuro, Task Force 58 based here for attacks on the western Carolines; Cowpens supplied air and antisubmarine patrols during the raids on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai from 30 March to 1 April. After operating off New Guinea during the invasion of Hollandia from 21 to 28 April, Cowpens took part in the strikes on Truk, Satawan and Ponape from 29 April to 1 May, returning to Majuro on 14 May for training. From 6 June to 10 July 1944, Cowpens operated in the Marianas operation. Her planes struck the island of Saipan to aid the assault troops, and made supporting raids on Iwo Jima, Pagan Island, Rota, and Guam. They also took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19‚Äì20 June, accounting for a number of the huge tally of enemy planes downed. After a brief overhaul at Pearl Harbor, Cowpens rejoined the fast carrier task force at Eniwetok on 17 August. Then, on 29 August, she sailed for the pre-invasion strikes on the Palaus, whose assault was an essential preliminary for the return to the Philippines. From 13 to 17 September, she was detached from the force to cover the landings on Morotai, then rejoined it for sweep, patrol, and attack missions against Luzon from 21 to 24 September. Cowpens, with her task group, sent air strikes to neutralize Japanese bases on Okinawa and Formosa from 10 to 14 October, and when and were hit by torpedoes, Cowpens provided air cover for their safe withdrawal, rejoining her task group on 20 October. En route to Ulithi, she was recalled when the Japanese Fleet threatened the Leyte invasion, and during the Battle of Surigao Strait phase of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf on 25‚Äì26 October, provided combat air patrol for the ships pursuing the fleeing remnant of the Japanese fleet. Continuing her support of the Philippines advance, Cowpens' planes struck Luzon repeatedly during December. During the disastrous Typhoon Cobra on 18 December, Cowpens lost a man: ship's air officer Lieutenant Commander Robert Price, several planes, and some equipment, but skillful work by her crew prevented major damage, and she reached Ulithi safely on 21 December to repair her storm damage. 1945 USS Cowpens in 1945 From 30 December 1944 to 26 January 1945, Cowpens was at sea for the Lingayen Gulf landings. Her planes struck targets on Formosa, Luzon, the Indochinese coast and the Hong Kong-Canton area and Okinawa during January. On 10 February, Cowpens sortied from Ulithi for the Iwo Jima operation, striking the Tokyo area, supporting the initial landings from 19 to 22 February, and hitting Okinawa on 1 March. On 13 June, following an overhaul at San Francisco and training at Pearl Harbor, Cowpens sailed on for San Pedro Bay, Leyte. Along the way she struck Wake Island on 20 June. Rejoining Task Force 58, Cowpens sailed from San Pedro Bay on 1 July to join in the final raids on the Japanese mainland. Her planes pounded Tokyo, Kure, and other cities of Hokkaid≈ç and Honsh≈´ until 15 August. Cowpens was the first American carrier to enter Tokyo Harbor. Remaining off Tokyo Bay until the occupation landings began on 30 August, Cowpens launched photographic reconnaissance missions to patrol airfields and shipping movements, and to locate and supply prisoner-of-war camps. Men from Cowpens were the first Americans to set foot on the Japanese mainland, and were largely responsible for the emergency activation of Yokosuka airfield for Allied use and the liberation of a POW camp near Niigata. From 8 November 1945 to 28 January 1946 Cowpens made two voyages to Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Okinawa to return veterans on \\"Magic Carpet\\" runs. =Post-War= On 3 December 1946, Cowpens was placed in commission reserve at Mare Island. On 15 May 1959, she was reclassified as an aircraft transport, with a new hull number, AVT-1. Then, on 1 November, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap. Awards In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, Cowpens received 12 battle stars for World War II service. Commemoration Each year, the town of Cowpens, South Carolina, holds a 4-day festival honoring veterans of Cowpens. \\"The Mighty Moo Festival\\" was first held in 1977, with one crewmember of CVL-25 attending. Since then, as many as 115 CVL-25 veterans have attended the festival at once. Also, since the launch and commissioning of the in 1991, the festival has included actively serving crewmen or women of CG-63 sent by the ship's commanding officer, as well as previously serving veterans of CG 63. The festival is held from Wednesday through Saturday preceding Father's Day each June. During the 1980s, the town of Cowpens, South Carolina, actively petitioned Congress to name another ship Cowpens, which may have played a direct role in choosing this name for CG-63.

Originally laid down as light cruiser Dayton (CL-78) on 29 December 1941 by New York Shipbuilding, Camden, New Jersey, the ship was reclassified CV-26 on 27 March 1942 and renamed Monterey four days later, launched on 28 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Patrick N. L. Bellinger, and commissioned on 17 June 1943, Captain Lestor T. Hundt in command. It was the third US Navy vessel to be named after the Battle of Monterrey. Future U.S. President Gerald R. Ford served aboard the ship during World War II. Service history =World War II= Monterey in 1944 Monterey was reclassified CVL-26 on 15 July 1943, shortly before commissioning, and after shakedown, departed Philadelphia for the western Pacific. She reached the Gilbert Islands on 19 November 1943, in time to help secure Makin Island. She took part in strikes on Kavieng, New Ireland on 25 December, as part of Task Group 37.2 (TG 37.2), and supported the landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 8 February 1944. The light carrier then operated with Task Force 58 (TF 58) during raids in the Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, northern New Guinea, and the Bonin Islands from February‚ÄìJuly 1944. During this time she was also involved in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19‚Äì20 June. Monterey then sailed to Pearl Harbor for overhaul, departing once again on 29 August. She launched strikes against Wake Island on 3 September, then joined TF 38 and participated in strikes in the southern Philippines and the Ryukyus. October through December 1944 were spent in the Philippines, supporting first the Leyte, and then the Mindoro landings. The gunnery officers of USS Monterey. Gerald R. Ford is second from the right, in the front row. Though enemy planes had been unable to damage Monterey, she did not complete her first full year of service unscathed. In December, she steamed into the path of Typhoon Cobra, with winds over . At the height of the storm, which lasted two days, several planes tore loose from their cables, causing several fires on the hangar deck. During the storm future US President Gerald Ford, who served on board the ship, was almost swept overboard. Ford, serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck, was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship‚Äôs commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship‚Äôs crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again. Monterey arrived Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul in January 1945. She rejoined TF 58 and supported Okinawa operations by launching strikes against Nansei Shoto and Ky≈´sh≈´ from 9 May to 1 June. She rejoined TF 38 for the final strike against Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç from 1 July to 15 August. =Post-War= Monterey departed Japanese waters on 7 September, having embarked troops at Tokyo, and steamed home, arriving in New York City on 17 October. Monterey left behind an impressive and enviable war record. Her planes sank five enemy warships, and damaged others. She was responsible for the destruction of thousands of tons of Japanese shipping, hundreds of planes, and vital industrial complexes. She was assigned \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, and made several voyages between Naples and Norfolk. She was decommissioned on 11 February 1947, and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia Group. =Korea= With the outbreak of hostilities in the Korean War, Monterey was recommissioned on 15 September 1950. She departed Norfolk on 3 January 1951, and proceeded to Pensacola, Florida, where she operated for the next 4 years under the Naval Training Command, training thousands of naval aviation cadets, student pilots, and helicopter trainees. Monterey was relieved as training carrier by Saipan, which had previously served at Pensacola as training carrier between 1946 and 1947. From 1 to 11 October 1954, she took part in a flood rescue mission in Honduras. She departed Pensacola on 9 June 1955 and steamed to rejoin the reserve fleet. She was decommissioned on 16 January 1956. Reclassified AVT-2 on 15 May 1959, she remained berthed at Philadelphia until she was sold for scrapping in May 1971.

Cabot was commissioned in 1943 and served until 1947. She was recommissioned as a training carrier from 1948 to 1955. From 1967 to 1989, she served in Spain as '. After attempts to preserve her failed, she was scrapped in 2002. USS Cabot was laid down as Wilmington (CL-79), a Cleveland-class light cruiser, redesignated CV-28 on 2 June 1942, renamed Cabot on 23 June 1942 and converted while building. She was launched on 4 April 1943 by New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. A. C. Read. She was reclassified CVL-28 on 15 July 1943 and commissioned on 24 July 1943, with Captain Malcolm Francis Schoeffel in command. Service history =United States= World War II (1943-1945) Cabot sailed from Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island with Air Group 31 aboard, on 8 November 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 2 December. Clearing for Majuro on 15 January 1944, she joined TF 58 to begin the consistently high quality of war service which was to win her a Presidential Unit Citation. From 4 February to 4 March 1944, she launched her planes in strikes on Roi, Namur, and the island stronghold of Truk, aiding in the neutralization of these Japanese bases as her part in the invasion of the Marshalls. Cabot returned to Pearl Harbor for a brief repair period, but was back in action from Majuro for the pounding raids on the Palaus, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai at the close of March 1944. She sailed to provide valuable air cover for the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) operation from 22‚Äì25 April, and 4 days later began to hurl her air power at Truk, Satawan, and Ponape. She cleared Majuro again on 6 June for the preinvasion air strikes in the Mariana Islands, and on 19 and 20 June launched sorties in the key Battle of the Philippine Sea, the famous \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\", which hopelessly crippled Japanese naval aviation. Cabots air group 31 pounded Japanese bases on Iwo Jima, Pagan, Rota, Guam, Yap and Ulithi as the carrier continued her support of the Marianas operation until 9 August. Preinvasion strikes in the Palaus in September 1944 along with air attacks on Mindanao, the Visayas, and Luzon paved the way for the long-awaited return to the Philippines. On 6 October, Air Group 29 relieved Air Group 31, and Cabot sailed from Ulithi for raids on Okinawa to provide air cover for her task group during the heavy enemy attacks off Formosa on 12 and 13 October. Cabot joined the group which screened \\"Cripple Division 1\\", and which had been torpedoed off Formosa, to the safety of the Carolines, then rejoined her group for continued air strikes on the Visayas, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 and 26 October. Cabot remained on patrol off Luzon, conducting strikes in support of operations ashore, and repelling desperate kamikaze attacks. On 25 November, a particularly vicious one occurred. Cabot had fought off several kamikazes when one, already flaming from hits, crashed the flight deck on the port side, destroying the still-firing 20 mm gun platform, disabling the 40 mm Mounts and a gun director: Another of Cabots victims crashed close aboard and showered the port side with shrapnel and burning debris. 62 men were killed or wounded but careful training had produced a crew which handled damage control smoothly and coolly. While she continued to maintain her station in formation and operate effectively, temporary repairs were made. On 28 November, she arrived at Ulithi for permanent repairs. Cabot returned to action on 11 December 1944, steaming with the force striking Luzon, Formosa, Indo-China, Hong Kong, and the Nansei Shoto in support of the Luzon operations during the South China Sea raid. From 10 February to 1 March 1945, her planes pounded the Japanese homeland and the Bonins to suppress opposition to the invasion of Iwo Jima. Continued strikes against Ky≈´sh≈´ and Okinawa in March prepared for the invasion of the latter island. After these prolonged, intensive operations, Cabot was homeward bound for San Francisco for a much-needed overhaul completed in June. After refresher training at Pearl Harbor with Air Group 32 aboard, the carrier launched strikes on Wake Island on 1 August while en route to Eniwetok. Here she remained on training duty until the end of the war. Sailing on 21 August, she joined TG 38.3 to support the landings of occupation troops in the Yellow Sea area in September and October. Embarking homeward- bound men at Guam, Cabot arrived at San Diego on 9 November, then sailed for the east coast. Cabot was placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia on 11 February 1947.http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c1/cabot-ii.htm Post-War (1948-1955) Cabot as a training carrier in 1949. Recommissioned 27 October 1948, Cabot was assigned to the Naval Air Reserve training program. She operated out of Pensacola as a training carrier qualifying carrier-based pilots before being relieved in that role by Monterey in 1951. Later, she was reassigned to Quonset Point, on cruises to the Caribbean, and had one tour of duty in European waters from 9 January to 26 March 1952. Cabot was again placed out of commission in the reserve fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Yard on 21 January 1955. She was reclassified AVT-3 on 15 May 1959. =Spanish Navy= 1967‚Äì1989 Spanish Navy AV-8S Matador flies over the aircraft carrier D√©dalo (R01) (ex-USS Cabot) in 1988 In 1967, after over twelve years in \\"mothballs\\", Cabot was loaned to Spain, in whose navy she served with the name of ' and was equipped with the AV-8S Matador. The loan was converted to a sale and USS Cabot was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1972. D√©dalo was stricken from the Spanish Navy in August 1989 and given to a private organization in the U.S. for conversion to a museum ship. =Preservation attempts (1990‚Äì2002)= Cabot in New Orleans in 1995. Cabot was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 29 June 1990.Withdrawal of U.S.S. Cabot: National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) The ship spent most of the 1990s berthed in New Orleans. The private groups attempting to preserve her as a memorial were unable to pay creditors, and on 10 September 1999 the ship was auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service to Sabe Marine Salvage of Brownsville, Texas. Its designation as a National Historic Landmark was withdrawn on 7 August 2001. Scrapping of the hulk was completed in 2002. Her island, along with that of , was obtained for preservation by the Texas Air Museum, at Rio Hondo, Texas.Dirk H.R.

The National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, constructed a replica of Cabots island using original plans, along with a reconstructed section of flight deck. Cabot has a large collection of items at the USS Lexington aircraft museum in Corpus Christi, Texas, including all the guns and the anchor. A museum room contains information, artifacts, and pictures of Cabot.

Serving in the Pacific Theatre for the entire war, taking part in operations around New Guinea, the Invasion of the Mariana Islands, the Battle of the Philippine sea, the Battle of Okinawa, and Attacks on the Japanese home islands. After World War II's end she was converted into an anti-submarine carrier and placed in reserve on 11 February 1947. She was reactivated on 13 May 1950 at Philadelphia, with Captain Edgar T. Neale in command in order to participate in the Korean War. After the war she returned to Pearl Harbor, and reported for a preinactivation overhaul on 26 August 1953. After moving to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, Bataan was decommissioned on 9 April 1954 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Francisco. Although she was reclassified an auxiliary aircraft transport and redesignated AVT-4 on 15 May 1959, her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1959. She was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corp., Beverly Hills, California, on 19 June 1961 for scrapping. Design and construction Captain Valentine H. Schaeffer, USN, the carrier's Commanding Officer, cuts the cake at a reception following her commissioning ceremonies, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 17 November 1943. Looking on are Philippine Commonwealth Vice President Sergio Osme√±a and Miss Rosie Osme√±a. The vessel that eventually became the light aircraft carrier Bataan was originally planned as the Buffalo (CL-99). Following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the need for more carriers became urgent. In response, the Navy ordered the conversion of nine Cleveland-class light cruisers then under construction to completion as light aircraft carriers. These became known as the s. Thus, CL-99 was reclassified CV-29 and renamed Bataan on 2 June 1942. She was further reclassified as CVL-29 on 15 July 1943. Bataan displaced light and at full load. She had an overall length of and a waterline length of . Her extreme beam was and her beam at the waterline was . Her draft was maximum. For armament she was equipped with 24 Bofors 40 mm gun and 22 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for anti-aircraft protection. She normally carried 30 aircraft. Her armor consisted of of belt armor, on the decks, and on the conning tower. She was powered by four Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers and General Electric geared turbines producing for her four screws. She had a design speed of and had a range of at . She normally carried a complement of 1569. The vessel was ordered 16 December 1940 as a light cruiser and reordered as a light aircraft carrier on 2 June 1942. She was laid down on 31 August 1942 and launched on 1 August 1943 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Corinne DeForest Murray, wife of Rear Admiral George D. Murray. She was commissioned on 17 November 1943, with Captain V. H. Schaeffer in command. Bataan was named after Bataan Peninsula and the Battle of Bataan where American and Filipino troops were besieged by Japanese forces from 24 December 1941 until 9 April 1942 when the remaining 78,000 troops surrendered to avoid unnecessary slaughter. Service history =World War II= After fitting out at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Bataan conducted preliminary shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay before sailing to the West Indies on 11 January 1944. Two days later, while en route to Trinidad, she suffered her first loss when a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter crashed into her number 2 stack and burst into flames, killing three crewmen. Returning to Philadelphia on 14 February, she underwent post-shakedown repairs and inspections until 2 March when she got underway for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 8 March, she arrived in San Diego on the 16th. Two days later, she sailed for Hawaii with her flight and hangar decks full with passengers, aircraft and cargo. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 22 March, the she conducted a week of pilot qualification drills in preparation for \\"forward area deployment\\". The warship lost her second aircraft on 31 March when a \\"Hellcat\\" crashed the landing barrier and went over the side, although the pilot survived without injury. Bataan departed Pearl Harbor on 4 April accompanied by her escorting destroyers and steamed to the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Majuro Atoll on 9 April and reported for duty with the fast carriers of Task Force 58 (TF 58) that same day. On 13 April, she sailed with the carriers , , and the rest of Task Group (TG) 58.1 for air operations against Hollandia, New Guinea (now known as Jayapura). These raids were intended to support American amphibious operations in the Humboldt Bay- Tanahmerah Bay region of New Guinea. On 21 April, Bataan launched five fighter sweeps to attack Japanese aircraft and ground installations on New Guinea. The pilots claimed hits on numerous buildings, flak guns, coastal barges and three aircraft on the ground. Meanwhile, the carrier's Combat Air Patrol (CAP) shot down a Mitsubishi G4M1 Betty bomber and a Mitsubishi Ki-21 Sally. The Task Group then headed north and struck the Japanese base at Truk Lagoon on 29 April. Bataan launched a fighter sweep and three bombing raids, with the Grumman/General Motors TBM Avenger torpedo bombers dropping of bombs on the Japanese base. One TBM Avenger was shot down during the attack, but the crew was rescued by submarine , which was engaged in lifeguard duty - patrolling for such survivors during the battle. On 30 April, Bataans task group turned toward Ponape (now Pohnpei), Caroline Islands; and, the next day, she flew CAP and Anti-Submarine Patrol (ASP) missions over the battleships bombarding that island. The warships then steamed to the Marshall Islands, arriving at Kwajalein lagoon on 4 May. Invasion of the Mariana Islands Bataan moved to Majuro on 14 May for repairs to her forward elevator but local repair crews could not fix the problem. She sailed to Pearl Harbor for repairs and returned to Majuro on 2 June. Once there, Bataan began hurried preparations for Operation Forager, the planned invasion of the Marianas. Tasked with neutralizing Japanese airfields in the Marianas, the 15 fleet carriers of TF 58 planned to attack Saipan, Guam, and nearby island groups. They also prepared for a major fleet battle in case the Japanese carriers attempted to interfere. Bataan joined Hornet, , and Belleau Wood in TG 58.1 and put to sea on 6 June. Five days later, Bataan launched fighters against the Japanese base on Rota in support of operations against Saipan. One section of four F6F Hellcats flying \\"rescue submarine cover patrol\\" near that island shot down three Mitsubishi A6M Zeke carrier fighters without American losses. Another F6F Hellcat, flying CAP over Bataan, shot down a Japanese Army Nakajima Ki-49 Helen bomber. That evening, TG 58.1 sailed south toward Guam. On 12 June, Bataan flew CAP and ASP over the task group while the three other carriers launched strikes at Orote air field on Guam. Her F6F Hellcats spotted two Japanese Yokosuka D4Y Judy bombers close to the task group and shot both down. Another attack of Rota on 13 June, Bataan aircraft concentrated on bombing Japanese antiaircraft gun positions and Piti Harbor. During recovery operations, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber jumped Bataans landing barrier and damaged four aircraft. The task group sailed for the Bonin Islands on the evening of 14 June. The task group was ordered to strike Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima in an effort to catch the airfields full of Japanese aircraft staging to the Marianas, fighter and bomber raids hit the islands on 15 June. Meanwhile, Bataans aircraft, flying CAP and ASP as usual, bombed and heavily damaged the Tatsutagawa Maru. On 16 June, after a morning fighter sweep over Iwo Jima, the task group received reports of a large Japanese force closing the Marianas from the Philippines. The planned afternoon strikes on Iwo Jima were canceled and Bataans task group hurried south to rejoin TF 58. Battle of the Philippine Sea Bataan and her task group rendezvoused with the other three fast carrier groups about noon on 18 June, approximately west of Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, while waiting to hear from dawn search missions, Bataan launched CAP and ASP aircraft to guard TG 58.1. At 0925, a TBM Avenger shot down a Nakajima A6M2-N Rufe seaplane fighter. Less than an hour later, starting at 1014, reports of multiple enemy raids caused the light carrier to launch all her available fighters. Over the next six hours, Bataans fighters helped break up four major raids, disrupting the Japanese attacks. Only one enemy formation approached TG 58.1 and only one out of the 16 torpedo bombers got close enough to be shot down by antiaircraft fire from the screening ships. The light carrier also sent a TBM Avenger strike against Rota around mid-day to help suppress Japanese land-based aircraft. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Bataans aircraft claimed 10 Japanese aircraft out of the approximately 300 enemy aircraft lost in the battle dubbed the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.\\" On the morning of 20 June, Bataan launched CAP and ASP as normal and steamed west as the task force prepared for a second day of battle. The enemy carriers, however, had turned toward Japan the previous evening, and American search aircraft could not find them. The only activity for Bataans aircraft occurred at 1320 when a Hellcat splashed a lone Betty near the task group. Finally, upon hearing a sighting report at 1613, the light carrier launched 10 fighters to accompany a massive 206-aircraft strike. The raid, catching the retreating Japanese at dusk, sank and damaged another. The American aircraft then returned to their carriers, landing with difficulty in the darkness after the task force turned on its deck and search lights. Eventually, two of Yorktowns aircraft landed on Bataan, the second of which crashed and fouled the deck. Nine of Bataans own fighters landed on other carriers, and one was lost. After a futile search for the Japanese carriers on 22 June, the American task force turned back toward the Marianas. On 23 June, Bataans aircraft bombed Pagan Island, damaging the airfield and shooting down four Zekes and a Betty. That afternoon, TG 58.1 turned northwest toward the Bonin Islands, attempting to complete the attacks canceled on 16 June. Bataan launched 17 fighters for the attack on Iwo Jima at dawn on 24 June but these, and the 34 Hellcats from Yorktown and Hornet, met a Japanese incoming strike about halfway to the target. A second melee developed near the carriers when another Japanese raid met with task force's CAP. Bataans air group lost three aircraft in these battles but claimed 25 in return. The task group then retired toward the Marshalls, anchoring at Eniwetok on 27 June. The brief rest ended when the task group sailed back to the Bonins on 30 June. The task force's aircraft struck at Iwo Jima on 3 and 4 July, interdicting Japanese efforts to reinforce Guam. The warship's crew, however, suffered another loss on 4 July when ad arresting gear cable snapped and killed one man and injured three others. In preparation for the landings planned for Guam in mid-July, Bataans aircraft conducted sweeps over Pagan Island on 5 July and then repeatedly bombed Guam from 6 to 11 July. On 12 July, her forward elevator failed permanently and she received orders to head home for repairs. She steamed by way of Eniwetok and Oahu before arriving in San Francisco on 30 July. Drydock refit and training Bataan entered the naval dry docks at Hunters Point on 30 July 1944 and, over the next two months, the yard workers repaired her elevator, painted the hull, and installed a second catapult, an air-search radar, deck lighting, rocket stowage, and a second aircraft landing barrier. She got underway for Hawaii on 7 October, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 13 October. Assigned to TG 19.5, Bataan spent the next four months preparing for operations against the Bonin and Ryukyu Islands which were the targets of invasions planned by the Americans for early 1945. Iwo Jima was needed to provide emergency airfields for B-29s bombing Japan from the Marianas and a base for their fighter escorts, while Okinawa was needed to support any future invasion of the Japanese home islands. Bataan spent most of November and December conducting pilot training exercises and night-fighter operations in Hawaiian waters. Seven aircraft were lost in accidents, including one Wildcat that crashed into her number 2 stack but only two pilots were injured. In January and February 1945, the focus of training operations shifted to night- fighter direction and ground-attack exercises. Accidents claimed another five aircraft, including a Vought F4U Corsair fighter that burned on the flight deck on 28 January 1945, but again no pilots were lost. The carrier entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 16 February, undergoing repairs to her flight deck and receiving three new 40-millimeter antiaircraft guns. Battle of Okinawa On 3 March 1945, Bataan departed Pearl Harbor for Ulithi, arriving at that atoll on 13 March. There she joined Task Unit (TU) 58.2.1, an ad hoc convoy comprising carriers , , , two battleships, two heavy cruisers and a host of destroyers formed for the short trip back to the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF-58). The task force conducted a series of raids to support the last major amphibious operation of the war, the invasion of Okinawa. Tasked with suppressing Japanese aircraft on Kyushu, one of the Japanese home islands, fighter sweeps and bomber strikes hit airfields on 18 March and struck at Japanese naval bases at Kure and Kobe. Over the next three days, vigorous counter-attacks by Japanese aircraft were mostly broken up by CAP, although a few aircraft got through and severely damaged Franklin. Other attacks targeted Bataan, whose antiaircraft guns claimed kills on two Judys and a Nakajima B6N Jill bomber. Bataans air group lost four aircraft in these actions while the ship's company suffered one man killed and eleven injured from shell fragments. Between 23 and 28 March, Bataans aircraft struck at Kerama Retto and conducted fighter sweeps over Okinawa. She then launched a raid on Kyushu on 29 March where her fighters claimed a Judy before returning to Okinawa operations. After the amphibious landings there on 1 April, the light carrier flew CAP over the amphibious forces and began intensive air strikes in support of Marine Corps operations ashore. Her aircraft also raided southern Kyushu, where Japanese kamikazes tended to congregate before major attacks. On 7 April, Bataans aircraft took part in the Battle of the East China Sea, when American search aircraft spotted a Japanese task force built around battleship Yamato. Swarms of carrier aircraft attacked the Japanese force as it steamed south in an effort to disrupt the American invasion of Okinawa. Bataans pilots claimed four torpedo hits on the giant battleship, as well as hits on a cruiser and two destroyers, that helped sink most of the Japanese task force. Bataan spent the next 10 days alternating between CAP sweeps over Okinawa and air strikes on southern Kyushu and nearby islands. Every three days or so, she retired eastward to refuel, rearm, and replenish at sea. During four enemy attacks on the task group over this period, one crew member was killed and 24 wounded when the ship was sprayed with shell fragments. Attack on Japanese home islands On 18 April, Bataan launched an antisubmarine patrol that assisted in the sinking of at . Following this, her aircraft returned to several weeks of air attacks on Okinawa and Kyushu. The heaviest Japanese counter-attack took place on 14 May when eight crewmen were killed and 26 others wounded. During these April and May operations, her gunners and pilots claimed a share in dozens of kills at a cost of nine aircraft and four air crewmen. Finally, on 29 May, she steamed south to the Philippines anchoring in San Pedro Bay on 1 June. Following a month of minor repairs to the warship and liberty for her crew, Bataan sailed in company with TG 38.3 on 1 July for the Japanese home islands. There her aircraft struck airfields in the Tokyo Bay area on 10 July, hit shore installations in northern Honshu and Hokkaido on 14 and 15 July, and helped to damage in Yokosuka Harbor on 18 July. Then her aircraft struck the naval base at Kure on 24 July, helping to sink and 15 small craft in the harbor. Bad weather canceled most of her air strikes late in the month, limiting her aircraft to attacks on 28 and 30 July, and, because a typhoon passed through the area, raids did not resume until 9 August. On that day her aircraft struck Misawa Air Base in northern Japan and on 10 August they battered Aomori. She returned to Honshu on 13 August working over the Tokyo area until 0635 on 15 August 1945 when all strikes were canceled following news that the Japanese intended to surrender. =Post-war= After the formal surrender ceremony on 2 September, Bataans aircraft air-dropped supplies to Allied prisoners of war at Zentzuji Camp in Shikoku. The carrier then steamed into Tokyo Bay on 6 September to pick up crew members ashore before departing for Okinawa that afternoon. After picking up 549 passengers there, she sailed for home on 10 September, steaming via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal and arriving in New York on 17 October. Bataan then sailed to the Boston Naval Shipyard on 30 October. Following two weeks of repairs, she was converted to a troop transport in preparation for Operation Magic Carpet, the return of soldiers from overseas. Bataan sailed for Europe on 21 November and moored in Naples harbor on the 29th where she embarked 2,121 Army officers and men. Arriving at Norfolk on 8 December, the troop-carrying warship then transported 890 Italian prisoners of war back to Naples, arriving there on 23 December. The following day, Bataan steamed out of the Bay of Naples with 2,089 Army troops embarked and arrived at Norfolk on 2 January 1946. On 10 January 1946, Bataan reported for inactivation at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. After conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) carrier, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 11 February 1947. =Korean War= In 1949, heightened international tensions between the United States and NATO on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and communist China on the other, led to increased military spending. As a result, the Navy began to expand in 1950. Bataan was recommissioned on 13 May 1950 at Philadelphia, Captain Edgar T. Neale in command. On 25 June, North Korean forces invaded into South Korea. Two days later, under United Nations (UN) auspices, the United States intervened in the conflict. Suddenly needed to train and deliver pilots and aircraft to the Korean theater, Bataan steamed for the west coast on 15 July and arrived at San Diego via the Panama Canal on 28 July. Bataan spent the next four months conducting training operations out of San Diego. She embarked naval air squadrons for carrier landing qualifications and antisubmarine warfare exercises. On 16 November, Bataan loaded Air Force cargo and personnel and sailed for Japan. After unloading her cargo there, she sailed on 14 December to report for duty with Task Force (TF) 77 off Korea's northeastern coast. First deployment Bataan joined the task force at a critical juncture in the conflict. Since 24 November, when some 30 Chinese divisions had intervened in the Korean war, bitter fighting had forced UN troops to retreat from the Yalu and Taedong Rivers. By mid-December, the American and South Korean troops on the east coast had fallen back to Hungnam. The soldiers, along with their vehicles, supplies, and almost 100,000 Korean refugees, were being shipped south to the Pusan perimeter. On 22 December, Bataan began flying Vought F4U-4 Corsair fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-212 over Hungnam to help cover the final phase of this evacuation. Her aircraft, along with aircraft from the carriers and , provided air cover to ground forces and shipping in the port area. Following the end of the evacuation on 24 December, her Corsairs then flew armed reconnaissance and close air support missions over the central mountains along the 38th parallel. On 31 December, a second communist offensive pushed south toward Seoul and Hanchon. In an attempt to stem the tide, Bataan was reassigned to Task Group (TG) 96.9 on the west coast of Korea. There, her aircraft attacked enemy troop concentrations below Seoul. After a replenishment period at Sasebo between 9 and 15 January 1951, Bataan relieved in the Yellow Sea on 16 January. Wearing the flag of Commander, Task Element (CTE) 95.1.1, Bataans mission was to blockade the west coast of Korea. While on station, Bataan generally flew 40 sorties a day - eight defensive CAP flights with the remainder divided between close air support (CAS), armed reconnaissance (AR), and interdiction missions. For CAS of ground forces, tactical air controllers usually called in Bataans Corsairs for bomb, rocket, and napalm attacks on known enemy positions. Daylight AR missions concentrated on halting enemy road traffic and bombing rail yards and bridges. The first patrol revealed the dangerous nature of this work when, between 16 and 26 January, VMF-212 lost three Corsairs, along with two pilots, to enemy small-arms fire. Over the next two months, Bataan conducted three more Yellow Sea patrols. In February and March, the light carrier supported the UN counterattack toward Inchon and Seoul, concentrating her air attacks on the Chinnampo area. These flights also included air spotting missions when cruisers and fired on targets ahead of advancing UN troops. Of the three Corsairs shot down by communist antiaircraft fire during these missions, two pilots were safely rescued by search and rescue (SAR) helicopters. On 8 April, after the fast carriers of TF 77 sailed south to Formosa to counter a perceived threat there, Bataan and HMS Theseus replaced them in the Sea of Japan. The two light carriers, screened by a pair of American destroyers and four British Commonwealth escorts, maintained the west coast blockade. Corsairs from Marine Attack Squadron VMF-312 along with British Fairey Firefly and Hawker Sea Fury fighters, bombed and strafed communist supply routes near Wonsan, Hamhung, and Songjin. Five aircraft and one pilot were lost to communist antiaircraft defenses. After a short visit to Sasebo between 16 and 20 April, Bataan resumed her alternating patrols with HMS Theseus off the west coast of Korea. On 21 April, in an unusual incident, two Corsairs of VMF-312 were attacked by four Russian-made Yakovlev Type 3U Yak fighters near Chinnampo. Marine Corps Capt. Philip C. DeLong shot down two of the Yaks, and heavily damaged a third, while 1st Lt. Harold D. Daigh, USMCR, shot down the fourth. According to Capt. DeLong, the North Korean pilots \\"were considerably inferior in flying ability to the Japanese of World War II.\\" The following day, 22 April, communist troops began another heavy attack toward Seoul, and Bataans aircraft flew 136 close air support sorties against them over the next four days. After a brief period of replenishment and upkeep at Sasebo between 27 and 30 April, Bataan returned to the Yellow Sea on 1 May. In company with the British carrier , she launched 244 offensive sorties against enemy troop concentrations, helping to stall and then reverse the communist offensive by 10 May. Later in the month, Bataans Corsairs concentrated on the destruction of junks and sampans in the Taedong Gang estuary until bad weather canceled flight operations. During these strikes, one pilot and aircraft was lost after being hit by 40-millimeter ground fire east of Anak. Relieved on 3 June by a British carrier, Bataan offloaded the aircraft and personnel of VMF-312 and proceeded for home via Japan, eventually mooring in San Diego harbor on 25 June. Following two weeks of rest and recreation for her crew, Bataan steamed to Bremerton, Washington, on 9 July for an extensive overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. When those repairs were complete, Bataan steamed to San Diego on 7 November for underway refresher training. Over the next 10 weeks, she conducted carrier landing qualifications and ASW exercises in preparation for a second deployment to the Far East. Second deployment Bataan got underway for Yokosuka on 27 January 1952, arriving in Tokyo Bay on 11 February after weathering a severe winter storm. There she embarked Scouting Squadron 25 (VS-25) and steamed south to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for ASW exercises. Between 24 February and 12 April, Bataan conducted three \\"hunter-killer\\" antisubmarine warfare exercises in the waters around Okinawa. Intended to prepare Allied forces to fight the Soviet submarine fleet in the event of Soviet intervention in Korea, these exercises pitted Bataans aircraft, including helicopters, against \\"enemy\\" submarines , , and . After refueling and replenishing at Yokosuka and Sasebo, the light carrier embarked VMA-312 at Kobe and departed Japan for operations off Korea on 29 April. She relieved HMS Glory as CTE-95.1.1 that same day and began combat sorties the following day. Ever since June 1951, the war in Korea had been bogged down in a military stalemate, with both sides heavily dug in along the 38th parallel. Tasked with interdicting communist supply routes between Hanchon and Yonan, Bataans aircraft flew 30 offensive sorties a day, bombing supply dumps, railway tracks, bridges, and road traffic. Her only aircraft loss of this line tour took place on 22 May when a Corsair was shot down by ground fire north of Pyongyang. While two other fighters provided cover, the pilot was rescued by an Air Force helicopter. That same day, another Corsair ejected a hung rocket while landing on Bataan. The rocket bounced forward on the flight deck and exploded, injuring three crewmen. She suffered no other losses that month and on 28 May she was relieved by . After sailing to Yokosuka for repairs to her flight deck, Bataan conducted three more Yellow Sea line tours in June and July, continuing the task of attacking communist supply lines. On 4 August, the warship turned for home and arrived in San Diego, via Pearl Harbor, on 26 August. Bataan entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 11 September for an overhaul, remaining there for three weeks. She then conducted two weeks of carrier qualification landings with VS-21, VS-23, and VS-871 until she began preparations for her third Far Eastern deployment. The warship steamed for Okinawa on 28 October, via Pearl Harbor, and anchored in Buckner Bay on 15 November. Third deployment Bataan headed for home the final time on 22 May 1953 Although fears of Soviet intervention in Korea had diminished, ASW exercises remained important to the units operating off Korea. Bataan conducted two such operations, one between 23 and 29 November 1952 and another between 17 and 23 December. The first operation included an \\"opposed\\" sortie against and , \\"hunter-killer\\" submarine searches, and general ASW patrols. She also practiced jet aircraft tracking with North American F-86 Sabre fighters operating out of Kadena airfield in Japan. The second exercise included electronic counter-measure (ECM) intercept exercises against and long-range ASW training with Lockheed P2V Neptunes. On 9 February 1953, after two more transit ASW exercises between Buckner Bay and Yokosuka, Bataan embarked VMA-312 for operations off Korea. She relieved HMS Glory as Commander, Task Unit (CTU) 95.1.1 on the 15th and began flying combat missions that same day. In addition to the usual armed reconnaissance patrols along the coast, her Marine Corps Corsairs attacked Chinese troop concentrations south of Chinnampo and on the Ongjin peninsula. These attacks were ordered because friendly partisan reports indicated Chinese troops were massing for attacks on UN-controlled islands close to the mainland. Bataan conducted four more line tours between 7 March and 5 May. Despite the bad flying weather associated with the spring thaw, VMA-312 continued to attack the enemy troop concentrations and supply dumps reported by friendly partisans. The Corsairs also attacked roads, railways, and especially bridges, as flood waters hampered communist repair efforts. After liberty at Yokosuka, Bataan sailed for home, via Pearl Harbor, on 10 May, arriving in San Diego on 26 May. She was undergoing repairs there on 27 July when the armistice was signed at Panmunjom in Korea. She then loaded aircraft and equipment destined for Japan and sailed on 31 July for a round-trip voyage to Kobe and Yokosuka. =Decommissioning and scrapping= Returning to Pearl Harbor, she reported for a preinactivation overhaul on 26 August 1953. After moving to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, Bataan was decommissioned on 9 April 1954 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Francisco. Although she was reclassified an auxiliary aircraft transport and redesignated AVT-4 on 15 May 1959, her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1959. She was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corp., Beverly Hills, California, on 19 June 1961 for scrapping. Awards Bataan received six battle stars for her World War II service and seven for her Korean War service.

She was named for the Battle of San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush served aboard the ship during World War II.  Operational history  Originally laid down as the light cruiser Newark (CL-100), on 26 October 1942 by the New York Shipbuilding Co., Camden, New Jersey; redesignated CV-30 and renamed Reprisal on 2 June 1942; renamed San Jacinto on 30 January 1943, converted, while building, to a light aircraft carrier and reclassified as CVL-30; launched on 26 September 1943; sponsored by Mary Gibbs Jones (wife of U.S. Commerce Secretary Jesse H. Jones); and commissioned on 15 November 1943, Capt. Harold M. Martin, in command. After shakedown in the Caribbean, San Jacinto sailed, via the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor, for the Pacific war zone. Arriving at Majuro, Marshall Islands, she joined Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Task Force 58/38, the fast carrier striking force of the Pacific Fleet. There, San Jacinto embarked Air Group 51, whose fighters and torpedo planes would be the ship's chief weapons in battle. = Marianas actions = After providing search patrols to protect other carriers striking at Marcus Island, San Jacinto rejoined the Fast Carrier Task Force, Task Force 58, on 21 May 1944 and was part of effective strikes against a weakened Japanese-held Wake Island on 23 May (there were no US troop landings in this action, Wake remained in Japanese hands until their surrender); Wake Island had previously been attacked by Task Force 14 on 5-6 October 1943. These were San Jacintos first offensive missions, and no combat casualties were incurred, but one TBF Avenger was lost and its aircrew listed as missing when it failed to return from an anti- submarine patrol. By 5 June 1944, San Jacinto was ready to participate in the largest fleet action since the Battle of Midway, almost exactly two years before. On that day, Task Force 58 sortied from Majuro and headed toward the Marianas to conduct air strikes preparatory to American seizure of Saipan and to protect the invasion forces from enemy air and naval attack. This American thrust triggered a strong Japanese reaction; on 19 June, the Japanese Fleet launched more than 400 planes against the invasion fleet and the covering carrier force. In the ensuing air battle, known to American pilots as the \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot,\\" more than 300 enemy planes were shot down. While San Jacintos planes were achieving their most one-sided victory of the war, her gunners helped to shoot down the few attackers able to get near the American ships. Then, at dusk, Admiral Mitscher dispatched an all-carrier attack after the retreating enemy fleet. The night recovery of the returning planes was accomplished amid considerable confusion. Reportedly, a Japanese carrier plane attempted a landing approach on San Jacinto, only to be waved off by the landing signal officer because its hook was not down. San Jacinto then participated in strikes against Rota and Guam and furnished combat air patrol (CAP) and antisubmarine patrol (ASP) for her task group. During these raids, a San Jacinto fighter pilot was shot down over Guam and spent 17 days in a life raft trying to attract attention and 16 nights hiding on the island. After a refueling and replenishment stop at Eniwetok Atoll, San Jacinto joined in carrier strikes against the Palaus on 15 July. On 5 August, her targets were Chichi, Haha and Iwo Jima. A brief stop at Eniwetok preceded dawn-to-dusk CAP and ASP duty while other carriers struck at Yap, Ulithi, Anguar and Babelthuap, pinning down Japanese air forces while the Palaus were being assaulted on 15 September. George H. W. Bush in his Grumman TBM Avenger aboard USS San Jacinto in 1944 On 2 September, while piloting a TBF Grumman Avenger #46214 from VT-51, future-President George H. W. Bush was shot down by anti- aircraft fire while attacking Japanese installations on the island of Chichijima. Bush for a time was considered the youngest navy pilot in history, and is known as the youngest pilot in WWII history to join an American torpedo bomber squad. Bush completed his bombing run, then guided his crippled plane out to sea. The two other crew members were lostLt W. White and ARM2c John Delaney, but Lieutenant (J.G.) Bush parachuted into the sea and was rescued by the submarine from potential cannibals.http://iht.com/articles/ap/2009/01/09/america/Bush-Aircraft- Carrier.php For his actions in the successful attack, 20-year old Bush received the Distinguished Flying Cross.http://americanwarriorsfivepresidents.com Following a replenishment stop at Manus, Admiralty Islands, San Jacinto joined in strikes against Okinawa and furnished photographic planes to get information necessary for future invasion plans. After refueling at sea, she once again supplied dawn- to-dusk air protection as other carriers sent strikes against Formosa, northern Luzon, and the Manila Bay area from 12 to 19 October. During operations on 17 October, a fighter plane made a very hard landing and inadvertently fired its machine guns into the ship's island structure, killing two men and wounding 24, including her commanding officer, and causing considerable damage to radar. Despite this accident, San Jacinto remained battle-worthy. As American troops landed on Leyte in the central Philippines on 20 October, San Jacinto provided close air support. On 24 October, this mission was interrupted by news of the three-pronged approach of the Japanese fleet which precipitated the largest fleet battle in naval history. = Philippines = San Jacinto sent planes against the central force in the Sibuyan Sea, then raced north to launch strikes against the northern force, resulting in heavy damage to the Japanese carriers and surface combatants off Cape Enga√±o. On 30 October, her fighters furnished air protection over Leyte while her guns shot down two planes attempting suicide attacks on the ship. After a pause at Ulithi, the carrier joined in attacks on the Manila Bay area; then took a side trip to Guam to exchange air groups, receiving Air Group 45. She received slight damage during a typhoon in December 1944. After completing repairs at Ulithi, San Jacinto and the rest of her fast carrier force entered the South China Sea and launched massive air attacks on the airfields of Formosa and against shipping at Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, and at Hong Kong. By refueling and replenishing at sea, Task Force 38 was able to continue its pressure on the enemy and strategic support for the American invasion of Luzon by strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. = Attacks over Japan = Next, San Jacinto joined in the first carrier strikes against the home islands of Japan. During the raids on 16 and 17 February 1945, carrier-based aircraft shot down many enemy planes during fierce dogfights over airfields in the Tokyo area. These operations were designed to cover the imminent invasion of Iwo Jima. Next came air support for the landing Marines, followed by further strikes against Tokyo and Okinawa before San Jacinto returned to Ulithi. While conducting operations off Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan, she witnessed the conflagration on the carrier ; and, on 19 March 1945, escaped destruction when a kamikaze narrowly missed her. More massive enemy attacks came with Operation \\"Iceberg\\" as the carrier force furnished air support for the invasion of Okinawa. On 5 April, more than 500 planes, primarily kamikazes, attacked. Fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down about 300, but many got through. San Jacintos gunners shot the wing off a would-be suicide plane, deflecting its dive; it splashed down only 50 feet off her port bow. Her mission of covering the Okinawa invasion entailed heavy air activity and kept the ship almost constantly at general quarters while supporting ground forces and repelling frequent attacks by suicide planes. On 7 April, San Jacinto'ss bombers torpedoed the Japanese destroyers and , part of a naval suicide attack in which super battleship was also sunk. San Jacinto then returned to the dangerous job of defending against the suicide plane attacks, striking at the kamikaze airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´, and providing close air support for ground forces fighting on Okinawa. On 5 June, she successfully rode out another typhoon, and after replenishing at Leyte sortied for her final raids as part of Task Force 58. Her aircraft struck at Hokkaid≈ç and Honsh≈´, Japan, on 9 July and continued to operate off the coast of Japan until the end of hostilities on 15 August 1945. After the ceasefire preceding Japan's formal surrender, her air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. Her wartime mission completed, San Jacinto returned home and tied up at NAS Alameda, California, on 14 September 1945.  Fate  She was decommissioned on 1 March 1947 and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet berthed at San Diego. She was reclassified as an auxiliary aircraft transport (AVT-5) on 15 May 1959, and struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1970; her hull was sold for scrapping in December 1971.

Biography  Kenneth Anderson was born in Bolarum and came from a British family that settled in India for six generations. His father Aryan Stewart Anderson was superintendent of the F.C.M.A. in Poona, Maharashtra and dealt with the salaries paid to military personnel, having an honorary rank of captain. His mother Lucy Ann n√©e Taylor was the grand- daughter of John Taylor who, for his services, had been gifted land in Bangalore by Sir Mark Cubbon. Douglas like most British soldiers took an interest in sport hunting and influenced Anderson's interest in the outdoors and hunting. Anderson went to Bishop Cotton Boys' School and also studied at St Joseph's College, Bangalore. He was sent to study law at Edinburgh but he quit studies and returned to India. He worked for fifteen years in the posts and telegraph department and later worked at the British Aircraft Factory in Bangalore (later HAL) in the rank of Factory Manager for Planning. He owned nearly 200 acres of land across Karnataka, Hyderabad and Tamil Nadu. In 1972 he was diagnosed with cancer from which he died in 1974. He was buried at the Hosur road cemetery.  Family Anderson met Cheryl Majoire Blossom Minnette n√©e Fleming who came from Sri Lanka (her mother Millicient Toussaint was a Burgher while her father Clifford Fleming was from Australia) at Bowring Club in Bangalore. They married in April 1929 at Sorkalpet, Cuddalore, then had a daughter named June (born 19 June 1930) and a son named Donald (18 February 1934 - 12 July 2014) who also took an interest in hunting. The couple separated in later life; Kenneth Anderson moved to Whitefield, while Blossom stayed on at Prospect House, their home on Sydney Road (now Kasturba Road). Blossom died on 11 March 1987.  Outdoors and writings  His love for the inhabitants of the Indian jungle led him to big game hunting and to writing real-life adventure stories. He often went into the jungle alone and unarmed to meditate and enjoy the beauty of untouched nature. As a hunter, he tracked down man-eating tigers and leopards. His kills include the Sloth bear of Mysore, the Leopard of Gummalapur, the Rogue Elephant of Panapatti, the Leopard of the Yellagiri Hills, the Tigress of Jowlagiri, the Tiger of Segur and the Tiger of Mundachipallam. He is officially recorded as having shot 8-man-eating leopards (7 males and 1 female) and 7 tigers (5 males and 2 females) on the Government records from 1939 to 1966 though he is rumored to have unofficially shot over 18 man eating panthers and over 15‚Äì20-man eating tigers. He also shot a few rogue elephants. Anderson's style of writing is descriptive, as he talks about his adventures with wild animals. While most stories are about hunting tigers and leopards ‚Äì particularly man-eaters ‚Äì he includes chapters on his first-hand encounters with elephants, bison, and bears. There are stories about the less 'popular' creatures like Indian wild dogs, hyenas, and snakes. He explains the habits and personalities of these animals. Anderson gives insights into the people of the Indian jungles of his time, with woods full of wildlife and local inhabitants having to contend with poor quality roads, communication and health facilities. His books delve into the habits of the jungle tribes, their survival skills, and their day-to-day lives. He also explored the occult, and wrote about his experiences for which he had no explanation. Anderson was often sought to shoot man-eaters in villages in southern India. He spoke Kannada, the language of his home town Bangalore, and Tamil, a language of the neighboring state of Tamilnadu. He had a Studebaker car and usually hunted with a .405 Winchester Model 1895 rifle. He was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in southern India, and spent his later years \\"shooting\\" with a camera. Anderson expounds his love for India, its people, and its jungles. He believed in the power of alternative medicine and carried a box containing natural herbs from the jungle. He refused most treatments based on Western medicine and died of prostate cancer. (However, when he was mauled by a man-eating tiger, he took penicillin to counter the possible infection.) This incident is described in his book Man Eaters and Jungle Killers in the chapter entitled \\"The Maurauder of Kempekarai\\".Anderson, Kenneth \\"Man Eaters and Jungle Killers\\", Swapna Printing Works His last book, Jungles Long Ago, was published posthumously. He wrote a novel called the Fires of Passion which highlighted the situation of the Scottish people in South India.Hunters Tales, Frontline Onnet In his introduction to Tales from the Indian Jungle, Anderson writes: \\"He [Anderson] appears to be of the jungle himself, and we get the impression that he belongs there. This is the home for him and here is the place he would want to die; the jungle is his birthplace, his heaven and his resting place when the end comes.\\" Jungle folk Kenneth Anderson became well acquainted with many jungle folk from various aborigine tribes; Byra the Poojare from the poojaree tribe, Ranga a petty shikari who also occasionally took to poaching, and Rachen from the Sholaga tribe. Some of his friends such as Hughie Hailstone also had estates in South India and he also tells us about Eric Newcombe, his friend from his young days who used to get into a lot of trouble.

It is partially migratory, with birds tending to move south in winter. The southernmost birds are mainly resident. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. Taxonomy and systematics The current genus name is from the Latin for lark. The specific leucoptera means \\"white-winged\\", from leukos, \\"white\\", and pteron, \\"wing\\". Formerly, the white-winged lark was classified as belonging to the genus Melanocorypha until moved to Alauda in 2014. Description This lark is large and robust, usually 17‚Äì19 cm in length, with a wingspan of 35 cm. Both sexes weigh about 44 g. In flight, it is unmistakable due to its striking wing pattern: black outer flight feathers, white inner flight feathers, and the rest of the wing chestnut. Its body is dark-streaked grey above and whitish below. The adult male has a chestnut crown, but the sexes are otherwise similar. =Vocalisations= Its song is a more melodious version of the Eurasian skylark's. Behaviour and ecology The white-winged lark lives in dry, open steppe and plains. It nests on the ground, laying three to eight eggs per clutch. Its diet consists of seeds, and insects during the breeding season. It is gregarious during the winter. =Threats= Habitat destruction due to ploughing is one of the main threats to the white-winged lark. Status Although its population has declined significantly, it is still relatively common, and is not considered to be at risk.

Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for \\"exceptional and distinguished service\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The award criteria include \\"service in any field including service rendered by Government servants\\" including doctors and scientists, but excluding those working with the public sector undertakings. , the award has been bestowed on 314 individuals, including seventeen posthumous and twenty-one non-citizen recipients. During 1 May and 15 September of every year, the recommendations for the award are submitted to the Padma Awards Committee, constituted by the Prime Minister of India. The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, the Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and previous Padma Vibhushan award recipients, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers and the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament including private individuals. The committee later submits their recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for the further approval. The award recipients are announced on Republic Day. The first recipients of the award were Satyendra Nath Bose, Nand Lal Bose, Zakir Hussain, Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, and V. K. Krishna Menon, who were honoured in 1954. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute. The \\"Padma Vibhushan\\", along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended twice, from July 1977 to January 1980 and from August 1992 to December 1995.

Namboodiripad, Swami Ranganathananda, and Manikonda Chalapathi Rau refused the award, the family members of Lakshmi Chand Jain (2011) and Sharad Anantrao Joshi (2016) declined their posthumous conferments, and Baba Amte returned his 1986 conferment in 1991. Most recently on 25 January 2020, the award has been bestowed upon seven recipients: George Fernandes, Arun Jaitley, Anerood Jugnauth, Mary Kom, Chhannulal Mishra, Sushma Swaraj, and Vishwesha Teertha. History On 2 January 1954, a press release was published from the office of the secretary to the President of India announcing the creation of two civilian awards‚ÄîBharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into \\"Pahela Varg\\" (Class I), \\"Dusra Varg\\" (Class II), and \\"Tisra Varg\\" (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards: the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri. The award, along with other personal civilian honours, was briefly suspended twice in its history; for the first time in July 1977 when Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister of India, for being \\"worthless and politicized\\". The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980 after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister. The civilian awards were suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed in the High Courts of India, one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand. Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being \\"titles\\" per an interpretation of Article 18 (1) of the Constitution of India. On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards. A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India was formed comprising five judges: A. M. Ahmadi C. J., Kuldip Singh, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, N. P. Singh, and S. Saghir Ahmad. On 15 December 1995, the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgment that the \\"Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution of India\\". Regulations The award is conferred for \\"exceptional and distinguished service\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The criteria include \\"service in any field including service rendered by Government servants\\", but excludes those working with the public sector undertakings, with the exception of doctors and scientists. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute; Aditya Nath Jha, Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq, and Vikram Sarabhai became the first recipients to be honoured posthumously in 1972. The recommendations are received from all state and union territory governments, the Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and previous Padma Vibhushan award recipients, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers, the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament, including private individuals. The recommendations received during 1 May and 15 September of every year are submitted to the Padma Awards Committee, convened by the Prime Minister of India. The Awards Committee later submits its recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for further approval. The Padma Vibhushan award recipients are announced every year on Republic Day of India and registered in The Gazette of Indiaa publication released weekly by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices. The conferral of the award is not considered official without its publication in the Gazette. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which actions require the authority of the President, are also registered in the Gazette and are required to surrender their medals when their names are struck from the register. Specifications The original 1954 specifications of the award called for a circle made of gold gilt in diameter, with rims on both sides. A centrally located lotus flower was embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text \\"Padma Vibhushan\\" written in Devanagari script was inscribed above the lotus along the upper edge of the medal. A floral wreath was embossed along the lower edge and a lotus wreath at the top along the upper edge. The Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the text \\"Desh Seva\\" in Devanagari Script on the lower edge. The medal was suspended by a pink riband in width divided into two equal segments by a white vertical line. A year later, the design was modified. The current decoration is a circular-shaped bronze toned medallion in diameter and thick. The centrally placed pattern made of outer lines of a square of side is embossed with a knob carved within each of the outer angles of the pattern. A raised circular space of in diameter is placed at the centre of the decoration. A centrally located lotus flower is embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text \\"Padma\\" written in Devanagari script is placed above and the text \\"Vibhushan\\" is placed below the lotus. The Emblem of India is placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto of India, \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" (Truth alone triumphs), in Devanagari Script, inscribed on the lower edge. The rim, the edges. and all embossing on either side is of white gold with the text \\"Padma Vibhushan\\" of silver gilt. The medal is suspended by a pink riband in width. The medal is ranked fourth in the order of precedence of wearing of medals and decorations. The medals are produced at Alipore Mint, Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Bharat Ratna, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Veer Chakra. * Recipients {class=\\"plainrowheaders\\" + ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"vertical- align:top\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top\\" } The first recipients of the Padma Vibhushan were Satyendra Nath Bose, Nandalal Bose, Zakir Husain, Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, V.

It is renowned for prehistoric parietal cave art featuring charcoal drawings and polychrome paintings of contemporary local fauna and human hands. The earliest paintings were applied during the Upper Paleolithic, around 36,000 years ago. The site was discovered in 1868 by Modesto Cubillas and subsequently studied by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. Aside from the striking quality of its polychromatic art, Altamira's fame stems from the fact that its paintings were the first European cave paintings for which a prehistoric origin was suggested and promoted. Sautuola published his research with the support of Juan de Vilanova y Piera in 1880, to initial public acclaim. However, the publication of Sanz de Sautuola's research quickly led to a bitter public controversy among experts, some of whom rejected the prehistoric origin of the paintings on the grounds that prehistoric human beings lacked sufficient ability for abstract thought. The controversy continued until 1902, by which time reports of similar findings of prehistoric paintings in the Franco-Cantabrian region had accumulated and the evidence could no longer be rejected. Altamira is located in the Franco- Cantabrian region and in 1985 was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a key location of the Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain. The cave can no longer be visited, for conservation reasons, but there are replicas of a section at the site and elsewhere.  Description  Bison on the roof of the pit. The cave is approximately long and consists of a series of twisting passages and chambers. The main passage varies from two to six meters in height. The cave was formed through collapses following early karst phenomena in the calcareous rock of Mount Vispieres. Archaeological excavations in the cave floor found rich deposits of artifacts from the Upper Solutrean (c.18,500 years ago) and Lower Magdalenian (between c.16,590 and 14,000 years ago). Both periods belong to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. In the two millennia between these two occupations, the cave was evidently inhabited only by wild animals. Human occupants of the site were well- positioned to take advantage of the rich wildlife that grazed in the valleys of the surrounding mountains as well as the marine life available in nearby coastal areas. Around 13,000 years ago a rockfall sealed the cave's entrance, preserving its contents until its eventual discovery, which occurred after a nearby tree fell and disturbed the fallen rocks. Human occupation was limited to the cave mouth, although paintings were created throughout the length of the cave. The artists used charcoal and ochre or hematite to create the images, often diluting these pigments to produce variations in intensity and creating an impression of chiaroscuro. They also exploited the natural contours of the cave walls to give their subjects a three-dimensional effect. The Polychrome Ceiling is the most impressive feature of the cave, depicting a herd of extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus) in different poses, two horses, a large doe, and possibly a wild boar. Great hall of polychromes of Altamira, published by M. Sanz de Sautuola in 1880. Dated to the Magdalenian occupation, these paintings include abstract shapes in addition to animal subjects. Solutrean paintings include images of horses and goats, as well as handprints that were created when artists placed their hands on the cave wall and blew pigment over them to leave a negative image. Numerous other caves in northern Spain contain Paleolithic art, but none is as complex or well-populated as Altamira.  Discovery, excavation, scepticism  Bison (reproduction) in the great hall of polychromes In 1879, amateur archaeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola was led by his eight-year-old daughter to discover the cave's drawings.Travel Advisory; A Modern Copy Of Ancient Masters, The New York Times, 4 November 2001 The cave was excavated by Sautuola and archaeologist Juan Vilanova y Piera from the University of Madrid, resulting in a much acclaimed publication in 1880 which interpreted the paintings as Paleolithic in origin. The French specialists, led by Gabriel de Mortillet and √âmile Cartailhac, were particularly adamant in rejecting the hypothesis of Sautuola and Piera, whose findings were loudly ridiculed at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon. Due to the high artistic quality, and the exceptional state of conservation of the paintings, Sautuola was accused of forgery, as he was unable to answer why there were no soot (smoke) marks on the walls and ceilings of the cave. A fellow countryman maintained that the paintings had been produced by a contemporary artist, on Sautuola's orders. Later, Sautuola found out the artist could have used marrow fat as oil for the lamp, producing much less soot than any other combustibles. It was not until 1902, when several other findings of prehistoric paintings had served to render the hypothesis of the extreme antiquity of the Altamira paintings less offensive, that the scientific society retracted their opposition to the Spaniards. That year, Cartailhac emphatically admitted his mistake in the famous article, \\"Mea culpa d'un sceptique\\", published in the journal L'Anthropologie. Sautuola, having died 14 years earlier, did not live to witness his rehabilitation. Further excavation work on the cave was done by Hermilio Alcalde del R√≠o between 1902‚Äì04, the German Hugo Obermaier between 1924‚Äì25 and finally by Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez Echegaray in 1968.  Dating and periodization  Association of the animals in the cave of Altamira, by Leroi-Gourhan. There is no scientific agreement on the dating of the archeological artifacts found in the cave, nor the drawings and paintings, and scientists continue to evaluate the age of the cave art at Altamira. In 2008, researchers using uranium-thorium dating found that the paintings were completed over a period of up to 20,000 years rather than during a comparatively brief period. A later study published in 2012 based on data obtained from further uranium-thorium dating research, dated some paintings in several caves in North Spain, including some of the claviform signs in the \\"Gran sala\\" of Altamira. The oldest sign found, a \\"large red claviform-like symbol of Techo de los Pol√≠cromos\\", was dated to (corrected), i.e. still well within the Aurignacian. A red dotted outline horse, also in the Techo de los Pol√≠cromos chamber, was dated to (beginning Solutrean), establishing that the paintings span a period of more than 10,000 years.A. W. G. Pike et al., \\"U-Series Dating of Paleolithic Art in 11 Caves in Spain\\", Science 336, 1409 (2012), . \\"We present uranium-series disequilibrium dates of calcite deposits overlying or underlying art found in 11 caves, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage sites of Altamira, El Castillo, and Tito Bustillo, Spain. The results demonstrate that the tradition of decorating caves extends back at least to the Early Aurignacian period, with minimum ages of 40.8 thousand years for a red disk, 37.3 thousand years for a hand stencil, and 35.6 thousand years for a claviform-like symbol. These minimum ages reveal either that cave art was a part of the cultural repertoire of the first anatomically modern humans in Europe or that perhaps Neandertals also engaged in painting caves.\\" Table 1: Ages are corrected for detritus by using an assumed 232Th/238U activity of and 230Th/238U and 234U/238U at equilibrium.  Visitors and replicas  Reproduction of the Cave of Altamira in the Deutsches Museum, Munich. During the 1970s and 2000s, the paintings were being damaged by the carbon dioxide and water vapor in the breath of the large number of visitors. Altamira was completely closed to the public in 1977, and reopened to limited access in 1982. Very few visitors were allowed in per day, resulting in a three-year waiting list. After green mold began to appear on some paintings in 2002, the caves were closed to public access. A replica cave and museum were built nearby and completed in 2001 by Manuel Franquelo and Sven Nebel, reproducing the cave and its art. The replica allows a more comfortable view of the polychrome paintings of the main hall of the cave, as well as a selection of minor works. It also includes some sculptures of human faces that are not visitable in the real cave. As well as the adjacent National Museum and Research Center of Altamira there are reproductions in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain (Madrid), in the Deutsches Museum in Munich (completed 1964) and in Japan (completed 1993). During 2010 there were plans to reopen access to the cave towards the end of that year. In December 2010, however, the Spanish Ministry of Culture decided that the cave would remain closed to the public.Visita la Cueva de Altamira This decision was based on advice from a group of experts who had found that the conservation conditions inside the cave had become much more stable since the closure.  Cultural impact  A modern interpretation of a bison from the Altamira cave ceiling, one of the cave's most famous paintings. Some of the polychrome paintings at Altamira Cave are well known in Spanish popular culture. The logo used by the autonomous government of Cantabria to promote tourism to the region is based on one of the bisons in this cave. Bisonte (Spanish for \\"bison\\"), a Spanish cigarette brand of the 20th century, also used a Paleolithic style bison figure along with its logo. The Spanish comic series Altamiro de la Cueva, created in 1965, are a consequence of the fame of Altamira Cave. The comic series depicts the adventures of a group of prehistoric cavemen, shown as modern people, but dressed in pieces of fur, a bit like the Flintstones. The song \\"The Caves of Altamira\\" appears on the 1976 album The Royal Scam by jazz-rock band Steely Dan, later covered by soul group Perri. The mid-20th-century modern dinnerware line Primitive, designed by Viktor Schreckengost for the American pottery company Salem China, was based on the bison, deer, and stick figure hunters depicted in the Altamira cave paintings. The song \\"Cuevas de Altamira\\" (Caves of Altamira) appears on the 1978 album Cuevas de Altamira by the symphonic progressive rock-folk group Ibio from Cantabria. The iconic bison image has been used for the cover of the poetry collection Songs for the Devil and Death by Scottish author Hal Duncan.Songs for the Devil and Death  Circle Six The protagonist in Satyajit Ray's film Agantuk was inspired by the charging Bison painting to leave his home and study tribal people. In 2007, the caves were selected as one of the 12 Treasures of Spain, a contest conducted by broadcasters Antena 3 and COPE. In 2016, British Director Hugh Hudson released the film Altamira (called Finding Altamira outside Spain) about the discovery of the caves, starring Antonio Banderas and with music by Mark Knopfler released on the soundtrack album Altamira.

See p.227: \\"[H√©bert] was himself a journalist... producer of the increasingly popular P√®re Duchesne.\\" H√©bert was a leader of the French Revolution and had thousands of followers as the H√©bertists (French H√©bertistes); he himself is sometimes called P√®re Duchesne, after his newspaper. Early life H√©bert arrived in Paris in 1780, at the age of 23. He was born on 15 November 1757 at Alen√ßon, to goldsmith, former trial judge, and deputy consul Jacques H√©bert (died 1766) and Marguerite Beunaiche de Houdrie (1727‚Äì1787). Jacques-Ren√© H√©bert studied law at the College of Alen√ßon and went into practice as a clerk in a solicitor of Alen√ßon, at which time he was ruined by a lawsuit against a Dr. Clouet. H√©bert fled first to Rouen and then to Paris. For a while he passed through a difficult financial time and lived through the support of a hairdresser in rue des Noyers. There he found work in a theater, la R√©publique, where he wrote plays in his spare time, but these were never produced. He was fired for stealing. He then entered the service of a doctor. It is said he lived through expediency and scams. In 1789, he began his writing with a pamphlet \\"la Lanterne magique ou le Fl√©au des Aristocrates\\" (Magic Lantern, or Scourge of Aristocrats). He published a few booklets. In 1790, he attracted attention through a pamphlet he published, and became a prominent member of the club of the Cordeliers in 1791. P√®re Duchesne From 1790 until his death in 1794 H√©bert became a voice for the working class of Paris through his highly successful and influential journal, Le P√®re Duchesne. In his journal, H√©bert assumed the voice of a patriotic sans-culotte named P√®re Duchesne and would write first-person narratives in which P√®re Duchesne would often relay fictitious conversations that he had with the French monarchs or government officials.Sonenscher, Michael. \\"The Sans-culottes of the Year II: Rethinking the Language of Labour in Revolutionary France\\". Social History Vol. 9 No. 3 (1984): 326. These stories encouraged violent behaviors and utilized foul language; P√®re Duchesne's stories were also witty, reflective, and resonated deeply with Parisian workers. Street hawkers would yell: Il est bougrement en col√®re aujourd‚Äôhui le p√®re Duchesne! (Father Duchesne is very angry today!). Although H√©bert did not create the image of the P√®re Duchesne, his use of the character helped to transform the symbolic image of P√®re Duchesne from that of a comical stove-merchant into a patriotic role model for the sans culottes. In part, H√©bert's use of P√®re Duchesne as a revolutionary symbol can be seen by his appearance as a bristly old man who was portrayed as smoking a pipe and wearing a Phrygian cap. Because he reflected both the speech and dressing style of his audience, his readers listened to and followed his message. The French linguist and historian Ferdinand Brunot called H√©bert \\"The Homer of filth\\" because of his ability to use common language to appeal to general audiences In addition, P√®re Duchesne's appearance played into the tensions of the revolution through the sharp contrast of his clothing and portrayal as a laborer against the crown and aristocracy's formal attire.Landes, Joan. \\"More than Words: The Printing Press and the French Revolution\\". Review of Revolution in Print: The Press in France, by Robert Darton, Daniel Roche; Naissance du Journal Revolutionnaire, by Claude Labrosse, Pierre Retat; La Revolution du Journal, by Pierre Retat; Revolutionary News; The Press in France, by Jeremy D. Popkin. Eighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 25 No. 1 (1991): 85‚Äì91. H√©bert was not the only writer during the French Revolution to use the image of P√®re Duchesne nor was he the only author in the period to adopt foul language as a way of appealing to the working class. Another writer at the time, Lemaire, also wrote a newspaper entitled P√®re Duch√™ne (although he spelt it differently than H√©bert) from September 1790 until May 1792 in which he assumed the voice of a \\"moderate patriot\\" who wanted to conserve the relationship between the king and the nation. Lemaire's character also used a slew of profanities and would address France's military. H√©bert's paper, however, became far more popular. In part, this was due to the Paris Commune deciding to buy his papers and distribute them to the French military for distribution to soldiers in training. For example, starting in 1792 the Paris Commune and the ministers of war Jean-Nicolas Pache and, later, Jean Baptiste No√´l Bouchotte bought several thousand copies of Le P√®re Duchesne which were distributed free to the public and troops. This happened again in May and June 1793 when the Minister of War bought copies of newspapers in order to \\"enlighten and animate their patriotism.\\" It is estimated that H√©bert received 205,000 livres from this purchase. thumb120pxleft \\"The Indignation of P√®re Duchesne\\" (1790). H√©bert's political commentary between 1790 and 1793 focused on the lavish excesses of the monarchy. Initially, from 1790 and into 1792, Le P√®re Duchesne supported a constitutional monarchy and was even favorable towards King Louis XVI and the opinions of the Marquis de La Fayette. His violent attacks of the period were aimed at Jean-Sifrein Maury, a great defender of papal authority and the main opponent of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Although the character of P√®re Duchesne supported a constitutional monarchy, he was always highly critical of Marie Antoinette. Knowing that the queen was an easy target for ridicule after the Diamond Necklace Affair, she became a consistent target in the paper as a scapegoat for many of France's political problems. By identifying Marie Antoinette's lavish excesses and alleged sexuality as the core of the monarchy's problems, H√©bert's articles suggested that, if Marie Antoinette would change her ways and renounce aristocratic excesses, then the monarchy could be saved and the queen could return to the good will of the people. Despite his view that the monarchy could be restored, H√©bert was skeptical of the queen's willingness to do so and often characterized her as an evil enemy of the people by referring to Marie Antoinette as \\"Madame Veto\\" and even addressing Louis XVI as \\"drunken and lazy; a cuckolded pig\\". Initially, H√©bert was trying to not only educate his readers about the queen, but also awaken her to how she was viewed by the French public. Many of the conversations that P√®re Duchesne carries with her in the newspaper are attempts at either showcasing her supposed nymphomania or attempts to beg her to repent and reverse her wicked ways.Kaiser, Thomas. \\"Who‚Äôs Afraid of Marie-Antoinette? Diplomacy, Austrophobia, and the Queen.\\" French History, Vol. 14 No. 3 (2000): 241‚Äì271. With the king's failed flight to Varennes his tone significantly hardened. Many writers and journalists at the time were greatly influenced by the proclamation of martial law on 21 October 1789. It invoked various questions and patterns of Revolutionary thinking and inspired various forms of writing such as Le P√®re Duchesne. The law prompted multiple interpretations all of which led to what became essential Revolutionary ideals. In his newspaper, Le P√®re Duchesne, H√©bert did not use himself as the prime example of the Revolution. He used a mythical character called the P√®re Duchesne to be able to relay his message in a more subtle way. He was already well known by the people of Paris and only wanted his message to be received directly and clearly by his followers and not his enemies. P√®re Duchesne was a very strong, outspoken character with extremely high emotions. He constantly felt great anger but also would experience great happiness. He was never afraid to fully display exactly how he was feeling. He would constantly use foul language and other harsh words to express himself. \\"The Great Anger of P√®re Duchesne\\" (1792). Revolutionary role H√©bert agreed with most of the ideals of the radical Montagnard faction; however, he was not a member of the faction. On 17 July 1791, H√©bert was at the Champ de Mars to sign a petition to demand the removal of King Louis XVI and was caught up in the subsequent Champ de Mars massacre by troops under Lafayette. This put him in the revolutionary mindset, and the Le P√®re Duchesne adopted a sloppier style to better appeal to the masses. Le P√®re Duchesne began to attack Lafayette, Mirabeau, and Bailly. Following Louis's failed flight to Varennes he began to attack both Louis and Pope Pius VI as well. H√©bert met his future wife Marie Goupil (born 1756), a 37-year-old former nun who had left convent life at the Sisters of Providence convent at rue Saint-Honor√©. Marie's passport from this time shows regular use. They married on 7 February 1792, and had a daughter, Virginia Scipion-H√©bert (7 February 1793 ‚Äì 13 July 1830). During this time, H√©bert had a luxurious, bourgeois life. He entertained Jean-Nicolas Pache, the mayor of Paris and Minister of War, for weeks, as well as other influential men, and liked to dress elegantly and surround himself with beautiful objects such as pretty tapestries‚Äîan attitude that can be contrasted to that of Paris Commune president Pierre Gaspard Chaumette. Where he got the financial resources to support his lifestyle is unclear; however, there are Jean-Nicolas Pache's commissions to print thousands of issues of Le P√®re Duchesne and his relationship to Delaunay d'Angers, mistress and wife of Andres Maria de Guzman. As a member of Cordeliers club, he had a seat in the revolutionary Paris Commune where on 9 and 10 August 1792 he was sent to the Bonne-Nouvelle section of Paris. As a public journalist, he supported the September Massacres. On 22 December 1792, he was appointed the second substitute of the procureur of the commune, and through to August 1793 supported the attacks against the Girondin faction. In April‚ÄìMay 1793 he, along with Marat and others, violently attacked Girondins. In February 1793, he voted with fellow bourgeois H√©bertists against the Maximum Price Act, a price ceiling on grain, on the grounds it would cause hoarding and stir resentment. On 20 May 1793 the moderate majority of the National Convention formed the Special Commission of Twelve, which was designed to investigate and prosecute conspirators. At the urging of the Twelve on 24 May 1793 he was arrested. However, H√©bert had been warned in time, and, with the support of the Sans Culottes, the National Convention was forced to order his release three days later. Dechristianization Dechristianization was a movement that took hold during the French Revolution in which advocates believed that, in order to pursue a secular society, they had to reject the superstitions of the old regime and, as an extension, Catholicism. The trend toward secularization had already begun to take hold throughout France during the eighteenth century; however, between September 1793 and August 1794, French politicians began discussing and embracing notions of \\"radical dechristianization.\\" While Robespierre advocated for the right to religion and believed that aggressively pursuing dechristianization would spur widespread revolts throughout rural France, H√©bert and his followers, the H√©bertists, wanted to spontaneously and violently overhaul religion. The program of dechristianization waged against Catholicism, and eventually against all forms of Christianity, included the deportation of clergy and the condemnation of many of them to death, the closing of churches, the institution of revolutionary and civic cults, the large scale destruction of religious monuments, the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education, forced marriages of the clergy and forced abjurement of their priesthood. On 21 October 1793 a law was passed which made all suspected priests and all persons who harbored them liable to death on sight. On 10 November 1793, dechristianization reached what many historians consider the climax of the movement when the H√©bertists moved the first celebration of the Festival of Reason, a civic festival celebrating the goddess of Reason, from the Circus of the Palais Royale to the Cathedral of Notre Dame and reclaimed the cathedral as a \\"Temple of Reason.\\" On 7 June Robespierre, who had previously condemned the Cult of Reason, advocated a new state religion and recommended that the Convention acknowledge the existence of God. On the next day, the worship of the deistic Supreme Being was inaugurated as an official aspect of the Revolution. Compared with H√©bert's somewhat popular festivals, this austere new religion of Virtue was received with signs of hostility by the Parisian public. Clash with Robespierre, arrest, conviction, and execution After successfully attacking the Girondins, H√©bert continued to attack others whom he viewed as too moderate, including Danton, Philippeaux, and Robespierre in the fall of 1793 among others. When H√©bert accused Marie- Antoinette during her trial of incest with her son, Robespierre called him a fool (\\"imb√©cile\\").Joachim Vilate (1795) Causes secr√®tes de la r√©volution du 9 au 10 thermidor, p. 12-13 The government, with support from the Jacobins, was exasperated and finally decided to strike on the night of 13 March 1794, despite the reluctance of Bar√®re de Vieuzac, Collot d'Herbois and Billaud- Varenne. The order was to arrest the leaders of the H√©bertists; these included individuals in the War Ministry and others. In the Revolutionary Tribunal, H√©bert was treated very differently from Danton, more like a thief than a conspirator; his earlier scams were brought to light and criticized. He was sentenced to death with his co-defendants on the third day of deliberations. Their execution by guillotine took place on 24 March 1794.Doyle (1989); p.270. \\"The trial took place on 21‚Äì4 March, its result a foregone conclusion. Among those who went to the scaffold with Pere Duchesne on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth were Vincent, Ronsin, and the leader of section Marat, Momoro.\\" H√©bert fainted several times on the way to the guillotine, and screamed hysterically when he was placed under the blade. H√©bert's executioners amused the crowd by adjusting the guillotine so that its blade stopped inches above his neck,Page 27 BBC History Magazine, September 2015 and it was only after the fourth time the lever (d√©clic) was pulled that he was actually beheaded. His corpse was disposed of in the Madeleine Cemetery. His widow was executed twenty days later on 13 April 1794, and her corpse was disposed of in the Errancis Cemetery. Influence It is difficult to ascertain the extent to which H√©bert's publication Le P√®re Duchesne impacted the outcomes of political events between 1790 and 1794. French revolutionary historians such as Jean- Paul Bertraud, Jeremy D. Popkin, and William J. Murray each investigated French Revolutionary press history and determined that while the newspapers and magazines that one read during the revolution may have influenced their political leanings, it did not necessarily create their political leanings. One's class, for example, could be a significant determinant in directing and influencing one's political decisions. Therefore, H√©bert's writings certainly influenced his audience to some extent, but that does not mean that it changed the political outcomes of the French Revolution. That being said, his wide readership and voice throughout the Revolution means that he was a significant public figure and Le P√®re Duchesne's ability to influence the general population of France was indeed notable.

He is the STANCO 25 Professor of Finance, Emeritus at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, and the winner of the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Sharpe was one of the originators of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). He created the Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted investment performance analysis, and he contributed to the development of the binomial method for the valuation of options, the gradient method for asset allocation optimization, and returns-based style analysis for evaluating the style and performance of investment funds. Early years William Sharpe was born on June 16, 1934 in Boston, Massachusetts. As his father was in the National Guard, the family moved several times during World War II, until they finally settled in Riverside, California. Sharpe spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years in Riverside, graduating from Riverside Polytechnic High School in 1951. He then enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley planning to pursue a degree in medicine. However, in the first year he decided to change his focus and moved to the University of California at Los Angeles to study business administration. Finding that he was not interested in accounting, Sharpe had a further change in preferences, finally majoring in economics. During his undergraduate studies, two professors had a large influence on him: Armen Alchian, a professor of economics who became his mentor, and J. Fred Weston, a professor of finance who first introduced him to Harry Markowitz's papers on portfolio theory. While at UCLA, Sharpe became a member of the Theta Xihttp://www.thetaxibruins.com/alumni/index.php?per_page=100&page;=5 Fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa Society. He earned a B.A. from UCLA in 1955 and a M.A. in 1956. Academic training After graduation, in 1956 Sharpe joined the RAND Corporation. While doing research at RAND, he also started work for a Ph.D. at UCLA under the supervision of Armen Alchian. While searching for a dissertation topic, J. Fred Weston suggested him to ask Harry Markowitz at RAND. Working closely with Markowitz, who in practice \\"filled a role similar to that of dissertation advisor\\", Sharpe earned his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on a single factor model of security prices, also including an early version of the security market line. Professional career In 1961 after finishing his graduate studies, Sharpe started teaching at the University of Washington. He started research on generalizing the results in his dissertation to an equilibrium theory of asset pricing, work that yielded the Capital asset pricing model. He submitted the paper describing CAPM to the Journal of Finance in 1962. However, ironically, the paperSharpe (1964) in Selected publications which would become one of the foundations of financial economics was initially considered irrelevant and rejected from publication. Sharpe had to wait for the editorial staff to change until finally getting the paper published in 1964. At the same time, the CAPM was independently developed by John Lintner, Jan Mossin, and Jack Treynor. In 1968 Sharpe moved to the University of California at Irvine but stayed there for only two years, and in 1970 he moved, this time to Stanford University. While teaching at Stanford, Sharpe continued research in the field of investments, in particular on portfolio allocation and pension funds. He also became directly involved in the investment process by offering consultance to Merrill Lynch and to Wells Fargo, thus having the opportunity to put in practice the prescriptions of financial theory. In 1986, in collaboration with the Frank Russell Company, he founded Sharpe-Russell Research, a firm specialized in providing research and consultancy on asset allocation to pension funds and foundations. His 1988 paper, 'Determining a Fund‚Äôs Effective Asset Mix', established the model later referred to as returns-based style analysis. Later career In 1989 he retired from teaching, retaining the position of Professor Emeritus of Finance at Stanford, choosing to focus on his consulting firm, now named William F. Sharpe Associates. In 1996, he co-founded Financial Engines (NASDAQ: FNGN) with Stanford Professor Joseph Grundfest and Silicon Valley lawyer Craig W. Johnson. Concept2Company Ventures Financial Engines uses technology to implement many of his financial theories in portfolio management. Today, Financial Engines has over 200 employees and is the leader in automated retirement plan investment advice and management, with more than $200 Billion in managed retirement accounts, providing advice and managed account services to employees in over 1000 major corporations. In March, 2018, Financial Engines was acquired for $3 Billion in cash. Financial Engines, robo-advice pioneer, to be sold for $3 billion Sharpe served as a President of the American Finance Association and he is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security. He is also the recipient of a Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa from DePaul University, a Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Alicante (Spain), a Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Vienna and the UCLA Medal, UCLA's highest honor.

Career =Early career= Born into a family of prominent Radical politicians, Camille Chautemps was a lawyer by training and a noted amateur rugby-player in his youth, playing for Tours Rugby and Stade Francais. He was inducted into the Grand Orient of France (1906; master 1908),Dictionnaire universel de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie by Monique Cara and Jean- Marc Cara and Marc de Jode (ed. Larousse, 2011) quitting the Freemasons in August 1940 as anti-masonic regulation is adopted by P√©tain. He entered local politics in the fiefdom of his parliamentarian uncle, Alphonse Chautemps, and followed a political career path typical of many Radical-Socialists: first elected town councillor for Tours (1912), then mayor (1919‚Äì25), parliamentary deputy (1919‚Äì34) and senator (1934‚Äì40). Chautemps was considered one of the chief figures of the 'right' (anti-socialist and pro-liberal) wing of the centre-left Radical-Socialist Party. Between 1924 and 1926, he served in the centre-left coalition governments of √âdouard Herriot, Paul Painlev√© and Aristide Briand. =1930s= Prime Minister twice Renowned as a skilful negotiator with friends from across the party divide, he was called upon on several occasions to attempt to build support for a coalition of the centre-left. He first became President of the Council for a short-lived government in 1930. After the electoral victory of the left in 1934, he served as Interior Minister and became head of government once more in November 1933. The revelations of the Stavisky corruption scandal tarnished two of his ministers, sparking violent protests by the extreme-right: he resigned his posts on 27 January 1934, when the anti-government press attributed Stavisky's suicide to a government cover-up.Williams, 2005, p.259. Deputy Prime Minister and Premier for the last time In L√©on Blum's Popular Front government of 1936, Chautemps represented the Radical-Socialist Party as a Minister of State; he succeeded Blum at the head of the government from June 1937 to March 1938. The franc was devalued, but government finances remained in difficulty.Griffiths, Richard, P√©tain, Constable, London, 1970, p.p.197, Pursuing the program of the Popular Front, he proceeded in the nationalisation of the railroads to create the SNCF. However, in January 1938, he formed a new government consisting solely of ministers from the non-socialist republican centre- left.Griffiths, 1970, p.197. In February, he granted married women financial and legal independence (until then, wives had been dependent on their husbands to take action involving family finances) and allowed them to go to university and open bank accounts. His government also repealed Article 213 of the code: \\"the husband owes protection to his wife, the wife obedience to the husband\\" However, the husband remained \\"head of the household\\" with \\"the right to choose the household‚Äôs place of residence\\".[France since 1870: Culture, Politics and Society by Charles Sowerine] His government fell on 10 March.Griffiths, 1970, p.197. Run-up to World War II Chautemps subsequently served from April 1938 to May 1940 as Deputy Premier in the governments of √âdouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud, and, after the latter's resignation, as Deputy Premier again, now to Marshal Philippe P√©tain. World War II France having declared war on Germany in September 1939, in May 1940, the German Army invaded and swept aside all opposition. With the fall of Dunkirk on 5 June and the defeat of the French army imminent, Chautemps, dining with Paul Baudouin on the 8th, declared that the war must be ended and that P√©tain saw his position most clearly.Griffiths, 1970, p.231. On the 11th, during a Cabinet meeting, Chautemps suggested that Churchill be invited back to France to discuss the hopeless situation; he attended a conference at Tours on 13 June.Griffiths, 1970, p.235. The Cabinet met again on the 15th, almost evenly split on the question of an armistice with Germany. Chautemps now suggested that to break the deadlock, that they should get a neutral authority to enquire what the German terms would be. If honourable, they could agree to study them. If not, they could all agree to fight on. The Chautemps proposal passed by 13 to 6.Griffiths, 1970, p.237. On 16 June Charles de Gaulle, now in London, telephoned Reynaud to give him the British Government's offer of joint nationality for French and British in a Franco-British union. A delighted Reynaud put it to a stormy cabinet meeting and was supported by five of his ministers. Most of the others were persuaded against him by the arguments of P√©tain, Chautemps and Ybarn√©garay, the latter two seeing the offer as a device to make France subservient to Britain as an extra dominion. Georges Mandel (who had a Jewish backgroundWebster, Paul, P√©tain's Crime, Pan Macmillan, London, 1990, p.40, ) was flinging accusations of cowardice around the room, and Chautemps and others replied in kind. It was now clear that Reynaud would not accept the Chautemps proposal, and Reynaud resigned.Griffiths, 1970, p.239. Defection Chautemps broke with P√©tain's government after arriving in the United States on an official mission and lived there for much of the rest of his life. After World War II, a French court convicted him in absentia for collaborating with the enemy;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica he was amnestied in 1954.

Biography Sarraut was born on 28 July 1872 in Bordeaux, Gironde, France. On 14 March 1907 Sarraut, senator of Aude and under-secretary of state for the Interior, was ridiculed by Clemenceau for trying to plead the case of his electorate during the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers. Clemenceau told Sarraut, \\"I know the South, it will all end with a banquet\\". After massive demonstrations in the winegrowing region in June 1907 Clemenceau asked Sarraut to bring the leader Ernest Ferroul to the negotiating table. Ferroul told him: \\"When we have three million men behind us, we do not negotiate\\". From 17 June 1907 the Midi was occupied by 22 regiments of infantry and 12 regiments of cavalry. The gendarmerie was ordered to imprison the leaders of the demonstrations. Sarraut refused to endorse this policy and resigned from the government. He was Governor-General of French Indochina, from 1912 to 1914 and from 1917 to 1919. Although Sarraut was celebrated for native education reform, his motivation was an example of colonial racism. He believed that the Vietnamese could not be civilized until their thinking, customs and institutions mirrored those of the French. For Sarraut, the Vietnamese would \\"deserve independence from French rule only when they no longer desired to be Vietnamese, but Frenchmen in yellow skin.\\" Demery, Monique Finding the Dragon Lady, New York: Public Affairs, 2013 page 33. Albert Sarraut supported actively the preservation and development of native arts, for instance supporting the French art scholar George Groslier in preserving Cambodian arts and cultural traditions, and funding the design and construction of the National Museum of Cambodia. On 18 January 1920 he replaced Henry Simon as Minister of the Colonies. On 10 July 1940, Sarraut voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided over by Marshal Philippe P√©tain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. Thereafter Sarraut retired from politics. He took control of the family newspaper, La D√©p√™che de Toulouse, after the editor, his brother Maurice Sarraut, was killed by the Milice in 1943.

A military pilot during World War I, Flandin held a number of cabinet posts during the interwar period. He was Minister of Commerce, under the premiership of Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois-Marsal, for just five days in 1924. He was Minister of Commerce and Industry in the premierships of Andr√© Tardieu in 1931 and 1932. Between those posts, he served under Pierre Laval as Finance Minister. He was Minister of Public Works in the cabinet of Gaston Doumergue in 1934. He became Prime Minister in November 1934, but his premiership lasted only until June 1935. However, a number of important pacts were negotiated during his term: the Franco‚ÄìItalian Agreement, the Stresa Front and the Franco-Soviet Pact. Flandin was, at 45, the youngest prime minister in French history. Flandin was the French Foreign Minister when Adolf Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland in 1936. Supporting appeasement during the Munich crisis hurt his career. In December 1940, Vichy Chief of State Philippe P√©tain appointed Flandin Foreign Minister and Prime Minister on 13 December 1940, replacing Pierre Laval. He occupied that position for only two months. His reputation has suffered considerably partially for the very negative comments in the 1944 book by Pertinax, The Gravediggers of France (Chapter 5) in which the author blames him for strengthening appeasement, which ultimately led to Hitler's invasion. He was ousted by Fran√ßois Darlan in January 1941. A street in Avallon was named in his honour. In May 2017, it was renamed in honour of the murdered British MP, Jo Cox.

He held the portfolio for the colonies through the ministries of Ren√© Viviani and Aristide Briand until Alexandre Ribot's ministry of March 1917, when he was sent to Russia to persuade Alexander Kerensky's government not to make a separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. He was elected as the 13th French President on 13 June 1924, the only Protestant to hold that office. He served until 13 June 1931 and again was Prime Minister in a conservative national unity government, after the riots of 6 February 1934. That government lasted from 6 February to 8 November 1934.

Career Born in Saint-Aignan, Loir-et-Cher, Paul-Boncour received a law degree from the University of Paris and became active in the labor movement, organizing the legal council of the Bourses du Travail (workers' associations). He was private secretary to Premier Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau from 1898 to 1902. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a Radical in 1909, he held his seat until 1914, briefly serving as Minister of Labour from March to June 1911. After serving in the military during World War I, he returned to the French National Assembly. Turning to Socialism, he joined the SFIO in 1916. Paul- Boncour left the socialist party in 1931 because he considered imperative, in face of the League of Nations progressive powerlessness, to reinforce national defence, something the socialists opposed.Yvert, Beno√Æt (2007).

He served twice as Prime Minister of the Third Republic: 12 September ‚Äì 13 November 1917 and 17 April ‚Äì 22 November 1925. His entry into politics came in 1906 after a professorship at the Sorbonne that began in 1892. His first term as prime minister lasted only nine weeks but dealt with weighty issues, such as the Russian Revolution, the American entry into the war, the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, quelling the French Army Mutinies and relations with the British. In the 1920s as Minister of War he was a key figure in building the Maginot Line. In his second term as prime minister he dealt with the outbreak of rebellion in Syria's Jabal Druze in July 1925 which had excited public and parliamentary anxiety over the general crisis of France's empire.  Biography  =Early life= Painlev√© was born in Paris. Brought up within a family of skilled artisans (his father was a draughtsman) Painlev√© showed early promise across the range of elementary studies and was initially attracted by either an engineering or political career. However, he finally entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1883 to study mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1887 following a period of study at G√∂ttingen, Germany with Felix Klein and Hermann Amandus Schwarz. Intending an academic career he became professor at Universit√© de Lille, returning to Paris in 1892 to teach at the Sorbonne, √âcole Polytechnique and later at the Coll√®ge de France and the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences in 1900. He married Marguerite Petit de Villeneuve in 1901. Marguerite died during the birth of their son Jean Painlev√© in the following year. Painlev√©'s mathematical work on differential equations led him to encounter their application to the theory of flight and, as ever, his broad interest in engineering topics fostered an enthusiasm for the emerging field of aviation. In 1908, he became Wilbur Wright's first airplane passenger in France and in 1909 created the first university course in aeronautics. =Mathematical work= Paul Painlev√© as a young man Some differential equations can be solved using elementary algebraic operations that involve the trigonometric and exponential functions (sometimes called elementary functions). Many interesting special functions arise as solutions of linear second order ordinary differential equations. Around the turn of the century, Painlev√©, √â. Picard, and B. Gambier showed that of the class of nonlinear second order ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients, those that possess a certain desirable technical property, shared by the linear equations (nowadays commonly referred to as the 'Painlev√© property') can always be transformed into one of fifty canonical forms. Of these fifty equations, just six require 'new' transcendental functions for their solution. These new transcendental functions, solving the remaining six equations, are called the Painlev√© transcendents, and interest in them has revived recently due to their appearance in modern geometry, integrable systems Ablowitz, M. J. and Clarkson, P.A. (1991) Solitons, nonlinear evolution equations and inverse scattering. Cambridge University Press and statistical mechanics. In 1895 he gave a series of lectures at Stockholm University on differential equations, at the end stating the Painlev√© conjecture about singularities of the n-body problem. In the 1920s, Painlev√© briefly turned his attention to the new theory of gravitation, general relativity, which had recently been introduced by Albert Einstein. In 1921, Painlev√© proposed the Gullstrand‚ÄìPainlev√© coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric. The modification in the coordinate system was the first to reveal clearly that the Schwarzschild radius is a mere coordinate singularity (with however, profound global significance: it represents the event horizon of a black hole). This essential point was not generally appreciated by physicists until around 1963. In his diary, Harry Graf Kessler recorded that during a later visit to Berlin, Painlev√© discussed pacifist international politics with Einstein, but there is no reference to discussions concerning the significance of the Schwarzschild radius. =Early political career= Between 1915 and 1917, Painlev√© served as French Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions. In December 1915, he requested a scientific exchange agreement between France and Britain, resulting in Anglo- French collaboration that ultimately led to the parallel development by Paul Langevin in France and Robert Boyle in Britain of the first active sonar.Michael A. Ainslie Principles of Sonar Performance Modelling, Springer, 2010 , page 13 =First period as French Prime Minister= Painlev√© took his aviation interests, along with those in naval and military matters, with him when he became, in 1906, Deputy for Paris's 5th arrondissement, the so-called Latin Quarter. By 1910, he had vacated his academic posts and World War I led to his active participation in military committees, joining Aristide Briand's cabinet in 1915 as Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions. On his appointment as War Minister in March 1917 he was immediately called upon to give his approval, albeit with some misgivings, to Robert Georges Nivelle's wildly optimistic plans for a breakthrough offensive in Champagne. Painlev√© reacted to the disastrous public failure of the plan by dismissing Nivelle and controversially replacing him with Henri Philippe P√©tain.\\"Paul Painlev√©\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica He was also responsible for isolating the Russian Expeditionary Force in France in the La Courtine camp, located in a remote spot on the plateau of Millevaches. On 7 September 1917, Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot lost the support of the Socialists and Painlev√© was called upon to form a new government. Painlev√© was a leading voice at the Rapallo conference that led to the establishment of the Supreme Allied Council, a consultative body of Allied powers that anticipated the unified Allied command finally established in the following year. He appointed Ferdinand Foch as French representative knowing that he was the natural Allied commander. On Painlev√©'s return to Paris he was defeated and resigned on 13 November 1917 to be succeeded by Georges Clemenceau. Foch was finally made commander-in-chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts in March 1918. =Second period as French Prime Minister= Painlev√© then played little active role in politics until the election of November 1919 when he emerged as a leftist critic of the right-wing Bloc National. By the time the next election approached in May 1924 his collaboration with √âdouard Herriot, a fellow member of Briand's 1915 cabinet, had led to the formation of the Cartel des Gauches. Winning the election, Herriot became Prime Minister in June, while Painlev√© became President of the Chamber of Deputies. Though Painlev√© ran for President of France in 1924 he was defeated by Gaston Doumergue. Herriot's administration publicly recognised the Soviet Union, accepted the Dawes Plan and agreed to evacuate the Ruhr. However, a financial crisis arose from the ensuing devaluation of the franc and in April 1925, Herriot fell and Painlev√© became Prime Minister for a second time on 17 April. Unfortunately, he was unable to offer convincing remedies for the financial problems and was forced to resign on 21 November.\\"√âdouard Herriot\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica =Later political career= Paul Painlev√© in the 1920s Following Painlev√©'s resignation, Briand formed a new government with Painlev√© as Minister for War. Though Briand was defeated by Raymond Poincar√© in 1926, Painlev√© continued in office. Poincar√© stabilised the franc with a return to the gold standard, but ultimately acceded power to Briand. During his tenure as Minister of War, Painlev√© was instrumental in the creation of the Maginot Line. This line of military fortifications along France's Eastern border was largely designed by Painlev√©, yet named for Andr√© Maginot, owing to Maginot's championing of public support and funding. Painlev√© remained in office as Minister for War until July 1929. From 1925 to 1933, Painlev√© represented France in the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations (he replaced Henri Bergson and was himself replaced by Edouard Herriot). Though he was proposed for President of France in 1932, Painlev√© withdrew before the election. He became Minister of Air later that year, making proposals for an international treaty to ban the manufacture of bomber aircraft and to establish an international air force to enforce global peace. On the fall of the government in January 1933, his political career ended. Painlev√© died in Paris in October of the same year.

He was born in Sidi Bel Abb√®s, in French Algeria. In France he sought to protect the rights of socialists and trade union workers. Biography Time cover, 19 May 1923 Ren√© Viviani was born in Algeria in a family of Italian immigrants. His parliamentary career began in 1893, when he was elected deputy of the fifth ward in Paris. He retained this office until 1902, when he failed to be reelected, but four years later he was elected deputy of the Department of Creuse. In the same year he entered the cabinet of Georges Clemenceau. At an early age he associated himself with the Socialist party, soon becoming one of its most brilliant orators and prominent leaders. When the party was reorganized in 1904 into the Unified Socialist party, Viviani, like fellow Socialist Aristide Briand, stayed outside, and thenceforth called himself an Independent Socialist. He served as Minister of Public Instruction in the ministry of M. Doumergue. Viviani was an antisemite, arguing that \\"antisemitism is the best form of social struggle\\".Weber, Eugen. \\"Jews, Antisemitism, and the Origins of the Holocaust.\\" R√©flexions Historiques 5.1 (1978), p.7 In the spring of 1914 an exceptionally radical chamber was elected, and for a while it seemed that they would be unable to agree upon any one for Premier, but finally, he was appointed Prime Minister on 13 June 1914, by President Poincar√©. He received a vote of confidence of 370 to 137. The chief issues were the maintenance of the law requiring three years' service in the army and provision for a loan of 1,800,000,000 francs ($360,000,000) for military preparations. Viviani supported both of these measures. During the July Crisis, he was largely dominated by President Poincar√©. He retained the premiership for the first year of the First World War, but his tenure was undistinguished. On 26 August 1914 Viviani reorganized his cabinet on a war basis with Alexandre Millerand replacing Adolphe Messimy as Minister of War.Greenhalgh 2014, p.67 Along with President Poincar√© and War Minister Millerand he attended a June 1915 meeting of Joffre (Commander-in-Chief) and his Army Group Commanders (Foch, Castelnau and Dubail), a rare attempt at political oversight at this stage of the war.Greenhalgh 2014, p.100 By autumn 1915 Viviani's government was in trouble following the resignation of Delcass√© as Foreign Minister, the unsuccessful western front offensive and the entry of Bulgaria into the war. Although he survived a no confidence vote by 372‚Äì9, there were many abstentions. General Gallieni agreed to replace Millerand as Minister of War, but other French politicians refused to join Viviani's government, so he resigned on 27 October 1915. Viviani served as Vice- President of the Council of Ministers (Deputy PM) and Gallieni as War Minister in Aristide Briand's new ministry.Doughty 2005, p229 In April 1917 Viviani led a mission to the US, which had just entered the war \\"associated with\\" the Allies. He was overshadowed by Marshal Joffre, who attracted much more attention from the American press.Eisenhower 2001, p12-13 During Viviani's time as prime minister, a law was adopted in July 1915 providing for special boards to fix such a wage for women employed in home-work in the clothing industry.The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 31 by Hugh Chisholm In May 1919 the Chamber of Deputies finally debated the bill proposed by Paul Dussaussoy in 1906 for limited women's suffrage.

The flag of British Columbia is based upon the shield of the provincial arms of British Columbia. At the top of the flag is a rendition of the Royal Union Flag, defaced in the centre by a crown, and with a setting sun below, representing the location of the province of British Columbia at the western end of Canada. History From 1870 to 1906, British Columbia was occasionally represented by a modified British blue ensign featuring various forms of the great seal of the Colony of British Columbia. The current flag of British Columbia was based upon the 1906 arms of the province, designed by Arthur John Beanlands, the canon of Christ Church Cathedral. Originally, the arms featured the Union Flag on the bottom. This was changed as it conflicted with the expression \\"The sun never sets on the British Empire.\\" Based upon Beanlands' revised design, the flag of British Columbia was introduced on June 14, 1960, by Premier W. A. C. Bennett, and was first flown on board the BC Ferries motor vessel Sidney (later Queen of Sidney). Design The four wavy white and three wavy blue lines symbolize the province's location between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. The setting sun represents the fact that British Columbia is Canada's westernmost province. The sun may also reflect the provincial motto \\"Splendor sine occasu\\" (beauty without diminish)‚Äîor, in other words, the sun that never sets (on the British Empire). The Union Flag on top reflects the province's British heritage, while the crown in the centre represents British Columbia becoming a Crown colony and achieving responsible government. The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5. A stylized version of the flag that appears on British Columbia licence plates incorrectly features the setting sun overlapping the Union Flag instead of the waves. The flag of British Columbia is similar to the flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory. It also bears similarities to the arms of Suffolk County Council, the local authority of the county of Suffolk in the United Kingdom. As well as the flag of Kiribati, which features the blue waves for the Pacific Ocean and a sun for its own cultural reasons.

They revealed that Barthou was hit by an 8 mm Mod√®le 1892 revolver round commonly used in weapons carried by French police.

Independence was built with an angled flight deck with four C-7 steam catapults, two on the bow and two on the angled deck. She was fitted with AN/SPS-37 long-range search radar and AN/SPS-8B height finding radar. Defensive armament consisted of eight 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns mounted on sponsons jutting out from the sides of the ship so they did not interfere with the flight deck. The initial air wing of the Forrestal- class carriers was about 90 aircraft, although this varied with the composition of the airwing. The contract to build Independence, the fourth Forrestal-class carrier was awarded to the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 2 July 1954, with the ship being laid down on 1 July 1955. She was launched on 6 June 1958 by the wife of Thomas S. Gates, the Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 10 January 1959. Operational history Independence on her initial shakedown in 1959 =Testing and workup= Independence conducted shakedown training under her first captain, Captain R. Y. McElroy, with the first landing-on being carried out by a Grumman Trader carrier onboard delivery aircraft on 2 March 1959. She arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia on 30 June 1959, and then carried out a ten-week training cruise in the Caribbean. During these trials, while carrying out compatibility tests aboard the new carrier, a Douglas A3D Skywarrior was catapulted off Independence at a gross weight of 84,000 pounds (38,000 kg), the heaviest aircraft to take off from a carrier at the time. =1960‚Äì1964= Independence (foreground) alongside her sister ship and in 1961 An F-8C ready to launch from Independence during her 1963-1964 Mediterranean cruise Independence operated off the Virginia Capes for the next year on training maneuvers, and departed 4 August 1960 for her first cruise to the Mediterranean. There, she added her great strength to the peace-keeping power of the 6th Fleet in that troubled region, remaining in the eastern Mediterranean until her return to Norfolk 3 March 1961. On 4 August 1961, she departed again for the Mediterranean to join the US 6th fleet for another cruise and returned on 19 December 1961 to Norfolk. Independence sailed on 19 April 1962 for Sixth Fleet duty in support of President John F. Kennedy's firm stand on Berlin during a recurrence of stress in a critical area. She returned to Norfolk 27 August and sailed 11 October for the Caribbean Sea. Called on by President Kennedy on 24 October during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Independence provided a strong, visible reminder of U.S. determination and resolve while she acted as a key participant in the U.S. naval blockade of Cuba. She arrived off Puerto Rico in response to the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba and took part in the quarantine operations which finally forced withdrawal of those missiles. She then returned to Norfolk on 25 November for readiness exercises along the eastern seaboard, overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay. Independence departed Norfolk on 6 August 1963 to take part in combined readiness exercises in the Bay of Biscay with sea-air units of the United Kingdom and France then entered the Mediterranean on 21 August for further duty with the Sixth Fleet. Cruising throughout the Mediterranean, she gained much valuable experience during combined NATO exercises, including close air support to Turkish paratroops, reconnaissance, communications, and convoy strike support. President Makarios of Cyprus paid her a visit on 7 October 1963, after which she took part in bilateral U.S.-Italian exercises in the Adriatic with Italian patrol torpedo boats, and U.S.-French exercises, which pitted her aircraft against French interceptors and a surface action with the French cruiser . She returned to Norfolk on 4 March 1964. Following training exercises, ranging north to New York and south to Mayport, Florida, Independence departed Norfolk 8 September 1964 for NATO Teamwork exercises in the Norwegian Sea and off the coast of France, then to Gibraltar. She returned to Norfolk 5 November 1964 and entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. =1965‚Äì1970= On 10 May 1965, Independence deployed for more than seven months, including 100 days in the South China Sea, off the coast of Vietnam, the first Atlantic Fleet carrier to do so. She also was the fifth U.S. carrier to operate off Vietnam. Independence and her embarked Carrier Air Wing 7 received the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 5 June to 21 November 1965. The carrier's air group participated in the first major series of coordinated strikes against vital enemy supply lines north of the Hanoi-Haiphong complex, successfully evading the first massive surface-to-air missile barrage in aviation history while attacking assigned targets, and executing, with daring and precision, the first successful attack on an enemy surface-to-air missile installation. The carrier launched more than 7,000 sorties, sustaining an exceptional pace of day and night strike operations against military and logistic supply facilities in North Vietnam. \\"The superior team spirit, courage, professional competence, and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of Independence and embarked Attack Carrier Air Wing Seven reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Naval Service.\\" F-4Bs launching from Independence during her 1965 deployment to Vietnam Independence returned to her homeport, Norfolk, arriving 13 December 1965. During the first half of 1966, she operated off Norfolk, replenishing and training air groups. On 4 May 1966, she participated in Operation Strikex. The carrier departed Norfolk 13 June for European operations with the Sixth Fleet. Independence was involved with unit and NATO exercises from July into December. She then continued her Sixth Fleet deployment returning to CONUS in early 1967. After a few months of local operations, she underwent an extensive overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The drydock portion of the overhaul was interrupted when Independence had to leave drydock early to make way for the fire-damaged on 19 September 1967. On 30 April 1968, Independence steamed to the Mediterranean Sea for a nine-month deployment. She returned to Pier 12 NOB Norfolk, Virginia on 27 January 1969. On 3 September 1969, the Independence departed Norfolk to participate in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, (NORLANT), where she participated in testing the Hawker Siddeley Harrier in flight deck operations, returning home on 9 October 1969. Independence was again deployed to the Mediterranean on 23 June 1970, returning to Pier 12 on 31 January 1971. It was during this cruise that the ship was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation in support of actions against the PLO during the Jordanian crisis. =1970‚Äì1979= Independence (foreground) operating with in the North Atlantic in 1971 On 25 September 1970, the news was received that Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic had died; an event that might plunge the Middle East into a crisis. Independence, along with , , and seven other U.S. Navy ships were put on standby in case U.S. military protection was needed for the evacuation of U.S. citizens and as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union's Mediterranean fleet. Pilots of VMA-142, -131 and -133 began qualification landings in A-4 Skyhawks aboard Independence on 3 August 1971. For the next three days, four active duty and 20 reserve pilots operated aboard the carrier --the first time that Marine Corps Reserve squadrons qualified in carrier duty. F-4J of VF-101 alongside an F-4K of 892 Naval Air Squadron wait to be catapulted from Independence Deploying from Norfolk in September 1971, the crew earned the designation as 'Blue Nose' sailors when the Independence crossed the Arctic Circle on 28 September. During subsequent operations in the North Sea, Independence conducted cross-deck operations with the British aircraft carrier and transited the English Channel en route to the Strait of Gibraltar and scheduled operations in the Mediterranean Sea. In May 1973, President Richard M. Nixon delivered his annual Armed Forces Day address from the decks of Independence. While based in Norfolk, the ship made deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. From 8 to 13 October 1973, Task Group 60.1 with Independence, Task Force 60.2 with , and Task Forces 61/62 with were alerted for possible evacuation contingencies in the Middle East as a result of the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Arab states and Israel. Independence operated off the island of Crete. In the summer of 1974, Independence departed Norfolk for yet another 'Med Cruise', operating with CTG 60.1 and CVW-7. Relieving Franklin D. Roosevelt, Independence and Saratoga continued the tradition of steaming the Mediterranean while being shadowed by Soviet aircraft and ships. On 8 September 1974, sailors were introduced to the new concept of terrorism when a bomb exploded in the cargo compartment of TWA Flight 841 high above. Steaming to the crash site, Independence and other ships spent two days retrieving the remains of the ill-fated jetliner, her crew, and passengers. On 20 June 1979, Lieutenant Donna L. Spruill became the first female Navy pilot to carrier qualify in a fixed-wing aircraft. Lieutenant Spruill piloted a C-1A Trader to an arrested landing aboard Independence. =1980‚Äì1989= Independence and during an underway replenishment with during the carrier's 1980-81 cruise On 19 November 1980, Independence with Carrier Air Wing Six (AE) embarked, deployed to the Indian Ocean along with the cruiser and was on watch along with Ranger on \\"Gonzo Station\\" as President Reagan took office and the Iranian Hostages were freed. Subsequently, completing an Indian Ocean cruise, Independence transited the Suez Canal northbound, shortly after had transited southbound, making America the first United States Navy carrier (and, thus, Independence the second) to transit the Suez Canal since in 1967. Independence completed a deployment of 204 days. Scheduled to go to Singapore, the crew was instead diverted to the Persian Gulf to back up during the Iran Hostage Crisis mission with Capt. Thomas E. Shanahan Commanding. After the Gulf, Independence and her battle group visited Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 2 February to 7 February for R&R.; Upon completion of the deployment, Captain Shanahan was promoted to rear admiral. In 1982, Independence provided critical support to the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon. On 25 June, the greatest concentration of U.S. Navy air power in the Mediterranean Sea resulted when the battle groups of Forrestal and Independence joined forces with and John F. Kennedy. After steaming together in the eastern Mediterranean Sea for several days, Forrestal and Independence relieved Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, the latter sailing home to Norfolk, after a long deployment. Independence operating off Lebanon in 1982. In late October 1983, Independences battle group (Carrier Group Four), assigned to the United States Second Fleet, became the core of Task Group 20.5, the carrier task group that would support the Invasion of Grenada. On 25 October 1983, aircraft from Independence's embarked air wing flew missions supporting the invasion. Returning to Lebanon that same year, the ship's air wing conducted air strikes against Syrian positions. In 1984, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. On 17 February 1985, Independence arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to undergo a modernization and overhaul program to extend her service life by 15 years. The flight deck was improved to allow the recovery of high-performance aircraft while the ship traveled at slower speeds, and the NATO Sea Sparrow launchers were upgraded. Other improvements improved the ship's fuel consumption. Independence completed the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in June 1988. Setting sail 15 August 1988 from Norfolk, the ship transited the tip of South America and arrived at her new homeport of NAS North Island, in San Diego, California, 8 October. The Paramount film Flight of the Intruder (1991), starring Danny Glover, Willem Dafoe, and Brad Johnson was filmed partly on Independence. The aircraft carrier went out for two weeks of filming in November 1989; the on-board fire party was kept busy dealing with the numerous small electrical fires that the movie crew had started with their lighting equipment. =1990‚Äì1995= Pearl Harbor relieving as the 7th Fleet forward deployed carrier In June 1990, with Carrier Air Wing 14 embarked, Independence departs San Diego on a routine WESTPAC. On 2 August, in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Independence, leading Task Group 800.1, which included Jouett (CG-29), was sent to deter further Iraqi aggression during Operation Desert Shield. Arriving on station in the Gulf of Oman on 5 August, Independence was the first carrier to enter the Persian Gulf since 1974. The ship remained on station for 112 days and permanently reestablished a U.S. naval presence in the region. She returned to San Diego on 20 December 1990. Independence changed homeports again on 11 September 1991‚Äîthis time to Yokosuka, Japan, embarking Carrier Air Wing 5 and becoming the Navy's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier, and flagship for Commander, Carrier Group Five. On 23 August 1992, Independence entered the Persian Gulf, under the Command of Captain Carter B. Refo prepared to enforce an Allied ban on Iraqi flights over south Iraq below the 32nd parallel north. On 26 August, President George H. W. Bush announced that the United States and its allies had informed Iraq that in 24 hours allied aircraft would fly surveillance missions in southern Iraq and were prepared to shoot down any Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel. The action was precipitated by Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. Resolution 688, which demanded that the Iraqi government stop the repression of its Shiite population in southern Iraq. Persian Gulf allies began to enforce the ban on Iraqi planes from flying south of the 32nd parallel on 27 August in Operation Southern Watch. Any Iraqi planes that violated the ban would be shot down. Twenty Navy aircraft from CVW-5 aboard Independence in the Persian Gulf were the first coalition aircraft on station over Iraq as Operation Southern Watch began. Southern Watch was the enforcement of a ban on Iraqi warplanes and helicopters from flying south of the 32nd parallel. Independence became the most battle experienced ship in the Navy's active fleet, and the first carrier in history to hold that distinction, on 30 June 1995. With this honor, Independence displayed the Revolution-era First Navy Jack, commonly called the \\"Don't Tread On Me\\" flag, from her bow until her decommissioning. The flag was presented to Independences commanding officer Capt. David P. Polatty III in a formal ceremony on 1 July. The flag was received from upon her decommissioning. In November 1995, Independence and Carrier Air Wing Five returned to Japan after successfully completing their third deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. =1996‚Äì1998= USS Independence conducts air operations off the coast of Taiwan during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. Independence (right) cruises alongside Nimitz and off Japan in 1997 Independence (left) at Pearl Harbor being relieved as the 7th Fleet forward deployed carrier by In March 1996, Independence was deployed to the waters east of Taiwan to provide a stabilizing presence amid the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. She was joined in the area by Nimitz as the People's Republic of China lobbed missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters. On returning to Yokosuka in April 1996, the ship was visited by President Bill Clinton as part of an official state visit to Japan. In 1997, Independence made a four-month deployment, covering several major exercises and seven ports of call. Included in these ports of call were two historic port visits. The first was 28 February 1997 to the island territory of Guam. Independence was the first aircraft carrier to pull into Guam in 36 years. The second, two months later, was to Port Klang, Malaysia. Independence became the first aircraft carrier in the world to make a port visit to Malaysia. Before sailing back to Yokosuka, Japan, Independence made her last port call of the deployment in May 1997 to Hong Kong. The ship's port call was the last U.S. naval visit to the territory before its handover to China on 1 July 1997. Independence deployed to the Persian Gulf in January 1998 to support negotiations between the UN and Iraq and to again participate in Operation Southern Watch, prior to being relieved at Yokosuka by . Independence was decommissioned in ceremonies at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, on 30 September 1998. At the conclusion of this ceremony, in keeping with naval tradition, Independences last commanding officer, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Mark R. Milliken, USN, was the last person to depart the ship. Independences commissioning pennant was hauled down 39 years, 9 months and 20 days after it was first hoisted, and the \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" First Navy Jack was transferred to the Navy's next oldest active ship, the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. Decommissioning and fate ex-Independence in mothballs, in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard After decommissioning, Independence remained in mothballs for five and a half years before being struck on 8 March 2004. During her time in mothballs, the ship was said to have been heavily stripped to support the active carrier fleet, especially the remaining s. Her port anchor and both anchor chains were used on the new . The recycling of parts and the poor material condition of the ship at the time she was withdrawn made a strong argument against retaining her as a potential museum ship. In April 2004, Navy officials identified ex- Independence as one of 24 decommissioned ships available to be sunk as artificial reefs. However, as of February 2008, she was scheduled to be dismantled in the next five years along with . At that time, she was still available for donation as a reef while awaiting a contract for her dismantling to be awarded. Ex-Independence is towed to the breaker's yard on 11 March 2017. On 26 January 2012, the Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command posted a notice of solicitation for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class Aircraft Carriers in the United States, including Forrestal, Independence, and Constellation. Following the disposal of and Constellation, on 10 March 2017 ex-Independence began her 16,000 mile journey from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Brownsville, Texas for dismantling by International Shipbreaking Limited. On 26 April 2017, she was on her way through the Strait of Magellan, and on 30 May 2017 she arrived at Brownsville, where a special ceremony was held at Isla Blanca Park for veterans, school children and members of the local community to honour the vessel. Scrapping was completed by early 2019.

He was a leader of the French Radical party and minister of finance, but his progressive views in opposition to the military alienated him from conservative elements. He was accused of corruption, but was cleared by a parliamentary commission. This political weakness strengthened the right wing elements in the radical party.Rudolph Binion, Defeated leaders; the Political Fate of Caillaux, Jouvenel, and Tardieu (1960). Biography After studying law and following lectures at the √âcole des Sciences Politiques, he entered the civil service in 1888 as an inspector of finance, and spent most of his official career in Algiers. Standing as a Republican candidate in the elections of 1898 for the department of the Sarthe, in opposition to the Duc de la Rochefoucault- Bisaccia, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies by 12,929 votes to 11,737. He became Minister of Finance in the Waldeck-Rousseau Cabinet, and after its fall it was not until the Clemenceau Ministry of 1906 that he returned to office, once more with the portfolio of Finance. During the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers on 22 May 1907 Caillaux tabled a bill on wine fraud. The text submitted to Parliament provided for an annual declaration of their harvest by wine growers, prohibition of second-cycle sweetening and control and taxation of purchases of sugar. In 1911 he became prime minister. The leader of the Radicals, he favored a policy of conciliation with Germany during his premiership from 1911 to 1912, which led to the maintenance of the peace during the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911. He and his ministers were forced to resign on 11 January 1912, after it was revealed that he had secretly negotiated with Germany without the knowledge of President Armand Falli√®res.J. F. V. Keiger, Raymond Poincar√© (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p. 126; \\"Political Chaos France's Peril\\", The New York Times, 12 January 1912 Nevertheless, thanks to his undoubted qualities as a financier, he remained a great power in French politics. He fought the Three Years' Service bill with the utmost tenacity. Although that measure became law, it was he who finally, on the financial aspect of that bill, brought about the downfall of the Barthou Ministry in the autumn of 1913. While the Entente Cordiale was in effect, it was impossible for Caillaux to return to the position of prime minister, but he joined the succeeding Doumergue Cabinet as Minister of Finance. As a financial expert, he had long identified himself with a great and necessary reform in the fiscal policy of France‚Äîthe introduction of the principle of an income tax. Throughout the winter of 1913, he campaigned for this principle. His advocacy of an income tax, and his uncertain and erratic championship of proletarian ideas, alarmed all the conservative elements in the country, and throughout the winter he was attacked with increasing vehemence from the platform and through the press. Those attacks reached their highest point of bitterness in a series of disclosures in Le Figaro of a more or less personal nature. Cover of \\"Le Petit Journal\\" illustrating the assassination of Gaston Calmette, the editor of \\"Le Figaro\\" In 1914, Le Figaro started the publication of letters addressed by Caillaux to Henriette Caillaux, the second Madame Caillaux, while he was still married to the first. In March 1914, Madame Caillaux in turn shot to death Gaston Calmette, the editor of Le Figaro newspaper, and Caillaux resigned as Minister of Finance. In July 1914, Madame Caillaux was acquitted on the grounds that she committed a crime passionel. Caillaux became the leader of a peace party in the Assembly during World War I. After a mission to South America, he returned in 1915, and at once began to lobby. He financed newspapers, and did everything he possibly could behind the scenes to consolidate his position. He became acquainted with the Bolos and the Malvys of political and journalistic life. By the spring of 1917, he had become in the eyes of the public \\"l'homme de la d√©faite,\\" the man who was willing to effect a compromise peace with Germany at the expense of Great Britain. However, the advent of Clemenceau to power killed all his hopes. This led to his arrest and trial for treason in 1918.\\"An Ex-Premier of France Facing a Treason Trial,\\" The Literary Digest, 29 December 1917. After long delay, he was tried on a charge of high treason by the High Court of the Senate, and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, the term he had already served. He was also forbidden to reside in French territory for five years and deprived of civil rights for ten years. Again rehabilitated after the war, Caillaux served at various times in the left wing governments of the 1920s.\\"Caillaux's Political Resurrection,\\" The Literary Digest, 2 May 1925.

He was the son and successor of King Jehoiakim, and the grandson of King Josiah. Most of what is known about Jeconiah is found in the Hebrew Bible. Records of Jeconiah's existence have been found in Iraq, such as the Jehoiachin's Rations Tablets. These tablets were excavated near the Ishtar Gate in Babylon and have been dated to c. 592 BCE. Written in cuneiform, they mention Jeconiah (, \\"Ia-'-√∫-kinu\\") and his five sons as recipients of food rations in Babylon.James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 308. Jeconiah in scripture =Reign= Jeconiah reigned three months and ten days, beginning December 9, 598 BCE. He succeeded Jehoiakim as king of Judah after raiders from surrounding lands invaded Jerusalem and killed his father., It is likely that the king of Babylon was behind this effort, as a response to Jehoiakim's revolt, starting sometime after 601 BCE. Three months and ten days after Jeconiah became king, the armies of Nebuchadnezzar II seized Jerusalem. The intention was to take high class Judahite captives and assimilate them into Babylonian society. On March 15/16th, 597 BCE, Jeconiah, his entire household and three thousand Jews were exiled to Babylon.Anchor Bible Dictionary New York: Doubleday 1997, 1992. \\"It is now known that the end of Jehoiachin's reign occurred on the 2d day of the month of Adar in the 7th year of Nebuchadrezzar (BM 21946 verso, line 12; see Wiseman 1956: 73; TCS 5, 102). This date corresponds to either March 15 or March 16 (the Babylonian day extended from sunset to sunset, and thus overlaps 2 days of our calendar) 597 b.c.e.\\"Jehoiachin\\". Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, 2000. (, ), pg. 678Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). (, 9780825438257). The Masoretic Text of 2 Chronicles states that Jeconiah's rule began at the age of eight, while in 2 Kings 24:8 Jeconiah is said to have come to the throne at eighteen., 2 Kings 24:8However, the Septuagint and Syriac versions state that his reign started at the age of eighteen. See the New English Translation of the Septuagint for the Septuagint reading at 2 Chronicles / 2 Supplements 36:9 Modern scholars have treated the difference between \\"eight\\" and \\"eighteen\\" as reflecting a copying error on one side or the other of the question.According to James R. Critchlow, these modern scholars include Ray Dillard, Edward L. Curtis, Hugh Williamson, Sara Japhet, and Jacob M. Myers. See =During exile= After Jeconiah was deposed as king, Jeconiah's uncle, Zedekiah, was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to rule Judah. Zedekiah was the son of Josiah.\\"Jehoiachin\\", Jewish Encyclopedia Jeconiah would later be regarded as the first of the exilarchs. In the Book of Ezekiel, the author refers to Jeconiah as king and dates certain events by the number of years he was in exile. The author identifies himself as Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeconiah, and he never mentions Zedekiah by name. =Release from captivity= According to , Jeconiah was released from prison \\"in the 37th year of the exile\\", in the year that Amel-Marduk (Evil-Merodach) came to the throne, and given a prestigious position at court. Jeconiah's release in Babylon brings to a close the Books of Kings and the Deuteronomistic history. Babylonian records show that Amel-Marduk began his reign in October 562 BCE.Richard Parker and Waldo Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 75 (Providence RI: Brown University Press, 1956) 12. According to , Jeconiah was released from prison \\"on the 27th day of the twelfth month\\": this indicates the first year of captivity to be 598/597 BCE, according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar. The 37th year of captivity was thus, by Judean reckoning, the year that began in Tishri of 562, consistent with the synchronism to the accession year of Amel- Marduk given in Babylonian records. Curse Jeremiah (22:28‚Äì30) cursed Jeconiah that none of his descendants would ever sit on the throne of Israel: =Genealogy= Jeconiah was the son of Jehoiakim and Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.(, ) He had seven children: Shealtiel, Malkiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah. (). Jeconiah is also mentioned in the first book of Chronicles as the father of Pedaiah, who in turn was the father of Zerubbabel. A list of his descendants is given in . In listing the genealogy of Jesus Christ, records Jeconiah as an ancestor of Joseph, the husband of Mary. Dating Jeconiah's reign Lunette in the Sistine Chapel of Jeconiah with Shealtiel and Josiah. The Babylonian Chronicles establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE.D. J. Wiseman, Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73. Before Wiseman's publication of the Babylonian Chronicles in 1956, Thiele had determined from biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem and its king Jeconiah occurred in the spring of 597 BCE, whereas Kenneth Strand points out that other scholars, including Albright, more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE. =Thiele's dates= Thiele said that the 25th anniversary of Jeconiah's captivity was April 25 (10 Nisan), 573 BCE, implying that he began the trip to Babylon on 10 Nisan 597, 24 years earlier. His reasoning in arriving at this exact date was based on Ezekiel 40:1, where Ezekiel, without naming the month, says it was the tenth day of the month, \\"on that very day.\\" Since this fits with his idea that Jeconiah's (and Ezekiel's) trip to Babylon began a month later than the capturing of the city, thus allowing a new Nisan-based year to begin, Thiele took these words in Ezekiel as referring to the day in which the captivity or exile proper began. He therefore ended Jehoiachin's reign of three months and ten days on this date. The dates he gives for Jeconiah's reign are then: 21 Heshvan (9 December) 598 BCE to 10 Nisan (22 April) 597 BCE. Thiele's reasoning in this regard has been criticized by Rodger C. Young, who advocates the 587 date for the fall of Jerusalem.Rodger C. Young, \\"When Did Jerusalem Fall?\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 47 (2004) 21‚Äì38. Young argues that Thiele's arithmetic is inconsistent, and adds an alternative explanation of the phrase \\"on that very day\\" (be-etsem ha-yom ha-zeh) in Ezekiel 40:1. This phrase is used three times in Leviticus 23:28‚Äì30 to refer the Day of Atonement, always observed on the tenth of Tishri, and Ezekiel's writings in several places show familiarity with the Book of Leviticus. A further argument in favor of this interpretation is that in the same verse, Ezekiel says it was Rosh Hashanah (New Year's Day) and also the tenth of the month, indicating the start of a Jubilee year, since only in a Jubilee year did the year begin on the tenth of Tishri, the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:9). The Talmud (tractate Arakin 12a,b) and the Seder Olam (chapter 11) also say that Ezekiel saw his vision at the beginning of a Jubilee year, the 17th, consistent with this interpretation of Ezekiel 40:1. Because this offers an alternative explanation to Thiele's interpretation of Ezekiel 40:1, and because Thiele's chronology for Jeconiah is incompatible with the records of the Babylonian Chronicle, the infobox below dates the end of Jeconiah's reign to 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE, the date of the first capture of Jerusalem as given in the Babylonian records. Thiele's dates for Jeconiah, however, and his date of 586 BCE for the fall of Jerusalem, continue to hold considerable weight with the scholarly community.Leslie McFall, \\"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\\" Bibliotheca Sacra 148 (1991) 40, 45.Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology (rev. ed.; Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998) 257‚Äì259. However, no such complication is necessary since the tenth of Tishri 574 BCE is precisely as stated in Ezekiel 40:1, both in the fourteenth year of the Temple's destruction in 587 BCE and the twenty-fifth year of Jeconiah's exile in 597 BCE.Andrew E. Steinmann, From Abraham to Paul: A Biblical Chronology (St. Louis, MO: Concordia, 2011) 169, 172. Gershon Galil also attempted to reconcile a 586 date for the fall of Jerusalem with the data for Jeconiah's exile. Like Thiele, he assumed that the years of exile should be measured from Nisan, but for a different reason. Galil hypothesized that Israel‚Äôs calendar was one month ahead of that of Babylon because Babylon had inserted an intercalary month and Israel had not yet done so.Gershon Galil, \\"The Babylonian Calendar and the Chronology of the Last Kings of Judah\\", Biblica 72 (1991), 373‚Äì377. This would make Adar (the twelfth month) in the Babylonian records correspond to Nisan (the first month) in Judean counting. But this hypothesis, like Thiele's, runs into difficulty with Ezekiel 40:1, since the 25th year of captivity would begin in Nisan of 573 and the fall of Jerusalem, 14 years earlier, would be in 587, not the 586 that Galil and Thiele advocate. There is further conflict with the Babylonian data, because the 37th year of captivity, the year in which Jeconiah was released from prison, would be the year starting in Nisan of 561 BCE, not Nisan of 562 BCE as given in the Babylonian Chronicle. Recognizing these conflicts, Galil admits (p. 377) that his date for the fall of Jerusalem (586 BCE) is inconsistent with the precise data given in the Bible and the Babylonian Chronicle. Dating the fall of Jerusalem using Jeconiah's dating The reign of Jeconiah is considered important in establishing the chronology of events in the early sixth century BCE in the Middle East. This includes resolving the date of the fall of Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar. According to , the city wall was breached in the summer month of Tammuz in the eleventh year of Zedekiah. Historians, however, have been divided on whether the year was 587 or 586 BCE. A 1990 study listed eleven scholars who preferred 587 and eleven who preferred 586.Jeremy Hughes, Secrets of the Times (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990) 229. The Babylonian records of the second capture of Jerusalem have not been found, and scholars looking at the chronology of the period must rely on the Biblical texts, as correlated with extant Babylonian records from before and after the event. In this regard, the Biblical texts regarding Jeconiah are especially important, because the time of his reign in Jerusalem was fixed by Donald Wiseman's 1956 publication, and this is consistent with his thirty- seventh year of captivity overlapping the accession year of Amel-Marduk, as mentioned above. Ezekiel's treatment of Jeconiah's dates are a starting point for determining the date of the fall of Jerusalem. He dated his writings according to the years of captivity he shared with Jeconiah, and he mentions several events related to the fall of Jerusalem in those writings. In Ezekiel 40:1, Ezekiel dates his vision to the 25th year of the exile and fourteen years after the city fell. If Ezekiel and the author of were both using Tishri-based years, the 25th year would be 574/573 BCE and the fall of the city, 14 years earlier, would be in 588/587‚Äîi.e., in the summer of 587 BCE. This is consistent with other texts in Ezekiel related to the fall of the city. Ezekiel 33:21 relates that a refugee arrived in Babylon and reported the fall of Jerusalem in the twelfth year, tenth month of \\"our exile.\\" Measuring from the first year of exile, 598/597, this was January of 586 BCE, incompatible with Jerusalem falling in the summer of 586 BCE, but consistent with its fall in the summer of 587 BCE. The other side holds that since Jeconiah surrendered in March 597, January 586 is less than eleven years later and therefore can not be considered in the twelfth year of the exile. Thiele held to a 586 BCE date for the capture of Jerusalem and the end of Zedekiah's reign. Recognizing to some extent the importance of Ezekiel's measuring time by the years of captivity of Jeconiah, and in particular the reference to the 25th year of that captivity in Ezekiel 40:1, he wrote, > Although the Babylonian tablets dealing with the final fall and destruction > of Jerusalem have not been found, it should be noticed that the testimony of > Ezekiel 40:1 is definitive in regard to the year 586. Since Ezekiel had his > vision of the temple on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his and Jehoiachin's > captivity (28 April 573), and since this was the fourteenth year after > Jerusalem's fall, the city must have fallen eleven years after the > captivity. Eleven years after 597 is 586. In order to justify his 586 date, Thiele had assumed that the years of captivity for Jeconiah must be calendar years starting in Nisan, in contrast to the Tishri-based years that he used everywhere else for the kings of Judah. He also assumed that Jeconiah's captivity or exile was not to be measured from Adar of 597 BCE, the month Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and its king according to the Babylonian Chronicle, but in the next month, Nisan, when Thiele assumed Jeconiah began the trip to Babylon. Granting these assumptions, the first year of captivity would be the year starting in Nisan of 597 BCE. The twenty-fifth year of captivity would start in Nisan of 573 BCE, (573/572) twenty-four years later. Years of captivity must be measured in this non- accession sense (the year in which the captivity started was considered year one of the captivity), otherwise the 37th year of captivity, the year in which Jeconiah was released from prison, would start on Nisan 1 of 560 BCE (597 ‚àí 37), two years after the accession year of Amel-Marduk, according to the dating of his accession year that can be fixed with exactitude by the Babylonian Chronicle. Thiele then noted that Ezekiel 40:1 says that this 25th year of captivity was 14 years after the city fell. Fourteen years before 573/572 is 587/586, and since Thiele is assuming Nisan years for the captivity, this period ended the day before Nisan 1 of 586. But this is three months and nine days before Thiele's date for the fall of the city on 9 Tammuz 586 BCE. Even Thiele's assumption that the years of captivity were measured from Nisan does not reconcile Ezekiel's chronology for the captivity of Jeconiah with a 586 date, and the calculation given above that uses the customary Tishri-based years yields the summer of 587, consistent with all other texts in Ezekiel related to Jeconiah's captivity. Another text in Ezekiel offers a clue to why there has been such a conflict over the date of Jerusalem's fall in the first place. Ezekiel 24:1‚Äì2 (NIV) records the following: > In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the Lord > came to me: \\"Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king > of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.\\" Assuming that dating here is according to the years of exile of Jeconiah, as elsewhere in Ezekiel, the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem began on January 27, 589 BCE.Parker and Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 28. This can be compared to a similar passage in (NIV): > So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth > month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his > whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around > it. The ninth year, tenth month, tenth day in Ezekiel is identical to the period in 2 Kings. In Ezekiel, the years are everywhere else measured according to Jeconiah's captivity, which must be taken in a non-accession sense, so that the beginning of the siege was eight actual years after the beginning of the captivity. The comparison with 2 Kings 25:1 would indicate that Zedekiah's years in 2 Kings were also by non-accession reckoning. His eleventh year, the year in which Jerusalem fell, would then be 588/587 BCE, in agreement with all texts in Ezekiel and elsewhere that are congruent with that date. Some who maintain the 586 date therefore maintain that in this one instance, Ezekiel, without explicitly saying so, switched to the regnal years of Zedekiah, although Ezekiel apparently regarded Jeconiah as the rightful ruler and never names Zedekiah in his writing. Another view is that a later copyist, aware of the 2 Kings passage, modified it and inserted it into the text of Ezekiel. In his study of all biblical texts related to the Babylonian capture of Jerusalem, Young concludes that these conjectures are not necessary, and that all texts related to the fall of Jerusalem in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, 2 Kings, and 2 Chronicles are internally consistent and consistent with the fall of the city in Tammuz of 587 BCE.Rodger C. Young (2004). \\"When Did Jerusalem Fall?\\" JETS. Archeological findings During his excavation of Babylon in 1899‚Äì1917, Robert Koldewey discovered a royal archive room of King Nebuchadnezzar near the Ishtar Gate. It contained tablets dating to 595‚Äì570 BCE. The tablets were translated in the 1930s by the German Assyriologist, Ernst Weidner. Four of these tablets list rations of oil and barley given to various individuals‚Äîincluding the deposed King Jehoiachin‚Äîby Nebuchadnezzar from the royal storehouses, dated five years after Jehoiachin was taken captive. One tablet reads: > 10 (sila of oil) to the king of Judah, Yaukin; 2 1/2 sila (oil) to the > offspring of Judah's king; 4 sila to eight men from Judea. Another reads, > 1 1/2 sila (oil) for three carpenters from Arvad, 1/2 apiece; 11 1/2 sila > for eight wood workers from Byblos ...; 3 1/2 sila for seven Greek > craftsman, 1/2 sila apiece; 1/2 sila to the carpenter, Nabuetir; 10 sila to > Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the son of Judah's king[1]; 2 1/2 sila for the five sons of > the Judean king.

It is composed of the descendants of Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Emirate of Diriyah, known as the First Saudi state (1744‚Äì1818), and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Ibn Saud, the modern founder of Saudi Arabia. The most influential position of the royal family is the King of Saudi Arabia. The family in total is estimated to comprise some 15,000 members, however the majority of power, influence and wealth is possessed by a group of about 2,000 of them. The House of Saud has had three phases: the Emirate of Diriyah, the First Saudi State (1744‚Äì1818), marked by the expansion of Wahhabism; the Emirate of Nejd, the Second Saudi State (1824‚Äì1891), marked with continuous infighting; and the Third Saudi State (1902‚Äìpresent), which evolved into Saudi Arabia in 1932 and now wields considerable influence in the Middle East. The family has had conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, the Sharif of Mecca, the Al Rashid family of Ha'il and their vassal houses in Najd, numerous Islamist groups both inside and outside Saudi Arabia and Shia minority in Saudi Arabia. The succession to the Saudi Arabian throne was designed to pass from one son of the first king, Ibn Saud, to another. King Salman, who reigns currently, first replaced the next crown prince, his brother Muqrin, with his nephew Muhammad bin Nayef. In 2017, Muhammad bin Nayef was replaced by Mohammad bin Salman, King Salman's son, as the crown prince after an approval by the Allegiance Council with 31 out of 34 votes. The monarchy was hereditary by agnatic seniority until 2006, when a royal decree provided that future Saudi kings are to be elected by a committee of Saudi princes. The king-appointed cabinet includes more members of the royal family. Title Genealogical table of the leaders of the ƒÄl Saud House of Saud is a translation of Al Saud, an Arabic dynastic name formed by adding the word Al (meaning \\"family of\\" or \\"House of\\") to the personal name of an ancestor. In the case of the Al Saud, the ancestor is Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, the father of the dynasty's 18th century founder Muhammad bin Saud (Muhammad, son of Saud). Today, the surname \\"Al Saud\\" is carried by any descendant of Muhammad bin Saud or his three brothers Farhan, Thunayyan, and Mishari. Al Saud's other family branches like Saud al-Kabir, the Al Jiluwi, the Al Thunayan, the Al Mishari and the Al Farhan are called cadet branches. Members of the cadet branches hold high and influential positions in government though they are not in the line of succession to the Saudi throne. Many cadet members intermarry within the Al Saud to reestablish their lineage and continue to wield influence in the government. All members of the royal family have the title of Emir (Prince) but sons, daughters, patrilineal granddaughters and grandsons of Kings are referred to by the style \\"His Royal Highness\\" (HRH), differing from patrilineal great-grandsons and members of cadet branches who are called \\"His Highness\\" (HH), while the reigning king uses the additional title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. History =Origins and early history= The earliest recorded ancestor of the Al Saud was Mani' ibn Rabiah Al-Muraydi who settled in Diriyah in 1446‚Äì1447 with his clan, the Mrudah. Although the Mrudah are believed to be descended from the Rabi'ah tribal confederation, the Banu Hanifa branches of the Rabi'ah. Mani was invited by a relative named Ibn Dir. Ibn Dir was the ruler of a set of villages and estates that make up modern-day Riyadh.Counter-Narratives: History, Contemporary Society, and Politics in Saudi Arabia and Yemen by Madawi Al-Rasheed (Editor), Robert Vitalis (Editor) p. 64 Mani's clan had been on a sojourn in east Arabia, near al-Qatif, from an unknown point in time. Ibn Dir handed Mani two estates called al-Mulaybeed and Ghusayba. Mani and his family settled and renamed the region \\"al-Diriyah\\", after their benefactor Ibn Dir. The Mrudah became rulers of al-Diriyah, which prospered along the banks of Wadi Hanifa and became an important Najdi settlement. As the clan grew larger, power struggles ensued, with one branch leaving for nearby Dhruma, while another branch (the \\"Al Watban\\") left for the town of az-Zubayr in southern Iraq. The Al Muqrin became the ruling family among the Mrudah in Diriyah. The name of the clan comes from Sheikh Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin who died in 1725. =First Saudi state= The First Saudi State was founded in 1744. This period was marked by conquest of neighboring areas and by religious zeal. At its height, the First Saudi State included most of the territory of modern-day Saudi Arabia, and raids by Al Saud's allies and followers reached into Yemen, Oman, Syria, and Iraq. Islamic Scholars, particularly Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab and his descendants, are believed to have played a significant role in Saudi rule during this period. The Saudis and their allies referred to themselves during this period as the Muwahhidun or Ahl al-Tawhid (\\"the monotheists\\"). Later they were referred to as the Wahhabis, a group of particularly strict, puritanical Sunni sect, named for its founder. Leadership of the Al Saud during the time of their first state passed from father to son without incident. The first imam, Muhammad ibn Saud, was succeeded by his eldest son Abdulaziz in 1765. In 1802, Abdulaziz led ten thousand Wahhabi soldiers into an attack on the Shi'ite holy city of Karbala, in what is now southern Iraq and where Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad is buried. Led by Abdulaziz, the Wahhabi soldiers killed more than two thousand people, including women and children. The soldiers plundered the city, demolishing the massive golden dome above Hussein's tomb and loaded hundreds of camels with weapons, jewelry, coins and other valuable goods. The attack on Karbala convinced the Ottomans and the Egyptians that the Saudis were a threat to regional peace. Abdulaziz was killed in 1803 by an assassin, believed by some to have been a Shi'ite seeking revenge over the sacking of Karbala the year before. Abdul-Aziz was in turn succeeded by his son, Saud, under whose rule the Saudi state reached its greatest extent. By the time Saud died in 1814, his son and successor Abdullah ibn Saud had to contend with an Ottoman-Egyptian invasion in the Ottoman‚ÄìWahhabi War seeking to retake lost Ottoman Empire territory. The mainly Egyptian force succeeded in defeating Abdullah's forces, taking over the Saudi capital of Diriyyah in 1818. Abdullah was taken prisoner and was soon beheaded by the Ottomans in Constantinople, putting an end to the First Saudi State. The Egyptians sent many members of the Al Saud clan and other members of the local nobility as prisoners to Egypt and Constantinople, and razed the Saudi capital Diriyyah. =Second Saudi state= Flag of the Second Saudi State A few years after the fall of Diriyah in 1818, the Saudis were able to re-establish their authority in Najd, establishing the Emirate of Nejd, commonly known as the Second Saudi State, with its capital in Riyadh. Compared to the First Saudi State, the second Saudi period was marked by less territorial expansion (it never reconquered the Hijaz or 'Asir, for example) and less religious zeal, although the Saudi leaders continued to go by the title of imam and still employed Salafi religious scholars. The second state was also marked by severe internal conflicts within the Saudi family, eventually leading to the dynasty's downfall. In all but one instance, succession occurred by assassination or civil war, the exception being the passage of authority from Faisal ibn Turki to his son Abdullah ibn Faisal ibn Turki. =Saudi Arabia= Ibn Saud and Franklin D. Roosevelt in February 1945 U.S. President Barack Obama offers condolences on death of Saudi King Abdullah, Riyadh, 27 January 2015 After his defeat at Mulayda, Abdul-Rahman ibn Faisal went with his family into exile in the deserts of eastern Arabia among the Al Murra bedouin. Soon afterward, however, he found refuge in Kuwait as a guest of the Kuwaiti emir, Mubarak Al Sabah. In 1902, Abdul-Rahman's son, Abdul Aziz, took on the task of restoring Saudi rule in Riyadh. Supported by a few dozen followers and accompanied by some of his brothers and relatives, Abdul Aziz was able to capture Riyadh's Masmak fort and kill the governor appointed there by Ibn Rashid. Abdul Aziz, reported to have been barely 20 at the time, was immediately proclaimed ruler in Riyadh. As the new leader of the House of Saud, Abdul Aziz became commonly known from that time onward as \\"Ibn Saud\\" in Western sources, though he is still called \\"Abdul Aziz\\" in the Arab world. Ibn Saud spent the next three decades trying to re-establish his family's rule over central Arabia, starting with his native Najd. His chief rivals were the Al Rashid clan in Ha'il, the Sharifs of Mecca in the Hijaz, and the Ottoman Turks in al-Hasa. Ibn Saud also had to contend, however, with the descendants of his late uncle Saud ibn Faisal (later known as the \\"Saud al-Kabir\\" branch of the family), who posed as the rightful heirs to the throne. Though for a time acknowledging the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultans and even taking the title of pasha, Ibn Saud allied himself to the British, in opposition to the Ottoman-backed Al Rashid. From 1915 to 1927, Ibn Saud's dominions were a protectorate of the British Empire, pursuant to the 1915 Treaty of Darin. Ibn Saud won final victory over the Rashidis in 1921, making him the ruler of most of central Arabia. He consolidated his dominions as the Sultanate of Nejd. He then turned his attention to the Hijaz, finally conquering it in 1926, just months before the British protectorate ended. For the next five and a half years, he administered the two parts of his dual realm, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, as separate units. By 1932, Ibn Saud had disposed of all his main rivals and consolidated his rule over much of the Arabian Peninsula. He united his dominions into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that year. Ibn Saud's father, Abdul Rahman retained the honorary title of \\"imam.\\" In 1937 near Dammam, American surveyors discovered what later proved to be Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves. Before the discovery of oil, many family members were destitute. Ibn Saud sired dozens of children by his many wives. He had at most four wives at a time, divorcing many times. He made sure to marry into many of the noble clans and tribes within his territory, including the chiefs of the Bani Khalid, Ajman, and Shammar tribes, as well as the Al ash-Sheikh (descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab). He also arranged for his sons and relatives to enter into similar marriages. He appointed his eldest surviving son, Saud as heir apparent, to be succeeded by the next eldest son, Faisal. The Saudi family became known as the \\"royal family,\\" and each member, male and female, was accorded the title amir (\\"prince\\") or amira (\\"princess\\"), respectively. Ibn Saud died in 1953, after having cemented an alliance with the United States in 1945. He is still celebrated officially as the \\"Founder,\\" and only his direct descendants may take on the title of \\"his or her Royal Highness.\\" The date of his recapture of Riyadh in 1902 was chosen to mark Saudi Arabia's centennial in 1999 (according to the Islamic lunar calendar). Upon Ibn Saud's death, his son Saud assumed the throne without incident, but his lavish spending led to a power struggle with his brother, Crown Prince Faisal. In 1964, the royal family forced Saud to abdicate in favor of Faisal, aided by an edict from the country's grand mufti. During this period, some of Ibn Saud's younger sons, led by Talal ibn Abdul Aziz, defected to Egypt, calling themselves the \\"Free Princes\\" and calling for liberalization and reform, but were later induced to return by Faisal. They were fully pardoned but were also barred from any future positions in government. Faisal was assassinated in 1975 by a nephew, Faisal ibn Musaid, who was promptly executed. Another brother, Khalid, assumed the throne. The next prince in line had actually been Prince Muhammad, but he had relinquished his claim to the throne in favor of Khalid, his only full brother. Khalid died of a heart attack in 1982, and was succeeded by Fahd, the eldest of the powerful \\"Sudairi Seven\\", so-called because they were all sons of Ibn Saud by his wife Hassa Al Sudairi. Fahd did away with the previous royal title of \\"his Majesty\\" and replaced it with the honorific \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\\", in reference to the two Islamic holy sites in Mecca and Medina, in 1986. A stroke in 1995 left Fahd largely incapacitated. His half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah [who was descended on the maternal side from the rival Rashidi] , gradually took over most of the king's responsibilities until Fahd's death in August 2005. Abdullah was proclaimed king on the day of Fahd's death and promptly appointed his younger brother, Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the minister of defense and Fahd's \\"Second Deputy Prime Minister,\\" as the new heir apparent. On 27 March 2009, Abdullah appointed Prince Nayef Interior Minister as his \\"second deputy prime minister\\" and Crown Prince on 27 October. Sultan died in October 2011 while Nayef died in Geneva, Switzerland on 15 June 2012. On 23 January 2015, Abdullah died after a prolonged illness, and his half-brother, Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, was declared the new King. Many princes and government officials have been arrested in the 2017 in alleged anti corruption campaign by the King and Crown prince. United States President Donald Trump has expressed support for the arrests. Political power Mohammad with U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, Pentagon, 13 May 2015 American President Donald Trump with the First Lady of the United States Melania Trump, King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the 2017 Riyadh summit. The head of the House of Saud is the King of Saudi Arabia who serves as Head of State and monarch of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The King holds almost absolute political power. The King appoints ministers to his cabinet who supervise their respective ministries in his name. The key ministries of Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs are usually held by members of the Saud family, as are most of the thirteen regional governorships. Most portfolios, however, such as Finance, Labour, Information, Planning, Petroleum Affairs and Industry, have traditionally been given to commoners, often with junior Al Saud members serving as their deputies. House of Saud family members also hold many of the Kingdom's critical military and governmental departmental posts. Ultimate power in the Kingdom has always rested upon the Al Saud, though support from the Ulema, the merchant community, and the population at large has been key to the maintenance of the royal family's political status quo. Long-term political and government appointments have occurred, such as those of King Faisal, who was Foreign Minister almost continuously from 1932 to 1975, King Abdullah, who was Commander of the National Guard from 1963 to 2010, and former Crown prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz, who was Minister of Defence and Aviation from 1962 until his death in 2011. Such terms of service have enabled senior princes to mingle their personal wealth with that of their respective domains. They have often appointed their own sons to senior positions within their own fiefdom. Examples of these include Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah as assistant commander in the National Guard until 2010; Prince Khalid bin Sultan as assistant minister of defence until 2013; Prince Mansour bin Mutaib as assistant minister for Municipal and Rural Affairs until he replaced his father in 2009; and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as assistant minister in the Interior Ministry. In cases, where portfolios have notably substantial budgets, appointments of younger, often full, brothers have been necessary, as deputies or vice ministers, ostensibly to share the wealth and the burdens of responsibility, of each fiefdom. Examples of these include Prince Abdul Rahman who was vice minister of defence and aviation under Prince Sultan; Prince Badr, deputy to King Abdullah in the National Guard; Prince Sattam, who was Deputy Riyadh Governor during King Salman's term; and Prince Ahmed, who held the deputy minister's portfolio under Prince Nayef's interior ministry. Unlike Western royal families, the Saudi Monarchy has not had a clearly defined order of succession. Historically, upon becoming King, the monarch has designated an heir apparent to the throne who serves as Crown Prince of the Kingdom. Upon the King's death the Crown Prince becomes King, and during the King's incapacitation the Crown Prince, likewise, assumes power as regent. Although other members of the Al Saud hold political positions in the Saudi government, it is only the King and Crown Prince who legally constitute the political institutions. Succession U.S. President Jimmy Carter meets with King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd in January 1978 Succession has been from brother to brother since the death of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud was succeeded by his son Saud. Saud was succeeded by his brother Faisal. Faisal was succeeded by his brother Khalid who, in turn, was succeeded by his brother Fahd. Fahd was succeeded by his brother Abdullah, and Abdullah by his brother Salman, the current King. Salman appointed his half-brother Muqrin as Crown Prince in January 2015 and removed him in April 2015. Even Abdulaziz's youngest son was to turn 70 in 2015. Abdulaziz, in 1920, had said that the further succession would be from brother to brother, not from father to son. Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Melania Trump, Riyadh, 20 May 2017 King Salman ended the brother-to-brother succession and appointed his 56-year-old nephew Muhammad bin Nayef as Crown Prince in April 2015, thus making the next succession from uncle to nephew. At the same time, King Salman appointed his son, Mohammad bin Salman, as Deputy Crown Prince, thus making the following succession from cousin to cousin, as Mohammad bin Salman is the cousin of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef. However, in June 2017, Salman elevated Mohammad bin Salman to Crown Prince, following his decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef of all positions, making his son heir apparent to the throne, and making the next succession father to son, for the first time since 1953, when Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud succeeded his father, the founder of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud. Amid international outcry over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, members of Saudi's royal families are distressed over the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman becoming the next king. A lot of princes and members of the Al Saud family want Prince Ahmed to become the next king instead of MbS. During his London tour, Prince Ahmed criticized the Saudi leadership. He was also the only member of the ruling family to oppose MbS from becoming the crown prince in 2017. Wealth Luxury yacht Kingdom 5KR owned by Saudi royal family, docked in Antibes, French Riviera In June 2015 Forbes listed Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal as the 34th-richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$22.6 billion.

As of 2020 the combined net worth of the entire royal family has been estimated at around $100 billion, which makes them the richest royal family among all monarchs, as well as one of the wealthiest families in the world. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/052416/top-10-wealthiest- families-world.asp Opposition Due to its authoritarian and quasi- theocratic rule, the House of Saud has attracted much criticism during its rule of Saudi Arabia. There have been numerous incidents, including the Wahhabi Ikhwan militia uprising during the reign of Ibn Saud. Osama Bin Laden, a critic of the US, was also a critic of Saudi Arabia and was denaturalized in the mid 1990s. On 20 November 1979, the Grand Mosque seizure saw the al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca violently seized by a group of 500 heavily armed and provisioned Saudi dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaybi and Abdullah al- Qahtani, consisting mostly of members of the former Ikhwan militia of Otaibah but also of other peninsular Arabs and a few Egyptians enrolled in Islamic studies at the Islamic University of Madinah. The Saudi royal family turned to the Ulema who duly issued a fatwa permitting the storming of the holy sanctuary by Saudi forces, aided by French and Pakistani special ops units. According to Lawrence Wright, the GIGN commandos did convert to Islam. Most of those responsible, including Al-Otaybi himself, were beheaded publicly in four cities of Saudi Arabia. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr, who had called for pro-democracy demonstrations, along with forty-seven other Saudi Shia citizens sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court on terrorism charges. Since May 2017 in response to protests against the government, the predominantly Shia town of Al-Awamiyah has been put under full siege by the Saudi military. Residents are not allowed to enter or leave, and military indiscriminately shells the neighborhoods with airstrikes, mortar and artillery fire along with snipers shooting residents. Dozens of Shia civilians were killed, including a three year old and a two- year-old child. The Saudi government claims it is fighting terrorists in al- Awamiyah. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman kept his own mother away from his father for more than two years, out of the fear that she would stop the king from giving the power to him. Princess Fahda bint Falah Al Hathleen, third wife of King Salman, was said to be in America for medical treatment. However, according to American intelligence this was refuted stating that she was not in the country. Some Royals have been criticised for various Human Rights violations, including the death of Jamal Khashoggi, treatment of workers https://www.france24.com/en/20190613-sister-saudi-crown-prince-faces-paris- trial-over-attack-workman, the Saudi led intervention in Bahrain and the Yemen war. The Reuters reported on 23 June, 2020, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of allegedly threatening and intimidating a former intelligence officer, Saad al-Jabri along with his family of adult children, of returning to Saudi Arabia from exile in Canada. Saad was a long-time aide to the former crown prince, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who Prince Salman ousted in 2017. The official allegedly has access to documents containing information sensitive and pivotal for the crown prince‚Äôs leadership. A group of intellects from Saudi Arabia, exiled in the US, UK, and elsewhere, launched a political party in opposition to the royal family ruling the kingdom. The launch of the party was announced in September 2020 and was launched on the 2nd death anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi. The National Assembly Party (NAAS ‚Äì people in Arabic) was launched with the aim of gathering the support of people both, inside and outside Saudi Arabia against the ruling royals King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Madawi al-Rasheed, a scholar is also the co-founder of NAAS. Other members of the party include scholar Abdullah al-Aoudh, comedian and vlogger Omar Abdulaziz, and activist Yahya Assiri. The party‚Äôs launch took place online from London as the Basic Law in Saudi prohibits the formation of political parties. The penalty of forming a political party in Saudi is charged with sedition along with lengthy jail terms.

He was the youngest son of Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud and the father of Ibn Saud, who founded the modern Saudi Arabia. Early life Abdul Rahman had three elder brothers: Abdullah, Saud and Mohammed. One of his sisters was Al Jawhara (died around 1930) who also exiled with the family in Kuwait. Royal civil war When Abdul Rahman's brothers ‚Äî Saud and Abdullah ‚Äî were struggling for power in 1865, Abdul Rahman and his brother Muhammad tended to align themselves with Saud. In 1871, after Saud had taken the capital Riyadh. Abdul Rahman was sent to Baghdad to negotiate with the Ottoman Empire for help. Unsuccessful after two years, he tried to take Al Hasa in the east where Abdullah was now based, but without success, and eventually returned to Riyadh. After Saud's death in 1875, Abdul Rahman was recognized as successor, but within a year Riyadh was taken by Abdullah and he was forced to abdicate. In 1887 the sons of Saud bin Faisal, who kept up desultory hostilities against their uncles, managed to capture Abdullah. The Rashidi amirs of Ha'il were able to secure Abdullah's release in exchange for Abdul- Rahman. Abdullah was taken to Ha'il and a Rashidi emir appointed to him to govern Riyadh. Abdul Rahman was able to rise in revolt in 1887 and take and defend Riyadh, but his attempts to expand control ended in disaster. When Abdul Rahman became the undisputed leader of the House of Saud in 1889, he attacked and regained Riyadh. However, the Saudi forces were defeated in the Battle of Mulayda, and Abdul Rahman and his family were forced to flee. Later years The family fled to the desert of the Rub al-Khali to the southeast among the Al Murrah Bedouin, before finding refuge with the Al Khalifa family in Bahrain, and finally with the Al Sabah family in Kuwait. They were given permission by the Ottoman State to settle in Kuwait. While in Kuwait, Abdul Rahman tried to make Wahhabist Islam widespread and recreate the Saudi Dynasty. After defeat at the battle of Sarif in 1900, he gave up all ambitions to recovery his patrimony. Following the capture of Riyadh by his son, Abdulaziz, in January 1902 he came back from Kuwait and presented his son a sword that had belonged to Muhammad ibn ‚ÄòAbd al Wahhab. Abdul Rahman was styled Imam and considered the spiritual leader of the country, while Abdulaziz held secular and military authority. He also acted as the ceremonial leader of the newly built state. Personal life and death Abdul Rahman had at least eleven sons with different wives, including Abdulaziz, Mohammed, Saad, Abdullah and Musaid. His most known daughter is Noura. One of his spouses was Sara bint Ahmed bin Muhammad Al Sudairi who was the mother of Faisal, Noura, Abdulaziz, Bazza, Haya and Saad. She died in 1910. Another one was Amsha bint Faraj Al Ajran Al Khalidi who was the mother of Musaid. Abdul Rahman died in Riyadh in June 1928.

The phrase is used to describe self-identified socialists whose luxurious upper middle-class or \\"preppy\\" lifestyles (perhaps including consumption of Champagne) apparently contradict their political convictions. It is a popular epithet that implies a degree of hypocrisy, and it is closely related to the concept of the \\"liberal elite\\". The term is broadly similar to the American terms \\"Learjet liberal\\", \\"limousine liberal\\" or \\"latte liberal\\", and to idioms in other languages such as the Spanish Izquierda caviar, the French Gauche caviar, the German Salonsozialist, the Portuguese Esquerda Caviar, the Italian Radical chic and Polish kawiorowa lewica. Other related terms include \\"Hampstead liberal\\", \\"Gucci socialist\\", \\"Gucci communist\\", \\"Neiman Marxist\\", \\"cashmere communist\\", in Ireland, \\"smoked salmon socialist\\", and in the Philippines, \\"steak commandos.\\" United Kingdom British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald In the UK, the term is often used by right-wing critics to disparage more progressive political opponents. This argument claims that the champagne socialist espouses leftist views while enjoying a luxurious lifestyle; one example might include Labour Party supporters who stereotypically live in Inner London and consume highbrow media. This usage of the term has been criticised by the writer and broadcaster Caitlin Moran as a fallacious argument, because she claims it assumes that only those who are poor can express an opinion about social inequality. The term has also been used by left-wing commentators to criticise centrist views. Some traditional left-wingers regard the first Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as a \\"champagne socialist\\" who betrayed the Labour movement. MacDonald's lavish lifestyle and his mingling with high society is supposed to have been a corrupting influence that led to the end of the Labour Government in 1931 and the eventual formation of the National Government. More recently, the epithet has been levelled at supporters of the New Labour movement which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997. In an article about Oscar Wilde's 1891 essay \\"The Soul of Man under Socialism\\", political commentator Will Self expressed the view that Wilde could be considered an early champagne socialist because of his aesthetic lifestyle and socialist leanings. The writer and Labour supporter John Mortimer, when accused of being a champagne socialist, said that he preferred to be thought of as \\"more a Bollinger Bolshevik\\". In cult TV series Absolutely Fabulous (series 4) episode 1 (\\"Parralox\\"), Saffron is offered a job with New Labour. While she is at pains to avoid being seen as a champagne socialist, her grandmother Mrs. Monsoon considers the family to be 'Bolly Bolsheviks'. The label has also been applied to the Labour politician Geoffrey Robinson MP on account of his large personal fortune. Singer Charlotte Church has described herself as a \\"prosecco socialist\\", referring to the increasing popularity and lower price range of non-champagne sparkling wines such as prosecco and cava. Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand, the variant \\"Chardonnay socialist\\" was used, as Chardonnay was seen as a drink of affluent people. Australian left-wing \\"true believers\\" used the term against supporters of the failed republic referendum of 1999, where the vote was split not along conventional party lines but socio-economic divides. The rich overwhelmingly supported the change; the less well-off were opposed. Staunch Australian right-wingers also used the term to deride those who supported what they considered \\"middle-class welfare\\"‚Äîgovernment funding for the arts, free tertiary education, and the ABC. By the late 1990s, chardonnay had become more readily available and generally consumed in Australia; today it is the most dominant white wine variety produced in the country. As a result, the drink's association with elitism has faded. United States Current Affairs ran a lighthearted article featuring a political cartoon of guests at a Marxist gathering dressed in fancy attire and sipping on champagne. The central argument was that conspicuous consumption was not inherently antithetical to leftist values so long as luxuries were shared equally. As the magazine put it, \\"When we say let them eat cake, we are serious: there must be cake, it must be good cake, and it must be had by all. The reason Marie Antoinette needed beheading was not that she wished cake on the poor, but that she never actually gave them any.\\" See also * Baizuo (White Left) * Liberal elite * Regressive Left * Latte#Politics *Logical fallacies  References   External links  * Dylan Jones: Card-carrying champagne socialists are looking to swap sides - but they want to do it with dignity The Independent * Champagne socialist at The Free Dictionary Category:Class-related slurs Category:Socialism Category:Social class subcultures Category:Political metaphors referring to people Category:Political terminology in Australia Category:Political terms in the United Kingdom Category:New Zealand slang Category:Metaphors referring to food and drink Category:Stereotypes of the middle class Category:Stereotypes of the upper class Category:Left-wing politics in the United Kingdom Category:Political catchphrases ","title":"Champagne socialist"},{"id":"402579","text":"Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud () (died November 1803) was the second ruler of the First Saudi State and son of Muhammad bin Saud.

In 1803 Mecca was taken by Abdulaziz's forces, and the religious figures in the city declared their alliance to Wahhabis.

Politics left Shajarian's Bidaad album was recorded after a three-year hiatus from commercial recording. The lyrics of the album speak of a wonderful place having been reduced to shambles and bloodshed, in which he sings in sadness \\"what happened?\\". When giving a lecture at California State University, Sacramento on 2 March 2012, he was asked what the lyrics of this song meant. His response made it clear that he chose these lyrics based on what happened to the Iranian regime in the aftermath of the revolution ‚Äì a once beautiful country being reduced to shambles.ÿ≥ÿÆŸÜÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±€åÿßŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá ⁄©ÿßŸÑ€åŸÅÿ±ŸÜ€åÿß This is widely considered his first commercial recording meant to represent the voice of an oppressed people in Iran. Shajarian has indicated support for Iranians protesting against the 12 June 2009 Iranian presidential election results. When Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to the protesters as \\"dust and trash\\", Shajarian told a BBC Persian channel telephone interviewer that he (Shajarian) considered himself the voice of dust and trash: \\"It is the voice of dust and trash and it will always remain the voice of dust and trash.\\" He also asked IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting) to stop broadcasting his songs. He mentioned that his famous song \\"Iran, Ey Saraye Omid\\" (Iran, the land of Hope), has no relation with the current situation of his country.ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿßÿπÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ∂ ÿ¢ŸÖ€åÿ≤ ÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±ŸäÿßŸÜ ÿ®Ÿá ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ∫ÿßŸÖ€å In an interview in 1995, Shajarian stated that \\"my criticism was a mistake of one person, I am not against the republic system.

He is an important figure in Islam as he was a member of the Household of Muhammad (Ahl al-Bayt) and the People of the Cloak (Ahl al-KisƒÅ), as well as the third Shia Imam. Prior to his death, the Umayyad ruler Mu'awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor, contrary to the Hasan-Muawiya treaty. When Muawiya died in 680, Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him. Husayn refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid, even though it meant sacrificing his life. As a consequence, he left Medina, his hometown, to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60.. There, the people of Kufa sent letters to him, asking his help and pledging their allegiance to him. So he traveled towards Kufa, after getting some favorable indications along with a small caravan of his relatives and followers but near Karbala his caravan was intercepted by Yazid's army. He was killed and beheaded in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 (10 Muharram 61 AH) by Yazid, along with most of his family and companions, including Husayn's six-month old son, Ali al-Asghar, with the women and children taken as prisoners.Gordon, 2005, pp. 144‚Äì146. Anger at Husayn's death was turned into a rallying cry that helped undermine the Umayyad caliphate's legitimacy, and ultimately its overthrow by the Abbasid Revolution. The annual commemoration of Husayn and his children, family and companions occurs during Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, and the day he was martyred is known as Ashura (the tenth day of Muharram, a day of mourning for Shi'i Muslims). Husayn's actions at Karbala fueled later Shi'a movements, and his death was decisive in shaping Islamic and Shi'a history. The timing of Husayn's life and death were crucial as they were in one of the most challenging periods of the seventh century. During this time, Umayyad oppression was rampant, and the stand that Husayn and his followers took became a symbol of resistance inspiring future uprisings against oppressors and injustice. Throughout history, many notable personalities, such as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, have cited Husayn's stand against oppression as an example for their own fights against injustice. Family Husayn's maternal grandmother was Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, and his paternal grandparents were Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad. Hasan and Husayn were regarded by Muhammad as his own sons due to his love for them and as they were the sons of his daughter Fatima. He said \\"Every mother's children are associated with their father except for the children of Fatimah for I am their father and lineage.\\" Thus, the descendants of Fatimah are the descendants of Muhammad, and are part of his family. Husayn had several children: * Ali Zayn al-'ƒÄbidƒ´n (\\"Adornment of the Worshipers\\") (b. AH 36) (Mother: Shahrbanu) * Sakinah (b. AH 38) (Mother: Shahrbanu) * Ali al-Akbar (\\"The great\\") (b. AH 42) (Mother: Layla) * Fatimah as-Sughra (b. AH 45) (Mother: Layla) * Sukaynah (b. AH 56) (Mother: Rubab) * Ali al-Asghar (\\"The small\\") (b. AH 60) (Mother: Rubab)  Birth and early life  Husayn was born on 10 January AD 626 (3 Sha'ban AH 4, or AH 3 according to Shi'i tradition). Husayn and his brother Hasan were reportedly the last male descendants of Muhammad living during his lifetime and remaining after his death. There are many accounts of his love for them which refer to them together. Muhammad is reported to have said that \\"He who loves me and loves these two, their father and their mother, will be with me at my place on the Day of Resurrection.\\" and that \\"Husayn is of me and I am of him. Allah loves those who love Husayn. Husayn is a grandson among grandsons.\\" A narration declares Hasan and Husayn as the \\"Masters of the Youth of Paradise\\"; this has been particularly important for the Shi'a who have used it in support of the right of Muhammad's descendants to succeed him. The Shi'a maintain that the infallibility of the Imam is a basic rule in the Imamate. \\"The theologians have defined the Imamate, saying: \\"Surely the Imamate is a grace from Allah, Who grants it to the most perfect and best of His servants to Him\\" Other traditions record Muhammad with his grandsons on his knees, on his shoulders, and even on his back when they were young during his prayer at the moment of prostrating himself.L. Veccia Vaglieri, (al-) ·∏§usayn b.  øAlƒ´ b. Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib, Encyclopedia of Islam. According to Wilferd Madelung, Muhammad loved them and declared them as people of his Bayt very frequently.Madelung (1997), pp. 14‚Äì16. He has also said: \\"Every mother's children are associated with their father except for the children of Fatima for I am their father and lineage.\\" Thus, the descendants of Fatimah were descendants of Muhammad, and part of his Bayt. According to popular Sunni belief, it refers to the household of Muhammad. Shia popular view is the members of Muhammad's family that were present at the incident of Mubahalah. According to Muhammad Baqir Majlisi who compiled Bihar al-Anwar, a collection of ahadith ('accounts', 'narrations' or 'reports'), Chapter 46 Verse 15 (Al-Ahqaf) and Chapter 89 Verses 27‚Äì30 (Al-Fajr) of the Qur'an are regarding Husayn. =Incident of the Mubahalah= In the Hijri year 10 (AD 631/32) a Christian envoy from Najran (now in southern Saudi Arabia) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus ( øƒ™sƒÅ). After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's ( æƒÄdam) creation,‚Äîwho was born to neither a mother nor a father ‚Äî and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad was instructed to call them to Mubahalah where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families.. \\"If anyone dispute with you in this matter [concerning Jesus] after the knowledge which has come to you, say: Come let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then let us swear an oath and place the curse of God on those who lie.\\". Sunni historians, except Tabari who do not name the participants, mention Muhammad, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn as the participants, and some agree with the Shi'i tradition that Ali was among them. Accordingly, in the verse of Mubahalah, in the Shi'i perspective, the phrase \\"our sons\\" refers to Hasan and Husayn, \\"our women\\" refers to Fatimah, and \\"ourselves\\" refers to Ali. Life under the Umayyads Mu'awiyah, who was the governor of the Syrian region under Caliph Uthman ibn Affan, had refused Ali's demands for allegiance, and had long been in conflict with him. After Ali was assassinated and people gave allegiance to Hasan, Mu'awiyah prepared to fight with him. The battle led to inconclusive skirmishes between the armies of Hassan and Mu'awiyah. To avoid the agonies of the civil war, Hasan signed a treaty with Mu'awiyah, according to which Mu'awiyah would not name a successor during his reign, and let the Islamic community (ummah) choose his successor. =Reign of Muawiyah= According to the Shi'ah, Husayn was the third Imam for a period of ten years after the death of his brother Hasan in AD 669. All of this time except the last six months coincided with the caliphate of Mu'awiyah.Tabatabaei, (1979), p.196. After the peace treaty with Hasan, Mu'awiyah set out with his troops to Kufa, where at a public surrender ceremony Hasan rose and reminded the people that he and Husayn were the only grandsons of Muhammad, and that he had surrendered the reign to Mu'awiyah in the best interest of the community: \\"O people, surely it was God who led you by the first of us and Who has spared you bloodshed by the last of us. I have made peace with Mu'awiyah, and I know not whether haply this be not for your trial, and that ye may enjoy yourselves for a time.\\" declared Hassan. In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in 41/660 and his death in 49/669, Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Muawiyah. Sentiments in favor of the rule of Ahl al-Bayt occasionally emerged in the form of small groups, mostly from Kufa, visiting Hasan and Husayn asking them to be their leaders - a request to which they declined to respond. Even ten years later, after the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to his younger brother, Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Muawiyah was alive due to Hasan's peace treaty with him. Later on, however, and before his death, Muawiyah named his son Yazid as his successor. =Reign of Yazid= One of the important points of the treaty made between Hasan and Mu'awiyah was that the latter should not designate anyone as his successor after his death. But after the death of Hasan, Mu'awiyah, thinking that no one would be courageous enough to object to his decision as the caliph, designated his son Yazid as his successor in 680, breaking the treaty.Halm (2004), p.13. Robert Payne quotes Mu'awiyah in History of Islam as telling his son Yazid to defeat Husayn‚Äîbecause Mu'awiyah thought he was surely preparing an army against him‚Äîbut to deal with him gently thereafter as Husayn was a descendant of Muhammad, but to deal with 'Abd Allah ibn al-Zubair swiftly, as Mu'awiyah feared him the most.John Dunn, The Spread of Islam, pg. 51. World History Series. San Diego: Lucent Books, 1996. In April 680, Yazid succeeded his father as caliph. He immediately instructed the governor of Medina to compel Husayn and few other prominent figures to pledge their allegiance (bay'ah). Husayn, however, refrained from it, believing that Yazid was openly going against the teachings of Islam in public, and changing the sunnah (deeds, sayings, etc.) of Muhammad.Al Bidayah wa al-Nihayah Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah In his view the integrity and survival of the Islamic community depended on the re-establishment of the correct guidance.Dakake (2007), pp. 81 and 82. He and his household left Medina to seek asylum in Mecca. While in Mecca, ibn al-Zubayr, Abdullah ibn Umar and Abdullah ibn Abbas advised Husayn to make Mecca his base, and fight against Yazid from there.Balyuzi, H. M.: Muhammad and the course of Islam. George Ronald, Oxford (U.K.), 1976, p.193. There, the people of Kufa sent letters to him, asking his help and pledging their allegiance to him. So he traveled towards Kufa, but near Karbala his caravan was intercepted by Yazid's army. He was killed and beheaded in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 (10 Muharram 61 AH), along with most of his family and companions, including Husayn's six-month old son, Ali al-Asghar, with the women and children taken as prisoners. Stories recounting the Battle of Karbala are referred to as Maqtal al-Husayn. Aftermath Imam Husayn Shrine, where Husayn is buried, in the 21st century Once the Umayyad troops had killed Husayn, his family members, and his male soldiers, they looted and burned the tents, plundered the body of Husayn, stripped the women of their jewellery, trampled over the body of Husayn with horses, and took the skin upon which Ali Zayn al-Abidin was prostrate. Ali had been unable to fight in the battle, due to an illness. It is said that Shimr was about to kill him, but Husayn's sister Zaynab was able to convince his commander, Umar ibn Sa'ad, to let him live. In addition, Zayn al-Abidin and other relatives of Husayn were taken hostage. They were taken to meet Yazid in Damascus, and eventually, they were allowed to return to Medina. After learning of the death of Husayn, Ibn al-Zubayr collected the people of Mecca and made the following speech: > O people! No other people are worse than Iraqis and among the Iraqis, the > people of Kufa are the worst. They repeatedly wrote letters and called Imam > Husayn to them and took bay'at (allegiance) for his caliphate. But when ibn > Ziyad arrived in Kufa, they rallied around him and killed Imam Husayn who > was pious, observed the fast, read the Quran and deserved the caliphate in > all respectsNajeebabadi, Akbar Shah (2001). The History of Islam V.2. > Riyadh: Darussalam. pp. 110. . After his speech, the people of Mecca joined him to take on Yazid. When he heard about this, Yazid sent a force to arrest him, but the force was defeated. People of Medina renounced their allegiance to Yazid and expelled his governor. Yazid tried to end his rebellion by sending his army the Hijaz, and took Medina after the bloody Battle of al-Harrah followed by the siege of Mecca but his sudden death ended the campaign and threw the Umayyads into disarray with civil war eventually breaking out. Eventually ibn al-Zubayr consolidated his power by sending a governor to Kufah. Soon, he established his power in Iraq, southern Arabia, the greater part of Al-Sham, and parts of Egypt. This essentially split the Islamic empire into two spheres with two different caliphs. Soon afterwards he lost Egypt and whatever he had of Al- Sham to Marwan I. This coupled with the Kharijite rebellions in Iraq reduced his domain to only the Hejaz. Ibn al-Zubayr was finally defeated and killed by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who was sent by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, on the battlefield in 692. He beheaded him and crucified his body, reestablishing Umayyad control over the Empire. Yazid died in Rabi'al-Awwal, 64 AH (November, AD 683), less than 4 years after coming to power. As for other opponents of Husayn, such as ibn Ziyad and Shimr, they were killed in a rebellion led by Mukhtar al-Thaqafi.Al-Kashee, Ikhtiyaar Ma\`arifah Al-Rijaal, pg. 127, hadeeth # 202.Al-Khoei, Mu\`jam Rijaal Al-Hadeeth, vol. 18, pg. 93, person # 12158. Burial Zarih of Husayn's head at Al-Hussein Mosque in Cairo, Egypt Husayn's body is buried in Karbala, the site of his death. His head is said to have been returned from Damascus and interred with his body,Halm (2004), pp. 15 and 16. although various sites have also been claimed to house, or have sheltered, Husayn's head, among others: Aleppo, Ashkelon, Baalbek, Cairo, Damascus, Homs, Merv, and Medina. =Return of his head to the body= Husayn's son Ali returned his head from Ash-Sham to Karbala,Amali of Shaykh Sadouq, Majlis 31, p. 232. forty days after Ashura, reuniting it with Husayn's body. Shi'i Muslims commemorate this fortieth day as Arba‚Äòƒ´n. According to the Shi'i belief that the body of an Imam is only buried by an Imam, Husayn ibn Ali's body was buried by his son, Ali Zayn al-Abidin. =Husayn's head in Isma'ilism= Niche for Husayn's head at the Umayyad mosque in Damascus After the battle of Karbala, the forces of Yazid I raised the head of Husayn on a lance. They took it to Kufa, then to Damascus to be presented to Yazid. The head was then buried in a niche of one of the internal walls of the Umayyad Mosque for about two hundred twenty years. When the Abbasids took over from the Umayyads, they also confiscated the head of Husayn. The Abbasid caliph al- Muqtadir (d. 295/908) attempted many times to stop the pilgrimage to the head but in vain. Ultimately, he secretly transferred the head to Ashkelon. The Fatimid caliph al-Aziz Billah traced the site through his contemporary in Baghdad, in 985.Brief History of Transfer of the Sacred Head of Hussain ibn Ali, From Damascus to Ashkelon to Qahera By: Qazi Dr. Shaikh Abbas Borhany PhD (USA), NDI, Shahadat al A'alamiyyah (Najaf, Iraq), M.A., LLM (Shariah) Member, Ulama Council of Pakistan.

According to an Arabic inscription on the Fatimid minbar of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali conquered Palestine under Caliph al-Mustansir Billah and discovered the head of Husayn in AH 448. He constructed the minbar, a mosque and the mashhad at the place of burial.Williams, Caroline. 1983. \\"The Cult of 'Alid Saints in the Fatimid Monuments of Cairo. Part I: The Mosque of al-Aqmar\\".

During the British Mandate it was a \\"large maqam on top of a hill\\" with no tomb but a fragment of a pillar showing the place where the head had been buried. Israeli Defense Forces under Moshe Dayan blew up Mashhad Nabi Husayn in July 1950 as part of a broader operation.

Commemoration Mourning of Muharram in cities and villages of Iran Shi'as mourn during Muharram to pay respect to Husayn whose sacrifices kept true Islam alive and to show their allegiance and love for Imamate. Many Christians and Sunnis also join them. Ashura is commemorated by the Shi'i community as a day of mourning Husayn's death. The commemoration of Husayn has become a national holiday and different ethnic and religious communities participate in it. Husayn's grave became the most visited place of ziyarat for Shi'as. A pilgrimage to Husayn's shrine in Karbala is said to have the merit of a thousand pilgrimages to Mecca, of a thousand martyrdoms, and of a thousand days fasting.Braswell, Islam: Its Prophet, Peoples, Politics and Power, 1996, p.28. Shi'a have an important book about Husayn which is called Ziyarat Ashura. Most of them believe that it is a hadith qudsi (the word of God). The Imam Husayn Shrine was later built over his grave in Karbala. In 850, the Abassid Caliph al-Mutawakkil destroyed his shrine in order to stop Shi'i pilgrimages. However, pilgrimages continued.Halm (2004), p. 15. In culture Historian Edward Gibbon described the events at Karbala as a tragedy. \\"In a distant age and climate, the tragic scene of the death of Husein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.\\" The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. 2, p. 218 . According to historian Syed Akbar Hyder, Mahatma Gandhi attributed the historical progress of Islam, to the \\"sacrifices of Muslim saints like Husayn\\" rather than military force.Reliving Karbala: Martyrdom in South Asian memory, By Syed Akbar Hyder, Oxford University Press, p. 170. The traditional narration \\"Every day is Ashura and every land is Karbala!\\" is used by the Shi'a as a mantra to live their lives as Husayn did on Ashura, i.e. with complete sacrifice for God and for others. The saying is also intended to signify that what happened on Ashura in Karbala must always be remembered as part of suffering everywhere. Inspiring modern movements The story of Husayn has been a strong source of inspiration for Shi'i revolutionary movements, justifying their own resistance against unjust authority. In the course of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran against the Pahlavi dynasty, Shi'i beliefs and symbols were instrumental in orchestrating and sustaining widespread popular resistance with Husayn's story providing a framework for labeling as evil and reacting against the Pahlavi Shah.

He ruled for three years from 680 until his death in 683. His appointment was the first hereditary succession in Islamic history. His caliphate was marked by the death of Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali as well as the start of the crisis known as the Second Fitna. His nomination in 676 (56 AH) by Muawiya was opposed by several prominent Muslims from the Hejaz. Following his accession, after Muawiya's death in 680, Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr refused to recognize him and fled to sanctuary in Mecca. When Husayn was on his way to Kufa to lead a revolt against Yazid, he was killed with his small band of supporters by Yazid's forces in the Battle of Karbala. The killing of Husayn led to resentment in the Hejaz, where Ibn al-Zubayr centered his opposition to the rule of Yazid, and was supported by many people in Mecca and Medina. After failed attempts to regain the confidence of Ibn al-Zubayr and the people of the Hejaz through diplomacy, Yazid sent an army to end the rebellion. The army defeated the Medinese in the Battle of al-Harrah in August 683 and the city was given over to three days of pillage. Later, siege was laid to Mecca, which lasted for several weeks. The siege ended with the death of Yazid in November 683 and the empire fell into civil war. Yazid is considered an illegitimate ruler and a tyrant by many Muslims due to his hereditary succession, the death of Husayn and the attack on the city of Medina by his forces. Modern historians present a milder view of him, and consider him a capable ruler, albeit less successful than his father. Early life Genealogical tree of the Sufyanids, the ruling family to which Yazid I belonged Yazid was born in Syria in 646 to Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, then governor of Syria under Caliph Uthman (), and Maysun, the daughter of Bahdal ibn Unayf, a chieftain of the powerful Banu Kalb tribe. Yazid grew up with his maternal Kalbite tribesmen. Although during his youth he spent his springs in the desert with his Bedouin kin, for the remainder of the year he was in the company of the Greek and native Syrian courtiers of his father, who became caliph in 661. Yazid led several campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and in 670 participated in an attack on Constantinople. He also led the hajj (the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca) on several occasions. Nomination as caliph By the end of the first Islamic civil war (August 661), Muawiya became sole ruler of the Caliphate as a result of a peace treaty with Hasan ibn Ali, who had controlled most of the Caliphate following the murder of his father Ali a few months earlier. The terms of the treaty stipulated that Muawiya would not nominate a successor. However, in 676, Muawiya nominated Yazid as his heir. Muawiya and the shura (consultation) declared for Yazid in Damascus, where the former had summoned influential people from all provinces to the capital and convinced them one way or another. Muawiya ordered Marwan ibn al-Hakam, then the governor of Medina, to inform the people of Medina of Muawiya's decision. Marwan faced resistance to this announcement, especially from Husayn ibn Ali, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr. Muawiya went to Medina and pressed the four dissenters to accede, but they fled to Mecca. Muawiya followed and threatened some of them with death, but they still refused to support him. Nonetheless, he was successful in convincing the people of Mecca that the four had pledged their allegiance, and received allegiance for Yazid. On his way back to Damascus, he secured allegiance from the people of Medina as well. Yazid's opponents were silent thereafter. German orientalist Julius Wellhausen doubts the story, while Bernard Lewis writes that the homage was arranged with a mix of diplomacy and bribes and, to a lesser extent, by force. Before dying, Muawiya left Yazid a will, instructing him on matters of governing the empire. He advised him to beware of Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr, and predicted that the people of Iraq would entice Husayn into rebellion and then abandon him. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad. Ibn al-Zubayr, on the other hand, was to be treated harshly, unless he came to terms. Muawiya also advised him to treat the people of the Hejaz well. Reign =Oaths of allegiance= Upon his accession, Yazid requested and received oaths of allegiance from the governors of the Caliphate's provinces. He wrote to his cousin, the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, informing him of the death of Muawiya and instructing him to secure allegiance from Husayn ibn Ali, Ibn al-Zubayr and Ibn Umar. The instructions contained in the letter were: Walid sought the advice of Marwan on the matter. Marwan suggested that Ibn al-Zubayr and Husayn should be forced to pay allegiance as they were dangerous, while Ibn Umar should be left alone as he posed no threat. Husayn answered Walid's summon, while Ibn al-Zubayr did not. When Husayn met Walid and Marwan in a semi-private meeting, he was informed of Muawiya's death and Yazid's accession to the caliphate. When asked for his pledge of allegiance to Yazid, Husayn responded that giving his allegiance in private would be insufficient, such a thing should be given in public. Walid agreed, but Marwan interrupted demanding that Husayn be detained until he pledged allegiance. At this, Marwan was scolded by Husayn who then exited unharmed. Husayn had his armed retinue waiting nearby in case the authorities attempted to apprehend him. Immediately following Husayn's exit, Marwan admonished Walid, who in turn rebutted Marwan, justifying his refusal to harm Husayn by stating \\"On the Day of Resurrection a man who is [responsible] for the blood of Al-Husayn [will weigh] little in the scale of God\\". Ibn al-Zubayr left for Mecca that night. In the morning Walid sent eighty horsemen after him, but he escaped. Husayn too left for Mecca shortly after, without having sworn allegiance to Yazid. Dissatisfied with this failure, Yazid replaced Walid with Amr ibn Said. Unlike Husayn and Ibn al- Zubayr, Ibn Umar, Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr and Abd Allah ibn Abbas, who had also previously denounced Muawiya's nomination of Yazid, now paid allegiance to him. =Battle of Karbala= Coin of the Umayyad Caliphate at the time of Yazid ibn Muawiya.

In Mecca Husayn received letters from pro-Alid Kufans, inviting him to lead them in revolt against Yazid. Husayn subsequently sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in the city. He also sent letters to Basra, but his messenger was handed over to the governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and killed. Ibn Aqil informed Husayn of the large-scale support he found in Kufa, signalling that the latter should enter the city. Yazid ordered Ibn Ziyad to move to Kufa and execute or imprison Ibn Aqil. Ibn Ziyad brutally suppressed the rebellion and killed Ibn Aqil. Encouraged by Ibn Aqil's letter, Husayn left for Kufa, ignoring warnings from Ibn Umar, Ibn al-Zubayr and Ibn Abbas that the Kufans could not be trusted. On the way to the city, he received the news of Ibn Aqil's death and that the Kufans had changed sides. Nonetheless, Husayn and his companions continued towards Kufa and Ibn Ziyad sent some 4,000 men to counter them. His troops forced them to camp in the desert of Karbala. In the ensuing hostilities on 10 October 680, Husayn and 72 of his male companions were killed, while Husayn's family were taken prisoner. This event caused widespread outcry among the Muslims and the image of Yazid suffered greatly. It also helped crystallize opposition to Yazid into an anti-Umayyad movement based on Alid aspirations, and contributed to the development of Shi'ite identity. =Revolt of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr= Ibn al-Zubayr started secretly taking oaths of allegiance in Mecca. Upon hearing of this, Yazid sent a silver chain to Ibn al-Zubayr with the intention of pacifying him, but it was refused. Yazid then sent a force led by Ibn al-Zubayr's own brother Amr, who was at odds with Ibn al-Zubayr, to arrest him. This force was defeated and Amr was killed. After Husayn's death at Karbala, Ibn al-Zubayr's influence reached Medina and Kufa. To counter the growing influence of Ibn al-Zubayr in Medina, Yazid invited notables of the city to Damascus and tried to win them over with gifts and presents. The notables were unpersuaded, and on their return to Medina narrated tales of his lavish lifestyle and practices considered by many to be impious, including drinking wine, hunting with hounds, and his love for music. The Medinese renounced their allegiance to Yazid upon hearing these details and expelled the governor and all Umayyads residing in the city. Yazid sent an army of 12,000 men under the command of Muslim ibn Uqba to reconquer Hejaz. By the end of August 683 Ibn Uqba approached Medina and gave the Medinese three days to reconsider, but was refused. When the ultimatum ended, a battle started in which the Medinese were defeated. After plundering the city for three days and forcing the rebels to renew their allegiance, the Syrian army headed for Mecca to subdue Ibn al- Zubayr. According to one account, the city was not plundered, only the leaders of the rebellion were executed. Ibn Uqba died on the way to Mecca and command passed to Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, who laid siege to Mecca in September 683. The siege lasted for several weeks, during which the Kaaba caught fire. Yazid's sudden death in November 683 ended the campaign and threw the caliphate into disarray and civil war. Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and Iraq and Egypt came under his rule. =Foreign campaigns= On the foreign front, Yazid discontinued Muawiya's policy of raids against the Byzantine Empire and focused on stabilizing his borders. Islands in the Sea of Marmara were abandoned. The Syrian district of Hims was split and the new district of Qinnasrin was formed. He reappointed Uqba ibn Nafi, whom Muawiya had deposed, as governor of Ifriqiya. In 681, Uqba launched a large-scale expedition into western Africa. Defeating the Berbers and the Byzantines, Uqba reached as far as the Atlantic coast and captured Tangier and Volubilis. Despite his successes, he was unable to establish a permanent hold on these territories. On his return eastward, he was ambushed and killed by a Berber-Byzantine force, resulting in the loss of the conquered territories. Death and succession Yazid died on 12 November 683 at Huwwarin, aged between 35 and 39. His son Muawiya II, whom he had nominated, became caliph. His control was limited to just some parts of Syria, however, and he died after a few months from an unknown illness. Some early sources state that Muawiya II abdicated before his death. In any case, Marwan ibn Hakam became caliph afterwards and the Sufyanid caliphate came to an end. According to Wellhausen, the story of abdication by Muawiya II is likely a Marwanid fabrication, since they had sidelined Sufyanids despite there being a pact that Yazid's second son Khalid will succeed Marwan. Supporters of the Sufyanids were unhappy about the development and thus arose the idea of Sufyani, a descendant of Abu Sufyan who would restore the Sufyanid power in Syria. Various Sufyani claimants arose after the fall of the Umayyads at the hand of the Abbasids. Legacy Yazid is considered an evil figure by many Muslims, especially by Shias. He was the first person in the history of the caliphate to be nominated as heir based on a blood relationship, and this became a tradition afterwards. He is considered a tyrant who was responsible for three major crimes during his caliphate: the death of Husayn ibn Ali and his followers at the Battle of Karbala, considered a massacre; the aftermath of the Battle of al-Harrah, in which the troops of Yazid's general, Muslim ibn Uqba, pillaged the town of Medina; and the burning of the Kaaba during the siege of Mecca, which was blamed on Yazid's commander Husayn ibn Numayr. Moreover, because of his habits of drinking, dancing and hunting, and keeping pet animals such as dogs and monkeys, he is considered to have been impious and unworthy of leading the Muslim community. Despite his reputation in religious circles, academic historians generally portray a more favourable view of Yazid. According to Wellhausen, Yazid was a mild ruler, who resorted to violence only when necessary, and was not the tyrant that religious tradition portrays him to be. Michael Jan de Goeje describes him as \\"a peace-loving, generous prince\\". According to G. R. Hawting, he tried to continue the diplomatic policies of his father. However, unlike Muawiya, he was not successful in winning over the opposition with gifts and bribes. In the view of Bernard Lewis, Yazid was a capable ruler but was overly criticized by later Arab historians. Extant Muslim histories describe Yazid as \\"a sinner in respect of his belly and his private parts\\", \\"an arrogant drunken sot\\", \\"motivated by defiance of God, lack of faith in His religion and hostility toward His Messenger,\\"Baladhuri (A), 9.291, (Futuh al-buldan, ed. M.J. de Goeje (Leiden, 1866)), and Tabari, (Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk ed. M.J. de Goeje, et al. (Leiden, 1879-1901)) 3.2173-75, cited in but these characterizations have been attributed to the hostility of the Abbasid dynasty, during whose rule the histories were written, toward the Umayyad caliphs, including Yazid. In contrast, a letter written by a Syrian in 741, before the fall of the Umayyads in 750 and about sixty years after Yazid's death, describes the Caliph as \\"a most pleasant man and deemed highly agreeable by all the peoples subject to his rule. He never, as is the wont of men, sought glory for himself because of his royal rank, but lived as a citizen along with all the common people\\".Chronicle of 741 ¬ß28 (trans. in Hoyland, Seeing Islam, Excursus B.) cited in Notes  Citations   General sources       External links * Category:646 births Category:683 deaths Category:7th-century Umayyad caliphs Category:People of the Second Fitna Category:Umayyad people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars ","title":"Yazid I"},{"id":"402595","text":"The Battle of Karbala () was fought on 10 October 680 (10 Muharram in the year 61 AH of the Islamic calendar) between the army of the second Umayyad caliph Yazid I and a small army led by Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, at Karbala, Iraq. Prior to his death, the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I had nominated his son Yazid as his successor. Yazid's nomination was contested by the sons of a few prominent companions of Muhammad, including Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali, and Abd Allah ibn Zubayr, son of Zubayr ibn al-Awam. Upon Muawiyah's death in 680 CE, Yazid demanded allegiance from Husayn and other dissidents. Husayn did not give allegiance and traveled to Mecca. The people of Kufa, an Iraqi garrison town and the center of Ali's caliphate, were averse to the Syria-based Umayyad caliphs and had a long- standing attachment to the house of Ali. They proposed Husayn overthrow the Umayyads. On Husayn's way to Kufa with a retinue of about 70 men, his caravan was intercepted by a 1,000-strong army of the caliph at some distance from Kufa. He was forced to head north and encamp in the plain of Karbala on 2 October, where a larger Umayyad army of 4,000 arrived soon afterwards. Negotiations failed after the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad refused Husayn safe passage without submitting to his authority, a condition declined by Husayn. The Battle of Karbala ensued on 10 October during which Husayn was killed along with most of his relatives and companions, while his surviving family members were taken prisoner. The battle was followed by the Second Fitna, during which the Iraqis organized two separate campaigns to avenge the death of Husayn; the first one by the Tawwabin and the other one by Mukhtar al-Thaqafi and his supporters. The Battle of Karbala galvanized the development of the pro-Alid party (Shi'at Ali) into a unique religious sect with its own rituals and collective memory. It has a central place in the Shi'a history, tradition, and theology, and has frequently been recounted in Shi'a literature. For the Shi'a, Husayn's suffering and death became a symbol of sacrifice in the struggle for right against wrong, and for justice and truth against injustice and falsehood. It also provides the members of the Shi'a faith with a catalog of heroic norms. The battle is commemorated during an annual ten-day period during the Islamic month of Muharram by Shi'a, culminating on tenth day of the month, known as the Day of Ashura. On this day, Shi'a Muslims mourn, hold public processions, organize religious gathering, beat their chests and in some cases self-flagellate. Sunni Muslims likewise regard the incident as a historical tragedy; Husayn and his companions are widely regarded as martyrs by both Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Political background After the third caliph Uthman's assassination by rebels in 656, the rebels and the townspeople of Medina declared Ali, a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, caliph. Some of Muhammad's companions including Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (then governor of Syria), and Muhammad's widow A'isha, refused to recognize Ali. They called for revenge against Uthman's killers and the election of a new caliph through shura (consultation). These events precipitated the First Fitna (First Muslim Civil War). When Ali was assassinated by Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam, a Kharijite, in 661, his eldest son Hasan succeeded him but soon signed a peace treaty with Mu'awiya to avoid further bloodshed. In the treaty, Hasan was to hand over power to Mu'awiya on the condition that Mu'awiya be a just ruler and that he would not establish a dynasty. After the death of Hasan in 670, his younger brother Husayn became the head of the Banu Hashim clan to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad also belonged. Though his father's supporters in Kufa gave him their allegiance, he would abide to the peace treaty between Hasan and Mu'awiya as long as the latter was alive. The Battle of Karbala occurred within the crisis resulting from the succession of Yazid I. In 676, Mu'awiya nominated his son Yazid as successor, a move labelled by the historian Wilferd Madelung as breach of the Hasan‚ÄìMuawiya treaty. With no precedence in Islamic history, hereditary succession aroused opposition from several quarters. Mu'awiya summoned a shura, or consultative assembly, in Damascus and persuaded representatives from many provinces to agree to his plan by diplomacy and bribes. He then ordered Marwan ibn al-Hakam, then the governor of Medina, where Husayn and several other influential Muslims resided, to announce the decision. Marwan faced resistance to this announcement, especially from Husayn, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, the sons of Muhammad's prominent companions, all of whom, by virtue of their descent, could also lay claim to the caliphal title. Mu'awiya went to Medina and pressed the four dissenters to accede. He followed and threatened some of them with death, but they still refused to support him. Nonetheless, Mu'awiya convinced the people of Mecca that the four had pledged their allegiance, and received allegiance from them for Yazid. On his return to Damascus, he secured allegiance from the people of Medina as well. There was no further overt protest against the plan for Yazid's succession. According to the historians Fitzpatrick and Walker, Yazid's succession, which was considered as an \\"anomaly in Islamic history\\", transformed the government from a \\"consultative\\" form to a monarchy. Before his death in April 680, Mu'awiya cautioned Yazid that Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr might challenge his rule and instructed him to defeat them if they did. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad. Prelude An Ottoman miniature depicting the opposing camps before the battle On his succession, Yazid charged the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, to secure allegiance from Husayn, Ibn al-Zubayr and Abd Allah ibn Umar, with force if necessary. Walid sought the advice of his Umayyad relative Marwan ibn al-Hakam, who suggested that Ibn al-Zubayr and Husayn should be forced to pledge allegiance as they were dangerous, while Ibn Umar should be left alone since he posed no threat. Walid summoned the two, but Ibn al-Zubayr escaped to Mecca. Husayn answered the summons but declined to pledge allegiance in the secretive environment of the meeting, suggesting it should be done in public. Marwan told Walid to imprison or behead him, but due to Husayn's kinship with Muhammad, Walid was unwilling to take any action against him. A few days later, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid. He arrived in Mecca at the beginning of May 680, and stayed there until the beginning of September. Husayn had considerable support in Kufa, which had been the caliphal capital during the reigns of his father and brother. The Kufans had fought the Umayyads and their Syrian allies during the First Fitna, the five-year civil war which had established the Umayyad Caliphate. They were dissatisfied with Hasan's abdication and strongly resented Umayyad rule. While in Mecca, Husayn received letters from pro-Alids in Kufa informing him that they were tired of the Umayyad rule, which they considered to be oppressive, and that they had no rightful leader. They asked him to lead them in revolt against Yazid, promising to remove the Umayyad governor if Husayn would consent to aid them. Husayn wrote back affirmatively that a rightful leader is the one who acts according to the Qur'an and promised to lead them with the right guidance. Then he sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in Kufa. Ibn Aqil attracted widespread support and informed Husayn of the situation, suggesting that he join them there. Yazid removed Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari as governor of Kufa due to his inaction, and installed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, then governor of Basra, in his place. As a result of Ibn Ziyad's suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil's following began to dissipate and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. It was defeated and Ibn Aqil was killed. Husayn had also sent a messenger to Basra, another garrison town in Iraq, but the messenger could not attract any following and was quickly apprehended and executed. Husayn was unaware of the change of political circumstances in Kufa and decided to depart. Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr advised him not to move to Iraq, or, if he was determined, not to take women and children with him. The sincerity of Ibn al- Zubayr's advice has been doubted by many historians, however, as he had his own plans for leadership and was supposedly happy to be rid of Husayn. Nevertheless, he offered Husayn support if he would stay in Mecca and lead the opposition to Yazid from there. Husayn refused this, citing his abhorrence of bloodshed in the sanctuary, and decided to go ahead with his plan. Journey towards Kufa Husayn left Mecca with some fifty men and his family on 9 September 680 (8 Dhu al-Hijjah 60 AH), a day before Hajj. He took the northerly route through the Arabian Desert. On persuasion of Husayn's cousin Abd Allah ibn Ja'far, the governor of Mecca Amr ibn Sa'id sent his brother and Ibn Ja'far after Husayn in order to assure him safety in Mecca and bring him back. Husayn refused to return, relating that Muhammad had ordered him in a dream to move forward irrespective of the consequences. At a place known as Tan'im, he seized a caravan carrying dyeing plants and clothes sent by the governor of Yemen to Yazid. Further on the way, at a place called Tha'labiyya, the small caravan received the news of the execution of Ibn Aqil and the indifference of the people of Kufa. Husayn at this point is reported to have considered turning back, but was persuaded to push forward by Ibn Aqil's brothers, who wanted to avenge his death; according to Madelung and I. K. A. Howard, these reports are doubtful. Later, at Zubala, Husayn learned of the capture and execution of his messenger Qays ibn Musahir al-Saydawi, whom he had sent from the Hejaz (western Arabia) to Kufa to announce his arrival. He informed his followers of the situation and asked them to leave. Most of the people who had joined him on the way left, while his companions from Mecca decided to stay with him. Ibn Ziyad had stationed troops on the routes into Kufa. Husayn and his followers were intercepted by the vanguard of Yazid's army, about 1,000 men led by Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi, south of Kufa near Qadisiyya. Husayn said to them: > I did not come to you until your letters were brought to me, and your > messengers came to me saying, 'Come to us, for we have no imam.' ... > Therefore, if you give me what you guaranteed in your covenants and sworn > testimonies, I will come to your town. If you will not and are averse to my > coming, I will leave you for the place from which I came to you. He then showed them the letters he had received from the Kufans, including some in Hurr's force. Hurr denied any knowledge of the letters and stated that Husayn must go with him to Ibn Ziyad, which Husayn refused to do. Hurr responded that he would not allow Husayn to either enter Kufa or go back to Medina, but that he was free to travel anywhere else he wished. Nevertheless, he did not prevent four Kufans from joining Husayn. Husayn's caravan started to move towards Qadisiyya, and Hurr followed them. At Naynawa, Hurr received orders from Ibn Ziyad to force Husayn's caravan to halt in a desolate place without fortifications or water. One of Husayn's companions suggested that they attack Hurr and move to the fortified village of al-Aqr. Husayn refused, stating that he did not want to start the hostilities. On 2 October 680 (2 Muharram 61 AH), Husayn arrived at Karbala, a desert plain north of Kufa, and set up camp. A shrine built at the location of Husayn's camp On the following day, a 4,000-strong Kufan army arrived under the command of Umar ibn Sa'd. He had been appointed governor of Rayy to suppress a local rebellion, but then recalled to confront Husayn. Initially, he was unwilling to fight Husayn, but complied following Ibn Ziyad's threat to revoke his governorship. After negotiations with Husayn, Ibn Sa'd wrote to Ibn Ziyad that Husayn was willing to return. Ibn Ziyad replied that Husayn must surrender or he should be subdued by force, and that to compel him, he and his companions should be denied access to the Euphrates river. Ibn Sa'd stationed 500 horsemen on the route leading to the river. Husayn and his companions remained without water for three days before a group of fifty men led by his half-brother Abbas was able to access the river. They could only fill twenty water-skins. Tropenmuseum Amsterdam Husayn and Ibn Sa'd met during the night to negotiate a settlement; it was rumored that Husayn made three proposals: either he be allowed to return to Medina, submit to Yazid directly, or be sent to a border post where he would fight alongside the Muslim armies. According to Madelung, these reports are probably untrue as Husayn at this stage is unlikely to have considered submitting to Yazid. A mawla of Husayn's wife later claimed that Husayn had suggested that he be allowed to leave, so that all parties could allow the fluid political situation to clarify. Ibn Sa'd sent the proposal, whatever it was, to Ibn Ziyad, who is reported to have accepted but then persuaded otherwise by Shemr ibn Ziljawshan. Shemr argued that Husayn was in his domain and letting him go would be to demonstrate weakness. Ibn Ziyad then sent Shemr with orders to ask Husayn for his allegiance once more and to attack, kill and disfigure him if he was to refuse, as \\"a rebel, a seditious person, a brigand, an oppressor and he was to do no further harm after his death\\". If Ibn Sa'd was unwilling to carry out the attack, he was instructed to hand over command to Shemr. Ibn Sa'd cursed Shemr and accused him of foiling his attempts to reach a peaceful settlement but agreed to carry out the orders. He remarked that Husayn would not submit because there was \\"a proud soul in him\\". The army advanced toward Husayn's camp on the evening of 9 October. Husayn sent Abbas to ask Ibn Sa'd to wait until the next morning, so that they could consider the matter. Ibn Sa'd agreed to this respite. Husayn told his men that they were all free to leave, with his family, under the cover of night, since their opponents only wanted him. Very few availed themselves of this opportunity. Defense arrangements were made: tents were brought together and tied to one another and a ditch was dug behind the tents and filled with wood ready to be set alight in case of attack. Husayn and his followers then spent the rest of the night praying. Battle After the morning prayer on 10 October, both parties took up battle positions. Husayn appointed Zuhayr ibn Qayn to command the right flank of his army, Habib ibn Muzahir to command the left flank, and his half-brother Abbas as the standard bearer. Husayn's companions, according to most accounts, numbered thirty-two horsemen and forty infantrymen; although forty-five horsemen and one hundred foot-soldiers, or a total of a few hundred men have been reported by some sources. The ditch containing wood were set alight. Husayn then delivered a speech to his opponents reminding them of his status as Muhammad's grandson and reproaching them for inviting and then abandoning him. He asked to be allowed to leave. He was told that first he had to submit to Yazid's authority, which he refused to do. Husayn's speech moved Hurr to defect to his side. The Battle of Karbala After Husayn's speech, Zuhayr ibn Qayn attempted to dissuade Ibn Sa'd's soldiers from killing Husayn, but in vain. Ibn Sa'd's army fired several volleys of arrows. This was followed by duels in which several of Husayn's companions were slain. The right wing of the Kufans, led by Amr ibn al-Hajjaj, attacked Husayn's force, but was repulsed. Hand-to-hand fighting paused and further volleys of arrows were exchanged. Shemr, who commanded the left wing of the Umayyad army, launched an attack, but after losses on both sides he was repulsed. This was followed by cavalry attacks. Husayn's cavalry resisted fiercely and Ibn Sa'd brought in armoured cavalry and five hundred archers. After their horses were wounded by arrows, Husayn's cavalrymen dismounted and fought on foot. Since Umayyad forces could approach Husayn's army from the front only, Ibn Sa'd ordered the tents to be burned. All except the one which Husayn and his family were using were set on fire. Shemr wanted to burn that one too, but was prevented by his companions. The plan backfired and flames hindered the Umayyad advance for a while. After noon prayers, Husayn's companions were encircled, and almost all of them were killed. Husayn's relatives, who had not taken part in the fighting so far, joined the battle. Husayn's son Ali Akbar was killed; then Husayn's half- brothers, including Abbas, and the sons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib, Jafar ibn Abi Talib and Hasan ibn Ali were slain. The account of Abbas' death is not given in the primary sources, al-Tabari and Baladhuri, but a prominent Shi'a theologian Shaykh Al-Mufid states in his account in Kitab al-Irshad that Abbas went to the river together with Husayn but became separated, was surrounded, and killed. At some point, a young child of Husayn's, who was sitting on his lap, was hit by an arrow and died. The al-Abbas Mosque in Karbala = Death of Husayn ibn Ali = Shrine to those killed at the battle The Umayyad soldiers hesitated to attack Husayn directly, but he was struck in the mouth by an arrow as he went to the river to drink. He collected his blood in a cupped hand and cast towards the sky, complaining to God of his suffering. Later, he was surrounded and struck on the head by Malik ibn Nusayr. The blow cut through his hooded cloak, which Husayn removed while cursing his attacker. He put a cap on his head and wrapped a turban around it to staunch the bleeding. Ibn Nusayr seized the bloodied cloak and retreated. Shemr advanced with a group of foot soldiers towards Husayn, who was now prepared to fight as few people were left on his side. A young boy from Husayn's camp escaped from the tents, ran to him, tried to defend him from a sword stroke and had his arm cut off. Ibn Sa'd approached the tents and Husayn's sister Zaynab complained to him: \\"'Umar b. Sa'd, will Abu 'Abd Allah (the kunya of Husayn) be killed while you stand and watch?\\" Ibn Sa'd wept but did nothing. Husayn is said to have killed many of his attackers. They were, however, still unwilling to kill him and each of them wanted to leave this to somebody else. Eventually Shemr shouted: \\"Shame on you! Why are you waiting for the man? Kill him, may your mothers be deprived of you!\\" The Umayyad soldiers then rushed Husayn and wounded him on his hand and shoulder. He fell on the ground face-down and an attacker named Sinan ibn Anas stabbed and then decapitated him. The place from which Zaynab bint Ali viewed the battle Aftermath Seventy or seventy-two people died on Husayn's side, of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali. This included two of Husayn's sons, six of his paternal brothers, three sons of Hasan ibn Ali, three sons of Jafar ibn Abi Talib and three sons and three grandsons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib. Following the battle, Husayn's clothes were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken. The women's jewelry and cloaks were also seized. Shemr wanted to kill Husayn's only surviving son Ali Zayn al-Abidin, who had not taken part in the fighting because of illness, but was prevented by Ibn Sa'd. There are reports of more than sixty wounds on Husayn's body, which was then trampled with horses as previously instructed by Ibn Ziyad. The bodies of Husayn's companions were decapitated. There were eighty-eight dead in Ibn Sa'd's army, who were buried before he left. After his departure, members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried the headless bodies of Husayn's companions. Husayn's family, along with the heads of the dead, were sent to Ibn Ziyad. He poked Husayn's mouth with a stick and intended to kill Ali Zayn al-Abidin, but spared him after the pleas of Husayn's sister Zaynab. The heads and the family were then sent to Yazid, who also poked Husayn's mouth with a stick. The historian Henri Lammens has suggested that this is a duplication of the report regarding Ibn Ziyad. Yazid was compassionate towards the women and Ali Zayn al-Abidin, and cursed Ibn Ziyad for murdering Husayn, stating that had he been there, he would have spared him. One of his courtiers asked for the hand of a captive woman from Husayn's family in marriage, which resulted in heated altercation between Yazid and Zaynab. The women of Yazid's household joined the captive women in their lamentation for the dead. After a few days, the women were compensated for their belongings looted in Karbala and were sent back to Medina. husayniyya, Kermanshah, Iran, depicting Ali Zayn al-Abidin, Zaynab and other prisoners being taken to Yazid's court =Later uprisings= The Battle of Karbala and Husayn's death signaled the start of the Second Fitna against the Umayyads. Ibn al-Zubayr's revolt Following Husayn's death, Yazid faced increased opposition to his rule from Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn al-Zubayr started secretly recruiting supporters in Mecca, while overtly calling for a shura to elect a new caliph. Ibn al- Zuabyr's influence reached Medina, where citizens were already disillusioned with Umayyad rule and Mu'awiya's agricultural projects, which included confiscating lands from them to increase the government's revenue. Yazid invited the notables of Medina to Damascus and tried to win them over with gifts. They were unpersuaded and on their return to Medina narrated tales of Yazid's lavish lifestyle and impious practices. The Medinese, under the leadership of Abd Allah ibn Hanzala, the son of a leading companion of Muhammad, renounced their allegiance to Yazid and expelled the governor and the Umayyads residing in the city. Yazid sent a 12,000-strong army under the veteran commander Muslim ibn Uqba to reconquer the Hejaz. After failed negotiations, the Medinese were defeated at the Battle of al-Harrah, and the city was plundered for three days. Having forced the rebels to renew their allegiance, the Syrian army besieged Mecca. After Yazid's death in November 683, the army withdrew to Syria and Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph, receiving widespread recognition throughout the caliphate. Nevertheless, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, his erstwhile ally, took over Kufa and most of Iraq from Ibn al-Zubayr's governor, and Kharijites in Basra, Persia and Arabia weakened his authority. Although the Zubayrids defeated Mukhtar, the forces of Abd al- Malik ibn Marwan, who became the Umayyad caliph in Syria in 685, defeated and killed Ibn al-Zubayr in 692. The latter's defeat marked the reestablishment Umayyad rule over the caliphate. Tawwabin uprising A few prominent Alid supporters in Kufa felt guilty for abandoning Husayn after having invited him to revolt. To atone for what they perceived as their sin, they began a movement known as the Tawwabin, under Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad, to fight the Umayyads. As long as Iraq was in Umayyad hands, the movement remained underground. After the death of Yazid in November 683, the people of Iraq drove out the Umayyad governor Ibn Ziyad; The Tawwabin called on the people to avenge Husayn's death, attracting large-scale support. Lacking any political program, they intended to punish the Umayyads or sacrifice themselves in the struggle. Their slogan was \\"Revenge for Husayn\\". Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, another prominent pro-Alid of Kufa, attempted to dissuade the Tawwabin from this endeavor in favor of an organized movement to take control of the city, but Ibn Surad's stature as a companion of Muhammad and an old ally of Ali, prevented most of his followers from accepting Mukhtar's proposal. Although 16,000 men enlisted to fight, only 4,000 mustered. In November 684, the Tawwabin left to confront the Umayyads, after mourning for a day at Husayn's grave in Karbala. The armies met in January 685 at the three- day Battle of Ayn al-Warda in present-day northern Syria; most of the Tawwabin, including Ibn Surad, were killed. A few escaped to Kufa and joined Mukhtar. Revolt of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi Mukhtar was an early settler of Kufa, having arrived in Iraq following its initial conquest by the Muslims. He had participated in the failed rebellion of Muslim ibn Aqil, for which he was imprisoned by Ibn Ziyad, before being released after the intervention of Abd Allah ibn Umar. Mukhtar then went to Mecca and had a short-lived alliance with Ibn al-Zubayr. After Yazid's death, he returned to Kufa where he advocated revenge against Husayn's killers and the establishment of an Alid caliphate in the name of Husayn's half-brother Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, and declared himself his representative. The defeat of the Tawwabin left the leadership of the Kufan pro-Alids in his hands. In October 685, Mukhtar and his supporters, a significant of number of whom consisted of local converts (mawali), overthrew Ibn al-Zubayr's governor and seized Kufa. His control extended to most of Iraq and parts of northwestern Iran. His attitude towards mawali, whom he awarded many favors and equal status with Arabs, provoked a rebellion by the dissatisfied Arab aristocracy. After crushing the rebellion, Mukhtar executed Kufans involved in the killing of Husayn, including Ibn Sa'd and Shemr, while thousands of people fled to Basra. He then sent his general Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to fight an approaching Umayyad army, led by Ibn Ziyad, which had been sent to reconquer the province. The Umayyad army was routed at the Battle of Khazir in August 686 and Ibn Ziyad was slain. Meanwhile, Mukhtar's relations with Ibn al-Zubayr worsened and Kufan refugees in Basra persuaded Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, the governor of the city and younger brother of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, to attack Kufa. Facing defeat in open battle, Mukhtar and his remaining supporters took refuge in the palace of Kufa and were besieged by Mus'ab. Four months later, in April 687, Mukhtar was killed while some 6,000‚Äì8,000 of his supporters were executed. According to Mohsen Zakeri, Mukhtar's attitude towards mawali was one of the reasons behind his failure, as Kufa was not ready for such \\"revolutionary measures\\". Mukhtar's supporters survived the collapse of his revolution and evolved into a sect known as the Kaysanites. The Hashimiyya, a splinter group of the Kaysanites, was later taken over by the Abbasids and eventually overthrew the Umayyads in 750. Primary and classic sources The primary source of the Karbala narrative is the work of the Kufan historian Abu Mikhnaf titled Kitab Maqtal Al-Husayn. Other early monographs on the death of Husayn, which have not survived, were written by al-Asbagh al-Nubata, Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju'fi, Ammar ibn Mu'awiya al-Duhni, Awana ibn al-Hakam, al-Waqidi, Hisham ibn al-Kalbi, Nasr ibn Muzahim, and al-Mada'ini; of these al-Nubta's monograph was perhaps the earliest. Although Abu Mikhnaf's date of birth is unknown, he was an adult by the time of the revolt of Ibn al-Ash'ath, which occurred in 701, some twenty years after the Battle of Karbala. As such he knew many eyewitnesses and collected firsthand accounts and some with very short chains of transmitters, usually one or two intermediaries. The eyewitnesses were of two kinds: those from Husayn's side; and those from Ibn Sa'd's army. Since few people from Husayn's camp survived, most eyewitnesses were from the second category. According to Julius Wellhausen, most of them regretted their actions in the battle and embellished the accounts of the battle in favor of Husayn in order to dilute their guilt. Although as an Iraqi, Abu Mikhnaf had pro-Alid tendencies, his reports generally do not contain much bias on his part. Abu Mikhnaf's original text seems to have been lost and the version extant today has been transmitted through secondary sources such as the History of Prophets and Kings, also known as The History of Tabari, by Mu·∏•ammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari; and Ansab al-Ashraf by Ahmad ibn Ya·∏•ya al-Baladhuri. Nevertheless, four manuscripts of a Maqtal located at Gotha (No. 1836), Berlin (Sprenger, Nos. 159‚Äì160), Leiden (No. 792), and Saint Petersburg (Am No. 78) libraries have been attributed to Abu Mikhnaf. Tabari quotes either directly from Abu Mikhnaf or from his student Ibn al-Kalbi, who took most of his material from Abu Mikhnaf. Tabari occasionally takes material from Ammar ibn Mu'awiya, Awana and other primary sources, which, however, adds little to the narrative. Baladhuri uses same sources as Tabari. Information on the battle found in the works of Dinawari and Ya'qubi is also based on Abu Mikhnaf's Maqtal, although they occasionally provide some extra notes and verses. Other secondary sources include al-Mas'udi's Muruj al-Dhahab, Ibn Ath'am's Kitab al-Futuh, Shaykh al- Mufid's Kitab al-Irshad, and Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani's Maqatil al-Talibiyyin. Most of these sources took material from Abu Mikhnaf, in addition to some from the primary works of Awana, al-Mada'ini and Nasr ibn Muzahim. Although Tabari and other early sources contain some miraculous stories, these sources are mainly historical and rational in nature, in contrast to the literature of later periods, which is mainly hagiographical in nature. The Battle of Karbala was also reported by an early Christian source. A history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785, is partially preserved in a number of extant Christian chronicles, including those by Michael the Syrian and the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. Theophilus's history corroborates the death in battle of Husayn and most of his men at Karbala after suffering from thirst. But in contrast to all Muslim sources, which state that Husayn fought Yazid, Theophilus appears to have written that Husayn was killed by Muawiyah as the final engagement of the First Fitna between the Umayyads and Ali's supporters. Historical Analysis Based on an official report sent to caliph Yazid, which describes the battle very briefly, stating that it lasted for no longer than a siesta, Lammens concludes that there was no battle at all but a quick massacre that was over in an hour; he suggests that the detailed accounts found in the primary sources are Iraqi fabrications, since their writers were dissatisfied with their hero being killed without putting up a fight. This is countered by the historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who argues that despite there being some fabricated accounts, all of the contemporary accounts together form \\"a coherent and credible narrative\\". She criticizes Lammens' hypothesis as being based on a single isolated report and being devoid of critical analysis. Similarly, Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account of the battle is reliable. Vaglieri and Madelung explain the length of the battle despite the numerical disparity between the opposing camps as Ibn Sa'd's attempt to prolong the fight and pressure Husayn into submission instead of attempting to quickly overwhelm and kill him. According to Wellhausen, the compassion that Yazid showed to the family of Husayn, and his cursing of Ibn Ziyad was only for show. He argues that if killing Husayn was a crime its responsibility lay with Yazid and not Ibn Ziyad, who was only performing his duty. Madelung holds a similar view; according to him, early accounts place the responsibility for Husayn's death on Ibn Ziyad, not Yazid. Yazid, Madelung argues, wanted to end Husayn's opposition, but as a caliph of Islam could not afford to be seen as publicly responsible and so diverted blame onto Ibn Ziyad by hypocritically cursing him. =Modern historical views on motivations of Husayn= Wellhausen has described Husayn's revolt as a premature and ill-prepared campaign by an ambitious person. He writes \\"He reaches out to the moon like a child. He makes the greatest demands and does not do the slightest; the others should do everything... As soon as he encounters resistance, it is over with him; he wants to go back when it is too late.\\" Lammens has agreed to this view and he sees in Husayn a person who disturbs public peace. According to Heinz Halm, this was a struggle for political leadership between the second generation of Muslims. Fred Donner, G. R. Hawting, and Hugh N. Kennedy see Husayn's revolt as an attempt to regain what his brother Hasan had renounced. Vaglieri, on the other hand, considers him to be motivated by ideology, saying that if the materials that have come down to us are authentic, they convey an image of person who is \\"convinced that he was in the right, stubbornly determined to achieve his ends...\\" Holding a similar view, Madelung has argued that Husayn was not a \\"reckless rebel\\" but a religious man motivated by pious convictions. According to him, Husayn was convinced that \\"the family of the Prophet was divinely chosen to lead the community founded by Mo·∏•ammad, as the latter had been chosen, and had both an inalienable right and an obligation to seek this leadership.\\" He was, however, not seeking martyrdom and wanted to return when his expected support did not materialize. Maria Dakake holds that Husayn considered the Umayyad rule oppressive and misguided, and revolted to reorient the Islamic community in the right direction. S. M. Jafri proposes that Husayn, although motivated by ideology, did not intend to secure leadership for himself. Husayn, Jafri asserts, was from the start aiming for martyrdom in order to jolt the collective conscience of the Muslim community and reveal what he considers to be the oppressive and anti-Islamic nature of the Umayyad regime. Impact The Imam Husayn Shrine during Arba'een The killing of the grandson of Muhammad shocked the Muslim community. The image of Yazid suffered and gave rise to sentiment that he was impious. The event has had an emotional impact on Sunnis, who remember the event as a tragic incident and those killed in the company of Husayn as martyrs. The impact on Shi'a Islam has been much deeper. =Shi'a Islam= Prior to the Battle of Karbala, the Muslim community was divided into two political factions. Nonetheless, a religious sect with distinct theological doctrines and specific set of rituals had not developed. Karbala gave this early political party of pro-Alids a distinct religious identity and helped transform it into a distinct religious sect. Heinz Halm writes: \\"There was no religious aspect to Shi'ism prior to 680. The death of the third imam and his followers marked the 'big bang' that created the rapidly expanding cosmos of Shi'ism and brought it into motion.\\" Ritual of chest beating Husayn's death at Karbala is believed by Shi'as to be a sacrifice made to prevent the corruption of Islam by tyrannical rulers and to protect its ideology. He is, as such, believed to have been fully aware of his fate and the outcome of his revolt, which was divinely ordained. He is thus remembered as the prince of martyrs (Sayyed al-Shuhada). The historian G. R. Hawting describes the Battle of Karbala as a \\"supreme\\" example of \\"suffering and martyrdom\\" for Shi'as. According to Abdulaziz Sachedina, it is seen by Shi'as the climax of suffering and oppression, revenge for which came to be one of the primary goals of many Shi'a uprisings. This revenge is believed to be one of the fundamental objectives of the future revolution of the twelfth Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, whose return is awaited. With his return, Husayn and his seventy-two companions are expected to be resurrected along with their killers, who will then be punished. Shi'a observances Shi'a Muslims consider pilgrimages to Husayn's tomb to be a source of divine blessings and rewards. According to Shi'a tradition the first such visit was performed by Husayn's son Ali Zayn al-Abidin and the surviving family members during their return from Syria to Medina. The first historically recorded visit is Sulayman ibn Surad and the Penitents going to Husayn's grave before their departure to Syria. They are reported to have lamented and beaten their chests and to have spent a night by the tomb. Thereafter this tradition was limited to the Shi'a imams for several decades, before gaining momentum under the sixth Shi'a imam Jafar Sadiq and his followers. Buyids and Safavids also encouraged this practice. Special visits are paid on 10 Muharram (Ashura Pilgrimage) and 40 days after the anniversary of Husayn's (Arba'een Pilgrimage). The soil of Karbala is considered to have miraculous healing effects. husayniyya Mourning for Husayn is considered by Shi'as to be a source of salvation in the afterlife, and is undertaken as a remembrance of his suffering. After the death of Husayn, when his family was being taken to Ibn Ziyad, Husayn's sister Zaynab is reported to have cried out after seeing his headless body: \\"O Muhammad!... Here is Husayn in the open, stained with blood and with limbs torn off. O Muhammad! Your daughters are prisoners, your progeny are killed, and the east wind blows dust over them.\\" Shi'a Muslims consider this to be the first instance of wailing and mourning over the death of Husayn. Husayn's son Zayn al-Abideen is reported to have spent the rest of his life weeping for his father. Similarly, Husayn's mother Fatima is believed to be weeping for him in paradise and the weeping of believers is considered to be a way of sharing her sorrows. Special gatherings (majalis; sing. majlis) are arranged in places reserved for this purpose, called husayniyya. In these gatherings the story of Karbala is narrated and various elegies (rawda) are recited by professional reciters (rawda khwan). A zuljenah in a Muaharram procession During the month of Muharram, elaborate public processions are performed in commemoration of the Battle of Karbala. In contrast to pilgrimage to Husayn's tomb and simple lamenting, these processions do not date back to the time of the battle, but arose during tenth century. Their earliest recorded instance was in Baghdad in 963 during the reign of the first Buyid ruler Mu'izz al-Dawla. The processions start from a husayniyya and the participants parade barefoot through the streets, wailing and beating their chests and heads before returning to the husyaniyya for a majlis. Sometimes, chains and knives are used to inflict wounds and physical pain. In South Asia, an ornately tacked horse called zuljenah, representing Husayn's battle horse, is also led riderless through the streets. In Iran, the battle scenes of Karbala are performed on stage in front of an audience in a ritual called taziya (passion play), also known as shabih. In India however, taziya refers to the coffins and replicas of Husayn's tomb carried in processions. Most of these rituals take place during the first ten days of Muharram, reaching a climax on the tenth day, although majalis can also occur throughout the year. Occasionally, especially in the past, some Sunni participation in majalis and processions has been observed. According to Yitzhak Nakash, the rituals of Muharram have an \\"important\\" effect in the \\"invoking the memory of Karbala\\", as these help consolidate the collective identity and memory of the Shi'a community. Anthropologist Michael Fischer states that commemoration of the Battle of Karbala by the Shi'a is not only the retelling of the story, but also presents them with \\"life models and norms of behavior\\" which are applicable to all aspects of life, which he calls the Karbala Paradigm. According to Olmo G√∂lz, the Karbala Paradigm provide Shi'as with heroic norms and a martyr ethos, and represents an embodiment of the battle between good and evil, justice and injustice. Rituals involving self-flagellation have been criticized by many Shia scholars as they are considered to be innovative practices damaging reputation of Shi'ism. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned the practice in Iran since 1994. =Politics= The first political use of the death of Husayn seems to have been during the revolt of Mukhtar, when he seized Kufa under the slogan of \\"Revenge for Husayn\\". Although the Penitents had used the same slogan, they do not seem have had a political program. In order to enhance their legitimacy, Abbasid rulers claimed to have avenged the death of Husayn by dethroning the Umayyads. During the early years of their rule, they also encouraged Muharram rituals. Buyids, a Shi'a dynasty originally from Iran which later occupied the Abbasid capital Baghdad while accepting the Abbasid caliph's suzerainty, promoted the public rituals of Muharram to portray themselves as patrons of religion and to strengthen the Shi'a identity in Iraq. After taking over Iran in 1501, Safavids, who were previously a Sufi order, declared the state religion to be Twelver Shi'ism. In this regard, Karbala and Muharram rituals came to be a vehicle of Safavid propaganda and a means of consolidating the dynasty's Shi'a identity. Riza Yildirim has claimed that the impetus of the Safvid revolution was the revenge of the death of Husayn. The founder of the dynasty, Shah Ismail, considered himself to be the Mahdi (the twelfth Shi'a Imam) or his forerunner. Similarly, Qajars also patronized Muharram rituals such as processions, taziya and majalis, to improve the relationship between the state and the public. Iranian revolution Karbala and Shi'a symbolism played a significant role in the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In contrast to the traditional view of Shi'ism as a religion of suffering, mourning and political quietism, Shi'a Islam and Karbala were given a new interpretation in the period preceding the revolution by rationalist intellectuals and religious revisionists like Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, Ali Shariati and Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi. According to these, Shi'ism was an ideology of revolution and political struggle against tyranny and exploitation, and the Battle of Karbala and the death of Husayn was to be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle; weeping and mourning was to be replaced by political activism to realize the ideals of Husayn. After the White Revolution reforms of the Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which were opposed by the Iranian clergy and others, Ruhollah Khomeini labelled the Shah as the Yazid of his time. Condemning the Iranian monarchy, Khomeini wrote: \\"The struggle of al-Husayn at Karbal√¢ is interpreted in the same way as a struggle against the non-Islamic principle of monarchy.\\" Opposition to the Shah was thus compared with the opposition of Husayn to Yazid, and Muharram ritual gatherings became increasingly political in nature. According to Aghaie, the Shah's hostility towards various Muharram rituals, which he considered to be uncivilized, contributed to his fall. The Islamic republic that was established after the revolution has since promoted Muharram rituals. The clerics encourage public participation in elections as a form of \\"political activism\\" comparable to that of Husayn. Martyrdom spirit influenced by the death of Husayn was frequently witnessed in Iranian troops during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war. =Literature= Cameleer telling people about the events he witnessed at Karbala Mir Mosharraf Hossain's 19th century novel on Karbala, Bishad Sindhu (the Ocean of Sorrow), established the precedent of the Islamic epic in Bangali literature. South Asian philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal sees Husayn's sacrifice as being similar to that of Ishmael and compares Yazid's opposition to Husayn with the opposition of Pharaoh to Moses. Urdu poet Ghalib compares Husayn's suffering with that of Mansur al-Hallaj, a tenth century Sufi, who was executed on a charge of claiming divinity. Maqtal literature and legendary accounts Maqtal (pl. Maqatil) works narrate the story of someone's death. Although Maqatil on the deaths of Ali, Uthman and various others have been written, the Maqtal genre has focused mainly on the story of Husyan's death. As well as Abu Mikhnaf's Maqtal, other Arabic Maqatil on Husayn were written. Most of these mix history with legend and have elaborate details on Husayn's miraculous birth, which is stated to be on 10 Muharram, coinciding with his date of death. The universe as well as humanity are described as having been created on the day of Ashura (10 Muharram). Ashura is also asserted to have been the day of both Abraham's and Muhammad's birth and of the ascension of Jesus to heaven, and of numerous other events concerning prophets. Husayn is claimed to have performed various miracles, including quenching his companions' thirst by putting his thumb in their mouths and satisfying their hunger by bringing down food from the heavens, and to have killed several thousand Umayyad attackers. Other accounts claim that when Husayn died, his horse shed tears and killed many Umayyad soldiers; the sky became red and it rained blood; angels, jinns and wild animals wept; that light emanated from Husayn's severed head and that it recited the Qur'an; and that all of his killers met calamitous end. Maqtal later entered Persian, Turkish, and Urdu literature, and inspired the development of rawda. Marthiya and rawda When Shi'ism became the official religion of Iran in the 16th century, Safavid rulers such as Shah Tahmasp I, patronized poets who wrote about the Battle of Karbala. The genre of marthiya (poems in the memory of the dead, with popular forms of Karbala related marthiya being rawda and nawha), according to Persian scholar Wheeler Thackston, \\"was particularly cultivated by the Safavids.\\" Various Persian authors wrote texts retelling romanticized and synthesized versions of the battle and events from it, including Sa'id al-Din's Rawdat al-Islam (The Garden of Islam) and Al- Khawarazmi's Maqtal nur 'al-'a'emmah (The Site of the Murder of the Light of the Imams). These influenced the composition of the more popular text Rawdat al-Shuhada (Garden of Martyrs), which was written in 1502 by Husain Wa'iz Kashefi. Kashefi's composition was an effective factor in the development of rawda khwani, a ritual recounting of the battle events in majalis. Inspired by Rawdat al-Shuhada, the Azerbaijani poet Fuz√ªl√Æ wrote an abridged and simplified version of it in Ottoman Turkish in his work Hadiqat al-Su'ada. It influenced similar works in Albanian on the subject. Dalip Frash√´ri's Kopshti i te Mirevet is the earliest, and longest epic so far, written in the Albanian language; the Battle of Karbala is described in detail and Frash√´ri eulogizes those who fell as martyrs, in particular Husayn. Urdu marthiya is predominantly religious in nature and usually concentrates on lamenting the Battle of Karbala. South Indian rulers of Bijapur (Ali Adil Shah), and Golkonda Sultanate (Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah) were patrons of poetry and encouraged Urdu marthiya recitation in Muharram. Urdu marthiya afterwards became popular throughout India. Famous Urdu poets Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Rafi Sauda, Mir Anees, and Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer have also composed marthiya. Comparing Karl Marx with Husayn, Josh Malihabadi argues that Karbala is not a story of the past to be recounted by the religious clerics in majalis, but should be seen as a model for revolutionary struggle towards the goal of a classless society and economic justice. Sufi poetry In Sufism, where annihilation of the self (nafs) and suffering in the path of God are paramount principles, Husayn is seen as a model Sufi. Persian Sufi poet Hakim Sanai describes Husayn as a martyr, higher in rank than all the other martyrs of the world; while Farid ud-Din Attar considers him a prototype of a Sufi who sacrificed himself in the love of God. Jalal ud-Din Rumi describes Husayn's suffering at Karbala as a means to achieve union with the divine, and hence considers it to be a matter of jubilation rather than grief. Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai devoted a section in his Shah Jo Risalo to the death of Husayn, in which the incident is remembered in laments and elegies. He too sees Husayn's death as a sacrifice made in the path of God, and condemns Yazid as being bereft of divine love. Turkish Sufi Yunus Emre labels Husayn, along with his brother Hasan, as the \\"fountain head of the martyrs\\" and \\"Kings of the Paradise\\" in his songs.

Originally established in 1870, the reservation is home to approximately 1,100 members of the federally recognized Fort Mojave Indian Tribe of Arizona, California, and Nevada, a federally recognized tribe of Mohave people. Native Americans occupy less than 50 percent of the Mojave reservation. The Mohave people have leased much of their land to cotton, corn, and soybean farming companies, which employ a large population of resident European-Americans and Mexican Americans.Fort Mojave Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, Arizona/California/Nevada United States Census Bureau The site of the former Fort Mohave, used from 1890 to the 1930s as a boarding school, and the eastern terminus of the Mojave Road are situated within the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. History These lands were occupied for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Indigenous peoples. The property covers areas along the Colorado River of the three adjacent states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. It also is sporadically traversed by the Mojave River in California. The Fort Mohave Indian Reservation was established in 1870, more than a decade after the US Army defeated the Mohave people. In 1890 Fort Mohave, located within reservation boundaries, was transferred by the War Department to the Office of Indian Affairs. For decades until the early 1930s, it operated an Indian boarding school for Native American students from the Mohave and other tribes, as part of efforts to assimilate youth to the mainstream culture. They were forced to speak English and practice Christianity while at the school. The property was transferred to the reservation in 1935. It has allowed the buildings to deteriorate, as they were symbolic of a painful period in relations with the US. In 1929 archeologist Arthur Woodward of the Los Angeles Exposition Museum visited a ranch near Victorville, California. Located near the Mojave River, it was bought by Robert Turner in 1883. Woodward found pottery similar to that of indigenous \\"lost cities\\" in Nevada, as well as ancient Indian graves, judging them to be thousands of years old. In 1940 descendant farmer Frank Turner found the Indian graves again during plowing of farmland, not aware of the earlier find. Two deputies called in to see the remains thought the bodies might have been of pioneers. Later assessment confirms they were likely ancient Native Americans, as they were buried in a ritual manner reported in oral tradition. > According to Frank, the bodies were in a crouching or kneeling position, all > facing the [Mohave] river, and all had beads around their necks. There were > 26 or 27 bodies altogether, but five or six were in better condition than > the others. The remains had been cremated, and buried in the graves with > them were large rocks...The listing for coordinates is . In 1950 a journalist reported this burial practice as typical of indigenous peoples preceding the Paiute and Shoshone. Economy The Mojave have leased considerable amounts of reservation land to agricultural companies for cultivation of commodity crops: soybeans, corn, and alfalfa. Many White and Mexican American workers live here, and less than 50% of the reservation is occupied by Mohave and other Native Americans. From 1995 the tribe operates the Avi Resort & Casino in Nevada.Avi Resort & Casino On October 20, 2003, the reservation government announced an agreement between the reservation and California Governor Gray Davis to allow the operation of a casino west of Needles, California (directly across the Colorado River from the Tribe's Arizona Reservation Lands).

The House of Saud extended its rule beyond Najd and into the Hijaz which culminated with the capture of Medina in April 1804 and Mecca in 1805. Saud's reign was a period of religious cleansing in Arabia. During his reign, attacks on shrines in Iraq continued. The new Saudis transformed the Kaaba in Mecca and destroyed the tombs of numerous religious figures in Medina in accordance with Wahhabi theology. This religious transformation did not sit well with other Muslims, and many other Muslims found the actions to be extreme, and were stunned that the holy cities had been taken so easily. The Ottoman Empire did not want to relent control over the cities to local tribesmen. The Ottomans could not retake the cities on their own though as the bulk of their forces were tied up in Europe. Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt, was assigned to recapture the Arabian territories. One of his sons, commanding the Egyptian troops, succeeded in re-conquering Hijaz in 1812.

He was the last ruler of the First Saudi State and was executed in Constantinople under the Ottoman Empire. Although the Ottomans maintained several garrisons in the Najd thereafter, they were unable to prevent the rise of the Emirate of Nejd (the Second Saudi State) led by Turki bin Abdallah bin Muhammad bin Saud. Fall of the First Saudi State Abdullah succeeded his father - Saud. At the beginning of his reign Abdullah faced intrafamily challenges from his uncle Abdullah bin Muhammad, but Abdullah managed to settle down these problems. His father, Saud, had initiated a war with the Ottoman Empire with the capture of Mecca and Medina. Because of his father's conquest, Abdullah immediately had to face an invasion of his domains by an Ottoman-Egyptian army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali. The Ottoman forces began their campaign by quickly recapturing Mecca and Medina. Heavily outnumbered and under-equipped, the Saudi forces retreated to their stronghold of Najd. Rather than engage the invaders in open battle, Abdullah decided to attempt to weather the invasion by fortifying his forces in the Najd towns. As a result, Ibrahim took the villages of Najd one by one, sacking any town that resisted. Ibrahim finally reached the Saudi capital at Diriyah. After a siege that lasted several months, Abdullah finally surrendered in the winter of 1818, marking the end of the Saudi state. Ibrahim systematically razed Diriyah to the ground and sent many members of the Al Saud clan into captivity in Egypt and Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire. Abdullah himself was promptly executed in Constantinople at the order of the Ottoman Sultan. Reasons for his execution In 1801, the tomb of Imam Husayn was defaced by the army of Abdullah bin Saud, causing anger and shock among entire Muslim world. As a result, the Ottoman authorities found themselves in a situation that they had to punish the Saudis for their crimes. The guardian of Islam's religious places was the Turkish-Ottoman Caliph in Constantinople, Mahmud II. Mahmud II ordered that an Egyptian force be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to defeat Abdullah bin Saud and his allies. In 1818, an Egyptian army led by Ibrahim Pasha (Mohammad Ali's son) completely destroyed Abdullah's forces and took their capital, Diriyah in Najd. Abdullah bin Saud was captured along with two of his supporters. They were then sent to prison in Constantinople. Abdullah and his two followers were publicly beheaded for their crimes against holy cities and mosques.Yaroslav Trofimov. (26 October 2018).

In business, through his bank in Paris and ownership of the Anzin Coal Co. in the Department of Nord, he contributed significantly to the economic development of France in the early stages of industrialization. In politics, he was a leading liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies throughout the Bourbon Restoration and president of the chamber at the outset of the July Revolution of 1830. He led the liberal-conservative Resistance Party in support of the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe I. He became president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Interior in the spring of 1831 (13 March 1831 ‚Äì 16 May 1832). Although his ministry was brief, his strong government succeeded in restoring order at home and keeping peace abroad. He fell victim to the cholera epidemic in France in 1832. Biography =Early life= Born in Grenoble, Casimir Perier was the fourth of the eight sons of \\"Milord\\" Claude-Nicolas Perier (1742‚Äì1801), the rich merchant-manufacturer and banker who opened his Ch√¢teau de Vizille to the famous meeting of the Estates of Dauphin√© (21 July 1788) foreshadowing the French Revolution. His mother was the former Marie-Charlotte Pascal (1749‚Äì1821), the daughter of a prominent linens manufacturer at nearby Voiron. Both his father and grandfather (Jacques Perier, 1702‚Äì82) made their fortunes in the commerce of canvas and linen cloths. Claude added the manufacture of printed cotton cloths (Indiennes) at the Ch√¢teau de Vizille, which he purchased in 1780 from Gabriel Louis de Neufville, duc de Villeroy. The Revolution and Napoleon opened up new opportunities for families of the wealthy \\"bourgeoisie grenobloise\\" such as the Periers. Claude Perier shifted the center of his business affairs to Paris, where he took up residence beginning in 1794 (rue Saint-Honor√©) and mingled with leading French financiers. In 1795 he invested in and became a director of the largest coal mining company in northern France, the Anzin Company; in 1796 he helped to found a major investment bank in Paris, the Caisse des Comtes Courants; and in 1799, shortly after Napoleon's coup d‚Äô√©tat of Brumaire, he became one of the founders and first directors of the famous Bank of France.See Francois Vermale, Le p√®re de Casimir Perier, 1743‚Äì1801 (1935); Eugene Choulet, La famille de Casimir Perier (1894); Robert Chagny, Une dynastie bourgeoise sous la R√©volution: Les Perier (1984); Madeleine Bourset, Casimir Perier. Un Prince Financier au Temps du Romantisme (1994). Claude Perier died on 6 February 1801, leaving his remarkably large family of ten children to share his enormous estate valued at 5,800,000 francs. Casimir, who was twenty-four years old at the time, inherited shares in the Anzin Company, land at Grenoble (Department of Is√®re) and in common with his brother Scipion, the property in Paris on the rue Saint-Honor√©. He'd had little experience in business or banking. His father had anticipated that the three eldest brothers, Augustin, Alexandre and Scipion, would carry on the family businesses at Grenoble/Vizille. Casimir himself gave no clear indication of a specific career choice. He was intelligent, energetic, handsome and eager to succeed, but he had spent his life mostly as a student and received a church-school and Jesuit-tutor classical education. During service with the army in Italy from 1799 to 1800, he began to consider a military career, but his father's death and legacy, the lure of Paris, and his close friendship with his older brother Scipion took him in a much different direction.See \\"Liquidation de la succession de Claude Perier (n.d), Municipal Library of Grenoble, R90.564, Fonds Chaper; Charles de R√©musat, M√©moires de ma vie (1872); Madeleine Bourset, Casimir Perier (1994); Richard Barker, Casimir Perier and William Ternaux: Two French Capitalists (1958). =Business career= Perier in his 30s. The two brothers, Casimir and Scipion, founded a bank in Paris (8 June 1801), located at No. 8, Place Vend√¥me until 1809, and after that year at No. 27, rue Neuve du Luxembourg (now the rue Cambon). Henry Flory and William Sabatier, who were former associates with their father at the Bank of France and the Anzin Company, respectively, helped to get the bank started. The youngest Perier brother, Joseph, joined the bank in 1822, approximately one year after the death of Scipion. The affairs of the older Perier bank at Grenoble were by then administered mainly by another younger brother, Alphonse. The bank of \\"Perier Fr√®res\\" in Paris, which played a significant and leading role in the early stages of the industrial revolution in France, would be near the peak of its success in the 1820s, numbering importantly by then among a small and select group of private banking houses known collectively as \\"la haute banque parisienne.\\" Scipion became a regent of the Bank of France in 1818, Casimir in 1820. They both became members of the influential Chamber of Commerce of Paris.See Richard Barker, \\"The Perier Bank during the Restoration (1815‚Äì1830),\\" Journal of European Economic History, Vol 2 (Winter 1973); Madeleine Bourset, Casimir Perier (1994); Rondo Cameron, Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization (1967). The two most important clients of the Perier bank were the Anzin Coal Company (Department of Nord) and the Perier- owned iron foundry and workshops in Paris at Chaillot. The founder-owner of the Chaillot firm, Jacques-Constantin Perier (1742‚Äì1818), who was not related to the Paris bankers, was well known for having brought the Watt steam engine to France. Famously, he used a Watt engine at Chaillot to provide Paris with water pumped from the Seine. In 1802 he supplied the Anzin Company with twenty of his engines for winding and drainage at the mines. Casimir and Scipion Perier purchased the Chaillot firm in 1818 and used its workshops to upgrade Anzin with more efficient Cornish high-pressure engines patented in France by Arthur Woolf. Chaillot was an important part of the most notable entrepreneurial achievement of the Periers during the Restoration, namely, the renovation, managerial reorganization and business expansion of Anzin.See Reed Geiger, The Anzin Coal Company, 1800‚Äì1833 (1971); Jacques Perier, \\"Notice sur les machines √† Vapeur,\\" Bulletin de la soci√©t√© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, IX (1810); Jacques Payen, Capital et machine √† vapeur au XVIIIe si√®cle: Les fr√®res Perier et l'introduction en France de la machine √† vapeur de Watt (1969). The Anzin Coal Company, which was established in 1757 as a closely held, family-owned firm managed by a self-perpetuating board of six directors, fell on hard times during the Revolution until rescued in 1795 by heavy investments from wealthy representatives of la grande bourgeoisie . Thus Claude Perier became a director of the company. The firm did reasonably well after 1795, although most of the new outsiders (\\"les Parisiens\\") who joined the founding families looked on Anzin as simply one of many investments. Not so Casimir and Scipion Perier, who determined to become active owner-directors for purposes of renovating and re-energizing the company for increased production and maximization of profits. The Perier bank in Paris became the company bank, regulating Anzin's accounts and contracts and supervising its large reserve funds. The brothers gradually took over making company policies. They were a good team. Scipion had the broad knowledge of the science and technology of the times (he was a long-standing member of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry, est. 1801); Casimir acted as the determined, driving force for innovation and risk-taking as opposed to the 'old ways' and too cautious decision-making. He was Anzin's ‚Äò homme fort‚Äô during the rejuvenation of the company in the 1820s. His much- quoted 1826 general report on Anzin company affairs illustrated the thoroughness of his knowledge of his firm's needs and potential. One measure of success during the Restoration was that output of coal at the mines increased from 250,000 metric tons in 1816 to 509,000 tons in 1830.See Reed Geiger, The Anzin Coal Company (1971); Richard Barker, \\"French Entrepreneurship during the Restoration: The Record of a Single Firm, the Anzin Mining Company,\\" Journal of Economic History, XXI (June 1961); Casimir Perier, \\"Rapport fait √† la R√©gie par Casimir Perier,\\" Saint-Vaast, 15 June 1826, Archives Nationales, 49 AQ 1. In association with other prominent bankers and business leaders, the Periers also engaged in the establishment of new financial institutions of the Restoration. Thus in 1818 Casimir and Scipion were among the founder-directors of the first French savings bank, the Caisse d‚Äô√âpargne et de Pr√©voyance de Paris (No. 104, rue Richlieu). Besides the Perier bank, other investors included Jacques Laffitte (governor of the Bank of France, 1814‚Äì19) and the banks of Lefebvre, Pillet Will, and Cottier. The same five banking houses helped back the organization during 1816-20 of an important early insurance company, the Compagnie Royale d‚ÄôAssurances, and in 1823 they would take part in the Compagnie des Quatre Canaux, a joint-stock company for loans to the government to improve the canal system in northern France. Perhaps a best example of the Perier bank's involvement in innovative financial ventures during the Restoration was the case of the ill-starred Soci√©t√© Commanditaire de l‚ÄôIndustrie. Conceived in 1825 mainly by Jacques Laffitte, its prospective president, this joint-stock company capitalized at 100 million francs was intended to help remedy the growing need in France for increased investment capital for large-scale projects in areas such as mining, metallurgy, canal construction and land development. It had the support of the haute banque and foreign banking houses. Casimir Perier and William Ternaux, France's leading woolens manufacturer, were its prospective vice-presidents. But in the end, unfortunately, the conservative Vill√®le ministry under Charles X refused to authorize the establishment of the Commanditaire.Barker, \\"The Perier Bank\\"; Eugene Bayard, La Caisse d'√©pargne et de pr√©voyance de Paris (1900); J.J. Baude, \\"Notice sur la Soci√©t√© commanditaire de l'industrie,\\" Revue Encyclop√©dique, XXXIX (1828); Bertrand Gille, La banque et le cr√©dit en France de 1815 √† 1848 (1959). Casimir Perier's policy as a banker was to spread his capital investment over a wide range of characteristic early nineteenth century business enterprise. He engaged as well in almost continuous investment in land and real estate, calculated most recently at about 15% of his total investments during 1815-30. Most notable were his purchases of highly valued properties on the rue Neuve du Luxembourg, the rue Sainte-Honor√© and the Champs-Elys√©es; a summer residence in the Bois de Boulogne; the Ch√¢teau Saint-Pierre ('le Taillis') in Normandy, near Rouen; and the parkland and ruins of the Ch√¢teau Pont-sur-Seine (Department of Aube), a property owned previously by Napoleon that was destroyed by invading armies in 1814. Casimir's largest investment in Paris real estate during the Restoration was made in 1829-30 when he agreed to pay 744,600 francs for properties on the rue Saint-Honor√© owned by Francis Egerton, Duke of Bridgewater. By the time of the Revolution of 1830, Casimir Perier was one of the richest men in Paris. At the age of 55 in 1832, when he died of cholera, his estate was estimated at close to 14 million francs.See the table for \\"Achats et Ventes Immobiliers de Casimir Perier,\\" in Bourset, Casimir Perier, p. 67; Barker, \\"The Perier Bank\\"; Fran√ßois Benoit, Pont-Sur-Seine, Son histoire, ses monuments (1952). Both Casimir and Scipion Perier valued education and believed strongly in the advancement of science and technology. They supported Joseph Deg√©rando's Soci√©t√© pour l‚ÄôAm√©lioration de l‚ÄôEnseignement √âl√©mentaire (est. 1815) and they arranged at Anzin for night-school instruction for workers using courses designed by Charles Dupin. In Paris, they supported the practical education programs provided by the √âcole Sp√©ciale de Commerce, founded in 1816, and the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures established in 1828. After Casimir was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1817, he would vote to protect the budgets of the Conservatory of Arts and Sciences and trade schools in the departments.See Joseph Deg√©rando, \\"√âloge de M. Scipion Perier,\\" Bulletin de la soci√©t√© pour l'industrie nationale, XX (1821);Leon Guillet, Cent ans de la vie de l'√âcole centrale des arts et manufactures, 1829‚Äì1939 (1939). =Political career= Madame Perier by Louis Hersent (1831), Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise. Casimir Perier's wide-ranging business interests and investments help to explain his opposition in the Chamber of Deputies to financial policies of Restoration ministries. In 1817, he opposed the policy of the Richelieu ministry for raising loans to pay the war indemnity demanded by the allied coalition after Napoleon's final defeat.Casimir Perier, R√©flections sur le projet d'emprunt (Paris, 1817) and Derni√®res r√©flections sur le projet d'emprunt, ou r√©ponse √† un article anonyme du 'Moniteur (Paris, 1817). In the 1820s, he was a leader in debates (1821‚Äì1822) against the policies of the Vill√®le ministry for financing canal construction and (1824‚Äì1825) for indemnifying the nobility for lands confiscated during the Revolution.See Reed Geiger, Planning the French Canals (1994); Bourset, Casimir Perier, pp.107‚Äì108. Perier entered the Chamber of Deputies for Paris in 1817, taking his seat in the Left Centre with the moderate opposition, and making his first speech in defense of the freedom of the press. Re-elected for Paris in 1822 and 1824, and in 1827 for Paris and for Troyes, he elected to represent Troyes (Department of Aube), and sat for that constituency until his death. Perier's violence in debate was not associated with any disloyalty to the Bourbon Restoration, and he held resolutely aloof from the Republican conspiracies and intrigues which prepared the way for the revolution of 1830. Under the Martignac ministry, there was some prospect of a reconciliation with the court, and, in January 1829, he was nominated a candidate for the presidency of the chamber; but in August with the elevation to power of Jules, Prince de Polignac, the truce ceased, and on 15 March 1830, Perier was one of the 221 deputies who repudiated the Ordinances put forward by Charles X. Averse by instinct and by interest to popular revolution, Perier nevertheless sat on the provisory commission of five at the H√¥tel de Ville during the Three Glorious Days of July 1830, but he refused to sign the declaration of Charles X's dethronement. Perier reluctantly recognized in the government of Louis Philippe's constitutional monarchy the only alternative to the continuance of the Revolution, but he was no favorite with the new king, whom he scorned for his trucking with the Paris 'mob'. He became President of the Chamber of Deputies, and sat for a few months in the cabinet, though without a portfolio.Bourset, Casimir Perier, p.216. =President of the Council= During the first years of the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, following the fall of the weak and discredited ministry of Jacques Laffitte, Perier, who had drifted more and more to the Right, was summoned to power (13 March 1831), and, in the short space of a year, he more or less restored civic order in France and re-established her credit in Europe. Paris was in a constant state of disturbance from March to September, and was only held in check by the premier's determination. The Canut Revolt at Lyon was suppressed after hard fighting; and at Grenoble, in face of the quarrels between the military and the inhabitants, Perier declined to make any concession to the townsfolk. For Perier, the Revolution of 1830 was not the beginning of greater things to come, it was the end of the Revolution of 1789. As he said to Odilon Barrot of Laffitte's \\"Party of Movement\\": \\"No, Monsieur, there has not been a revolution, only a change in the head of state.\\"Odilon Barrot, M√©moires posthumes (Paris, 1875-76), p. 215, cited in Bourset, Casimir Perier, p 202. As a minister, Perier refused to be dragged into armed intervention in favor of the revolutionary government of Warsaw, but his policy of peace did not exclude energetic demonstrations in support of French interests. He constituted France the protector of Belgium by the prompt expedition of the army of the north against the Dutch in August 1831. French influence in Italy was asserted by the audacious occupation of Ancona (23 February 1832); and the refusal of compensation for injuries to French residents by the Portuguese government was followed by a naval demonstration at Lisbon. Perier had undertaken the premiership with many forebodings, and overwork and anxiety prepared the way for disease. In the spring of 1832, during the cholera outbreak in Paris, he visited the hospitals in company with Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans. He fell ill the next day of a violent fever, and died six weeks later.See Bourset, Casimir Perier, pp. 267-74. Private life Casimir Perier married (13 October 1805) Marie C√©cile Laurence Loyer, nicknamed \\"Pauline\\", the daughter of Laurent-Pouthus Loyer, an old regime magistrate of Lyon who was a victim of the Terror during the Revolution. There were two sons: Auguste Casimir-Perier (1811‚Äì1876), deputy for Seine and Aube, and Charles-Paul Perier (1812‚Äì1897), deputy and senator for Seine-Inf√©rieur. Auguste-Casimir's son, Jean Casimir-Perier (1847‚Äì1907), was elected President of the Third Republic in 1894. Notes ;Attribution * References * Barral, Pierre.

He moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s, and became a key member of the Modernist architectural movement. He is most prominently remembered for designing residential tower blocks, some of which are now listed buildings. Biography Goldfinger was born in Budapest to a Jewish family.Nigel Warburton, Ern√∂ Goldfinger: The Life of an Architect, p. 12 The family business was forestry and saw-mills, which led Goldfinger to consider a career in engineering until he became interested in architecture after reading Hermann Muthesius's Das englische Haus, a description of English domestic architecture around the turn of the twentieth century. He continued to recommend the book for most of his life. Goldfinger moved to Paris in 1921, after the defeat and collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1923 he went to study at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux arts in the atelier of L√©on Jaussely, and in the following years got to know many other Paris-based architects, including Auguste Perret, Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. In 1929, before finishing his studies, Goldfinger established a partnership and worked on a number of interior designs and an extension to a holiday home at Le Touquet. He was strongly influenced by the publication of Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture, and became a fervent admirer of Le Corbusier's former mentor, Auguste Perret, an expert in designing reinforced concrete structures and an inspiration for Goldfinger when designing his own home. In the early 1930s Goldfinger met and married Ursula Blackwell, heiress to the Crosse & Blackwell fortune. Goldfinger was based in the UK for the remainder of his career. =Modernist in London= 1‚Äì3 Willow Road In 1934, Ern≈ë and Ursula Goldfinger moved to a flat in Highpoint I, London. Before World War II, Goldfinger built three houses (including his own) at 1‚Äì3 Willow Road in Hampstead, North London, and another at Broxted, Essex. His own house, 2 Willow Road, is now in the care of the National Trust. =Post World War II= After the war, Goldfinger was commissioned to build new offices for the Daily Worker newspaper and the headquarters of the British Communist Party. In the 1950s, he designed two London primary schools from prefabricated pre-cast concrete with brick infill for the London County Council in Putney. A cottage forming part of Brandlehow School was demolished by a rogue developer who was prosecuted in 2008, and ordered to restore the building to \\"exactly match\\" its former appearance. Trellick Tower, Kensal Town On the site of George Coles's Trocadero cinema in south-east London Goldfinger built Alexander Fleming House for the Ministry of Health, and the Odeon Elephant & Castle, which opened in 1966, and has since been demolished. Rise of the high rise In an attempt to solve the huge shortage of housing in the country following World War II, during which nearly 4 million houses had been destroyed or damaged, the British Government began to see high-rise buildings as a solution, and Goldfinger rose to prominence in England as a designer of tower blocks. Among his most notable buildings of the period were the 27-floor Balfron Tower and the adjacent eleven-storey Carradale House in Poplar, which served as models for the similar 31-floor Trellick Tower in Kensal Town (started 1968, completed 1972). These three buildings are notable examples of Brutalist architecture. =Personal life= Goldfinger was known as a humourless man given to notorious rages. He sometimes fired his assistants if they were inappropriately jocular, and once forcibly ejected two prospective clients for imposing restrictions on his design. A discussion on a golf course about Ern≈ë with Goldfinger's cousin prompted Ian Fleming to name the James Bond adversary and villain Auric Goldfinger after Ern≈ë‚ÄîFleming had been among the objectors to the pre-war demolition of the cottages in Hampstead that were removed to make way for Goldfinger's house at 2 Willow Road. Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when Goldfinger was published in 1959, which prompted Fleming to threaten to rename the character 'Goldprick', but eventually decided not to sue; Fleming's publishers agreed to pay his costs and gave him six free copies of the book. Goldfinger died on 15 November 1987, at the age of 85, and was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium where his ashes remain. Legacy Although Goldfinger enjoyed living in his own buildings, they were unpopular among both the public and many post-modernist architects. Towards the end of the 20th century Goldfinger's work became more appreciated. Trellick Tower is now a Grade II* listed building and has become something of a design icon, appearing on T-shirts, paintings and in the lyrics of the song \\"Best Days\\" by Blur. The few privately-owned flats within fetch high prices at sale. Balfron Tower and Carradale House are also listed Grade II, while an adjacent building by Goldfinger's studio, the 14-storey Glenkerry House, is run as a housing co- operative and is regarded as a model for management of buildings of the type. In 2000, Ern≈ë Goldfinger's estate endowed a sum of money to foster links between Hungary and the United Kingdom by sponsoring young Hungarian architectural students to study, travel or work in the UK. Their intention was to honour Ern≈ë's achievements, his commitment to his profession, and his lifelong support for his compatriots.

It is produced by WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The show's host is Terry Gross. , the show was syndicated to 624 stations and claimed nearly 5 million listeners. The show is fed live weekdays at 12:00 noon ET. In addition, some stations carry Fresh Air Weekend, a re-programming of highlights of the week's interviews. In 2016, Fresh Air was the most-downloaded podcast on iTunes. Overview The show began in 1975 at WHYY, with Judy Blank as host. In September of that year, Terry Gross took over as presenter and producer; over 40 years later she remains its chief presenter. In 1985, WHYY launched a weekly half-hour edition of Fresh Air, which was distributed nationally by NPR. The show began daily national broadcasts in 1987. The show is composed primarily of interviews with prominent figures in various fields, among them entertainment and the arts, culture, journalism, and global current affairs. This main segment is followed by shorter segments, most often comprising coverage and reviews of events and new releases in various cultural and entertainment spheres. The subjects of these shorter segments include movies, books, stage plays, television programs, as well as recordings of popular music, jazz, and classical music. The program also features commentary from a range of regular contributors, including Maureen Corrigan, David Bianculli, Dave Davies, Ken Tucker, Kevin Whitehead, John Powers, Lloyd Schwartz, Geoffrey Nunberg, Justin Chang, Milo Miles, and Ed Ward. David Edelstein was let go from his position as film critic for the show on November 27, 2018 for comments made in the wake of Bernardo Bertolucci's death. The executive producer of Fresh Air is Danny Miller. The program is produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Ann Marie Baldonado, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden and Mooj Zadie. The show is directed by Roberta Shorrock. Audrey Bentham is the engineer. Molly Seavy-Nesper is the associate producer of Online Media. Background The program's interviews are pre-recorded and edited, not broadcast live. As with many such radio programs, guests are often not in the studio during recording, and often speak remotely from a local affiliate station, or a home studio. When pressing news requires, the show has gone live, such as during the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, and in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing on April 19, 2013. Fresh Air interviews are generally first aired on the Monday through Thursday shows. The Friday shows are rebroadcasts of past interviews. The show's theme song, a jazz piece called \\"Fresh Air\\", was composed for the program by Joel Forrester of The Microscopic Septet. Controversial interviews Fresh Air has become a premiere source of audio journalism. Politicians, public intellectuals, and celebrities (such as R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, pictured) are among those who have been interviewed by its host, Terry Gross. In February 2002, when Gross interviewed Gene Simmons of Kiss, Simmons discussed his sexual experimentation with women of all age groups and propositioned Gross in demonstration; according to NPR's website, Simmons withheld permission to supply transcripts or audio of the interview on their website. In July 2010, Fresh Air was removed from Mississippi Public Broadcasting radio because of \\"recurring inappropriate content\\", shortly after the broadcast of an interview with comedian Louis C.K. in which he discussed his sex life. It has since returned to the state network's evening line-up. Awards In 1993, NPR, Fresh Air, and Gross were presented with the George Foster Peabody Award with praise for her \\"probing questions, revelatory interviews, and unusual insights\\". The show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2004, Gross published a book of her favorite interviews from the show under the title All I Did Was Ask. In 2016, Gross received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama, \\"For her artful probing of the human experience. Her patient, persistent questioning in thousands of interviews over four decades has pushed public figures to reveal personal motivations behind extraordinary lives‚Äîrevealing simple truths that affirm our common humanity.\\" References Further reading  External links * *Fresh Air Archive * Streaming audio schedule Category:1975 radio programme debuts Category:American variety radio programs Category:English-language radio programs Category:Mass media in Philadelphia Category:NPR programs Category:Peabody Award-winning radio programs ","title":"Fresh Air"},{"id":"402635","text":"Weapons of Mass Deception is pejorative expression used by some people to describe U.S. President George W.

This punning alteration accuses the Bush administration of using the war in Iraq to draw the nation's attention away from other problems, such as the economic recession of 2002. The meaning was later inverted to describe Bush's alleged attempts to divert attention away from the war following a drop in public support for the war.

It is usually composed of three to six aircraft, with their aircrews and ground staff; or, in the case of a non-flying ground flight, no aircraft and a roughly equivalent number of support personnel. In most usages, multiple flights make up a squadron. The \\"flight\\" is also a basic unit for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Foreign languages equivalents include escadrille (French), escuadrilla (Spanish), esquadrilha (Portuguese) and Schwarm (German). Origins The use of the term \\"flight\\" to describe a collection of aircraft (typically four in the early days of aviation) dates back to around 1912. It has been suggested that the term was coined by technical sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which was examining the British air arrangements around the same time. Commonwealth usage =Aircraft flights= In the United Kingdom Royal Air Force and the other air forces of the Commonwealth, from where much air force terminology emanated, an aircraft flight, in the first decades of air forces, was commanded by a flight lieutenant, a rank equivalent to captain in armies and other air forces, or a naval lieutenant. More recently, however, it has become common for a flight to be led by a squadron leader--a formal rank distinct from a squadron commander--equivalent to an army major or naval lieutenant commander. A flight is usually divided into two sections, each containing two to three aircraft, which share ground staff with the other section, and are usually commanded by a flight lieutenant. The Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, the Army Air Corps, and other Commonwealth naval and army aviation arms also have flights. In the Fleet Air Arm a flight could be as few as 1 helicopter operating from a smaller ship. =Ground flights= An air force ground flight is roughly equivalent to an army platoon and may be commanded by a flight lieutenant, flying officer, pilot officer, or warrant officer. A flight is also a basic unit of guided missiles, such as surface-to- air missiles. These ground flights may carry out operational roles (such as air traffic control, airfield defence or firefighting), engineering roles (such as aircraft or ground systems maintenance), medical, dental, and legal units, or purely administrative roles, such as finance, infrastructure or human resource management. American usage The United States Air Force (USAF) has three types of flights: numbered, alphabetic, and aircraft (which may be designated by alpha/numerics or name). A numbered flight is a unit with a unique base, wing, group, or Numbered Air Force mission, such as training or finance, though not large enough to warrant designation as a squadron. Numbered flights are uncommon, and are usually only found in basic training facilities. An alphabetic flight is an operational component of a flying or ground squadron, not an independent unit; alphabetic flights within a squadron normally have identical or similar functions and are normally designated A, B, C, and so on within the squadron. Flights in the USAF are generally authorized to have between 20 and 100 personnel, and are normally commanded by a company- grade officer (lieutenant or captain) and/or a flight chief, usually a senior noncommissioned officer with the rank of master sergeant or senior master sergeant. In USAF flying squadrons, the term flight also designates a tactical sub-unit of a squadron consisting of two or three elements (designated \\"sections\\" in U.S. Army and U.S. Naval Aviation), with each element consisting of two or three aircraft. The flight operates under the command of a designated flight leader. In Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile units of the U.S. Air Force, a flight is composed of ten unmanned launch facilities remotely controlled by a manned launch control center, containing two personnel. Five of these flights make up one missile squadron. The Air Force has a total of 45 ICBM missile flights. (In U.S. Army Aviation the equivalent organizational level of a flight is called a \\"platoon,\\" while in U.S. Naval Aviation the \\"flight\\" is known as a \\"division.\\") Under U.S. military and FAA common usage, for air traffic control and separation purposes, a \\"flight\\" of aircraft is simply two or more aircraft intentionally operating in close proximity to each other under a designated \\"flight leader\\" without regard to military organizational hierarchy.

Since joining NPR in 1975, Gross has interviewed thousands of guests. Gross has won praise over the years for her low-key and friendly yet often probing interview style and for the diversity of her guests. She has a reputation for researching her guests' work largely the night before an interview, often asking them unexpected questions about their early careers.  Early life  Terry Gross was born in Brooklyn,https://www.jewishexponent.com/2020/01/19/fresh-air-host-terry-gross- appears-on-finding-your-roots/ and grew up in its Sheepshead Bay neighborhood, the second child of Anne (Abrams), a stenographer, and Irving Gross,Stated on Finding Your Roots, January 21, 2020 who worked in a family millinery business, where he sold fabric to milliners. She grew up in a Jewish family, and all her grandparents were emigrants, her father's parents from Tarn√≥w, Poland and her mother's from the Russian Empire. She said that her family lived in an apartment near Senior's Restaurant, a local landmark. When she was young, people would often ask where Gross came from, assuming that her lack of a heavy Brooklyn accent meant she grew up elsewhere. She has an older brother, Leon J. Gross, who works as a psychometric consultant. In 1968, Gross graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School. She earned a bachelor's degree in English and a Master of Education degree in communications from the University at Buffalo. While in college, she married her high-school boyfriend who attended the same university; they subsequently divorced. She took a year off from school to hitchhike cross country. In 1972, Gross started teaching 8th grade at an inner-city public junior high school in Buffalo. She said she was ill-equipped for the job, especially at establishing discipline, and was fired after only six weeks.  Career  Gross began her radio career in 1973 at WBFO, an NPR CPB-funded college station, then broadcasting from the Main Street Campus of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, where she started out as a volunteer on a show called Woman Power, then co-hosted This is Radio. Typical subjects of these shows were women's rights and public affairs. In 1975, she moved to WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to host and produce Fresh Air, which was a local interview program at the time. In 1985, Fresh Air with Terry Gross went national, being distributed weekly by NPR. It became a daily program two years later. Gross typically conducts the interviews from the WHYY-FM studios in Philadelphia, with her subject at the studio of a local NPR affiliate convenient to them connected via telephone or satellite feed. For the majority of these conversations, Gross is not face-to- face with her subjects. Gross creates a daily show that is an hour long, usually includes two interviews, and is distributed to over 190 NPR stations. The show reaches an audience of millions of daily listeners. Many of the producers and staff on Gross' show have been with her since the late 1970s to 1980s. She appeared as a guest-voice on The Simpsons as herself, in the episode \\"The Debarted\\". During the spring 1998 semester, Gross was a guest lecturer at University of California-Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. In 2015 she appeared on Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me and played the game \\"Not My Job\\", answering questions about Hulk Hogan. = Interview style = The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Gross's interviews are \\"a remarkable blend of empathy, warmth, genuine curiosity, and sharp intelligence.\\" Gross prides herself on preparation; prior to interviewing guests, she reads their books, watches their movies, and/or listens to their CDs. The Boston Phoenix opined that \\"Terry Gross... is almost certainly the best cultural interviewer in America, and one of the best all-around interviewers, period. Her smart, thoughtful questioning pushes her guests in unlikely directions. Her interviews are revelatory in a way other people's seldom are.\\" Gross said that when she first started working in radio, her voice was much higher with anxiety. She said she has worked to relax her voice and to a more natural, deeper tone. Much has been written about Gross's voice, and the precision of her use of language has been the subject of much analysis. = Difficult interviews = There have been some occasions when interviews have not gone smoothly. Gross asked Nancy Reagan about the lack of funding and mishandling of HIV/AIDS by her husband, President Ronald Reagan, which was not well received. Several guests, including Lou Reed, Jann Wenner, Faye Dunaway, Monica Lewinsky, and Adam Driver, have stopped their interviews prematurely. Three notable examples are: * February 4, 2002: Kiss singer and bassist Gene Simmons. The interview began with Gross not pronouncing Simmons's original Hebrew last name to his liking. Simmons dismissively replied to her that she pronounced without \\"flavor\\" because she had a \\"Gentile mouth\\"; Gross responded that she is Jewish. In the interview, Gross asked Simmons about his studded codpiece, to which Simmons replied, \\"It holds in my manhood, otherwise it would be too much for you to take,\\" adding, \\"If you want to welcome me with open arms, I'm afraid you're also going to have to welcome me with open legs,\\" to which Gross replied, \\"That's a really obnoxious thing to say.\\" Unlike most Fresh Air guests, Simmons refused to grant permission for the interview to be made available on the NPR website. The interview appears in Gross's book All I Did Was Ask, and unauthorized transcripts and audio of the complete original interview are known to exist. * October 8, 2003: Fox News television host Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly walked out of the interview because of what he considered biased questions, creating a media controversy fed by the ongoing presidential campaign. Toward the end of the interview, O'Reilly asked Gross if she had been as tough on Al Franken, who had appeared on the program two weeks earlier. Gross responded, \\"No, I wasn't... we had a different interview.\\" Gross was later criticized by then NPR ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin for \\"an interview that was, in the end, unfair to O'Reilly\\" and that \\"it felt as though Terry Gross was indeed 'carrying Al Franken's water'. \\" Dvorkin described Gross's interviewing tactic of reading a quote critical of O'Reilly after he had walked out of the room as \\"unethical and unfair\\". Gross was later supported by an NPR colleague, Mike Pesca, who contended that O'Reilly did have the opportunity to respond to a criticism that Gross read to O'Reilly levelled by People magazine, but that he defaulted by prematurely abandoning the interview. On September 24, 2004, Gross and O'Reilly met again on O'Reilly's television show, where Gross assured O'Reilly, \\"no matter what you ask me, I'm staying for the entire interview.\\" * February 9, 2005: Lynne Cheney, conservative author and the wife of then-Vice President Dick Cheney. The initial focus of the interview was on Cheney's latest history book, but Gross moved on to questions about Cheney's lesbian daughter Mary and her opinion of the Bush administration's opposition to same-sex marriage. Cheney declined to comment on her daughter's sexuality, but repeatedly stated her opposition to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which was being endorsed by President George W. Bush. Cheney declined to discuss the matter further. When Gross brought the interview back to issues of gay rights, Cheney again refused to comment. According to producers, Cheney had been warned that Gross would ask about politics and current events.  Personal life  While she was in college in the late 1960s, Gross was married for about a year to a man she knew from high school, with whom she had been living previously. Gross said she dropped out of college in her sophomore year to hitchhike with him across the country before they were married. She proceeded to obtain a divorce by the time she started her radio career in 1973. Gross has been married to Francis Davis, jazz critic of The Village Voice, since 1994.

Public Radio International The Tavis Smiley Show was broadcast on Public Radio International (PRI). It was a one-hour weekly program featuring interviews with news makers, thought leaders and artists and seeks to bring diverse perspectives to the airwaves. It was produced by Smiley Radio Properties, Inc., in partnership with PRIAbout the PRI show at its official website at Smiley's studio in Los Angeles, California.Profile of Tavis Smiley The program ran two hours per week until October 2010 when the second hour became the sister program Smiley & West, co-hosted by longtime Smiley collaborator Dr. Cornel West. The show ended in 2017.  History of radio show  The first version of The Tavis Smiley Show was on National Public Radio (NPR). It was broadcast daily from January 2002 to December 16, 2004, in Los Angeles, when the host Tavis Smiley decided not to renew his contract with NPR.Statement of NPR and the African American Consortium regarding cancellation of show, November 29, 2004. Some of the reasons cited based on an article by Howard Kurtz for not renewing the contract were 1) Tavis Smiley wanted to tape his show a day in advance, and NPR did not agree; 2) against federal funding policies, Tavis Smiley wished to own the right to rebroadcast the show; and 3) Tavis Smiley appealed to have the budget for promoting the program significantly increased, and NPR did not have the budget to do so. The show was a news and opinion program focusing upon issues of race, diversity, and ethnicity and often featured guest speakers. It was an hour-long show. The show was helped through a collaboration with various public radio stations. It was replaced on some radio stations by News & Notes which follows much the same format and topics. Many other radio stations replaced it with the short- lived NPR News with Tony Cox.

Sandia Peak - New Mexico Sandia Peak - New Mexico Taxonomy The black rosy finch was first classified by American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1874. This bird has been thought to form a superspecies with the three other rosy finches: grey-crowned rosy finch (L. tephrocotis) and the brown-capped rosy finch (L. australis), all of which were classified as the same species as the Asian rosy finch (L. arctoa) from 1983‚Äì1993. Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another. Along with four Asian rosy finches, the three North American rosy finches form the mountain finch genus Leucosticte. There are no recognized subspecies of the black rosy finch. Alternative common names include: roselin (in French), Ru√üschneegimpel (in German), and pinz√≥n montano negro (in Spanish). Description Adults are black on the head, back and breast with pink on the belly, rump and wings. There is a patch of grey at the back of the head. They have short black legs and a long forked tail. The grey-crowned rosy finch has a brown body instead of black and the brown-capped rosy finch and lacks the grey patch on the back of the head. Distribution and habitat The black rosy finch's breeding habitat is mountain areas above the tree-line, amongst alpine rocks and cliffs. Because of this it is one of the least studied birds in North America. Its distribution range is between that of the grey-crowned rosy finch (L. tephrocotis), which is located to north and west, and the brown-capped rosy finch (L. australis), which is located to the south and east. Behavior The black rosy finch builds a cup nest in a cavity on a cliff. Most birds migrate short distances to lower elevations and further south and return to the alpine areas in April. These birds forage on the ground, may fly to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat seeds from weeds and grasses and insects, often in areas where snow is melting, uncovering food items and new plant shoots are growing. They often feed in small flocks, sometimes mixing with grey-crowned rosy finches. A male will defend its female's territory during breeding season, not just the nest but where ever she goes. This behavior is common with the rosy finches. When breeding both males and females develop throat pouches, known as gular pouches or gular skin, to carry food to their chicks, a trait seen in only one other North American genus, Pinicola. Due to their inaccessibility, actual black rosy finch nests had been reached by only three researchers as of 2002. The nests are made of grass and stems and lined with fine grass, hair, and feathers. They are known to use protected areas such as openings in cliffs, mine shafts, caves, and rafters. They eat seeds and insects, usually foraged from the ground, including snowfields. Their call is a buzz-sounding \\"chew\\". References Further reading =Book= * Johnson, R. E. 2002. Black Rosy-Finch (Leucosticte atrata). In The Birds of North America, No. 678 (A. Poole and F.

Compulsive hoarding behavior has been associated with health risks, impaired functioning, workplace impairment, economic burden, and adverse effects on friends and family members. When clinically significant enough to impair functioning, hoarding can prevent typical uses of space, enough so that it can limit activities such as cooking, cleaning, moving through the house, and sleeping. It can also put the individual and others at risk of fires, falling, poor sanitation, and other health concerns. Researchers have recognized compulsive hoarding as a phenomenon since at least the 1980s,Compulsive Hoarding. David Greenberg. American Journal of Psychotherapy 1987 41:3, 409-416 https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1987.41.3.409 but only recently have begun to study hoarding, and it was first defined as a mental disorder in the 5th edition of the DSM in 2013. It was not clear whether compulsive hoarding is a separate, isolated disorder, or rather a symptom of another condition, such as OCD, but the current DSM lists hoarding disorder as both a mental disability and a possible symptom for OCD. Prevalence rates have been estimated at 2% to 5% in adults, though the condition typically manifests in childhood with symptoms worsening in advanced age, at which point collected items have grown excessive and family members who would otherwise help to maintain and control the levels of clutter have either died or moved away. Hoarding appears to be more common in people with psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Other factors often associated with hoarding include alcohol dependence and paranoid, schizotypal and avoidance traits.  Signs and symptoms  Example of useful but unopened items Compulsive hoarding in its worst forms can cause fires, unsanitary conditions such as rat and cockroach infestations and other health and safety hazards. Listed below are possible symptoms hoarders may experience: * They hold onto a large number of items that most people would consider useless or worthless, such as: **Advertising mail, old catalogs, magazines, and newspapers ** Worn out cooking equipment ** Things that might be useful for making crafts ** Clothes that might be worn one day ** Broken things or trash ** \\"Freebies\\" or other promotional products * Their home is cluttered to the point where many parts are inaccessible and can no longer be used for intended purposes. For example: ** Beds that cannot be slept in ** Kitchens that cannot be used for food preparation ** Tables, chairs, or sofas that cannot be used for dining or sitting ** Unsanitary bathrooms ** Tubs, showers, and sinks filled with items and can no longer be used for washing or bathing * Their clutter and mess is at a point where it can cause illness, distress, and impairment. As a result, they: ** Do not allow visitors in, such as family and friends, or repair and maintenance professionals, because the clutter embarrasses them ** Are reluctant or unable to return borrowed items ** Keep the shades drawn so that no one can look inside ** Get into a lot of arguments with family members regarding the clutter ** Are at risk of fire, falling, infestation, or eviction ** Often feel depressed or anxious due to the clutter = Obsessive-compulsive disorder = A hoarder's living room For many years, hoarding has been listed as a symptom or a subtype of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder (OCPD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. People with OCD experience unwanted thoughts that incline them to do something repetitively. Some of these behaviors are excessive cleanliness and excessive toothbrushing. The current DSM says that an OCD diagnosis should be considered when: * The hoarding is driven by fear of contamination or superstitious thoughts * The hoarding behavior is unwanted or highly distressing * The individual shows no interest in the hoarded items * Excessive acquisition is only present if there is a specific obsession with a certain item Compulsive hoarding does not seem to involve the same neurological mechanisms as more familiar forms of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and does not respond to the same drugs, which target serotonin. In compulsive hoarding, the symptoms are presented in the normal stream of consciousness, and are not perceived as repetitive or distressing like in OCD patients. Despite statistics indicating that there is a prevalence of hoarding in 18% to 40% of patients with OCD, only 5% of compulsive hoarders experience symptoms of OCD. In another study, a sample of 217 patients diagnosed with significant hoarding, only 18% were diagnosed with OCD, as opposed to the 36% that were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. There are significant differences and issues between the diagnostic features of compulsive hoarding and OCD which are being considered in a possible addition to the DSM-V of a new independent disorder such as compulsive hoarding. It is also said that there may be an overlap with a condition known as impulse control disorder (ICD), particularly when compulsive hoarding is linked to compulsive buying or acquisition behavior. Recent findings suggest that there may be three types of hoarding: pure hoarding, hoarding plus OCD (i.e., co-morbid OCD), and OCD-based hoarding. Given the aforementioned distinction, it was proposed to increase coverage of compulsive hoarding in the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V), both by creating a distinct category for compulsive hoarding, provisionally named, Hoarding Disorder (either in the main manual under \\"obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders\\" or in the appendix), and by including hoarding as a potential symptom of OCD. = Book hoarding = Bibliomania is a disorder involving the collecting or hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged. One of several psychological disorders associated with books (such as bibliophagy or bibliokleptomania), bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a more conventional book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. One of the most famous bibliokleptomaniacs in American history, Stephen Blumberg, never felt that he was doing anything wrong. \\"Blumberg was trying to save a forgotten world from a system (the libraries) that neglected it.\\" Another was Gustav Hasford. (See Gustav Hasford#Library books theft charges.) = Animal hoarding = Animal hoarding: rabbits Animal hoarding involves keeping larger than usual numbers of animals as pets without having the ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time denying this inability. Compulsive animal hoarding can be characterized as a symptom of a disorder rather than deliberate cruelty towards animals. Hoarders are deeply attached to their pets and find it extremely difficult to let them go. They typically cannot comprehend that they are harming their pets by failing to provide them with proper care. Hoarders tend to believe that they provide the right amount of care for their pets. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals provides a \\"Hoarding Prevention Team,\\" which works with hoarders to help them attain a manageable and healthy number of pets. Along with other compulsive hoarding behaviors, it is linked in the DSM-IV to obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder. Alternatively, animal hoarding could be related to addiction, dementia, or even delusional disorder. Animal hoarders display symptoms of delusional disorder in that they have a \\"belief system out of touch with reality.\\" Many hoarders lack insight regarding the extent of deterioration their habitation and the health of their animals undergo, and tend not to recognize that anything is wrong. Delusional disorder is an effective model in that it offers an explanation of hoarders' apparent blindness to the realities of their situations. Another model that has been suggested to explain animal hoarding is attachment disorder, which is primarily caused by poor parent-child relationships during childhood. As a result, those suffering from attachment disorder may turn to possessions, such as animals, to fill their need for a loving relationship. Interviews with animal hoarders have revealed that hoarders often experienced domestic trauma during childhood, providing evidence for this model. Perhaps the strongest psychological model put forward to explain animal hoarding is obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. The Animal Legal Defense Fund provides an online resource addressing ways, from a legal standpoint, to stop or prevent animal hoarding. It covers civil options for stopping animal hoarders, cost mitigation laws, and sentencing including mandatory forfeiture.  Mechanism  Some evidence based on brain lesion case studies also suggests that the anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be involved in abnormal hoarding behaviors, but sufferers of such injuries display less purposeful behavior than other individuals who hoard compulsively, thus making the involvement of these brain structures unclear. Other neuropsychological factors that have been found to be associated with individuals exhibiting hoarding behaviors include slower and more variable reaction times, increased impulsivity, and decreased spatial attention. A study comparing neural activity in hoarders, people with OCD, and a control group when deciding to throw possessions away found that when hoarders were trying to decide to throw away their own possessions, they had lower activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula regions of the brain. The study suggested this lower activity was related to \\"problems in identifying the emotional significance of a stimulus, generating appropriate emotional response, or regulating affective state during decision making.\\" Hoarders had normal levels of activity in those regions when making decisions about possessions that did not belong to them. The opposite condition is compulsive decluttering.  Diagnosis  The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder are: Understanding the age of onset of hoarding behavior can help develop methods of treatment for this ‚Äúsubstantial functional impairment.\\" Hoarders pose danger to not only themselves, but others as well. The prevalence of compulsive hoarding in the community has been estimated at between 2% and 5%, significantly higher than the rates of OCD, panic disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. 751 people were chosen for a study in which people self-reported their hoarding behavior. Of these individuals, most reported the onset of their hoarding symptoms between the ages of 11 and 20 years old, with 70% reporting the behaviors before the age of 21. Fewer than 4% of people reported the onset of their symptoms after the age of 40. The data shows that compulsive hoarding usually begins early, but often does not become more prominent until after age 40. Different reasons have been given for this, such as the prominence of family presence early in life and the extent of limits and facilitates they have on removing clutter. The understanding of early onset hoarding behavior may help in the future to better distinguish hoarding behavior from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù childhood collecting behaviors. A second key part of this study was to determine if stressful life events are linked to the onset of hoarding symptoms. Similar to self-harming, traumatized persons may create \\"a problem\\" for themselves in order to avoid their real anxiety or trauma. Facing their real issues may be too difficult for them, so they \\"create\\" a kind of \\"artificial\\" problem (in their case, hoarding) and prefer to battle with it rather than determine, face, or do something about their real anxieties. Hoarders may suppress their psychological pain by \\"hoarding.\\" The study shows that adults who hoard report a greater lifetime incidence of having possessions taken by force, forced sexual activity as either an adult or a child, including forced intercourse, and being physically handled roughly during childhood, thus proving traumatic events are positively correlated with the severity of hoarding. For each five years of life the participant would rate from 1 to 4, 4 being the most severe, the severity of their hoarding symptoms. Of the participants, 548 reported a chronic course, 159 an increasing course and 39 people, a decreasing course of illness. The incidents of increased hoarding behavior were usually correlated to five categories of stressful life events. Although excessive acquiring is not a diagnostic criterion of hoarding, at least two-thirds of individuals with hoarding disorder excessively acquire possessions. Having a more anxiously attached interpersonal style is associated with more compulsive buying and greater acquisition of free items and these relationships are mediated by stronger distress intolerance and greater anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism has been shown to increase both the sentimental value and perceived utility of items. These findings indicate that individuals may over- value their possessions to compensate for thwarted interpersonal needs. Feeling alone and/or disconnected from others may impair people's ability to tolerate distress and increase people's tendencies to see human-like qualities in objects. The humanness of items may increase their perceived value and individuals may acquire these valued objects to alleviate distress. = Differential diagnosis = Collecting and hoarding may seem similar, but there are distinct characteristics between hoarders and collectors that set them apart. Collecting often involves the targeted search and acquisition of specific items that form‚Äîat least from the perspective of the collector‚Äîa greater appreciation, deeper understanding, or increased synergistic value when combined with other similar items. Hoarding, by contrast, appears haphazard and involves the overall acquiring of common items that should not be especially meaningful to the person who is gathering such items in large quantities. People who hoard commonly keep items that hold little to no true meaning or value to most others, unlike some collectors, whose items may be of great value to select people. Most hoarders are disorganized, and their living areas are crowded and in disarray. Most collectors can afford to store their items systematically or have enough room to put their collections on display. There have been on occasion collectors who because of their age, mental state, or finances have had their collections fall into a hoarding state.  Treatment  Many individuals with hoarding disorder do not recognize their hoarding as a problem. In one study, 42% of individuals with hoarding disorder found their behavior problematic compared to the 63% of their family and friends who saw the behavior as problematic. Low insight leads to poor treatment outcomes. Most investigations have found that only a quarter of patients who hoard show an adequate response to these medications and therapeutic interventions. = Medication = Although no medication has received FDA approval for the treatment of compulsive hoarding, some monoamine reuptake inhibitors have been moderately successful in a small number of low- quality clinical studies. In patients where compulsive hoarding is secondary to or comorbid with frank OCD, serotonergic antidepressants such as SSRIs or the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine are indicated, although the presence of hoarding predicts relatively poor treatment response. When examined, concurrent pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment appeared more effective than either alone. = Counseling = Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a commonly implemented therapeutic intervention for compulsive hoarding. As part of cognitive behavior therapy, the therapist may help the patient to: * Discover why he or she is compelled to hoard. * Learn to organize possessions in order to decide what to discard. * Develop decision- making skills. * Declutter the home during in-home visits by a therapist or professional organizer. * Gain and perform relaxation skills. * Attend family and/or group therapy. * Be open to trying psychiatric hospitalization if the hoarding is serious. * Have periodic visits and consultations to keep a healthy lifestyle.Roger, Harms W. \\"Definition\\". Mayo Clinic. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 25 May 2011. Web. 21 Mar. 2012. This modality of treatment usually involves exposure and response prevention to situations that cause anxiety and cognitive restructuring of beliefs related to hoarding. Furthermore, research has also shown that certain CBT protocols have been more effective in treatment than others. CBT programs that specifically address the motivation of the sufferer, organization, acquiring new clutter, and removing current clutter from the home have shown promising results. This type of treatment typically involves in-home work with a therapist combined with between-session homework, the completion of which is associated with better treatment outcomes. Research on internet-based CBT treatments for the disorder (where participants have access to educational resources, cognitive strategies, and chat groups) has also shown promising results both in terms of short- and long-term recovery. Other therapeutic approaches that have been found to be helpful: # Motivational interviewing originated in addiction therapy. This method is significantly helpful when used in hoarding cases in which insight is poor and ambivalence to change is marked. # Harm reduction rather than symptom reduction. Also borrowed from addiction therapy. The goal is to decrease the harmful implications of the behavior, rather than the hoarding behaviors. # Group psychotherapy reduces social isolation and social anxiety and is cost-effective compared to one-on- one intervention. Group CBT tends to have similar outcomes to individual therapy. Although group treatment often does not include home sessions, experimental research suggests that treatment outcomes may be improved if home sessions are included. Individuals have been shown to discard more possessions when in a cluttered environment compared to a tidy environment. Indeed, a meta-analysis found that a greater number of home sessions improves CBT outcomes. Individuals with hoarding behaviors are often described as having low motivation and poor compliance levels, and as being indecisive and procrastinators, which may frequently lead to premature termination (i.e., dropout) or low response to treatment. Therefore, it was suggested that future treatment approaches, and pharmacotherapy in particular, be directed to address the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairments demonstrated by individuals with hoarding symptoms. Mental health professionals frequently express frustration regarding hoarding cases, mostly due to premature termination and poor response to treatment. Patients are frequently described as indecisive, procrastinators, recalcitrant, and as having low or no motivation, which can explain why many interventions fail to accomplish significant results. To overcome this obstacle, some clinicians recommend accompanying individual therapy with home visits to help the clinician: Likewise, certain cases are assisted by professional organizers as well.

The exact name and scope of the office varies by state. Alternative titles for the office include county attorney, commonwealth's attorney, solicitor, or county prosecutor. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual suspected of breaking the law, initiating and directing further criminal investigations, guiding and recommending the sentencing of offenders, and are the only attorneys allowed to participate in grand jury proceedings. The prosecutors decide what criminal charges to bring, and when and where a person will answer to those charges. In carrying out their duties, prosecutors have the authority to investigate persons, grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals, and plea bargain with defendants. A district attorney leads a staff of prosecutors, who are most commonly known as deputy district attorneys (DDAs). The Deputy who serves as the supervisor of the office is often called the Assistant District Attorney. The majority of prosecutions will be delegated to DDAs, with the district attorney prosecuting the most important cases and having overall responsibility for their agency and its work. Depending upon the system in place, DAs may be appointed by the chief executive of the jurisdiction or elected by local voters.  History  This term for a prosecutor originates with the traditional use of the term \\"district\\" for multi-county prosecutorial jurisdictions in several U.S. states. For example, New York appointed prosecutors to multi-county districts prior to 1813. Even after those states broke up such districts and started appointing or electing prosecutors for individual counties, they continued to use the title \\"district attorney\\" for the most senior prosecutor in a county rather than switch to \\"county attorney\\".  Role  The principal duties of the district attorney are usually mandated by law and include representing the State in all criminal trials for crimes which occurred in the district attorney's geographical jurisdiction. The geographical jurisdiction of a district attorney may be delineated by the boundaries of a county, judicial circuit, or judicial district. Their duties generally include charging crimes through informations and/or grand jury indictments. After levying criminal charges, the state's attorney will then prosecute those charged with a crime. This includes conducting discovery, plea bargaining, and trial. In some jurisdictions, the district attorney may act as chief counsel for city police, county police, state police and all state law enforcement agencies within the state's attorney's jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, the district attorney oversees the operations of local prosecutors with respect to violations of county ordinances. In other jurisdictions, the district attorney prosecutes traffic matters and/or misdemeanors. In some states the district attorney prosecutes violations of state laws to the extent that the state permits local prosecution of these. District attorneys do not prosecute federal crimes, which are the jurisdiction of a United States Attorney. Many district attorneys also bear responsibilities not related to criminal prosecution. These include defending the county against civil suits, occasionally initiating such suits on behalf of the county, preparing or reviewing contracts entered into by the county and providing legal advice and counsel to local government. In some jurisdictions, the county attorney does not handle any criminal matters at all, but serves only as the legal counsel to the county. For example, in Arizona, Missouri, Montana, and Minnesota a county attorney represents the county and state within their county, prosecutes all felonies occurring within the county, and prosecutes misdemeanors occurring within unincorporated areas of the county. In Ohio a county prosecutor represents the county and state within their county, prosecutes all crimes within the county, and is legal adviser to the board of county commissioners, board of elections, and all other county officers and boards.The Office of the County Prosecuting Attorney is granted its authority by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 309 On the other hand, county attorneys in Kentucky and Virginia prosecute only certain misdemeanors and sometimes traffic matters and serve as legal counsel for their county, with felony prosecutions and prosecutions of offenses not handled by the county attorney being the responsibility of the commonwealth's attorney for the given county.  Departments  The district attorney usually divides their services into several departments that handle different areas of criminal law. Each department is staffed by several duly appointed and sworn ASAs. The departments of a large district attorney's office may include but are not limited to: felony, misdemeanor, domestic violence, traffic, juvenile, charging (or case filing), drug prosecution, forfeitures, civil affairs such as eminent domain, child advocacy, child support, victim assistance, appeals, career criminal prosecution, homicide, investigations, organized crime/gang, and administration.  Nomenclature  The name of the role of local prosecutor may vary by state or jurisdiction based on whether they serve a county or a multi-county district, the responsibility to represent the state or county in addition to prosecution, or local historical customs. District attorney and assistant district attorney are the most common titles for state prosecutors, and are used by jurisdictions within the United States including California, Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. State's attorney or state attorney is used in Connecticut, Florida (state attorney), Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont. In Maryland, the roles of Assistant and Deputy are reversed from those used in \\"District Attorney\\" jurisdictions, with Deputy State's Attorney being the primary subordinate to the elected State's Attorney and Assistant State's Attorneys being the line-level prosecutors of the office. In Kentucky and Virginia, the title is commonwealth's attorney. Commonwealth's attorneys are elected in their respective jurisdictions in both Virginia and Kentucky for terms of four years and six years, respectively. In St. Louis, Missouri, the title is circuit attorney, while in St. Louis County, Missouri, the title is prosecuting attorney. Assistant district attorney  The assistant district attorney (assistant DA, ADA) (or state prosecutor or assistant state's attorney) is a law enforcement official who represents the state government on behalf of the district attorney in investigating and prosecuting individuals alleged to have committed a crime. In carrying out their duties to enforce state and local laws, ADAs have the authority to investigate persons, issue subpoenas, file formal criminal charges, plea bargain with defendants, and grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals. Administrative assistant district attorney (admin ADA), executive assistant district attorney (exec ADA), chief assistant district attorney (chief ADA), or first assistant district attorney (First ADA) are some of the titles given to the senior ADA leadership working under the DA. The chief ADA or first ADA, depending on the office, is generally considered the second-in- command, and usually reports directly to the DA. The exact roles and job assignments for each title vary with each individual office, but generally include management of the daily activities and supervision of specialized divisions within the office. Often, a senior ADA may oversee or prosecute some of the larger crimes within the jurisdiction. In some offices, the Exec ADA has the responsibility of hiring lawyers and support staff, as well as supervising press-releases and overseeing the work of the office. The badge of an Assistant District Attorney in Genesee County, NY The salary of an ADA will be lower than the elected DA. The non-monetary benefits of the job induce many to work as an ADA; these include the opportunity to amass trial experience, perform a public service, and network professionally. Tuesday, 12 March 2019 Upon leaving employment as an ASA, persons seek employment as a judge, in private law firms, or as U.S. Attorneys.  Appeals  Depending on state law, appeals are moved to appellate courts (also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts in some states). During the appeals process district attorneys, in many cases, hands all relative prosecutorial materials to a state appellate prosecutor who in turn will represent the state in appellate courts with the advice and consent of the district attorney. District attorney investigators Some district attorneys maintain their own law enforcement arm whose members are sworn peace officers. Depending on the jurisdiction, they are referred to as district attorney investigators or county detectives.  Other jurisdictions  In England and Wales, the vast majority of criminal prosecutions are prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is appointed by the Attorney General for England and Wales. Within the CPS, 14 Chief Crown Prosecutors, answering to the DPP, head regional teams of Crown Prosecutors. With the exception of the AG and Solicitor General for England and Wales, no prosecutors are political officials in England and Wales and no prosecutor in England and Wales is a law enforcement official by virtue of their job. In Canada, the equivalent position to a district attorney is a crown attorney, crown counsel or crown prosecutor depending on the province, and the equivalent to an assistant district attorney is the assistant crown attorney, assistant crown counsel or assistant crown prosecutor respectively.

Now employed by NBC after nearly three decades (1976‚Äì2006) with ABC Sports, Michaels is known for his many years calling play-by-play of National Football League games, including nearly two decades with ABC's Monday Night Football and over a decade with NBC Sunday Night Football. He is also known for famous calls in other sports, including the Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter Olympics and the earthquake-interrupted Game 3 of the 1989 World Series. Michaels' move from ABC to NBC in 2006 was notable as it was part of an agreement between the two networks' parent companies, The Walt Disney Company and NBCUniversal, respectively, that allowed Disney to take ownership of the intellectual property of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBCUniversal. Early life and education Michaels was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, to Jay Leonard Michaels and Lila Roginsky/Ross. He grew up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. In 1958, Michaels's family moved to Los Angeles, the same year the Dodgers left Brooklyn. Michaels attended Arizona State University, where he majored in radio and television and minored in journalism. He worked as a sports writer for ASU's independent student newspaper, The State Press, and called Sun Devils football, basketball, and baseball games for the campus radio station. He also is a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. =Early career= Michaels's first job in television was with Chuck Barris Productions, choosing women to appear on The Dating Game. His first sportscasting job came in 1967, when he was hired to do public relations for the Los Angeles Lakers and serve as a color commentator on the team's radio broadcasts alongside veteran play-by-play announcer Chick Hearn; however, he was terminated after appearing on just four games. Michaels resumed his broadcasting career in 1968 after moving to Honolulu, where he worked as a sports anchor for KHVH-TV and called play-by-play for the Hawaii Islanders baseball team in the Pacific Coast League as well as the University of Hawaii's football and basketball teams and local high school football games; he was named Hawaii's \\"Sportscaster of the Year\\" in 1969. In 1970, Michaels appeared as attorney Dave Bronstein in an episode of Hawaii Five-O called \\"Run, Johnny, Run\\" (Air date: January 14, 1970); the episode also featured a young Christopher Walken. In 1971, Michaels moved to Cincinnati, where he became the lead announcer for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball. In 1972, after the Reds won the National League Championship Series and advanced to the World Series, Michaels helped to cover the Fall Classic for NBC Sports; he also was the network's play-by-play man for the hockey coverage at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. In 1973, after NBC announcer Bill Enis died from a heart attack at the age of 39 two days before he was assigned to call the regular-season NFL finale between the Houston Oilers and Cincinnati Bengals, Michaels was brought in to replace Enis in the booth with Dave Kocourek. In 1974, Michaels left the Reds for a similar position with the San Francisco Giants, and also covered basketball for UCLA, replacing Dick Enberg on the Bruins' tape-delayed telecasts of their home games, during a period when UCLA was in the midst of an 88-game winning streak. He left NBC that year and announced regional NFL games for CBS Sports in 1975. He called the no-hitter by John Candelaria on August 9, 1976. He signed with ABC Sports in January 1977. ABC Sports (1977‚Äì2006) Michaels initially joined ABC as the back-up announcer on Monday Night Baseball in 1976. The following year, he was promoted to the network on a full-time basis. He became the lead baseball announcer, replacing Keith Jackson in 1983. Over the next three decades, Michaels covered a wide variety of sports for ABC, including Major League Baseball, college football, college basketball, ice hockey, track and field events, horse racing, golf, boxing (such as the 1985 Marvin Hagler/Thomas Hearns fight), figure skating, road cycling, and many events of the Olympic Games as well as the Olympic trials. Episodes of Wide World of Sports featuring Michaels early in his ABC career have been featured at least two occasions on the ESPN Classic comedy series Cheap Seats. While at ABC, he aired many prominent events including serving as the studio host for the Stanley Cup Finals from ‚Äì. Also, he served as host for the yearly Tiger Woods Monday night specials that aired in July or August. =The Miracle on Ice= Two of Michaels's more famous broadcasts were of the 1980 Winter Olympics ice hockey medal round match between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the attempted third game of the 1989 World Series. In 1980, an unheralded group of college ice hockey players from the United States won the Gold Medal at the Olympic Winter Games. The medal round match on February 22‚Äîwhich, contrary to popular belief, did not yet assure the team of the gold medal‚Äîwas of particular interest, as it was played against a heavily favored professional squad from the Soviet Union, and was in front of an incredibly excited pro-American crowd in Lake Placid, New York. Michaels's memorable broadcast of this game, including his interjection‚Äî\\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\\"‚Äîas time expired on the 4‚Äì3 U.S. victory, earned the game the media nickname of The Miracle on Ice. Most assume that the game was broadcast live (indeed, CTV, which held Canadian rights to the game, aired it live); but in reality, the game started at 5:05 pm Eastern Standard Time and ABC decided against pre-empting local and network news (on the East Coast) to carry the game live. Instead, most of it‚Äîincluding the entire third period‚Äîwas broadcast within the regularly scheduled, prime-time telecast from 8:30 to 11 pm Eastern time (and on a six-and-a-half-hour delay on the West Coast from 8:30 to 11 pm Pacific Standard Time). Despite being on tape, the game was one of the highest-rated programs of the 1979‚Äì80 television season and remains the most- watched ice hockey game in the history of American television. Michaels, along with broadcasting partner Ken Dryden, recreated their Olympic commentary in the 2004 movie Miracle. Although Michaels and Dryden recreated the bulk of their commentary for the film, the closing seconds of the game against the Soviet Union used the original ABC Sports commentary from 1980. Gavin O'Connor, the director of Miracle, decided to use the last 10 seconds of Michaels's original \\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\\" call in the film because he felt he couldn't ask him to recreate the emotion he experienced at that moment. Thus they cleaned up the recording to make the transition to the authentic call as seamless as possible. Michaels later recalled, \\"When I look back, obviously Lake Placid would be the highlight of my career. I can't think of anything that would ever top it. I can't dream up a scenario.\\" Michaels was only on this particular assignment because he had done one hockey game, eight years prior. The game in question was the gold medal game (the Soviet Union vs. Czechoslovakia) of the 1972 Winter Olympics (on NBC) in Sapporo, Japan. Other announcers on the ABC Sports roster such as Keith Jackson, Frank Gifford, and Howard Cosell had never done a hockey game before. Michaels recalled this during a Real Sports interview in January 2009. Michaels also apparently beat out WABC-AM and New York Islanders commentator George Michael for the assignment. Two days later, Michaels would broadcast the gold medal game, in which the U.S. defeated Finland, closing the game out by declaring \\"This impossible dream comes true!\\" Michaels along with John Davidson would later call Games 1 and 4 of the Calgary‚ÄìLos Angeles Stanley Cup playoff series in 1993 for ABC. =Memorable baseball moments= 1972 National League Championship Series Even though the events of October 17, 1989, in San Francisco are widely considered to be the most dramatic baseball-related moment of Michaels's career, he had several others that were memorable. In the 1972 National League Championship Series, the defending World Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates faced the Cincinnati Reds. In Game 5, with both teams tied at two games apiece, the Pirates led 3‚Äì2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and were three outs away from advancing to the World Series. But Pirates closer Dave Giusti unraveled. He surrendered a game-tying home run to Johnny Bench before allowing back-to-back singles to Tony P√©rez and Denis Menke before being relieved by Bob Moose, who almost worked out of the jam by recording two outs. But with pinch-hitter Hal McRae at the plate, Moose lost his footing and uncorked a wild pitch sending George Foster, who was pinch running for P√©rez, home with the pennant-clinching run and setting off a massive celebration at Riverfront Stadium. 1985 World Series Perhaps Michaels's first historic call with ABC Sports while covering Major League Baseball occurred in what is now known by many as the Don Denkinger game. The Kansas City Royals trailed the St. Louis Cardinals 3‚Äì1 in a series that was panned for being low- scoring and dull. After a Royals win in St. Louis forced the action back to Kansas City, the sixth game was also low scoring. However, this contest grew into a tense pitcher's duel. In the bottom of the 9th, pinch-hitter Jorge Orta led off for the Royals against Cardinals pitcher Todd Worrell with Kansas City trailing 1‚Äì0 and hit a ground ball to first baseman Jack Clark. Clark threw over to pitcher Worrell, who was running over to cover first base in time to beat the speedy Orta and did. Yet first base umpire Don Denkinger still called Orta safe at first. Steve Balboni then hit a pop-up to first which Jack Clark missed for an error, keeping Balboni's at-bat alive, and he promptly singled to put men on first and second. The infamous and controversial leadoff single by Orta and the Jack Clark error eventually led to the Royals loading the bases and putting the tying run on third base and the winning run on second with one out for Dane Iorg. Iorg hit a 2-run single and the Royals came back to win 2‚Äì1. The Royals went on to win Game 7 11‚Äì0 and complete the comeback after being down 3 games to 1. However, it was Denkinger's dubious 'safe' call, and not Iorg's hit, Clark's error, Jim Sundberg's heroics (for his difficult slide past catcher Darrell Porter for the winning run) or the Game 7 blowout that were most remembered in years to come. 1986 American League Championship Series In 1986, Michaels was also on hand for what he says was \\"the greatest of all the thousands of games I've done.\\" On October 12 at Anaheim Stadium, Michaels along with Jim Palmer called Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. The California Angels held a 3 games to 1 lead of a best-of-seven against the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5‚Äì2 lead going into the ninth inning. Boston scored two runs on a home run by Don Baylor, closing the gap to 5‚Äì4. When Donnie Moore came in to shut down the rally, there were two outs, and a runner on first base, Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch. The Angels were one out from their first-ever trip to the World Series. But Dave Henderson hit a 2‚Äì2 pitch off Moore for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 6‚Äì5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore continued to pitch for the Angels. He was able to stifle a 10th inning Red Sox rally by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th-inning via a sacrifice fly by Henderson. The Angels could not score in the bottom of the 11th and lost the game 7‚Äì6. The defeat still left the Angels in a 3 games to 2 advantage, with two more games to play at Fenway Park. The Angels were not able to recover, losing both games by wide margins, 10‚Äì4 and 8‚Äì1. Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS ended with Calvin Schiraldi striking out Jerry Narron. Despite the fact that ABC Sports and ESPN had been under the same corporate umbrella (the Walt Disney Company) since 1996, Michaels never served as a regular commentator for ESPN Major League Baseball. The only time that Michaels appeared in an ESPN booth of any kind was as a guest commentator on Wednesday Night Baseball in 2003 as part of ESPN's Living Legends Series. Michaels joined Gary Thorne and Joe Morgan, whom he worked with on ABC's 1989 World Series coverage and served as ABC's #2 baseball team behind Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver in 1989, for a game at Dodger Stadium between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds. 1989 World Series On October 17, 1989, Michaels was in San Francisco, preparing to cover the third game of the 1989 World Series between the home team, the Giants, and the visiting Oakland Athletics. ABC's network telecast began with a recap of the first two games (to the soundtrack of James Taylor's \\"Hello Old Friend\\"), both won by Oakland. Soon after Michaels handed off to his broadcast partner, Tim McCarver, who started assessing the Giants' chances for victory in the game, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck (at approximately 5:04 pm local time). Michaels exclaimed \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth‚Äî\\" as the network feed cut out.\\"Earthquake\\". Time. Monday, October 30, 1989. Ed Magnuson. p. 2. Retrieved September 5, 2009.News report on MLB.COM, 1:50 minutes in. Retrieved August 29, 2009. When ABC restored audio via telephone 15 seconds later, Michaels quipped, \\"Well folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\\"\\"Earthquake\\". Time. Monday, October 30, 1989. Ed Magnuson. p. 3. Retrieved September 5, 2009. Michaels then reported from the ABC Sports production truck outside Candlestick Park on the earthquake, for which he later was nominated for an Emmy Award for news broadcasting. Michaels relayed his reports to Ted Koppel, who was stationed at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C. According to Tim McCarver, when the earthquake hit, he, Michaels and Jim Palmer immediately grabbed a hold of what they perceived to be the armrests. In reality, the announcers were clutching on each other's thighs and they were each left with bruises the next day. Years later (on a 1999 SportsCenter retrospective about the 1989 World Series earthquake), Al Michaels would boldly admit his strong belief that had the earthquake lasted much longer than 15 seconds, he would have been killed. Michaels added that the only time that he really had been scared during the earthquake was when he moved in a position which he perceived to be backward. The three announcers were sitting on a ledge with their backs turned and no bracing behind them. =Monday Night Football= Michaels's longest-running assignment was that of the lead play-by-play announcer on ABC's Monday Night Football telecasts, a position he held for 20 seasons beginning in 1986. Before that, his most notable NFL assignment for ABC was hosting (along with Jim Lampley) the pre-game coverage of Super Bowl XIX. In 1988, Michaels called his first Super Bowl. Three years later, Michaels was on hand to call the thrilling Super Bowl between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. Bills kicker Scott Norwood missed a potentially game-winning field goal, and thus, ensured the Giants victory. The trio of Michaels, Dan Dierdorf (who joined MNF the year after Michaels's first), and Frank Gifford lasted until the 1997 season when Gifford was replaced following disclosure of an extramarital affair. During the 1980s, Gifford would fill-in for Michaels on play-by-play whenever Michaels went on baseball assignments for the League Championship Series (1986 and 1988) or World Series (1987 and 1989). Former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason (who left after the 1999 season) replaced Gifford in 1998, and Dierdorf was dropped after that season. Unexpectedly, comedian Dennis Miller joined the cast in 2000 along with Dan Fouts. In 2002, following Miller and Fouts' departure, John Madden joined Michaels in a well- received pairing. =NBA on ABC= After disastrous ratings in the 2003 NBA Finals, ABC decided to revamp their lead NBA broadcast team. Brad Nessler was reassigned to the second broadcast team, where he was joined by Sean Elliott and Dan Majerle. Michaels was hired to replace Nessler as lead broadcaster of the NBA. For the first several weeks of the 2003‚Äì2004 season, Michaels had no partner. However, Doc Rivers, a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with Turner Sports, became available after a 1‚Äì19 start by his Orlando Magic. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC's Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, the team worked every single telecast, including the 2004 NBA Finals, which saw great improvement in television ratings. During the 2004 NBA Playoffs, Doc Rivers was hired by the Boston Celtics. Though Rivers continued to work games with Michaels throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC would have to find a new lead analyst for the 2004‚Äì2005 season. Early in the 2004‚Äì2005 season, ABC found a new partner for Al Michaels. Memphis Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, a broadcasting legend with CBS, TBS, and TNT, was forced into retirement due to health reasons and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers. Michaels and Brown began their partnership on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant game. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. Michaels became sporadic in NBA coverage, doing two games in early March, and then three more games in April. Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster Mike Breen. For the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Al Michaels and Hubie Brown were slated to remain as ABC's number one broadcast team. The duo worked that year's Christmas Day game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat and was expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, due to Michaels's impending departure to NBC, that plan did not come to fruition. Replacing Michaels on The NBA on ABC was Mike Breen, who became the lead broadcaster for an over-the-air NBA package for the first time in his career. Breen worked the 2006 NBA Finals with Hubie Brown, as well as all the main games ABC broadcast that year. This gave ABC its first consistent lead broadcaster since Brad Nessler, as Breen (unlike Michaels) did games every week. To put things into proper perspective, during his two-season tenure as ABC's lead NBA broadcaster, Michaels called just 13 of a possible 26 regular season games, with all but two games taking place from either Los Angeles (where he resides) or Sacramento. Besides his inconsistent work, Michaels (despite being initially seen as adding credibility to ABC's NBA broadcasts in contrast to his predecessor, Brad Nessler) was criticized for apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a \\"great, great contested shot\\") expected of a No. 1 play-by-play voice. Barry Horn of the Dallas Morning News said that Michaels was simply \\"not a basketball guy\\". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels \\"shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, 'Only five weeks to the [NFL] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!'\\" Another criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about. =Leaving ABC for NBC= In 2003, he was quoted as saying, \\"ABC Sports has been my professional home for the last 26 years, and I am delighted that will continue to be for several more...\\" after signing a long-term contract extension. In 2005, it was announced that Monday Night Football would be moving from ABC to ESPN beginning with the 2006 season, and partner John Madden announced he would be joining NBC Sports, which had acquired the rights to Sunday Night Football games. Despite speculation that Michaels might be joining NBC as well, Michaels stated that he would continue as the MNF play- by-play announcer, stating, \\"I feel like I'm a creature of Monday night. I'm home and I'm staying home.\\" Plans were for Michaels to be teamed with Joe Theismann (who would be coming over from Sunday Night Football) on the Monday night telecasts. At the time, then-ABC Television President Alex Wallau said, \\"For 26 years Al has played a pivotal role here at ABC Sports, and for 17 of those years he's been the face and voice synonymous with television's most successful sports franchise, Monday Night Football... It's Al's outstanding play-by-play coverage, coupled with his breadth of knowledge, experience and enthusiasm, that keep MNF fans invigorated, excited and coming back for more.\\" also, \\"Al Michaels has been invaluable to the Network and we are thrilled to have him remain in our family. [...] Al is the consummate professional and makes everyone around him better\\" said then-ABC Sports President Howard Katz; however, in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl XL, it was widely speculated that Michaels was attempting to get out of his contract with ESPN to join Madden at NBC. By this time, it was clear that NBC's Sunday Night Football would be the NFL's premier prime-time package, with ESPN's Monday Night Football relegated to secondary match-ups similar to that network's previous Sunday night telecasts. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he couldn't \\"respond to rumors ... because that would become a distraction.\\" On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its Monday Night Football team would consist of Mike Tirico on play-by-play, with Theismann and Tony Kornheiser as analysts. ESPN explicitly stated that Michaels would not return to either Monday Night Football broadcasts or ABC's NBA broadcasts (on which Michaels had been lead NBA play-by-play man). NBC Sports (2006‚Äìpresent) =\\"Traded\\" to NBC for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit= On February 9, 2006, NBC confirmed that Michaels would be joining Madden at the network to broadcast football on Sunday nights, thus ending Michaels's 20-year run on Monday Night Football and almost 30 years of service with ABC. In exchange for letting Michaels out of his contract with ABC and ESPN, NBCUniversal sold ESPN cable rights to Friday coverage of the next four Ryder Cups, granted ESPN increased usage of Olympic highlights, and sold to parent company Disney the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a cartoon character developed by Walt Disney himself (which he lost in 1928) but previously owned by Universal Pictures (now NBCUniversal). NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol explained, \\"We earn nothing from those rights; they've had no value in the United States.\\" Michaels had a bemused take on the \\"trade.\\" After it was noted to Michaels that the Kansas City Chiefs gave the New York Jets a draft pick as compensation for releasing coach Herman Edwards from his contract, Michaels stated, \\"Oswald is definitely worth more than a fourth-round draft choice. I'm going to be a trivia answer someday.\\" In an article with the magazine Game Informer, Warren Spector, a designer on the game Epic Mickey, stated that Disney CEO Bob Iger wanted Oswald to be in the game so badly, he made this trade to get the rights of the character back. Michaels and Madden began their new NBC tenure on August 6, 2006, with the network's telecast of the preseason Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, with their regular-season debut on September 7. Michaels had called Sunday Night Football, with John Madden from August 6, 2006 ‚Äì April 15, 2009. On April 16, 2009, Cris Collinsworth made an agreement with NBC to join Michaels on replacing Madden for Sunday Night Football. On February 1, 2009, Michaels called Super Bowl XLIII, his first Super Bowl telecast for NBC and seventh overall as a play-by-play announcer. Michaels is the third man to ever do play-by-play for an NBC broadcast of a Super Bowl, following the footsteps of Curt Gowdy and Dick Enberg. Michaels would also call Super Bowl XLVI on February 5, 2012, Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015, and Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018. Remarkably, Michaels usually eats his dinner along with the rest of America while doing play-by-play commentary during a typical broadcast of Sunday Night Football. =NBC Olympic Daytime host= In March 2009, it was announced that Michaels would be serving as the daytime host for NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was Michaels's first involvement in an Olympic telecast since he called ice hockey at the 1988 Calgary Games for ABC, as well as his first non-NFL event for NBC. NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said that Michaels had previously expressed an interest in contributing to the network's Olympics coverage. Michaels also co-hosted NBC's coverage of the Closing Ceremony (with Bob Costas). Michaels also served as daytime co-host (with Dan Patrick) for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and co-hosted the Closing Ceremony (with Costas and Ryan Seacrest). For the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Michaels served as weekday host on NBCSN and weekend daytime host on NBC. He returned to host daytime coverage for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. =Premier Boxing Champions= In January 2015, NBC announced that Michaels would be at ringside along with Marv Albert and Sugar Ray Leonard for the PBC on NBC Saturday night bouts. In partnership with Haymon Boxing, NBC would televise 20 PBC on NBC events (beginning on March 7), including five to be shown in prime time on Saturday nights. MLB Network (2011) On July 8, 2011, Michaels teamed up with Bob Costas (with the two announcers alternating between play-by-play and color commentary) to call a game between the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants on MLB Network. It was Michaels's first appearance on a baseball telecast since August 6, 2003 (when he served as a guest commentator on an ESPN game, as previously mentioned) and his first as a primary announcer since Game 5 of the 1995 World Series on ABC. (Michaels had called Games 1, 4 and 5 of that series with Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver, while Costas called Games 2, 3 and 6 with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker for NBC.) Michaels and Costas also made appearances on SportsNet New York and Comcast SportsNet Bay Area during the game's middle innings, since the MLB Network broadcast was blacked out in the Mets' and Giants' respective home markets.

David Michaels has produced such programs as NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games, Triple Crown and Fox Sports Net's Beyond the Glory series. In March 2011, Michaels accompanied New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his wife, Myra, to Israel to visit Kraft Family Stadium in Jerusalem, an American football venue and home to three teams in the Israeli Football League, which is sponsored by the Kraft family. It was one of Myra Kraft's last trips before becoming sick with the cancer that would ultimately cause her death on July 20, 2011. Michaels was arrested and charged for driving under the influence on April 21, 2013. He was released after about five hours. He eventually pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to 80 hours of community service plus probation. In 2014, Michaels released his autobiography titled You Can't Make This Up: Memories and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television, which reached The New York Times Bestseller List for nonfiction. In popular culture It was Michaels who explained to Peter Jennings that Jennings had been the victim of a prank call in the final hour of O. J. Simpson's Bronco chase, after the Bronco had pulled into Simpson's driveway and parked. The prankster, claiming to be watching Simpson inside the van, described what he said to be the scene in perfect Stepin Fetchit dialect, then signed off with \\"...and Baba Booey to y'all.\\"\\"Great Moments In Al Michaels History\\", Deadspin.com, n.d. Michaels, unlike Jennings, understood the prankster's use of the term as an association of being a Howard Stern fan. Michaels himself is a Howard Stern fan, and has discussed that prank call as a guest on Stern's show. As previously mentioned, Michaels had an acting role in a 1970 episode of Hawaii Five-O, and has appeared as himself in the films Jerry Maguire and BASEketball, as well as on several TV shows including Coach and Spin City. Also as previously mentioned, his call of the U.S. hockey team's victory in the 1980 Olympics can be heard in the 2004 film Miracle. Michaels re-recorded all his original play-by-play coverage for the film, except for the immortal line. Brian d'Arcy James portrayed Michaels in the 2002 television movie Monday Night Mayhem. Michaels has also been lampooned on several occasions by noted impressionists, Frank Caliendo and Billy West as well as in the Family Guy episode \\"Mother Tucker\\". Michaels was also the featured voice in Hardball 3, a popular computer baseball game for PC. He was also featured, along with John Madden, in the Madden NFL series from Madden NFL 2003 to Madden NFL 09. Michaels also appeared in two episodes of Arliss, portraying the older cousin of sports agent Arliss Michaels. Notable broadcasts Unless otherwise noted, Michaels was the play-by-play announcer. *1972 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey *1972 National League Championship Series *1972 World SeriesAl Michaels ‚Äì ABC Sports Journalist ‚Äì Nationwide Speakers Bureau *1979 World Series (Games 3‚Äì5) *1980 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey (\\"Miracle on Ice\\") *1981 World Series (Games 3‚Äì5) *1983 World Series *1984 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey *Super Bowl XIX (1985, co-host with Jim Lampley) *1984 Summer Olympics athletics and road bicycle racing *1985 World Series *112th Kentucky Derby (1986, host) *111th Preakness Stakes (1986, host) *123rd Belmont Stakes (1986, host) *1986 American League Championship Series *113th Kentucky Derby (1987, host) *112th Preakness Stakes (1987, host) *124th Belmont Stakes (1987, host) *1987 World Series *Super Bowl XXII (1988) *1988 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey *114th Kentucky Derby (1988, host) *113th Preakness Stakes (1988, host) *125th Belmont Stakes (1988, host) *1988 NLCS *1989 Sugar Bowl *115th Kentucky Derby (1989, host) *114th Preakness Stakes (1989, host) *126th Belmont Stakes (1989, host) *1989 World Series *1990 Sugar Bowl *116th Kentucky Derby (1990, host) *115th Preakness Stakes (1990, host) *127th Belmont Stakes (1990, host) *1991 Sugar Bowl *Super Bowl XXV (1991) *117th Kentucky Derby (1991, host) *116th Preakness Stakes (1991, host) *128th Belmont Stakes (1991, host) *1992 Sugar Bowl *118th Kentucky Derby (1992, host) *117th Preakness Stakes (1992, host) *129th Belmont Stakes (1992, host) *119th Kentucky Derby (1993, host) *118th Preakness Stakes (1993, host) *1993 Stanley Cup Finals (host) *130th Belmont Stakes (1993, host) *120th Kentucky Derby (1994, host) *119th Preakness Stakes (1994, host) *131st Belmont Stakes (1994, host) *Super Bowl XXIX (1995) *121st Kentucky Derby (1995, host) *120th Preakness Stakes (1995, host) *132nd Belmont Stakes (1995, host) *1995 World Series (Games 1, 4‚Äì5) *122nd Kentucky Derby (1996, host) *121st Preakness Stakes (1996, host) *133rd Belmont Stakes (1996, host) *123rd Kentucky Derby (1997, host) *122nd Preakness Stakes (1997, host) *134th Belmont Stakes (1997, host) *124th Kentucky Derby (1998, host) *123rd Preakness Stakes (1998, host) *135th Belmont Stakes (1998, host) *125th Kentucky Derby (1999, host) *124th Preakness Stakes (1999, Host) *1999 Indianapolis 500 (host) *136th Belmont Stakes (1999, host) *Super Bowl XXXIV (2000) *126th Kentucky Derby (2000, host) *125th Preakness Stakes (2000, host) *2000 Indianapolis 500 (host) *2000 Stanley Cup Finals (host) *137th Belmont Stakes (2000, host) *2001 Indianapolis 500 (host) *2001 Stanley Cup Finals (host) *2002 Stanley Cup Finals (host) *Super Bowl XXXVII (2003) *NBA on Christmas Day 2004: Los Angeles Lakers vs Miami Heat *2004 NBA Finals *NBA on Christmas Day 2005: Los Angeles Lakers vs Miami Heat *2005 NBA Finals *Super Bowl XL (2006;
