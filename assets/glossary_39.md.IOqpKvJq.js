It became Rowan College of South Jersey on July 1, 2019 as the result of a merger with Rowan College at Gloucester County. The historic merger is the first of its kind in New Jersey.  History  Founded in 1966, Cumberland County College was the first community college in the state to open its own campus. The State of New Jersey, in 1962, passed the New Jersey County College Act, after which the Cumberland County Board of Chosen Freeholders authorized the founding of a community college. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 10, 1965. The original campus, which cost $2.7 million to construct, consisted of three buildings. Today, the 90-acre RCSJ Cumberland Campus consists of 12 buildings, including: Phillip Alampi Science Center, Frank Guaracini Jr. Fine and Performing Arts Center, George P. Luciano Family Center for Public Service and Leadership, Shirlee and Bernard Brown University Center, and Paul Navone Healthcare Education Center. On October 17, 1966, the college opened its doors to offer nine associate degree programs to approximately 350 enrolled students. The college's first class of graduates, in 1968, numbered 151. The Class of 2017, the largest in Cumberland County College's history, numbered 758.  University Center  In May 2006, Bernard Brown and his wife Shirlee donated $1 million to establish an endowment to assist with the operating costs of a facility that would enable students to earn a bachelor's or master's degree on Cumberland County College's campus. The $6 million Shirlee and Bernard Brown University Center opened in February 2008. The modern 17,423-square-foot facility features 12 classrooms, study areas and offices. The University Center marked its 10th anniversary in 2018 by hosting an inaugural Distinguished Alumni Induction ceremony.  Satellite locations  Rowan College of South Jersey maintains two additional education and training facilities in Cumberland County. The Paula J. Ring Education Center in Millville, which opened in 2013, houses the Workforce and Community Education division; and 2017 saw the opening of the Arts and Innovation Center in Millville, containing the Clay College studio and gallery, educational and training classrooms, and entrepreneurial space.

Collingwood He was recruited by Collingwood from North Reservoir after he had initially trained with, and had been rejected by Essendon.It is a matter of record that, paradoxically, Essendon struggled in the ruck for much of Thompson's career. Combining great physical size (200 cm, 95.5 kg) with tremendous athleticism, he provided Collingwood with a formidable around the ground presence.Despite this, Thompson was able to avoid National Service, through the agency of the medical examiner declaring that he had a foot problem that rendered him unfit for military service. Thompson played a total of 272 VFL games and scored 217 goals for Collingwood between 1965 and 1978, winning the club's best and fairest award a record 5 times, as well as the 1972 Brownlow Medal. Players Strike In 1970 he and Des Tuddenham, vice captain and club captain respectively, refused to play for Collingwood, going on strike to protest at the perceived unfair salaries being paid to lure interstate players east.Pies legend Len Thompson dies  Herald Sun While this protest resulted in temporary souring the relationship between Thompson and the Collingwood football club, Thompson returned to a leadership position quickly, as vice-captain 1973-7 and captain 1978. South Melbourne and Fitzroy Thompson later played seasons for both South Melbourne (20 games and 39 goals in 1979) and Fitzroy (13 games, 19 goals, 1980). However, in all of his sixteen season, 305-game VFL career with three senior clubs, he failed to play in a premiership team, despite appearing in four grand finals: the 1966 Grand Final (which Collingwood lost by one point), the 1970 Grand Final (which, despite being 44 points in front at half-time, Collingwood lost 10 by points), and the 1977 First Grand Final (which was a drawn match), and the 1977 Grand Final Replay (which Collingwood lost by 27 points) . Interstate football Thompson was a regular Victorian interstate representative, and achieved All Australian selection after the 1972 Perth Carnival. He served on the Collingwood board in 1982 and 1983. Thompson was selected as the first ruck in Collingwood's 'Team of the Century'. Death On 18 September 2007, Thompson died at the home of his former wife after a heart attack. He is survived by six children ‚Äì Kari- Anne, Nicolas, Sam, Lachlan, Laura and Emily ‚Äì and former partners Julie, Susi and Bronwyn. That day was 42 years after Thompson's debut for Collingwood. Funeral Len Thompson's funeral took place at Melbourne's St Paul's Cathedral at 10.30am on Thursday 25 September 2007. Conducted by The Dean, The Very Reverend David Richardson, it was attended by more than 1,200 mourners, led by his six children and including notable members of the AFL fraternity, friends and fans. Sons Nicolas, Sam and Lachlan contributed a poem and personal reflections, daughter Laura delivered a eulogy and Emily read a scripture (John 14: 1‚Äì6). Tributes were delivered by Barry Breen (St. Kilda) & Gary Dempsey (Footscray and North Melbourne), Peter McKenna (Collingwood), John Nicholls (Carlton), Des Tuddenham (Collingwood), Mike Williamson (former professional athlete and HSV 7 television commentator) and Eddie McGuire (Collingwood FC President) all of whom had long, close friendships with 'Thommo'. Musical contributions were made by tenor Peter Brocklehurst (Ave Maria), Kate Ceberano (Wind Beneath My Wings) and Mike Brady sang 'One Day in September' in which he varied the lyrics to sing 'Thommo, you were part of this old town; In life you were the best man on the ground'. The service ran for two hours and was a moving and celebratory tribute to one of the humblest champions to have consistently played at the elite level of any Australian sport.

It became one of the two last strongholds of Norwegian resistance in southern Norway during World War II, the other being Hegra Fortress. Background Under the command of Second Lieutenant Thor O. Hannevig, the Norwegians held their position against superior German forces until 5 May 1940. Hannevig managed to sneak great loads of arms, equipment and fuel from depots right in front of the German forces. The equipment was brought to Vinje and V√•gsli in Telemark, where Hannevig established a unit which came to be known as Telemark Infantry Regiment. This included Krag-J√∏rgensen bolt action rifles, Madsen light machine guns, Colt M/29 heavy machine guns, mortars as well as mines and explosives to destroy bridges and roads. The plan was to prevent German advance westward through Telemark and Setesdal, and to support Allied reinforcements from the west. Battle A full mobilization was carried out in the area, and at most the force totaled around 300 men, but the number changed constantly. Several small battles were fought, mostly involving Norwegian ambushes on advancing German formations, using small arms and IEDs. The Norwegian defenders often destroyed and/or damaged bridges and roads in the area to delay the German advance. The main battle took place from 3‚Äì5 May. Large German forces were eventually deployed to the area, and the German losses were considerable. When it was realized that the entire south of Norway was lost, and that the Allied √Öndalsnes task force would not break through from the west, Hannevig initiated negotiations for surrender. The battles of Vinjesvingen had a great symbolic effect during the occupation, and provided a moral boost to a rather depressing occupation. It was however not known to the rest of the country while the battles were fought.

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected Kendrick in the tenth round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2006. He has played in MLB for the Angels from 2006 to 2014, Los Angeles Dodgers from 2015 to 2016, the Philadelphia Phillies in 2017 and the Nationals from 2017 to present. In 2011, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game. While primarily a second baseman throughout his career, he has also played first base and left field. Early life Kendrick and his two sisters, Christina and Michelle, were raised by their grandmother in Callahan, Florida while their mother, Belinda, served in the US Army. When Kendrick was 12 years old, he began living with his mother. Kendrick eventually found that he and his mother \\"didn't get along very well\\" and moved in with another family. Kendrick attended West Nassau High School in Callahan. He was an undersized high schooler at and and did not have the benefit of being able to play travel ball. He played before recruiters from several colleges but received no interest until he enrolled at St. Johns River Community College in Palatka, Florida, where he was named Conference Player of the Year. It was by chance that Angels scout Tom Kotchman discovered him there in 2002. \\"My goodness, the kid hit the ball,\\" he recalled. \\"I couldn't believe there weren't other scouts there. And other JCs cut this guy? What were they thinking?\\" Professional career=Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected Kendrick in the tenth round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. Baseball America named him the best prospect in the Texas League in 2005, calling him \\"the clear standout\\" in a league that also featured Kendrys Morales, Erick Aybar, and Andre Ethier. He was named the 12th top prospect by Baseball America in 2006. Kendrick playing for the Salt Lake Bees in 2009 Kendrick made his MLB debut on April 26, 2006, as the starting second baseman for the Angels against the Detroit Tigers. He was hitless in four at-bats in the game. His first hit was a line drive single to center off Barry Zito of the Oakland Athletics in his next start, on May 1. Kendrick hit his first home run against Shawn Camp of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on July 26. He hit .285 with 4 homers and 30 RBIs in 72 games during that season. Kendrick had a one- on-one collision with actor Ben Affleck during his rookie season in the stands on the first base side of Fenway Park. On a foul ball that was hit towards where Affleck was sitting, Kendrick beat Affleck to the ball, recording the out. Fans sitting nearby booed Affleck for not taking the ball away from Kendrick. The event landed Kendrick's picture in People magazine. In an edition of the syndicated Access Hollywood, Kendrick presented Affleck an autographed baseball for his birthday. After the incumbent starter, Adam Kennedy, signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Cardinals during the 2006-2007 offseason, Kendrick became the Angels starting second baseman for 2007. He batted .322 in 88 games and again batted over .300 in 2008. Kendrick struggled in the first half of the 2009 season, batting only .239 with 4 homers, and was optioned to the minors. After returning from the minors, Kendrick hit extremely well, batting .358 in the second half with a .558 slugging percentage. Los Angeles Angels in 2011 Kendrick extended his positional versatility in the 2011 season, seeing time at first base and left field in addition to his usual place at second base. In 2011, Kendrick was selected to serve as an American League reserve in the 2011 All-Star Game. He joined teammates Jered Weaver, and Jordan Walden as the Angels' representatives in Phoenix, Arizona. Through the All-Star break on July 10, Kendrick was hitting .302/.360/.462 with 8 home runs, 9 stolen bases, and 29 RBIs in 301 at-bats. On January 7, 2012, Kendrick agreed to a new four-year contract worth $33.5 million, making him the Angels' second baseman through the 2015 season. Kendrick had a strong 2012 season, batting .287 with 8 home runs and 67 RBIs. On July 30, 2013, Kendrick got his 1,000th career hit in a game versus the Texas Rangers. Kendrick would improve on his 2012 campaign with an even stronger 2013, batting .297 with 13 home runs and 57 RBIs. In 2014, he hit .292 with 7 homers and 75 RBIs. Los Angeles Dodgers Kendrick with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 On December 10, 2014, the Angels traded Kendrick to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Andrew Heaney. Kendrick suffered a strained hamstring in a game on August 9 and did not return from the disabled list until September 18, though the injury would continue to bother him for the rest of the season. As a result, he played in only 117 games for the Dodgers (his lowest total since 2009) and hit .295 with 9 homers and 54 RBI. He received a qualifying offer for one year of $15.8 million, but declined it. On February 4, 2016, Kendrick re-signed with the Dodgers on a two-year, $20 million contract. Kendrick and his agent blamed the fact that he declined the qualifying offer and thus would require any team claiming him to give up a draft pick with the lack of interest in him from other teams during his free agency. With Chase Utley getting most of the work at second base, Kendrick played primarily in left field but also saw time at third base and first base in addition to second. He appeared in 146 games and hit .255/.326/.366 with eight homers and 40 RBI. For the season, he had the highest ground ball percentage (61.0%), and the lowest fly ball percentage (19.6%), of all major league hitters. Philadelphia Phillies Kendrick was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Darin Ruf and Darnell Sweeney on November 11, 2016.Los Dodgers Dodgers trade Howie Kendrick to Philadelphia Phillies for Darin Ruf and Darnell SweeneyPhillies upgrade lineup with trade for Dodgers castoff Howie Kendrick On April 18, 2017, Kendrick was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a strained right abdomen. Washington Nationals On July 28, 2017, the Phillies traded Kendrick and cash considerations to the Washington Nationals for McKenzie Mills and international signing bonus money. On August 13, Kendrick hit his first grand slam, a walk-off in the bottom of the 11th, against the San Francisco Giants. He batted .293 that season, finishing with 7 HR and 25 RBI. He primarily played left field. He re-signed with the Nationals after the season for two years and $7 million plus incentives. On May 19, 2018, Kendrick ruptured his Achilles, ending his season early. He finished the season batting .303 with 4 HR and 12 RBIs. Kendrick participated in 121 regular season games in 2019, finishing with a batting average of .344 in 330 at bats, alongside 62 RBIs and 17 home runs, second-most of any season in his career. He primarily played first base. On October 9, 2019, in Game 5 of the National League Division Series, Kendrick hit a grand slam in the 10th inning off of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Joe Kelly to give the Nationals a 7-3 lead that held up as the final score, advancing the Nationals to the National League Championship Series. It was just the second extra-innings grand slam in MLB postseason history, the other being hit by Nelson Cruz in the 2011 American League Championship Series. In the National League Championship Series, Kendrick went 5 for 15 with 4 doubles and 4 RBIs in the Nationals' four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, earning him the National League Championship Series MVP award. In Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, Kendrick hit a go-ahead home-run off of Will Harris that struck the screen on the right field foul pole. His efforts paid off as the Nationals won 6-2, giving them their first championship in franchise history. Kendrick won the 2019 Heart and Hustle Award. Kendrick became a free agent after the 2019 season, but on December 9, 2019, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said he had signed a new deal to stay with the Nationals.

The Warsaw Pact was seen by the West as having an aggressive force outnumbering the NATO forces. Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a few tank designs. In comparison, NATO adopted a defensive posture. The major contributing nations, France, Germany, the USA, and the UK developed their own tank designs, with little in common, while the smaller nations of NATO purchased or adapted these designs. After World War II, tank development continued largely as it had been because of the Cold War. Tanks would not only continue to be produced in huge numbers, but the technology advanced dramatically as well. Tanks became larger and their armour became thicker and much more effective. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances in shell design and terminal effectiveness. However, most contemporary tanks in service still have manually breech-loaded guns, a trait of the earliest tanks which is shared with most self-propelled and field guns. Many of the changes in tank design have been refinements to targeting and ranging (fire control), gun stabilisation, communications and crew comfort. Armour has evolved to keep pace with improvements in weaponry, and guns have grown bigger. But there have been no fundamental changes. After World War II, tank design budgets were cut and engineering staff was often scattered. Many war planners believed that with the advent of nuclear weapons the tank was obsolete, given that a tactical nuclear weapon could destroy any brigade or regiment, whether it was armoured or not. The Korean War proved that tanks were still useful on the battlefield, given the hesitation of the great powers to use nuclear weapons. In the 1950s, many nations' tanks were equipped with NBC protection, allowing mechanized units to defend against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, or to conduct breakthroughs by exploiting battlefield nuclear strikes. The last medium tanks After World War II a few last medium tanks designs were constructed and mass produced before the main battle tank idea was fully accepted; these vehicles were highly similar to early main battle tanks with powerful guns and decent armor but still retaining decent mobility. The American M26 and M46 and the Soviet T-44 and T-54 are some examples (albeit the M26 and T-44 were being massed produced before the end of World War Two). Development of the main battle tank Centurion Mk 3 main battle tank at Eastbourne Redoubt Medium tanks gradually evolved into the new concept of the main battle tank. This transition happened gradually in the 1950s, as it was realized that medium tanks could carry guns (such as the US 90 mm gun, Soviet 100mm D-10 tank gun, and especially the British L7 105 mm gun) that could penetrate any practical level of armour at long range. The World War II concept of heavy tanks, armed with the most powerful guns and heaviest armour, became obsolete since they were just as vulnerable as other vehicles to the new medium tanks. Likewise, World War II had shown that lightly armed, lightly armoured tanks were of little value in most roles. Even reconnaissance vehicles had shown a trend towards heavier weight and greater firepower during World War II; speed was not a substitute for armor and firepower. M48 Patton T-72B with thick \\"Dolly Parton\\" composite armor on the turret front An increasing variety of anti-tank weapons and the perceived threat of a nuclear war prioritized the need for additional armor. The additional armour prompted the design of even more powerful cannons. The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the 'Universal tank', filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were well armed and highly mobile, but cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The classic main battle tanks of the 1950s were the British Centurion, the Soviet T-55 series, and the US M47 and M48 series, which saw continuous updates throughout the Cold war. For example, the Centurion began life with the highly effective 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun, but was upgraded to 20 pounder (84 mm) and then 105 mm main armament by 1959, with improved fire control and new engines. The Russian T-55 started with a 100 mm gun, but has been upgraded with both 115 mm and 125 mm guns, much improved fire control systems, new engines, track, etc. The M47 series evolved through to the M60 series. The first Soviet main battle tank was the T-64T-64 manual (\\"–¢–∞–Ω–∫ –¢-64–ê. –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –ø–æ —ç–∫—Å–ø–ª—É–∞—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏. 1984\\") state T-64 as \\"main battle\\" tank, while previous T-62 and T-55 (in corresponding military manuals, like \\"–¢–∞–Ω–∫ –¢-62. –†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —ç–∫—Å–ø–ª—É–∞—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏. 1968\\") stated as \\"medium\\" tanks while the first American MBT was the M48 Patton.MIL-T-45308 state \\"Tank, Main Battle, 105MM Gun, M60\\", while MIL-T-45148 state \\"TANK, COMBAT, FULL-TRACKED, 90MM GUN, M48A2\\" These vehicles and their derivatives formed the bulk of the armoured forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War; many remain in use in the 21st century. Light tanks 258x258px Light tanks, such as the Soviet PT-76, maintained limited roles such as amphibious reconnaissance, support of Airborne units, and in rapid intervention forces which were not expected to face enemy tanks. The US M551 Sheridan had similar strengths and weaknesses, but could also be airdropped, either by parachute or LAPES. The value of light tanks for scouting has been diminished greatly by helicopters, although many continued to be fielded. During the early Cold War the US wielded the more conventional M41 Walker Bulldog. From the mid-late Cold War Infantry Fighting Vehicles such as the Soviet BMP and US M2 Bradley to an extent replaced light tanks, being similar to the extent that they are lesser armed and armored but lighter and cheaper than main battle tanks. At the end of the Cold War light tank-like armored cars were designed such as the South African Rooikat and the Italian B1 Centauro which have seen service in the post-Cold War era. Heavy tanks M103A2 heavy tank at Bovington tank museum in the UK Heavy tanks such as the T-10 continued to be developed and fielded along with medium tanks until the 1960s and 1970s, when the development of anti-tank guided missiles and powerful tank guns rendered them ineffective. The combination of large HEAT warheads, with a long effective range relative to a tank gun, and with high accuracy meant that heavy tanks could no longer function in the stand-off, or overwatch role; much cheaper antitank guided missiles could fill this role just as well. Medium tanks were just as vulnerable to the new missiles, but could be fielded in greater numbers and had higher battlefield mobility. The development of antitank weapons and countermeasures An Israeli M60 Patton tank destroyed in the Yom Kippur War. After the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israeli tanks were destroyed in large quantities by man-portable wire-guided missiles (ATGMs) fired by Egyptian infantry, concerns were raised on the vulnerability of tanks on the battlefield to antitank weapons. Subsequent analysis showed that Israeli forces had underestimated their opponents during the first phases of the war; their all-tank tactics ignored the newfound ability of Infantry armed with cheap AT weapons to stop tanks. Tactically, there was renewed recognition for the need for combined-arms tactics. This led to greater mechanization of Infantry and advanced artillery tactics and warheads. Tanks alone were vulnerable to Infantry, but a combined team of tanks, mechanized Infantry, and mechanized artillery could still win in the new environment. In 1974, the United States initiated a programme to modernise its existing tank fleet and start real mass production of the M60A1, and later the M60A3; at the same time the M1 was developed. Budgets for tank design and production picked up during the administration of president Ronald Reagan, following tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. In response to infantry-portable and vehicle-mounted ATGMS, ever more capable vehicle armour were developed. Spaced armour, composite, explosive reactive armour, and active protection systems--like the Russian Shtora, Drozd, and Arena--were added to old and new tanks. Despite these improvements the larger missiles remained highly effective against tanks. Missile armed tanks SS.11 anti- tank missile-launcher version of the French AMX-13. The U.S. M551 Sheridan was an amphibious air-mobile light tank with a 152 mm gun/missile launcher. During the latter half of the 20th century, some tanks were armed with ATGMs (Anti- Tank Guided Missiles) which could be launched through a smoothbore or (in the case of \\"Shillelagh\\") a rifled main gun barrel with a provision to prevent imparting \\"spin\\" to the missile. In the U.S., the M60A2, M551 Sheridan, and prototype MBT-70, with 152 mm barrel/launchers used the Shillelagh infrared- guided missile. During WWII a few tanks designs such as the M4 Sherman were modified to carry unguided rockets on the turret in addition to their main gun. This concept was to a limited extent carried into the Cold War with ATGMs; examples include the French AMX-13 and the Swedish Strv 81 (the Swedish version of the British centurion), both modified to carry SS.11 missiles on the top and sides of the turret, respectively. The MBT-70 was cancelled prior to production due to high cost, and superseded by the M1 Abrams, which used a conventional gun. The M551 and the M60A2 were widely considered disappointing due to problems of overall complexity, sensitive advanced electrical systems (some components of which involved the Shillelagh guidance system) and issues related to the conventional rounds with combustible cases, though the Sheridan would serve into the 1990s before finally being withdrawn. The M60A2's were eventually replaced by M60A3s using conventional 105 mm guns. The Soviet Union put gun-launched missiles into service in the mid-1970s, which continue to be used in CIS forces. Tanks capable of firing gun-launched missiles in Russian service include the T-72, T-80, T-90, and upgraded T-55 (T-55AM2). Ukraine also employs missile-armed T-64, T-80, and T-84 tanks. History in the Cold War=Korean War M24 Chaffee Marine M26 Pershing tanks in Korea. USMC M46 Patton, 8 July 1952. Note the different rear plate and twin fender-mounted exhausts. In the Korean War M24 Chaffees were the first U.S. tanks to fight the North Korean T-34-85s. The Chaffee fared poorly against these much better- armed and armored medium tanks. Chaffees were more successful later in the war in their reconnaissance role, supported by heavier tanks such as the M4 Sherman, M26 Pershing, and M46 Patton. The heavier but older Pershing was deemed unsatisfactory due to its inferior mobility, which was unsuitable for a medium tank role as it used the same engine that powered the much lighter M4 Sherman, and 1949, the upgraded M26 received a new power plant and a main gun with bore evacuator, and the M46 Patton designation. Less than a thousand were upgraded to M46 standard. Marines of 1st Marine Division at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir supported by M46 Patton tank. On 8 August 1950 the first M46 Pattons landed in South Korea. The tank proved superior to the much lighter North Korean T-34-85, which were encountered in relatively small numbers. By the end of 1950, 200 M46 Pattons had been fielded, forming about 15% of US tank strength in Korea; the balance of 1,326 tanks shipped to Korea during 1950 included 679 M4A3 Shermans, 309 M26 Pershings, and 138 M24 Chaffee light tanks.Steven J. Zaloga \\"M26/M46 Pershing Tank 1943‚Äì1953\\" pp.39-40 Subsequent shipments of M46 and M46A1 Pattons allowed all remaining M26 Pershings to be withdrawn during 1951, and most Sherman equipped units were also reequipped.Donald W Boose Jr.\\"US Army Forces in the Korean War 1950-53\\" pp.52,75-86 By 1953 the M24 Chaffees were completely replaced by the M41 Walker Bulldog, which was rushed to the battlefield by the U.S. Army. The Walker Bulldog saw limited combat during the Korean War, but the conflict served as a testing ground to work out the M41's deficiencies, especially with its rangefinder. M41 Walker Bulldog British Centurion tanks, assisted by Cromwells in the reconnaissance role, arrived in Korea in late 1950. The UK tanks had to operate in much colder conditions than their usual deployments on the North German Plain. The Centurions covered the retreat at the battle of the Imjin River with the tanks from C Squadron, 8th Hussars, under the command of Major Henry Huth and by 55 Squadron, Royal Engineers. The British position on the Imjin river \\"was deemed safe\\" but vulnerable in case of an attack which prove to be case, and the tanks were able stand their ground in the battle. The Centurions were also in Operation Commando and were used to capture high ground earning praise from the commander of I Corps. Thereafter the war was largely static and the Centurions were used as artillery against the infantry attacks which generally happened at night.Centurion 1943-2003 p18-20 Interwar The M47 Patton was intended to replace the M46 Patton and M4 Sherman tanks. It had a 90 mm gun and a crew of 5. Despite it being the primary tank of the US it never saw combat while in US service. In early 1951, the U.S. initiated the design of the M48 Patton, designated the T-48 with a 90 mm cannon.Hunnicutt/p. 85 & 152 The T48 featured a new turret, new redesigned hull and an improved suspension. The hull machine gunner position was removed, reducing the crew to 4. On 2 April 1953, the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM), standardized the last of the Patton series tanks as the M48 Patton. Nearly 12,000 M48s were built from 1952 to 1959. The early designs, up to the M48A2, were powered by a gasoline 12-cylinder engine which was coupled with an auxiliary 8-cylinder engine. The gas engines gave the tank a short operating range and were prone to catching fire when hit; this version was considered unreliable. M103 at Ft. Lewis The M103 heavy tank was manufactured at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant and the first units were accepted in 1957. The M103 was designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks. Its long-ranged 120 mm cannon was designed to hit enemy tanks at extreme distances, although it was never used in combat. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines.Hunnicut/Firepower The tank was relatively underpowered and the drive systems were fragile. The turret of the M103 was larger than that of the M48 or the M60 to make room for the huge 120 mm gun and the two loaders assigned to it, in addition to the gunner and the commander. The driver sat in the hull. The gun was capable of elevation from +15 to -8 degrees. The British introduced their Heavy Gun Tank F214 Conqueror with the same 120mm gun as the M103 into service in 1955. It stayed in service until 1960; the upgrading of Centurion tank to the L7 105mm gun having removed its purpose. While the US Army deactivated its heavy armor units with the reception of the new M60 series main battle tanks in 1960, the remaining M103s stayed within the US Marine Corps inventory until they began receiving the M60 series MBT. With the disappearance of the heavy tank from US forces came the full acceptance of the main battle tank in 1960 for the US Army, and later for the US Marine Corps.Hunnicutt The British successor to Centurion was Chieftain in 1966. Chieftain was heavily armoured and had a 120mm gun following a doctrine of long range fire and survivability that would be needed against the more numerous Warsaw Pact tanks in the event of an invasion of West Germany. Vietnam War era One of two PT-76s from the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment, destroyed by US M48 Pattons, from the 1/69th Armored battalion, during the battle of Ben Het, March 3, 1969, Vietnam.Starry Tanks for the most part, saw limited action in Vietnam compare to the heavy fighting in Korea, but even in the Vietnam jungle the M48 Patton saw tank-to-tank duels. On March 3, 1969, the Special Forces camp at Ben Het was attacked by the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment. The 202nd was tasked with the mission of destroying the camp's 175 mm self-propelled guns.Starry, p. 153 One of the PT-76s had detonated a land mine, which not only alerted the camp, but also lit up the other PT-76s attacking the firebase. Flares had been sent up, thus exposing adversary tanks, but sighting in on muzzle flashes, one PT-76 scored a direct hit on the turret of a M48, killing two Patton crewmen and wounding two more. A second Patton, using the same technique, destroyed a PT-76 with their second shot. At daybreak, the battlefield revealed the wreckage of two PT-76s and one BTR-50 armored personnel carrier. U.S. Marines riding atop an M48 tank, Vietnam, April 1968. The M48s saw extensive action during the Vietnam War, over 600 Pattons would be deployed with US Forces during the war.Starry/Hunnicutt The initial M48s landed with the US Marines in 1965.Dunstan Remaining Pattons deployed to South Vietnam were in three U.S. Army battalions, the 1-77th Armor near the DMZ, the 1-69th Armor in the Central Highlands, and the 2-34th Armor near the Mekong Delta. Each battalion consisted of approximately fifty seven tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam, until replaced by M551 Sheridan tanks. The M67A1 flamethrower tank (nicknamed the Zippo) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966. When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their M41 Walker Bulldog units. During the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) Easter Offensive in 1972, tank clashes between NVA T-54/PT-76 and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace, but on 23 April 1972, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new 9M14M Malyutka (NATO designation: Sagger) wire guided anti-tank missile. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in 1973. In the mid-1970s, the M48A5 upgrade was developed to allow the vehicle to carry the heavier 105 mm gun. This was designed to bring the M48s up to speed with the M60 tanks then in regular use. Most of the M48s were placed into service with reserve units by this time. By the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out. The M48s performed admirablyNolan in Vietnam in the infantry-support role. However, there were few actual tank versus tank battles. The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and rocket-propelled grenades. USMC M67A2 \\"Zippo\\" in action near Da Nang, Vietnam. M48A5 Patton with an M48A3 commander's cupola. The plans were laid in the US in the late fifties, for a tank with a 105 mm main gun and a redesigned hull offering better armor protection. The resulting M60 largely resembled the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences. The M60 mounted a bore evacuated 105 mm main gun, had a hull with a straight front slope whereas the M48's hull was rounded, had three support rollers per side to the M48's five, and had road wheels constructed from aluminum rather than steel. The hull of the M60 was a single piece steel casting divided into three compartments, with the driver in front, fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the rear.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html The driver looked through three M27 day periscopes, one of which could be replaced by a night vision periscope. Initially, the M60 had essentially the same turret shape as the M48, but this was subsequently replaced with a distinctive \\"needlenose\\" design that minimized frontal cross-section to enemy fire. The M60 was the last US main battle tank to utilize homogeneous steel armor for protection. It was also the last to feature either the M60 machine gun or an escape hatch under the hull. Originally designated the M68, the new vehicle was put into production in 1959, reclassified as the M60, and entered service in 1960. Over 15,000 M60s (all variants) were constructed. In 1963, the M60 was upgraded to the M60A1. This new variant, which stayed in production until 1980, featured a larger, better-shaped turret and improvements to the armor protection and shock absorbers. The M60A1 was also equipped with a stabilization system for the main gun. However, the M60A1 was still not able to fire on the move, as the system only kept the gun pointed in the same general direction while the tank was traveling cross country. It did however enable the coaxial machine gun to be brought to bear while moving. XM551 Sheridan The M551 Sheridan was initiated when the replacement for the M41 Walker Bulldog, the T92 Light Tank, was canceled. The need for even lighter weight to make the tank transportable presented the design with a particularly difficult problem; guns capable of defeating modern tanks at reasonable ranges were so large that they demanded a large vehicle to carry them, so large that they couldn't be used as a \\"light\\" tank. The use of HEAT rounds instead of conventional penetrating ammunition could address this, but HEAT rounds work better at larger calibers. Gun weight is typically the product of caliber and muzzle velocity, so in the case of the XM551 they sacrificed the muzzle velocity, producing the low-velocity but relatively large-caliber 152 mm M81. HEAT rounds fired by the M81 could defeat any contemporary tank at shorter ranges, but its low velocity made it difficult to use at longer ranges, especially against moving targets. The large low- velocity gun was also ideal for infantry support, where higher performance anti-tank guns would often fire right through soft targets and their small- caliber guns left little room for explosive filler. The M551 Sheridan tank would thus be ideal for both direct fire support as well as short-distance anti-tank engagements. The only niche where the M551 Sheridan was not ideal was the medium and long-range anti-tank engagement. The muzzle velocity was so low that a HEAT round fired at longer ranges would have to be \\"lofted\\", making aiming difficult, and the flight time would be so long that a moving target would be very difficult to hit. However, it appeared there was a solution to this problem by equipping the tank with gun-fired anti-tank missiles. For longer range engagements a missile would be fired instead of a HEAT round, and although its velocity would also be relatively slow, the guidance system would make a hit highly likely anyway. The M551 Sheridan appeared to offer the best of both worlds; for infantry support the large calibre gun allowed it to fire full-sized artillery rounds and canister shot, while also giving it reasonable short-range anti-tank performance from the same gun. The M551 Sheridan had a steel turret and aluminum hull. It was powered by a large diesel engine. The M551 thus had excellent mobility, able to run at speeds up to 45 mph, which at that time was unheard of for a tracked vehicle. Swimming capability was provided by a flotation screen. Production started on late July 1966, and entered service in June 1967. More than 1,600 M551s were built between 1966 and 1970. Total cost of the M551 program was $1.3 billion. The vehicle proved to be very noisy and unreliable under combat conditions. The armor was thin enough that it could be penetrated even by heavy machine gun rounds as well as being highly vulnerable to mines. Firing the gun would often adversely affect the delicate electronics, which were at the early stages of transitioning to solid state, so the missile and guidance system was omitted from vehicles deployed to Vietnam. The gun had problems with cracks developing near the breech after repeated firing. Most field units were modified to help address the problem but gun also was criticized for having too much recoil for the vehicle weight, the second and even third road wheels coming clear off the ground when the main gun fired. The Sheridan saw extensive action in the Vietnam War, being assigned to nearly all armored cavalry squadrons in country. In 1969, armored cavalry units began replacing their M48 Patton tanks. The battle reports from the troops were sometimes glowing, while the reports higher up the chain of command were often negative. A 1969 evaluation of the vehicles found the M551 was employed in reconnaissance, night patrol and road clearing, accumulating 39,455 road miles and 520 combat missions, with a ready rate of 81.3 percent. Despite vulnerability to rockets and mines, it was judged worth applying modifications and equip all cavalry squadrons with the Sheridan. Washer evaluation 1969. The Sheridan was much appreciated by the infantry who were desperate for direct-fire support, which generally served in combination with ACAVs (M113s) as armored cavalry units consisted of both M113s and M551s as part of their TO&E.; Armor units consisted solely of tanks (minus headquarters company) and Mechanized Infantry units consisted solely of M113s. In this role the real problem with the Sheridan was its limited ammunition load of only 20 rounds and 8 missiles (though M551s in Vietnam service were not equipped with missiles or their guidance equipment, increasing the basic load of conventional rounds). A common field-modification was to mount a large steel shield, known as an \\"ACAV set\\" (Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle), around the commander's 50-cal. (12.7 mm) gun, allowing it to be fired with some level of protection. The driver has an unusual rotating hatch which has vision blocks when rotated forward. Included with the set was an extra layer of steel belly armor which was bolted onto the vehicle's bottom, although only covering from the front to halfway to the end, possibly due to weight reasons. A standard modification made during the mid-70's was the addition of the \\"Cereal Bowl\\" commander's cupola. This mod came about due to the broken rib effect that occurred when the Sheridan fired conventional rounds, the recoil would pitch the TC against the armor plating resulting in cracked ribs. Post-Vietnam The US Army began to phase out the Sheridan in 1978, although at the time there was no real replacement. Nevertheless, the 82nd Airborne were able to keep them on until 1996. The Sheridan was the only air-deployable tank in the inventory, and as an elite force they had considerably more \\"pull\\" than general infantry and armor units who were forced to get rid of them. Their units were later upgraded to the M551A1 model, including a thermal sighting system for the commander and gunner. A C-130 delivering an M551 Sheridan tank using LAPES (Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System). The Sheridan's only air drop in combat occurred during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989, when fourteen M551's were deployed; four were transported by C-5 Galaxies and ten were dropped by air, but two Sheridans were destroyed upon landing.Doyle, p. 44, 46 The Sheridans' performance received mixed reviews. They were lauded by their operators and some commanders as providing firepower in needed situations to destroy hard targets. However, the Sheridans' employment of only HEAT rounds limited their effectiveness against reinforced concrete construction. Fifty-one Sheridans were deployed in the Gulf War as some of the first tanks sent. They would not be very effective against the Russian-built T-72s. Their role was limited by age and light armor to reconnaissance duties, possibly 6 or less Shillelagh missiles were firedDoyle, p. 4 at Iraqi bunkers, these fewer than a half-dozen missiles, were the only time that the Shillelagh had been fired in a combat environment, from the inventory of the aforementioned 88,000 missiles produced. Several attempts to upgun or replace the Sheridan have been made, but none were successful. Several experimental versions of the Sheridan mounting a new turret carrying a 105 mm gun were made, but the resulting recoil was too great. Several possible replacements for the M551 were tested as a part of the XM8 Armored Gun System and Expeditionary tank efforts of the early and late 1980s respectively, but none of these entered service. The Stryker Mobile Gun System has replaced the light tank role of the United States. Marines from Company D, 2nd Tank Battalion, drive their M60A1 main battle tank during a breach exercise in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The tank is fitted with reactive armor and an M-9 bulldozer kit. During the 1960s, the US and West Germany entered a joint project for a new tank common to both armies and intended to enter service in the 1970s. The MBT-70 project was technically advanced with sophisticated suspension, a low silhouette, spaced armor and advanced gun systems but suffered from excessive costs and the Germans pulled out of the project at the end of the decade. After Vietnam, the M60 Patton was upgraded and designated the M60A2. It featured an entirely new low-profile turret with a commander's machine-gun cupola on top, giving the commander a good view and field of fire while under armor but spoiling the low profile. It also featured a 152 mm cannon, which fired conventional rounds as well as guided missiles. The M60A2 proved a disappointment, though technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped. Most of the M60A2 tanks were rebuilt as M60A3.Patton Mania M60 In 1978, work began on the M60A3 variant. It featured a number of technological enhancements, including smoke dischargers, a new rangefinder, and M21 ballistic computer, and a turret stabilization system. In addition it reverted to the 105 mm cannon. All active American M60s eventually underwent the conversion to the A3 model. The M60A3 was phased out of US service in 1997.Development and History of the M-60 tank An XM1 Abrams, during a demonstration at Fort Knox, Kentucky in 1979. The German Leopard tank, another 105mm armed tank, was introduced in 1965. It was sold widely to several nations in NATO as well as worldwide. It was followed in 1979 by the Leopard 2 with a 120mm smoothbore gun. In 1976, prototypes of a new tank which became the M1 Abrams were delivered by Chrysler Defense and General Motors armed with a 105 mm rifled cannon. The Chrysler Defense design was selected for development as the M1. In 1979, General Dynamics Land Systems Division purchased Chrysler Defense. The M1 Abrams came from the diverted funds from the over budget and impractical MBT-70 and XM815 projects. The M1 was the first of its kind. It feature a low profile turret and for the first time ever on a tank, composite Chobham armor. Despite all these advances, the Abrams still retained the 4-man crew of the M60 Patton as the autoloader was considered unproven and risky. It was armed with the same L7-derived 105mm gun as the M60. Over 3200 M1 Abrams were produced and first entered US Army service in 1980. About 6,000 upgraded M1A1 Abrams were produced and used the German 120 mm smoothbore cannon, improved armor, and a CBRN protection system. As the Abrams entered service in the 1980s, they would operate alongside M60A3 Patton. These exercises usually took place in Western Europe, especially West Germany, but also in some other countries like South Korea. During such training, Abrams crews honed their skills for use against the Soviet Union. However, by 1991 the USSR had collapsed and the Abrams would have its trial by fire in the Middle East. The British FV4030/4 Challenger, continuing with a 120mm rifled gun for long range accuracy and the use of widest type of rounds, and protected by Chobham armor entered service in 1983. Gulf War/Iraq war US Army recognition poster of T-54/55 series tanks The Gulf War saw the US Marines still deploying obsolete M60 Pattons while the rest of the tank forces had Abrams. The Iraqi forces were initially regular army units, equipped with tanks such as T-54/55 tanks and T-62s. The Coalition main battle tanks, such as the U.S. M1 Abrams, British Challenger 1, Canadian leopard 2, and Kuwaiti M-84AB were vastly superior to the Chinese Type 69 and domestically built T-72 tanks used by the Iraqis, with crews better trained and armoured doctrine better developed. 3rd Armored Division along the Line of Departure. The majority of Iraqi armored forces still used old Chinese Type 59s and Type 69s, Soviet-made T-55s from the 1950s and 1960s, and some poor quality Asad Babil tanks (domestically assembled tank based on Polish T-72 hulls with other parts of mixed origin). These machines were not equipped with up-to-date equipment, such as thermal sights or laser rangefinders, and their effectiveness in modern combat was very limited. The Iraqis failed to find an effective countermeasure to the thermal sights and sabot rounds used by Coalition armour. This equipment enabled them to engage and destroy Iraqi tanks from more than three times the range that Iraqi tanks could engage coalition tanks. Some Iraqi crews even fired training rounds at the U.S. and British tanks. These rounds (purchased in great number during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War due to their inexpensive cost) had soft steel penetrators and thus no hope of penetrating the advanced Chobham Armour of the Coalition tanks. In the Iraqi war in 2003, an Iraqi division the 6th Armored Division of the Iraqi Army.RJ Lee, Key Components of the Iraqi Ground Forces, 2002 which was equipped with T-55s and BMP-1s defending the control of key bridges over the Euphrates River and the Saddam Canal at Nasiriyah, were decimated by US Marines with M1 Abrams, and the division as a unit rendered incapable for combat during the Battle of Nasiriyah in March 2003, during the invasion. In addition to the T-54/55 and T-62 tanks that Iraq had, the most feared to US armoured forces were the T-72 tanks in the Iraqi forces. Only Republican Guard divisions were equipped with Iraqi-modified T-72s. Many of the Iraqi T-72s were dug-in or hidden in groves, and then used to ambush the US or British tanks. In the war, the Iraqi T-72s were the preferred target for Apache helicopters and A-10s, in an attempt to diminish the combat power of Republican Guard divisions. The only chance for the Asad Babil T-72s against American tanks was to lure them to close range combat, or trying to ambush them from dug-in positions.Scales, page 269: \\"As TF 1-37th Armor crossed over the ridge into the heart of the Iraqi defensive zone, the Iraqi commander's carefully disposed rear-slope defense stripped Dyer's tanks of their range advantage. Within 1,000 meters, a row of dug-in T-72s and BMPs suddenly appeared below the crest. All were hull-down in prepared positions behind thick dirt walls (thus disproving the much-quoted u.s. truism that soviet tanks had difficulties in achieving 'hull down' position). Now the Americans were well within Iraqi killing range, and although the Soviet-made night sights were markedly inferior, things could still get very dicey.\\" An Asad Babil abandoned after facing the final US thrust into Baghdad But even in those conditions, the M1s usually prevailed, as proven in circumstances like the Battle of Baghdad, and the drive to the capital, where dozens of Iraqi MBTs were obliterated,Scales, page 270: \\"After the war they (TF 1-37th) returned to count the burned-out hulks of 76 T-72s, 84 BMPs, 3 air defense artillery pieces, 8 howitzers, 6 command vehicles, 2 engineer vehicles, and myriad of trucks.\\" or near Mahmoudiyah, south of Baghdad, April 3, 2003, (Iraqi Freedom) when US tanks engaged their counterparts from just 50 yards, shattering seven enemy T-72s without losses.Conroy & Mars, p. 158 The Lion of Babylon T-72 was utterly outclassed by the M1 Abrams, the Challenger and by any other contemporary Western main battle tank during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The college was established in 1966 as Gloucester County College. In 2014 the college changed its name to Rowan College of Gloucester County when Rowan University and Gloucester County College entered into a partnership. The college then expanded in 2019, combining Rowan College at Gloucester County (RCGC) and Cumberland County College to become Rowan College of South Jersey. The college now offers conditional dual enrollment with Rowan University depending on GPA. While then GCC took the Rowan name, the community college maintains its independence with its own Board of Trustees and administration. RCSJ has articulation and credit transfer agreements with many area and online colleges and universities, and several dual enrollment agreements. Academic areas include Nursing and Allied Health (an area with selective admissions, unlike most other programs), the Gloucester County Police Academy and related degrees, and continuing education. As of February 2012, RCSJ has about of grounds on the main Gloucester Campus, on which are twelve buildings, two of which include the headquarters of other Gloucester County organizations. It has an art gallery, a walking and jogging trail, and community gardens. Student life at the college includes KotoriCon, an anime convention, as well as many other activities. History The voters of Gloucester County had passed a non-binding referendum in 1965, calling for the Board of Chosen Freeholders to start a community college in the county. Gloucester County College was established in 1966, when the New Jersey Department of Education approved its charter. Buildings The first classes were taught in the summer of 1967 at Monongahela Middle School and Deptford Township High School. The first building owned by RCSJ was the Instructional Center. It was completed in 1970, and the first classes were taught there in the fall of that year. Other past building projects include the College Center (opened in January 1971), the Library (dedicated in October 1988), the Health Sciences building and the Police Academy (begun in 1993), and Scott Hall, which houses the chemistry and biology classrooms and laboratories (began in 2001 and dedicated in September 2002). Presidents Charter President William L. Apetz began his tenure in September 1966. He retired from RCGC in 1980 and went on to be the first president of Sussex County Community College, another County College in New Jersey. The second president was Gary L. Reddig, who was appointed in July 1980 and resigned on 31 October 1986, giving two reasons. First, he wished to assume the position of director of the County Community College Presidents Association of New Jersey. Second, he alleged that the then chair of the Board of Trustees, Richard J. Ambacher, Jr. (now a professor emeritus of Rowan University), had pressured him to get Ambacher's son a custodial job at the college and his daughter-in-law into the nursing program, which has selective admissions; he also claimed that Ambacher had otherwise interfered in college operations. Ambacher denied the allegations, and stated that he had only asked that the nursing program's admissions standards be altered to avoid bias against non-traditional students. One trustee resigned in sympathy with Reddig. A state investigation resulted in a report and letter recommending that the relationship between the Board of Trustees and the school be changed (including requiring the college president's approval for hiring done by the board), that trustee quorum requirements be increased, and that trustee training and selection be improved. The investigation did not find Reddig's allegations correct. One member of the Board of Chosen Freeholders asked for Ambacher's term as a trustee not to be renewed; Ambacher responded that this was a political maneuver in the context of an upcoming election. Ambacher did not seek another term as trustee after his existing term ended in November 1987, stating that this was due to health reasons (diabetes exacerbated by stress). There was considerable dismay at RCGC over these events, especially with accreditation renewal coming in spring 1987. Richard H. Jones was the third president, serving from 4 October 1987 until his retirement on 1 February 1998. He had been a vice-president at RCGC, then acting president after Reddig's departure. The fourth president was Gail O. Mellow, who was selected prior to Jones' retirement and worked with him from 1 November 1997 until his retirement. She served as president until she left to become president of LaGuardia Community College on 1 August 2000. The fifth president was William F. Anderson, who had previously served as vice president, then as interim president. He resigned in July 2007, but stayed with RCGC as the food science program administrator. Russell A. Davis was the sixth president from September 2008 until his resignation on 13 April 2011. He had earlier been vice president of student services, then acting president after Anderson's resignation. On 29 April 2011 Davis was charged with eleven counts of forgery of a signature to obtain loans from his pension/retirement account (similar to the loans allowed from a 401(k)); the prosecutor's office has not accused Davis of theft of college property. The current president is Frederick Keating, who had been serving as interim president. He was previously RCSJ's vice president of student services and before that superintendent at the Gloucester County Institute of Technology (GCIT). Problematic periods There has been tension between faculty and administration on two occasions: a strike was threatened in 1989 over pay; further tension in 2002 was settled largely by Lalaji S. Deshbandhu, the late president of the RCSJ Faculty Association. The first years of the late-2000s recession were also difficult. In 2008 the workweek was cut to four days during the summer, more buildings were closed during breaks, and there was increased scrutiny of purchases. RCSJ (including RCSJ Foundation) investment revenue went from $636,391 per year in 2007 to $202,805 per year in 2009. RCSJ's nursing program had difficulties in 1997‚Äì98, with lower pass rates (78% in 1998, and below 80% in 1997) on state examinations for nursing qualifications. These led to it being put on probation by the state. Changes made that elevated the pass rate to 93% for May‚ÄìSeptember 1999, taking the school from the bottom 20% of two-year nursing programs to the top 25%. Organization and administration The college's governing body is the Board of Trustees. Eight trustees are appointed by the Gloucester County Administrator and Board of Chosen Freeholders; two are appointed by the Governor of New Jersey; the eleventh trustee is the county Superintendent of Schools, a voting ex officio member; and the college president is a non-voting ex officio member.  RCGC's annual budget in 2009 was $39,388,473. The college is financially dependent primarily on money from Gloucester County and the State of New Jersey (about 49.1% of revenue in 2009), followed by funds from student tuition and fees (about 35.2% of revenue in 2009). The RCGC Foundation holds the college's endowment ($4,761,853 as of 31 December 2018). Most income from the endowment is used to provide scholarships. RCGC's Health Sciences Building The academic divisions of RCGC are: * Division of Allied Health and Nursing * Division of Business Studies * Division of Health, Physical Education and Recreation (also includes Exercise Science) * Division of Liberal Arts * Division of Public Safety and Security (Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement) * Division of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) * Other Areas (including continuing education, some certificate programs, the Police Academy, and the Fire Academy) Articulation and credit transfer agreements exist with 27 area or online four-year colleges and universities. These include Rowan University, Farleigh Dickinson University, Wilmington University, Temple University, Penn State University, the University of Maryland University College (UMUC), Thomas Edison State College, Drexel University, and Rutgers University. RCGC offers dual enrollment with Rowan, Farleigh Dickinson,* * Wilmington, and UMUC (generally only for some programs and majors). Stephen M. Sweeney, President of the New Jersey Senate, has called for other community colleges in South Jersey to follow RCGC in having dual enrollment agreements with Rowan. Academics=Admissions Most of RCGC's programs are open to anyone with a high school diploma or GED; some opportunities to take for-credit courses are available to high school students and others. (RCGC has links with the Gloucester County Institute of Technology (GCIT) and, to a lesser degree, with other high schools in the county.) There are, however, selective admissions for Nursing, Allied Health, and Automotive Technology. Enrollment and demographics The college awarded 819 associate degrees and 15 academic certificates in 2009‚Äì2010. Of the 1561 first-time, full-time students starting in 2007, 350 had graduated with associate degrees and 351 transferred (for example, to a four-year college or university) by 2010. The total percentage of 44.9% was the third highest among the nineteen New Jersey County Colleges (NJCCs); the median was 35.3%. Among all students in 2010, the percentage enrolled in remedial courses was 28.9% (seventh among the nineteen NJCCs; the median is 28.1%); among first-time, full-time students, the percentage was 63.3% (tenth among the nineteen NJCCs; the median is 63.3%). Enrollment in for-credit courses was 6,609 in 2010; of these, 1,557 (about 23.6%) were first-time, full-time students, and altogether 60% were full-time. 33.5% of RCGC's students in 2010 were between 18 and 21 (48.5% of full-time students and 10.6% of part-time students). In 2010, about 17% of RCGC's students came from outside Gloucester County; 99.5% were from New Jersey. In 2011, 170 of RCGC's students were veterans; On G.I. Jobs magazine‚Äôs 2012 list of Military Friendly Schools, and on two lists from previous years, RCGC was ranked in the top 15% of universities, colleges, and trade schools nationwide for enrolling veterans as students. Adjunct professors make up about 77.4% of the faculty. About 61.8% of course sections are taught by adjuncts or staff members rather than full-time faculty. RCGC ranks ninth out of the nineteen NJCCs in the proportion of course sections not taught by full-time faculty; the median is 60%. Tuition/fees and financial aid Tuition and fees at RCSJ are lowest for Gloucester County and Cumberland County residents, intermediate for other New Jersey residents, and highest for others. In this, the college follows the way other county colleges in New Jersey favor their counties or pairs of counties. The total of tuition plus fees for in-state but out-of-county full- time students at RCSJ in 2011‚Äì2012 was less than the in-county rates charged by all but three other county colleges in New Jersey. The same was true of part-time (twelve credits per year) rates, compared with those of all but two other county colleges in New Jersey. Over 40% of students entering RCGC in 2010 received some form of financial aid. The most common source was a federally funded Pell Grant, received by about 34% of students. Approximately 1% received financial aid from the RCGC Foundation in 2010. Accreditation and programs Gloucester County College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Higher Education. Some programs at RCGC are also accredited by other agencies. These include: * Nursing (including RN and LPN to RN, with an Associate of Science in Nursing) accredited by the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC); * Diagnostic Medical Sonography, accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs; * Nuclear Medicine Technology, accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Educational Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology; * Paralegal degree and certificate programs, accredited by the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Legal Assistants. RCGC also includes the Gloucester County Police Academy, and associate degrees in Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice are available. The Dean of the Police Academy is Fred H. Madden, who is also a New Jersey State Senator. (Such dual office-holding has been questioned by Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey.) Nursing and Allied health professions includes respiratory therapy, partially through cooperation with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Nursing and Allied Health are areas in which RCGC operates selective admissions. In its 2010 survey, Community College Week ranked RCGC 9th nationwide in the number of associate degrees awarded to education majors and 35th nationwide in the number of associate degrees awarded in parks, recreation, leisure, and fitness studies. As well as face-to-face education, distance learning and hybrid (blended) distance and face-to-face learning are available for some courses using the Blackboard system. RCGC's Scott Hall (the Virginia N. Scott Center for Science and Technology), location of the biology and chemistry laboratories In fall 2010 the top ten programs by numbers enrolled were: # Associate of Arts in Arts & Sciences (general; meant for transfer) # Associate of Science in Business administration # Associate of Arts in Education # Associate of Arts & Sciences in Criminal justice # Associate of Arts in Psychology # Associate of Applied Science in Law enforcement # Associate of Science in Arts & Sciences (general; meant for transfer) # Associate of Science in Biology # Associate of Science in Nursing (selective admissions) # Associate of Science in Exercise science Academic calendar RCGC uses a modified semester system. It has fall and spring semesters together with shorter winter and summer terms; the latter are further broken up into overlapping sessions of variable lengths (five weeks at the most for the winter term). A higher proportion of the winter and summer courses are blended/hybrid or distance education. As well as weekdays (including late afternoon and evening), courses are offered on Saturdays and Sundays. Continuing education Registration for continuing education courses totaled 35,773 in 2009, counting each course separately. A survey conducted by South Jersey Biz named RCGC \\"Best of Biz 2011\\" in the professional development category for its computerized office administration, network management, accounting, web development, and information technology programs. RCGC offers subsidized ($25 or less registration fee and no class fee) courses to local residents in areas such as English as a Second Language, Adult Basic Education, and GED test preparation. * It offers free classes in basic computer skills to employees of local businesses, in health information technology for a limited number of students, and in logistics. As with for- credit courses, GCC has traditional in-person, hybrid/blended, and purely online continuing education courses. Campus RCGC is close to Route 47 ( away by car) and Route 55 ( away by car). It is from Woodbury (Gloucester County's county seat), from Washington Township (Gloucester County's largest municipality), from Camden, New Jersey, and from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It has a bus stop that is on New Jersey Transit bus routes 408 and 463. Buildings and usage RCGC's campus of about has twelve buildings as of February 2012; all are accessible by wheelchair. A University Center building is under construction. It is planned to use it from the fall of 2012 for RCGC classes in the daytime and dual enrollment undergraduate and graduate classes at night. Other buildings include Scott Hall, the Eugene J. McCaffrey, Sr. College Center, the Library, and the Early Childhood Education Center, which offers daycare services for children aged to students, faculty, staff, alumni, and Gloucester County residents. The entire campus is non-smoking except for specifically designated areas. Some other Gloucester County organizations are headquartered at RCGC. The Gloucester County Community Service Corps (a branch of the Senior Corps) and the Volunteer Center of Gloucester County are in the Instructional Center building, * * In the College Center building there is the Center for People in Transition, a Displaced Homemaker program from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs' Division on Women that serves former homemakers who have lost that role through bereavement, divorce, or other separation from a money-providing spouse. The center concentrates on women, and it is not clear whether a former househusband would be eligible. A number of its services, such as some of its workshops, are not restricted to displaced homemakers. When funding is available, the center also provides services to military spouses whose partners are overseas in Iraq or Afghanistan. * Inside the College Center building is the Dr. Ross Beitzel Art Gallery, with a permanent collection valued at over $250,000. It is on display both in the gallery and throughout the campus and is the longest-running art exhibit among community colleges in New Jersey. Art exhibitions are sometimes held there. RCGC trail Grounds The grounds are part of the Gloucester County Educational Campus (GCEC), which also includes GCIT's campus. RCGC's campus includes over of walking and jogging trail (available for use by visitors as well as students, faculty, and staff) that goes through part of the forested area of the campus; it has 76 trail markers, for which GPS coordinates are available, and a map of the college course at an entrance to the trail. The grounds are also used for the Community Gardens project, which started in 1973 and allows county residents to rent small plots of RCGC land to raise vegetables, flowers, and other plants. The rental money goes to the RCGC Foundation to help provide scholarships. Off-campus sites Two portions of RCGC are located off of the main campus. The first is the automotive technology program, most of which is located on the neighboring Gloucester Institute of Technology campus as part of the cooperation between RCGC and GCIT, with the additional involvement of the Ford Motor Company; it includes both classroom courses (some taken at RCGC's main campus) and paid internships. The second is the Gloucester County Fire Academy, located in Clarksboro, New Jersey. Student life Services for RCGC students include free short-term psychological counseling; on the counseling staff is a licensed clinical psychologist. The Student Assistance Center also provides workshops on topics such as stress management. Student organizations The Student Government Association, together with its advisor, distributes funding to other student organizations. RCGC has an active local chapter (Alpha Psi Pi) of the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society. Also active are the Student Veterans Organization, the Vanguard Fine Arts Club, and many other student clubs. People at KotoriCon in front of the College Center KotoriCon One of the active student clubs at RCGC is the Japanese Anime Guild (JAG). They have held an annual anime convention called KotoriCon since January 2010. In addition to anime, KotoriCon includes video game tournaments, panels (with voice actors, for instance), cosplay events and competitions, Japanese swordplay and other martial arts demonstrations, Jedi events, music video contests, a charity auction, comedians, origami displays, concerts, and Japanese dance contests. The JAG Club sponsored a concert by Shonen Knife on 23 October 2011 as a prelude to KotoriCon. * Sports The college's sports teams, known as the Roadrunners, have earned five NATYCAA (National Association of Two-Year College Athletic Administrators) Cups for the best overall non-scholarship two-year college in the nation, and thirty national championships in National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Division III. The Roadrunners compete in NJCAA Region XIX and are members of the Garden State Athletic Conference. The college now offers 16 sports: Baseball Basketball (Men's) Basketball (Women's) Cross County (Men's & Women's) Soccer (Men's) Soccer (Women's) Golf (Men's) Softball Tennis (Men's) Tennis (Women's) Track & Field (Men's & Women's) Volleyball (Women's) Wrestling Golf (Women's) National championships were won by these teams: * Men's Basketball ‚Äì 1994 * Baseball ‚Äì 1992, 1993, 1999, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013 * Wrestling ‚Äì 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2007 * Women's Cross Country ‚Äì 2006, 2012 * Men's Cross Country ‚Äì 1995 * Men's Tennis ‚Äì 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 * Softball ‚Äì 2011, 2012 * Women's Tennis - 2012, 2013, 2014 * Men's Track & Field - 2014, 2018, 2019 * Women's Track & Field - 2013 Website for Athletics is www.RCRoadrunners.com.

That year, incumbent Governor Roberto S√°nchez Vilella had a serious dispute with the leaders of the PPD and was barred from seeking a second term as Governor under the party's insignia. Negr√≥n was then chosen as the new candidate for Governor of Puerto Rico. However, Governor S√°nchez had founded a new party, the People's Party, and was also seeking reelection. This caused a division inside the PPD that caused the defeat of both S√°nchez and Negr√≥n. Instead, Luis A. Ferr√© of the New Progressive Party was elected Governor. This was the first electoral defeat ever for the PPD. Later and death After the elections of 1968, Negr√≥n retired from public life. Negr√≥n L√≥pez died on September 18, 1991 when he was 82 years old. He was buried at the Sabana Grande Masonic Cemetery in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico. The town of Sabana Grande named the high school after him.

It is located approximately east of the town centre.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth Between 1920 and the Second World War, Carlyon Bay was the site of the New Cornish Riviera Lido and large sports facilities. After the war it became known as the Cornish Leisure World. A large venue, the Cornwall Coliseum, opened in the 1950s, it hosted exhibitions, tennis tournaments and concerts by musicians, but lost its importance with the opening of the Plymouth Pavilions in 1991.Praising 20 years of the Pavilions, Plymouth Herald, 16 September 2011. The venue continued until early 2003 when only the Gossips nightclub remained open, until its closure too shortly after. The building stood, falling into disrepair, until demolition began in April 2015. Since the 1990s there have been plans for development of homes and a resort complex. The area surrounding the bay was a centre of the mining industry and is now a golf course. The South West Coast Path runs along the cliff top and across the golf course. The Cliff Head Hotel was established in 1934 and stood until its demolition in 2017. Carlyon Bay is also the site of the Carlyon Bay Hotel, which stands upon and over looks the cliff top with views of the bay.

At public enquiry in June 2014 Cornwall Council recognised the existence of the rights of way, CEG has exercised its right to appeal and decision now rests with the Secretary of State. Another point of contention has been the sea defences. The original 1990 plans propose a large sea wall. Following local protests a public inquiry was held in 2006 which rejected the plans. A revised scheme was accepted in 2011 but construction has not yet started. Temporary sheet piling defences were installed in early 2000s without planning permission, the developers were asked to remove it in 2008 but they have remained until 2014. A planning application for temporary defences was rejected in November 2013 and in May 2014 Cornwall Council resolved to take enforcement action for the removal of the temporary wall.

Fully Buffered DIMM (or FB-DIMM) is a memory technology that can be used to increase reliability and density of memory systems. Unlike the parallel bus architecture of traditional DRAMs, an FB-DIMM has a serial interface between the memory controller and the advanced memory buffer (AMB). Conventionally, data lines from the memory controller have to be connected to data lines in every DRAM module, i.e. via multidrop buses. As the memory width increases together with the access speed, the signal degrades at the interface between the bus and the device. This limits the speed and memory density, so FB-DIMMs take a different approach to solve the problem. 240-pin DDR2 FB-DIMMs are neither mechanically nor electrically compatible with conventional 240-pin DDR2 DIMMs. As a result, those two DIMM types are notched differently to prevent using the wrong one. As with nearly all RAM specifications, the FB-DIMM specification was published by JEDEC.  Technology  FB-DIMM DDR2 vs DIMM DDR2 Fully buffered DIMM architecture introduces an advanced memory buffer (AMB) between the memory controller and the memory module. Unlike the parallel bus architecture of traditional DRAMs, an FB-DIMM has a serial interface between the memory controller and the AMB. This enables an increase to the width of the memory without increasing the pin count of the memory controller beyond a feasible level. With this architecture, the memory controller does not write to the memory module directly; rather it is done via the AMB. AMB can thus compensate for signal deterioration by buffering and resending the signal. The AMB can also offer error correction, without imposing any additional overhead on the processor or the system's memory controller. It can also use the Bit Lane Failover Correction feature to identify bad data paths and remove them from operation, which dramatically reduces command/address errors. Also, since reads and writes are buffered, they can be done in parallel by the memory controller. This allows simpler interconnects, and (in theory) hardware-agnostic memory controller chips (such as DDR2 and DDR3) that can be used interchangeably. The downsides to this approach are; it introduces latency to the memory request, it requires additional power consumption for the buffer chips, and current implementations create a memory write bus significantly narrower than the memory read bus. This means workloads that use many writes (such as high- performance computing) will be significantly slowed. However, this slowdown is nowhere near as bad as not having enough memory capacity to avoid using significant amounts of virtual memory, so workloads that use extreme amounts of memory in irregular patterns might be helped by using fully buffered DIMMs. Protocol The JEDEC standard JESD206 defines the protocol, and JESD82-20 defines the AMB interface to DDR2 memory. The protocol is more generally described in many other places. The FB-DIMM channel consists of 14 \\"northbound\\" bit lanes carrying data from memory to the processor and 10 \\"southbound\\" bit lanes carrying commands and data from the processor to memory. Each bit is carried over a differential pair, clocked at 12 times the basic memory clock rate, 6 times the double-pumped data rate. E.g. for DDR2-667 DRAM chips, the channel would operate at 4000 MHz. Every 12 cycles constitute one frame, 168 bits northbound and 120 bits southbound. One northbound frame carries 144 data bits, the amount of data produced by a 72-bit wide DDR SDRAM array in that time, and 24 bits of CRC for error detection. There is no header information, although unused frames include a deliberately invalid CRC. One southbound frame carries 98 payload bits and 22 CRC bits. Two payload bits are a frame type, and 24 bits are a command. The remaining 72 bits may be either (depending on the frame type), 72 bits of write data, two more 24-bit commands, or one more command plus 36 bits of data to be written to an AMB control register. The commands correspond to standard DRAM access cycles, such as row select, precharge, and refresh commands. Read and write commands include only column addresses. All commands include a 3-bit FB-DIMM address, allowing up to 8 FB-DIMM modules on a channel. Because write data is supplied more slowly than DDR memory expects it, writes are buffered in the AMB until they can be written in a burst. Write commands are not directly linked to the write data; instead, each AMB has a write data FIFO that is filled by four consecutive write data frames, and is emptied by a write command. Both northbound and southbound links can operate at full speed with one bit line disabled, by discarding 12 bits of CRC information per frame. Note that the bandwidth of an FB-DIMM channel is equal to the peak read bandwidth of a DDR memory channel (and this speed can be sustained, as there is no contention for the northbound channel), plus half of the peak write bandwidth of a DDR memory channel (which can often be sustained, if one command per frame is sufficient). The only overhead is the need for a channel sync frame (which elicits a northbound status frame in response) every 32 to 42 frames (2.5‚Äì3% overhead). Implementations Intel has adopted the technology for their Xeon 5000/5100 series and beyond, which they consider \\"a long-term strategic direction for servers\\".Intel server platform page Sun Microsystems used FB-DIMMs for the Niagara II (UltraSparc T2) server processor.Microprocessor Report: \\"Niagara 2 Opens the Floodgates\\", Harlan McGhan Intel's enthusiast system platform Skulltrail uses FB-DIMMs for their dual CPU socket, multi-GPU system.Intel Skulltrail Unleashed: Core 2 Extreme QX9775 x 2 - HotHardware FB-DIMMS have 240 pins and are the same total length as other DDR DIMMs but differ by having indents on both ends within the slot. The cost of FB-DIMM memory was initially much higher than registered DIMM, which may be one of the factors behind its current level of acceptance. Also, the AMB chip dissipates considerable heat, leading to additional cooling problems. Although strenuous efforts were made to minimize delay in the AMB, there is some noticeable cost in memory access latency. History As of September 2006, AMD has taken FB-DIMM off their roadmap.The Inquirer report In December 2006, AMD has revealed in one of the slides that microprocessors based on the new K10 microarchitecture has the support for FB-DIMM \\"when appropriate\\".(slide 5) Slides AMD Analyst Day 2006, December 14, 2006 In addition, AMD also developed Socket G3 Memory Extender (G3MX), which uses a single buffer for every 4 modules instead of one for each, to be used by Opteron-based systems in 2009. At the 2007 Intel Developer Forum, it was revealed that major memory manufacturers have no plans to extend FB-DIMM to support DDR3 SDRAM. Instead, only registered DIMM for DDR3 SDRAM had been demonstrated. In 2007, Intel demonstrated FB-DIMM with shorter latencies, CL5 and CL3, showing improvement in latencies. On August 5, 2008, Elpida Memory announced that it would mass-produce the world's first FB-DIMM at 16 Gigabyte capacity, as from Q4 2008,All Bow Down Before the Mighty 16GB FB-DIMM! however the product has not appeared and the press release has been deleted from Elpida's site.

Fictional character biography Born on March 11, 1995 and died on March 11, 2095, Martha Washington grew up in the Cabrini‚ÄìGreen housing project in Chicago (called \\"The Green\\") with her mother and two brothers in abject poverty brought on by the economic policies of the President Erwin Rexall. She is an average student, but one who displays a gift for computer programming and hacking. Her teacher, Donald, encourages her to be a better student and, because he lives outside the Green, brings her contraband items. One night, Martha shows up at Donald‚Äôs classroom and finds that he‚Äôs been murdered by the Ice Man, a large thug who works for a local gangster called the Pope. Before dying, Donald managed to stab the Ice Man in the wrist. This distraction allowed Martha to seize his weapon, a longshoreman‚Äôs hook, and plunge it into his shoulder. The Ice Man chases her through the school to a locker room, but before he can kill her, he dies of blood loss. Martha is later remanded to a psychiatric hospital. In the institution, she discovers that experiments are being secretly performed on children to genetically alter their minds, effectively turning them into human computers. Their heads are covered with wires plugged into their brains. Martha believes one of them resembles the Raggedy Ann doll she played with as a child. This institution is closed due to national budget cuts, and Martha is left homeless. She later joins the PAX Peace Force, where her heroic tale begins. She fights in many battles during the second American Civil War. During the second American Civil War, her mother and brother die when Chicago is destroyed by a nuclear weapon. Appearances=Give Me Liberty Martha Washington's first appearance. It features Martha joining the PAX Peace Force -- a reinvented U.S. Army -- and engaging in various heroic efforts, such as saving the rain forests of South America from crazed cattle ranchers. She eventually has to thwart the megalomanical plans of Colonel Moretti before he brings the country to the brink of destruction. Martha Washington Goes to War A five-issue series published in 1994, and closely based on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, Martha Washington Goes to War has Martha fighting for the PAX army to reunite the fractured United States. The war effort is undermined by frequent technology failures, the disappearances of America's brightest minds, and a general malaise among the people. Washington is crippled in an attack. She's secretly visited by Wasserstein, her old boyfriend, who heals her with unknown technology. Washington is later brought onboard PAX's orbiting satellite Harmony. Wasserstein returns and seems to kill Coogan, Harmony's chief engineer. Washington pursues Wasserstein's flying craft into the radioactive wasteland in Oklahoma. She penetrates the field at the core of the wasteland, and finds a paradise. Wasserstein, Raggyann, and the missing scientists have hidden themselves here to develop technologies and strategies to improve the world. They knew PAX and the current government weren't interested in truly improving people's lives, so they created this sanctuary to wait until they were strong enough to overthrow the corrupt government and implement true change. Meanwhile, the Surgeon General, living through robot doubles, has taken control of Harmony. He finds the sanctuary by tracking Washington's wrist computer and fires a devastating ray. As she sees the destruction she indirectly caused, Washington realizes it was this weapon that destroyed Oklahoma and not a nuclear device. Washington joins the scientists' cause as they attack and bring down Harmony. The Surgeon General's robots are destroyed. Other revolutionaries infiltrate military bases, free political prisoners, and seize control of the US government. Two years later, Washington continues to work with the revolutionaries to create a better world. Happy Birthday, Martha Washington A one-shot issue published in 1995, this is a collection of short stories about Martha and some of the many battles she has fought. The first story has Martha landing in Manhattan to take out Dictator Beluga. The building she lands in is shelled by PAX (her own side) and she is forced to head to Mercy Hospital with a wounded soldier of the Manhattan military. After the man she saved is patched up, they sit down to share a cigarette. He reveals to her that Dictator Beluga is dead, assassinated by his own inner circle and possibly even by his own wife. However, PAX does not believe Martha's report and the shelling continues. Martha Washington Stranded in Space A one-shot issue published in 1995, Martha Washington Stranded in Space guest-stars The Big Guy. Martha investigates a space anomaly which temporarily sends her to Big Guy's reality. The back-up story is \\"Attack of the Flesh Eating Monsters\\", originally published in black and white in Dark Horse Presents #100-4. Martha fights off an attack by monsters conforming to 1950s pulp-SF stereotypes; she discovers that this is merely a psychological study conducted by the world-controlling AI, named Venus. Martha Washington Saves the World A three-issue series published in 1997, Martha Washington Saves the World depicts the arrival of an actual alien spaceship. Martha uses its superior technology to defeat the megalomaniacal artificial intelligence named Venus, which - though it had proved critical in defeating the old corrupt American regime - has been undermining humanity and sapping people's will. Martha and a handful of friends then leave Earth entirely, off to explore the origin of the aliens. Martha Washington Dies This 2007 one- shot takes place on Martha Washington's 100th birthday on March 11, 2095 in a warzone. Unlike the earlier stories narrated by Martha, it is narrated by a young female soldier who looks like Martha Washington before joining Pax in the first issue of Give Me Liberty. The only difference is a scar on her face (it is possible she is related to Martha as her great granddaughter). She reveals that Martha married Wasserstein and has three sons, of whom she survived, and also that it is her final day of her final year of her life. Surrounded by Soldiers apparently under siege from unknown foes, who are described as \\"barbarians who won an awful victory\\", Martha gives a brief speech of inspiration and as she dies, she gave her final words to the soldiers for courage \\"Give me liberty\\" before turning her body into a blast full of fireworks. The final page of the issue and the series ends with the Martha lookalike now leading the soldiers to battle, who are now encouraged by Martha's final words.

It is part of the School of Advanced Study in the University of London and is located at Senate House. The Institute was founded in 1921 by A. F. Pollard. History= Foundation  The IHR was founded in 1921 by British historian Albert Pollard. Appointed Professor of Constitutional History at University College London in 1903, his inaugural address, a year later, argued for the need for a postgraduate school of historical research.Birch and Horn 1996, pp. 1‚Äì12. With a generous and anonymous donation of ¬£20,000 from Sir John Cecil Power in 1920 towards the founding of the institute, Pollard's dream was realised. The Institute was formally opened by H. A. L. Fisher on 8 July 1921. The IHR was directly administered by the Senate of the University of London, rather than being part of one of the federal colleges. It was the first organisation to be administered under such an arrangement, and as such provided the model for other Institutes, many of which later joined the IHR in the University of London's School of Advanced Study. Senate House, home to the IHR since 1947 The IHR's first premises were in \\"temporary\\" huts on Malet Street, on a site now occupied by Birkbeck College.Birch and Horn 1996, pp. 13‚Äì17. Despite the supposedly temporary nature of this accommodation, the IHR was not to move until 1947, when it took up residence in the north block of Senate House. The new location was built by architect Charles Holden, along with the rest of the University, at a projected cost of ¬£3,000,000 and duration of 30 years for the whole project. Still occupying this position, many rooms in the IHR overlook the grass lawn in between Senate House and SOAS, which is where Senate House's unbuilt fourth court would have been. With the start of World War II in September 1939 the Institute's work and construction of its permanent building were disrupted, with the Ministry of Information occupying Senate House, and closing the Institute in May 1940. The IHR was struck by a bomb on the night of 22‚Äì23 September 1940. The impact resulted in \\"the destruction of six books and almost the entire collection of London maps, as well as of furniture\\".Birch and Horn 1996, p. 73.

It also publishes the results of historical research. Wohl Library From its inception, the founders of the Institute of Historical Research envisaged a combination of scholarship and library. This tradition is continued in that many seminars still take place in the rooms of the library. The library itself collects sources for the History of Western Europe and areas affected by the European expansion. It now contains over 190,000 volumes. There are sizable holdings for the British Isles, as well as for Germany, Austria, France, the Low Countries, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Latin America, the US and colonial history, ecclesiastical, Byzantine and crusader history as well as small holdings for Eastern Europe, Switzerland and Scandinavia. The library is particularly good for sources on local history both of the British Isles and Europe. It contains the largest collection of Low Countries material outside of the region (due to gifts from the Netherlands and research interests of scholars working there), the most complete collection of French cartularies outside France as well as collections of poll books for the United Kingdom and a complete run of the Victoria County History books. The collections have been supplemented by donations and bequests from many different scholars, such as the Wright collection. In its early years the IHR library was built up by actively seeking donations, and much of the collection was formed from bequests and gifts by individuals and organisations. By 1926, three-quarters of the collection had been acquired through private benefactions and presentations by governments from Europe and other parts of the World.Birch and Horn 1996, p. 31. Among the IHR‚Äôs extensive collection of books on European history are a set of volumes of the and other works donated to the University of London by the Nazi government of Germany in 1937. The presentation was made by Joachim von Ribbentrop, Germany‚Äôs ambassador to Britain. The accessions records highlight the collaborative nature of library collection development; many donations were shared between the IHR and other libraries to build on existing collection strengths or through an agreed division of collection policy. As an example, the sizeable portion of the IHR‚Äôs colonial and early national holdings in the United States collection was donated to the library by the widow of George Louis Beer between 1921 and 1925. Seminar programme The IHR supports and promotes a wide variety of seminars. They are accessible to all interested in the topic under discussion. Seminar topics range from the Early Middle Ages to Modern Britain, from the history of gardening to the philosophy of history. Conferences The IHR is also involved with organising and running a number of conferences and workshops, including its annual conference on a historical theme. British History Online The IHR co-manages British History Online, a digital library of key printed primary and secondary sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a primary focus on the period between 1300 and 1800. Historical Research The IHR publishes Historical Research, a scholarly historical journal. The journal first appeared in 1923 under the title Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research; and the present title was adopted in 1987 (beginning with volume 60, no. 141). Reviews in History The IHR publishes the online journal Reviews in History. The journal was launched in 1996, and publishes reviews and reappraisals of significant work in all fields of historical interest. Layers of London The Layers of London project brings together digitised historic maps, photos and other information provided by key partners across London including: the British Library, London Metropolitan Archives, Historic England, The National Archives, MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology). These will be linked on a website which will allow visitors to create and interact with many different \\"layers\\" of London's history from the Romans to the present day. Marc Fitch Lectures The institute hosts the Marc Fitch Lectures with funding provided by the Marc Fitch Fund. The lecture was held at the Institute until 2012, when it started touring the counties with a planned three lectures a year. Previous lectures have been presented by Linda Colley, Roy Strong, Michael Wood, Simon Thurley and David Starkey. Humanities Digital Library In IHR leads an inter-institutional initiative within the School of Advanced Study to explore and deliver open access research publications. This has culminated in the launch of the Humanities Digital Library, a catalogue of open access books published across the School, as well as an open access book series focusing upon early career authors and published in partnership with the Royal Historical Society. Integrated bodies Besides the core activities, two research centres are integrated into the Institute. These are: * the Victoria County History, * the Centre for Metropolitan History The IHR formerly housed a third research centre, the Centre for Contemporary British History. In August 2010, however, this transferred to King's College London, where it is now known as the Institute of Contemporary British History.

The term refers to intolerance not only against the Turks across all regions, but also against Turkic groups as a whole, including Azerbaijanis, Crimean Tatars and Turkmens. It is also applied on groups who developed in part under the influence of Turkish culture and traditions while converting to Islam, especially during Ottoman times, such as Albanians, Bosniaks and other smaller ethnic groups around Balkans during the period of Ottoman rule. It can also refer to racism against Turkish people living outside of Turkey following the Turkish diaspora. Early history In the Late Middle Ages, the fall of Constantinople and the Ottoman wars in Europe‚Äîpart of European Christians' effort to stem the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor to Turkey‚Äîhelped fuel the development of anti-Turkism. By the middle of the 15th century, special masses called missa contra Turcos (Latin for \\"mass against Turks\\") were held in various places in Europe to spread the message that victory over the Ottomans was only possible with the help of God and that a Christian community was therefore necessary to withstand the cruelty of the Turks. 16th century Original prints from the 16th century at the Hungarian National Museum depict a Turkish warrior butchering infants. As the Ottomans expanded their empire west, Western Europe came into more frequent contact with the Turks, often militarily. During the Fourth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, the Ottomans conquered Cyprus. In the 16th century, around 2,500 publications about the Turks‚Äîincluding more than 1,000 in German‚Äîwere released in Europe, spreading the image of the \\"bloodthirsty Turk\\". From 1480 to 1610, twice as many books were published about the Turkish threat to Europe than about the discovery of the New World. Bishop Johann Faber of Vienna claimed, \\"There are no crueler and more audacious villains under the heavens than the Turks, who spare no age or sex and mercilessly cut down young and old alike and pluck unripe fruit from the wombs of mothers.\\" \\"The dying, half-naked 'Turk' slips down along with his weapons. The body of the vanquished serves as a stepping stone for the transfigured Christian to ascend toward heaven. The baroque apotheosis (1738) above the Capistrano pulpit on the north side of St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna shows John of Capistrano, canonized in 1690, as the vanquisher of the 'Turks'. Moreover, until after 1945 the inscription \\"1683 -schau Mahomet, du Hunt\\" (1683 -Look Muhammad, You Dog) hung resplendent above the main entrance of the cathedral. It was only removed by order of Cardinal Franz K√∂nig.\\" During this time, the Ottoman Empire also invaded the Balkans and besieged Vienna, sparking widespread fear in Europe, and especially in Germany. Martin Luther, the German leader of the Protestant Reformation, took advantage of these fears by asserting that the Turks were \\"the agents of the Devil who, along with the Antichrist located in the heart of the Catholic Church, Rome, would usher in the Last Days and the Apocalypse\\". Luther believed that the Ottoman invasion was God's punishment of Christians for allowing corruption in the Holy See and the Catholic Church.Smith, R. O. (2007). Luther, the Turks, and Islam. Currents in Theology and Mission, 34(5), 351‚Äì365: \\"Luther's statement of explanation created yet more contention. Indeed, it was singled out for condemnation in Exsurge Domine, the papal bull of excommunication directed at Luther by Pope Leo X on 15 June 1520. Among the \\"destructive, pernicious, scandalous, and seductive\\" errors enumerated in the bull is an essentialized version of Luther's position: \\"To go to war against the Turks is to resist God who punishes our iniquities through them.\\" (11) But even before Exsurge Domine, Luther tied his struggles with Rome to the war against the Turk. Prior to the beginning of the Leipzig Debate with Johannes Eck in June 1519, Luther wrote to his friend Wencenlaus Linck, \\"I think I can demonstrate that today Rome is worse than the Turk.\\" In 1518, when he defended his 95 Theses, Luther claimed that God had sent the Turks to punish Christians just as he had sent war, plague, and earthquakes. (In response, Pope Leo X issued a papal bull in which he threatened Luther with excommunication and portrayed him as a troublemaker who advocated capitulation to the Turks.) In his writings On War Against the Turk and Military Sermon Against the Turks, Luther was \\"consistent in his theological conception of the Turks as a manifestation of God's chastising rod\\". He and his followers also espoused the view that the Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg Wars were a conflict \\"between Christ and Antichrist\\" or \\"between God and the devil\\". Spurred by this argument, the Portuguese Empire, seeking to capture more land in East Africa and other parts of the world, used any encounter with the \\"Terrible Turk\\" as \\"a prime opportunity to establish credentials as champions of the faith on par with other Europeans\\". Stories of the \\"Wolf- Turk\\" reinforced the negative image. The Wolf-Turk was claimed to be a man- eating being, half animal and half human, with a wolf's head and tail. Military power and cruelty were the recurring attributes in each portrayal of the Turks. 17th‚Äì18th centuries According to some sympathetic Orientalist authors, negative accounts of Turkish customs and people written during the 17th and 18th centuries \\"served as an 'ideological weapon' during the Enlightenment's arguments about the nature of government\\",Grosrichard, A. (1998). The sultan's court: European fantasies of the East. (p. 125). London: Verso. creating an image of the Turks that was \\"inaccurate but accepted\\". However, some contemporary reports documented brutality and corrupt governance against subjugated Christians, including a law that forced all Christian families to relinquish at least one child to the Janissaries in order to fulfill the Quranic requirement of jizya. In Sweden, the Turks were portrayed as the archenemies of Christianity. A book by the parish priest Erland Dryselius of J√∂nk√∂ping, published in 1694, was titled Luna Turcica eller Turkeske m√•ne, anwissjandes lika som uti en spegel det mahometiske vanskelige regementet, f√∂rdelter uti fyra qvarter eller b√∂cker (\\"Turkish moon showing as in a mirror the dangerous Mohammedan rule, divided into four quarters or books\\"). In sermons, the Swedish clergy preached about the Turks' cruelty and bloodthirstiness, and how they systematically burned and plundered the areas they conquered. In a Swedish schoolbook published in 1795, Islam was described as \\"the false religion that had been fabricated by the great deceiver Muhammad, to which the Turks to this day universally confess\\". In 1718, James Puckle demonstrated two version of his new invention, the Puckle gun: a tripod-mounted, single-barreled flintlock weapon fitted with a revolving cylinder, designed to prevent intruders from boarding a ship. The first version, intended for use against Christian enemies, fired conventional round bullets. The second, intended for use against the Muslim Turks, fired square bullets, designed by Kyle Tunis, which were believed to be more damaging and would, according to Puckle's patent, convince the Turks of the \\"benefits of Christian civilization\\". Voltaire and other European writers described the Turks as tyrants who destroyed Europe's heritage. In his book Orientalism, Edward Said noted, \\"Until the end of the seventeenth century the 'Ottoman peril' lurked alongside Europe to represent for the whole of Christian civilization a constant danger, and in time European civilization incorporated that peril and its lore, its great events, figures, virtues, and vices, as something woven into the fabric of life.\\"Edward Said. \\"Orientalism\\", (1978), p. 59‚Äì60 Even within the Ottoman Empire, the term \\"Turk\\" was sometimes used to denote the Y√∂r√ºk backwoodsmen, bumpkins, or illiterate peasants in Anatolia. \\"Etrak-i bi-idrak\\", an Ottoman play on words, meant \\"the ignorant Turk\\".Alfred J. Rieber, Alexei Miller. Imperial Rule, Central European University Press, 2005. pg 33 √ñzay Mehmet wrote in his book Islamic Identity and Development: Studies of the Islamic Periphery:Ozay Mehmet, Islamic Identity and Development: Studies of the Islamic Periphery, Routledge, 1990. pg 115 Anti-Turkism by Ottomans The Ottomans discriminated against the Turkish peasantry, and used ethnic slurs such as E≈üek Turk (donkey Turk) and Kaba Turk (rude Turk) to describe them. Other expressions used were \\"Turk-head\\" and \\"Turk-person\\". Modern history Before the 1960s, Turkey had relatively low emigration. However, after the adoption of a new constitution in 1961, Turkish citizens began to migrate elsewhere.Unat, N. A. (1995). Turkish migration to Europe. In R. Cohen (Ed.), The Cambridge survey of world migration (p. 279). Cambridge University Press. Gradually, Turks became a \\"prominent ethnic minority group\\" in some Western countries.H√ºbner, E., & Rohlfs, H. H. (1992). Jahrbuch der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: 1992/93. M√ºnchen: Beck. But from the beginning, they were subject to discrimination. At times, when host countries adopted more immigrant-friendly policies, \\"only the Turkish workers were excluded\\" from them. In various European languages, the word \\"Turk\\" has acquired a meaning similar to \\"barbarian\\" or \\"heathen\\",:nl:Turk (scheldwoord)#cite note-2 Turk (scheldwoord) Dutch Wikipedia article about Turk (curseword) or is used as a slur or curse. As a result, the word also has some negative connotations in the United States.  Arab World  The Arab World has a long historical mixup relations with the Turks back from the Ottoman Empire. In the past, the Ottoman conquest had absorbed a large number of Arab countries into its map, ultimately opened a chapter of complicated relationship between Turks and Arabs. While both are Muslim majority, subsequent conflict of interests and the growing Turkification and nationalist movement had led to growing anti-Arabism among Turks, especially following the Arab Revolt in World War I. Due to growing Arabophobia among Turks, a growing number of Arabs have developed a resentment against anything Turkic and Turkish in general. Recently, many Syrians have feared the return of the Ottoman Empire due to growing ottomanist policies of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. However, Arab opinions of Turkey remain deeply divided between region, while Arabs from the Middle East has increasingly hostile to Turkey, Arabs from North Africa has a friendlier opinion of Turkey due to little conflicts between two. =Egypt= Since independence in 1956, Egypt has always had a mixed view of Turkey, in particular due to Turkey's relationship with Israel and had once allied with Syria leaving to tensions between Turkey and Egypt.Daniela, Huber. Turkish-Israeli relations in a Changing Strategic Environment IAI (2010). Since 2014 when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power, a growing anti-Turkism spread in Egypt, as retribution for growing hostility from Erdoƒüan against the Egyptian administration. The Egyptian Government has targeted in sensitive issues of the Turkish state, such as Armenian Genocide, Turkish military invasion in Syria as el-Sisi allied with Bashar al-Assad. There's a growing fear of Turkish interference in Egyptian affairs, which contributed to the growth of Turkophobia in Egypt. =Iraq= The fear of Turkish influence has always dominated Iraq and as such, relationship between Iraq and Turkey has always been tense. Another negative influence is stemmed from the past when the Turks, formed part of the Mongol Empire's conquest to Arab World, had ransacked the city of Baghdad in 1258, had left a great stain and fear that Turkey will never stop abandoning its desire to conquer Iraq like its Mongol ancestors did. =Lebanon= The memory of the Great Famine of Mount Lebanon in 1915 has played a great role on the attitude of the Lebanese people towards Turkey. The Turkish Government was found to have taken 1 million Lebanese lives during the time span of the famine. Kahlil Gibran, a Lebanese poet and writer claimed the famine was a deliberate act of genocide. This began a long process of Turkophobia among the Lebanese people. The Lebanese Armenians have developed hostility against anything Turkish because of the Armenian Genocide, comparing Turkey to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.https://7dnews.com/news/lebanon-s-armenian-community- compares-1915-massacres-to-isis-atrocities Many Lebanese sympathize with the large minority of Lebanese Armenians (about 5-6%) and have developed negative views of Turkey. =Saudi Arabia= Saudi Arabia has a very tense relationship with Turkey, owning by the old, previous Wahhabi War when the Saudis were defeated by the Ottomans, which contributed to the Turkish rule for another century before the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and its alliance with the Al-Rashid family against the Al-Saud. The tensions eventually rekindled in the 21st century with the desire to revive the Ottoman Empire by Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, which draws Saudi Arabia to be more antagonistic to Turkey. Saudi Arabia has since then made numerous changes, such as accusing the Ottomans as the occupants in Arabia, to financing movies that is deemed anti-Turkism. Recently, Saudi Arabia has banned Turkish websites and led boycotts against Turkey. =Syria= Syria has long and deep tensions with Turkey. Since the Turkish annexation of Sanjak of Alexandretta, there is a strong anti-Turkish sentiment among the Syrian population. For the Syrians, the annexation of Alexandretta became a national wound and a symbol of increasing Turkish meddling of Syrian affairs. This had led to the beginning of anti-Turkish discrimination, intensified under the government of Hafez al-Assad and the Arabization process. Its minority Syrian Turkmen, which have deep links to Turkey, were affected greatly and a ban of Turkish schools, Turkish education and anything Turkish became a norm, in contrast to Syrian regime's generous treatment toward Armenians, the arch- enemy of the Turks. With the begin of Syrian Civil War, Syrian Turkmen had sided with the Syrian opposition, fed the growth of anti-Turkism in Syria and Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian Armed Forces, with Russian support, often bombing Syrian Turkmen positions and increased xenophobic attacks against Turkmen, accusing them of being Ankara's stooge. =United Arab Emirates= In May 2017, the UAE's Ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba described Turkey under Erdoƒüan as a \\"long-term threat\\" to both the UAE and the United States. In December 2017, the UAE's foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, shared a tweet that claimed an Ottoman general had robbed Medina during Ottoman rule. Emirati diplomat Anwar Gargash then added, \\"The sectarian and partisan view is not an acceptable alternative, and the Arab world will not be led by Tehran or Ankara.\\" Further anti-Turkish policies led by the Emirates, such as arming the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, clashing of influence during the Syrian Civil War, the issue of Qatar crisis and Egypt, and aftermath of the failed 2016 Turkish coup, led to further deterioration of relations and facilitate stronger anti-Turkish tones in the Emirates. =Yemen= The Yemenis had a long history of resisting Ottoman and Turkish influence, and have rebelled against the Turks in a number of times, causing tensions between Yemenis and the Turks. BalkansAlbania= Albanian nationalists have long accused the Turks for Albania's backwardness under the Ottomans and Islamization as the cause for making Albania a primitive country in Europe. For this reason, there is a strong anti-Turkish sentiment in Albania, believing the Turks brought only calamities and national shame for Albania and its people. The Ottoman rule was depicted very negative in modern Albanian historiography and Skanderbeg, the Christian hero of Muslim-dominated Albania, is often praised for protecting Albanian identity from the \\"barbaric Turks\\". Albanians became very furious toward growing Turkish desire to restore its influence in the Balkans and Turkish meddling on Albanian affairs, including the G√ºlen movement, thus increases the number of anti-Turkish Albanians. =Bulgaria= Turkish refugees from the Veliko Tarnovo district coming into Shumen (1877). The Bulgarian Martyresses, by Konstantin Makovsky (1877). A painting from the April Uprising, it sparked outrage in the West against Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria. Before 1878, Turks accounted for an estimated one-third of the population of Bulgaria. In 1876, approximately 70% of the country's arable land belonged to Turks. This number declined from 1923‚Äì49, when an estimated 220,000 Turks moved from Bulgaria to Turkey, a migration encouraged by the Turkish government. Another wave of about 155,000 left Bulgaria from 1949‚Äì51, many of them forcibly expelled..R. J. Crampton, 2007, Bulgaria, pp. 431‚Äì433 In 1984, the government implemented Bulgarisation policies to limit the cultural and ethnic influence of Bulgarian Turks. Approximately 800,000 Turks were forced to adopt Bulgarian names. Furthermore, Turks were not allowed to attend Muslim ceremonies, speak Turkish in public places, or wear traditional Turkish clothing.. This led, a few years later, to the biggest exodus in Europe since World War II: After the Bulgaria‚ÄìTurkey border was opened in June 1989, approximately 350,000 Turks left Bulgaria on tourist visas in the span of three months.. Eventually, more than 150,000 Turks returned to Bulgaria‚Äîespecially after the removal of Todor Zhivkov from power‚Äîbut more than 200,000 chose to remain in Turkey permanently.. Former Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, has been accused of having anti- Turkish tendencies. In December 2009, he backed a referendum, proposed by the nationalist party Attack (Bulgarian: –ê—Ç–∞–∫–∞), on whether to allow daily Turkish-language news broadcasts on Bulgarian National Television, although he later withdrew his support. Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, then the Turkish prime minister, \\"expressed his concern of rising anti-Turkish sentiments in Bulgaria\\" to the Bulgarian prime minister. The Turkish Foreign Ministry also \\"expressed its concern over the rising heated rhetoric in Bulgaria\\". According to a report by Ivan Dikov, \\"not just –ê—Ç–∞–∫–∞ but a large number of Bulgarians have resented the news in Turkish\\". Borisov also referred to Turks (and Romani) as \\"bad human material\\" in 2009. The vice president of the Party of European Socialists, Jan Marinus Wiersma, said Borisov had \\"crossed the invisible line between right wing populism and extremism\\". =Former Yugoslavia= Iconostasis in the Church of the Ascension of Jesus, Skopje from 1867, Northern Macedonia. The Beheading of John the Baptist is carried out by figures stylized like Ottoman Turks. After the Ottoman Empire fell in the early 20th century, many Turks fled as Muhacirs (refugees). Others intermarried or simply identified themselves as Yugoslavs or Albanians to avoid stigma and persecution.. Historically, from the Ottoman conquest through the 19th century, many ethnically non-Turkish groups‚Äîespecially the Slavic Muslims of the Balkans‚Äîwere referred to in local languages as Turks. This usage is common in literature, including in the works of Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá and Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°. The religious ideology of Christoslavism, coined by Michael Sells, holds that \\"Slavs are Christian by nature and that any conversion from Christianity is a betrayal of the Slavic race\\". Under this ideology, as seen in Croatian and Serbian nationalism, South Slavic Muslims are not regarded as part of their ethnic kin; by virtue of their Muslim faith, they become \\"Turks\\". =Greece= Turks have lived in Western Thrace, an area of northeastern Greece, since the Ottoman conquest of the region in the 15th century. In 1922, Turks owned 84% of the land in Western Thrace. Today, however, estimates range from 20‚Äì40%, largely because of policies under which ethnic Greeks were encouraged to purchase Turkish land with soft loans granted by the state. The Turkish government estimates that the Turks of Western Thrace number between 120,000 and 130,000.. However, the Greeks claim that the Muslim population there includes people of various ethnic and religious backgrounds‚Äîprimarily the Pomaks (a Slavic people, ethnically and linguistically related closest to Bulgarians), Muslim Roma and ethnic Greek Muslims‚Äîand that Sunni Muslims who identify ethnically as Turks are the minority. Thus, the Greek government refers to the Muslims of Western Thrace‚Äîwhom Turkey sees as the \\"Turkish community\\"‚Äîas Greek Muslims or Hellenic Muslims, and does not recognise any specific Turkish minority. Greek courts have outlawed the use of the word \\"Turkish\\" to describe the community. In 1987, the Supreme Court of Greece affirmed a 1986 decision in which the Union of Turkish Associations of Western Thrace was ordered closed for illegally using it. The court held that the word \\"Turkish\\" referred specifically to citizens of Turkey and could not be used to describe citizens of Greece. Anti-Turkish rhetoric within the lawmakers and administrators of Greece have been encountered in the modern times as well. A Greek lawmaker Ioannis Lagos, deputy of the Greek far-right Golden Dawn party, tore up the Turkish flag in the European Parliament during a debate at the parliament over a large number of refugees on Greek islands when he blamed Turkey for the situation. Another member of the European parliament, of the Greek far-right Golden Dawn party, and a former army lieutenant general Eleftherios Synadinos has been expelled from a European Parliament plenary session after violating rules against racist speech, stating that \\"As it has been expressed in scientific literature, the Turks are dirty and polluted. Turks are like wild dogs when they play but when they have to fight against their enemies they run away. The only effective way to deal with the Turks is with decisive and resolute attitudes.\\" China China has a long standing tensions toward Turkic people. Persisted Turkophobia among Chinese have been dated back from ancient era, when the Chinese Empire fought against various Turkic rulers since antiquity, and often the Turks assisted the Koreans against Chinese further led the Chinese to campaign against the Turks. Further hostility increased when the Uyghur Turks joined the Mongol conquest of China and its atrocities toward Chinese.https://www.historyonthenet.com/mongol-empire- timeline From 19th century onward, tensions between Turks and Chinese revived with the establishment of Kashgaria and subsequent Turko-Chinese wars to control the region. This had led to the weakening of the Qing dynasty and paved way for its future collapse. The Republic of China however, failed to address the increasing tensions between Turks and Han Chinese, and conflict between two continued, known as Xinjiang Wars, when the Turkic Uyghurs raised arms to fight Chinese Army. In response, China imposed heavy military repression against the Uyghurs and other Turkic rebels, many were supported by the Soviet Union. This conflict would continue until the fall of the Republic and establishment of Communist China, known as People's Republic of China. Since 1990s with Chinese economic reform, China had grown to become a new major superpower, but this has led to the increase of tensions among Turks and Chinese. Due to growing pan-Turkist separatism against China, the Chinese Government had deployed the military, increased surveillance on Uyghurs and operating re-education camps. Meanwhile, in China, growing anti-Turkism ranges from the felonious act accusing the Turkish Government's support for Uyghur separatism, to later call for extermination of Uyghur Turks. The Turks were also held directly for being the source of national turmoil in China, notably throughout the story of An Lushan, a Turkic-born Chinese General who caused the An Lushan rebellion that led to the collapse of Tang dynasty and weakening of China. A growing sense of anti-Turkist among Chinese nationalists have been reinforced further when Chinese nationalist websites with tie to Chinese government sohu and tuotiao published news claiming that Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (two Turkic countries in Central Asia) should not be independent nations but rather it was part of China since antiquity.https://zeenews.india.com/world/chinese-websites-claim-kyrgyzstan- kazakhstan-part-of-china-draws-ire-of-central-asia-2282791.html Cyprus The island of Cyprus became an independent state in 1960, with power shared between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots under the London‚ÄìZ√ºrich Agreements. But in December 1963, in events that became known as Bloody Christmas,. Turkish Cypriots were ousted from the republic and Greek Cypriots began a military campaign against them, leading to 11 years of ethnic clashes.. Turkish Cypriots bore the heavier cost in terms of casualties, and some 25,000‚Äîabout a fifth of the population of Turkish Cypriots‚Äîwere internally displaced. They lived as refugees for at least ten years, until the 1974 Turkish invasion.. By the late 1960s, approximately 60,000 Turkish Cypriots had left their homes and moved into enclaves.. This resulted in an exodus of Turkish Cypriots, with the majority migrating to the United Kingdom and others to Turkey, North America, and Australia.. Anti-Turkish rhetoric in Cyprus has been exemplified within the administrative bodies of Cyprus. For example, the primate of the Church of Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos has expressed his opinions regarding the reversion of the Hagia Sophia museum to a mosque stating that \\"The Turks have remained uncivilized, they are rude, and they will remain [this way].\\" He added that \\"Turkey has learned to destroy, it has learned to appropriate the cultures of others and sometimes, when it does not benefit it, it destroys them and falsely presents cultures as its own.\\" Germany The Solingen arson attack of 1993, in which neo-Nazis set fire to a Turkish family's home, was one of the most severe instances of xenophobic violence in modern Germany. Turks are \\"the most prominent ethnic minority group in contemporary Germany\\", and discrimination and violence against them are common.R. Cohen. (1995). Labour migration to western Europe after 1945. In R. Cohen (Ed.), The Cambridge survey of world migration. (p. 279). Cambridge University Press. In public discourse and popular jokes, they are often portrayed as \\"ludicrously different in their food tastes, dress, names, and even in their ability to develop survival techniques\\".Toelken, B. (1985). \\"Turkenrein\\" and \\"Turken, Rausl\\"‚ÄîImages of fear and aggression in German Gastarbeitterwitze. In N. Furniss & I. Basgoz (Eds.), Turkish workers in Europe: An interdisciplinary study. (p. 155). Indiana: Indiana University Turkish Studies. The number of violent acts by right-wing extremists in Germany increased dramatically between 1990 and 1992.. On November 25, 1992, three Turkish residents were killed in a firebombing in M√∂lln, a town in northern Germany... And on May 29, 1993, in an arson attack in Solingen, five members of a Turkish family that had resided in Germany for 23 years were burnt to death.. Several neighbours heard someone shout \\"Heil Hitler!\\" before dousing the front porch and door with gasoline and setting fire to the home.. Most Germans condemned these attacks, and many marched in candlelight processions. According to Greg Nees, \\"because Turks are both darker-skinned and Muslim, conservative Germans are largely against granting them citizenship\\".. Some critics accuse the news media of bias against German Turks, particularly in contrast to German Kurds. For example, many German news outlets and politicians have warned against demonstrations by Turks in support of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the Turkish president, but remained silent about demonstrations by Kurds in support of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Iran In Iran, ethnic Persians use the word \\"Torke khar\\" (donkey Turk) in reference to Turks of Iranian Azerbaijan. In the Iranian media, Turks are often depicted as 'stupid,' 'uneducated,' and 'illiterate' individuals who speak Persian with heavy Turkish accents. In spring of 2006 the government newspaper Iran Daily published a cartoon that depicted Turks as cockroaches and suggested various methods of exterminating them. Dozens were killed and scores were arrested after ethnic Turks took to the streets of cities in Iranian Azerbaijan to protest the racist cartoon. In 2010, a group of scholars and human rights activists from Iran, mostly from its Turkish community, wrote an open letter to Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA at the time, and complained about the issue of racism in Iran‚Äôs football stadiums directed against Turkish citizens of the country. The same year, UN urged Iran to tackle racism against its ethnic minorities including Turks. In November 2015, Turks in Iranian Azerbaijan took to the streets after IRIB-2, a state-run TV channel, aired an episode of a children's show, Fitilehha (Candle Wicks), in which a Turkish boy was shown brushing his teeth with a toilet brush. Dozens of protesters were detained by Iranian authorities in the protests. In June 2017, FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe), an organization working under the auspices of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), published a report called ‚ÄúGlobal Guide to Discriminatory Practices in Football,‚Äù which examines ‚Äúdiscriminatory practices displayed inside football stadiums around the world‚Äù. In its Iran section, the report pointed out to anti-Turkish, racist, and dehumanizing chants that directed at Turkish fans in Iranian stadiums. Israel Historically, relationship between Turkey and Israel, as well as Israel with the Turkic world has been majority friendly, one of the few rare exceptions of Israel's harmonious relationship with Muslim world since most Turkic countries are Muslims. However, as for the result of increasing anti- Semitic sentiment by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan,https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/06/16/erdogans-anti-semitism-has- done-great-harm-to-turkey/ increasing anti-Turkism can be shown in Israel. In 2019, Benjamin Netanyahu's son, Yair Netanyahu, published his tweet criticizing Turkey and warned that Istanbul shall be renamed Constantinople, sparking a political crisis between Turkey and Israel.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190319-erdogan-slams-israel-pm-and- son-over-anti-turkey-tweets/ In 2020, Israel was accused for secretly aiding the Arab countries against Turkey in the Libyan conflict,https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/the-purpose-of-the-anti- turkish-campaign Israeli nationalist groups have recently burned Turkish flag in response to Erdoƒüan's decision converting Hagia Sophia back to a mosque further deepens growing anti-Turkish enmity among Israelis.https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-group-burns-turkish- flag-over-hagia-sophia-move/1909334 Malta The Maltese have a colourful vocabulary stemming from their fight against the Ottoman Empire during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. For example, the expression tghammed tork is used when the sun is visible during rainfall; it means \\"a Turk has been baptised\\", which was considered a rare event. The phrase twieled tork (\\"a Turk was born\\") is also used. Another expression is haqq ghat-torok (\\"curse on the Turks\\"), used when something goes wrong. Netherlands Turks are the second-largest ethnic minority group in the Netherlands.Hagendoorn, L., & Hraba, J. (1989). Foreign, different, deviant, seclusive and working class: Anchors to an ethnic hierarchy in the Netherlands. Ethnic and Racial Studies, (12), 441‚Äì468. Although policies toward Turks in the Netherlands are more progressive than those in many other European countries, such as Germany,Mendes, H. F. (1994). Managing the multicultural society: The policy making process. Paper presented at the Conference on Today's Youth and Xenophobia: Breaking the Cycle. Wassenaar, Netherlands: Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. Human Rights Watch criticized Dutch legislation that it said violated Turks' rights. In a report on the Netherlands in 2008, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance wrote that the Turkish minority had been particularly affected by \\"stigmatisation of and discrimination against members of minority groups\\". The report also noted that \\"the tone of Dutch political and public debate around integration and other issues relevant to ethnic minorities has experienced a dramatic deterioration\\". According to the European Network Against Racism, an international organisation supported by the European Commission, half of all Turks in the Netherlands report having experienced racial discrimination. The network also noted \\"dramatic growth\\" of Islamophobia and antisemitism. In 2001, another international organisation, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, highlighted a negative trend in Dutch attitudes towards minorities, compared with average European Union results.Thalhammer, E., Zucha, V., Enzenhofer, E., Salfinger, B., & Ogris, G. (2001). Attitudes towards minority groups in the European Union: A special analysis of the Eurobarometer 2000 survey on behalf of the European Monitoring Centre on racism and xenophobia. Vienna, Austria: EUMC Sora. . That analysis also noted that, compared to other Europeans, the Dutch were \\"more in favour of cultural assimilation of minorities\\" rather than \\"cultural enrichment by minority groups\\".  New Zealand  The perpetrator of the Christchurch Mosque Shootings was motivated by strong anti-Turkish sentiments, characterizing the Ottoman Turks as an enemy of what he sees to be the European culture, having painted his rifle with historical references symbolic to popular historical debates, political arguments and internet memes often used to ridicule the Turkish history, such as Skanderberg (an Albanian officer who lead an uprising against the Ottoman Empire), Antonio Bragadin (a Venetian officer who broke an agreement and killed Turkish captives), 1683 (which is the date of the Second Siege of Vienna), Milos Obilic (who is said to have killed the Ottoman Emperor Murat I in Battle of Kosovo in 1389), J√°nos Hunyadi (who has blocked Ottoman attempts to take Belgrade), Ernst Rudiger von Starhemberg (who lead the defeat of Ottomans in 1683), the Kahlenberg Battle (which marked the beginning of the Ottoman withdrawal from the Siege of Vienna) and ‚ÄòTurkofagos‚Äô (Turk-eater, a nickname used by Greek forces fighting the Ottomans) which he used to shoot 91 people with, 51 fatal (one Turkish) and 40 wounded. His 'manifesto' has a whole section about Turks, dictating Turkish people to stay in Asia Minor, that Istanbul will be destroyed and Hagia Sophia will be christianized, threatening the 5 million Turkish people living in Europe. This declaration references to the ethnic cleansing of the European Turks from the Balkans in which 5.5 Muslim Turks have been exterminated between 1821-1922. The attacker had previously toured Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, visiting Turkey, France, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, North Korea and Pakistan, where he has made contacts with far-right groups with same ideology as his, indicating the wide spread of hate-based extremist cells, especially nested in the Balkans. He also identifies himself as a \\"kebab removalist\\", referencing to the famous racist 'remove kebab' internet meme often used by the far-right ultranationists and racists to mock the extermination of the Turks and Muslims in the Balkans, especially the Srebrenica massacre. He was also playing the 'remove kebab' song in his car before the shooting. Former Soviet Union A World War I Russian propaganda poster depicting an imagined Turk running away from a Russian. =Armenia= Armenia‚ÄìTurkey relations have historically been hostile, primarily because of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and Turkey's denial that it happened. According to a 2007 survey, 78% of Armenians see Turkey as a threat. = Georgia = Georgians look with a wary eye to Turkey's growing Neo-Ottomanism and the rise in popularity of irredentist maps showing Turkey with borders expanded into the former Ottoman Empire, usually including Adjara. Although some Turks have since come back to Meskheti, the Georgians and Armenians who settled in their homes have vowed to take up arms against any who return. Many Georgians have also argued that the Meskhetian Turks should be sent to Turkey, \\"where they belong\\".. = Russia = According from Robert Crew, Russia has been historically more tolerant towards Turkic people than any other European administrations, and many Turkic people (Volga Tatars, Bashkirs, Karachays, Nogais, Kazakhs, Chuvash, for examples), most of them Muslims, were fairly treated under Tsarist Russia. However, not all Turkic peoples received such generous treatment, for instance, Crimean Tatars under Russian Tsarist administration were forced to leave their houses for Turkey due to Russian colonial politics in the Crimean peninsula. Many Muslim Turks also formed a significant part of Russian Imperial administration and a major bulk of Russian army in its expansion.https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032231 However, anti-Turkism is sometimes expressed under Russian rule, especially since the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the NKVD and the Red Army carried out ethnic cleansing during World War II through mass deportations of Turks.. In June 1945, Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet minister of foreign affairs, formally demanded that Turkey surrender three Armenian provinces (Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin), and Moscow was also preparing to support Armenian claims to several other provinces. War against Turkey seemed possible, and Joseph Stalin wanted to drive out Turks (especially in Meskheti, near the Turkish‚ÄìGeorgian border) who were likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.. The campaign is relatively poorly documented, but Soviet sources suggest that 115,000 Turks were deported, mainly to Central Asia. Most of them settled in Uzbekistan,. but many others died along the way. More recently, some Turks in Russia, especially Meskhetian Turks in Krasnodar, have faced human rights violations, including deprivation of citizenship and prohibitions on employment and owning property. Since 2004, many Turks have left the Krasnodar region for the United States as refugees. They are still barred from full repatriation to Georgia.. = Uzbekistan = While Turkey and Uzbekistan have a fair relations for being commonly Turkic, some tensions were witnessed. In 1989, 103 people died and more than 1,000 were wounded in ethnic clashes between Turks and Uzbeks. Some 700 houses were destroyed, and more than 90,000 Meskhetian Turks were driven out of Uzbekistan.. Many Turks see these events as their \\"second deportation\\". Those who remained in Uzbekistan complained of ethnic discrimination. United States Anti-Turkism first appeared in the United States during the World War I, when the Armenian Genocide broke out and reported by American newspapers.https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html?mcubz=1 These reports had reinforced a sense of solidarity to Armenians and increasingly anti-Turkish rhetorics in the United States, with the Turks being equally seen as a barbaric people.https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP5.HTM For this reason, anti- Turkism has become a major issue on the problematic Turkey‚ÄìUnited States relations, even though the two countries are parts of NATO. Another reason is since most Turks are Muslims, it is often mingled with Islamophobia, further worsened the perception of Turkish people in the United States, with Turkish mosques facing increasing attacks by American nationalist groups.https://www.dailysabah.com/americas/2019/05/14/turkish-mosque-in-us- suffers-serious-damage-after-anti-muslim-arson-attack-in-ramadan Outside the Armenian genocide, anti-Turkism is also ranged by the fact the United States found bond with most of European countries, where most modern Americans traced their ancestry from.https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/hilal_kaplan/2016/08/12/what-about- anti-turkism-in-the-west  In Contemporary Media = Movies  Dracula Untold = The plot revolves around glorifying Vlad the Impaler, a historical figure that is known to have committed mass murder against the Turks, portraying him as an honorable freedom fighter rather than the brutal figure in actual history. With the numerous usage of the word 'Turk' through out the movie, an ethnicity is constructed that wasn't present in the time, such as calling a Roman 'Italian' would have the same effect of calling an Ottoman a 'Turk'. Mehmet II is misleadingly portrayed as a spoiled and greedy young villain who easily attacks women and children, while in truth it was Vlad that used scorched earth tactics to devastate the people of Balkans. = Midnight Express = Midnight Express is criticized for its unfavorable portrayal of Turkish people. In her 1991 book Turkish Reflections: A Biography of Place, Mary Lee Settle wrote: 'The Turks I saw in Lawrence of Arabia and Midnight Express were like cartoon caricatures, compared to the people I had known and lived among for three of the happiest years of my life.' Pauline Kael, in reviewing the film for The New Yorker, commented, 'This story could have happened in almost any country, but if Billy Hayes had planned to be arrested to get the maximum commercial benefit from it, where else could he get the advantages of a Turkish jail? Who wants to defend Turks? (They don‚Äôt even constitute enough of a movie market for Columbia Pictures to be concerned about how they are represented.)' One reviewer, writing for World Film Directors, wrote: \\"Midnight Express is 'more violent, as a national hate-film than anything I can remember', 'a cultural form that narrows horizons, confirming the audience‚Äôs meanest fears and prejudices and resentments'.\\" David Denby of New York criticized Midnight Express as 'merely anti-Turkish, and hardly a defense of prisoners' rights or a protest against prison conditions'. Denby said also that all Turks in the movie ‚Äî guardian or prisoner ‚Äî were portrayed as 'losers' and 'swine', and that 'without exception [all the Turks] are presented as degenerate, stupid slobs'. Turkish Cypriot film director Dervi≈ü Zaim wrote a thesis at the University of Warwick on the representation of Turks in the film, in which he concluded that the one- dimensional portrayal of the Turks as 'terrifying' and 'brutal' served merely to reinforce the sensational outcome, and was likely influenced by such factors as Orientalism and capitalism. = My Big Fat Greek Marriage = The movie bestows constant slurs against the Turks, but only in Greek language, so the English speakers are not aware of the problematic language of the movie. The lines such as \\"You ugly Turk, you are going to kidnap me\\", \\"Bloodthirsty Turks\\", \\"When my people were writing philosophy, your people were swinging from trees.\\" depict a portrayal of Turks as barbarians and Greek supremacism without any clarification of an alternate view. The leading actress, Nia Vardalos, later participated in a Saturday Night Live episode where Turks were portrayed as dirty, smoking, Arabic speaking, ragtag, nose picking and anti- Armenian characters, which was heavily criticized by the Turkish Forum, a network of expat Turks which protested NBC and asked for a public apology, and the received heavy criticism by the Turks on the internet.  TV Shows  Friends = Monica wears a fez over an actual turkey on her head In one of the Thanksgiving Day special episodes, one of the characters, Monica, shows a raw turkey over her head and to complete the ethnic nature of the joke, puts a fez on top of her head, which is used to depict Turks in contemporary western culture, and then starts belly dancing, something that non-Turks often associate with being Turkish. 'Cooking Turkey' (not 'Cooking a turkey') is part of the racial linguistic humor often seen in media.  Anti-Turkish slurs and sentiments in various countries  It's possible to come across anti- Turkish phrases, idioms and maxims in various different countries: *: In rural Austria, children often say the rhyme \\"Es ist schon dunkel. T√ºrken kommen. T√ºrken kommen\\" (\\"It's getting dark, Turks are coming, Turks are coming.\\") *: In German, the phrase \\"get√ºrkt\\" ('turkified') which means that something is fraudulent or forged, is still in contemporary use. Also the exclamation words \\"Kruzit√ºrken\\" and \\"K√ºmmelt√ºrke\\" have the same meaning as \\"Shit!\\" or \\"Damn!\\" in English *: In Armenian the word Turk is generally used to question the mental faculties of a person: \\"’∞’∏ ’©’∏÷Ç÷Ä÷Ñ ’π’•’Ω?!\\" (\\"Are you Turk?\\"). Also phrase is used to describe a dirty home: \\"’Ø’°÷Ä’Æ’•’Ω ’©’∏÷Ç÷Ä÷Ñ’´ ’ø’∏÷Ç’∂ ’¨’´’∂’´\\" (\\"This looks like the house of a Turk?\\") Also in the Armenian community, the phrase \\"Dacik\\" is used to define Turks and Muslims.Ahmet Talat Onay, ‚ÄúNasƒ±l T√ºrk√ß√º Oldum-2‚Äù Duygu gazetesi, sayƒ±:278, √áankƒ±rƒ±.\\"\\"Bu Hƒ±ristiyan √ßocuklar bize Osmanlƒ± derlerdi.

United Kingdom is a case that was argued before the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in February 1997, that no violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights occurred. Facts During an investigation led by the Obscene Publications Squad of the Metropolitan Police, several video tapes of homosexual, sado-masochistic sexual encounters were obtained by the police. These encounters involved the applicants and possibly as many as forty-four other men. On the basis of their violent sadomasochistic actions, the men were convicted for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In R v. Brown, the House of Lords upheld their judgement, finding that consent was not a defence to their actions in these circumstances. The applicants believed that a violation of Article 8 had occurred because the activities were consensual, conducted in a private setting, and none of the participants required medical attention. Judgment The European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that no violation of Article 8 occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the State the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of public health and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. More specifically, the Court ruled that the reasons that the police gave for confiscating the tapes were valid, and that the action was justified granted the number of charges that were brought against the applicants. The ruling also questioned whether or not the tapes could be considered part of the applicants' private lives, because so many people were involved in the footage, as well as because the applicants made and distributed the recordings in the first place. The Court stressed that the ruling in Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom should be seen as distinct from that in Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, an earlier, similar case relating to sexual behavior between consenting adults. Related case * K. A. and A. D. v. Belgium (17.2.2005, applications 42758/98 and 45558/99) * ADT v.

More than 7000 prisoners from 23 countries were imprisoned there between April 1944 and April 1945. The camp was situated in the village of Langenstein, Saxony- Anhalt, that has since been absorbed into the town of Halberstadt.  History  The first group of deportees from Buchenwald arrived on 21 April 1944. They were 18, French, and formed the executives of the Kommando future. They were initially placed in an inn of the periphery of Langenstein, then, the convoys following one another, while waiting for the completion of the construction of the camp, in a barn, which still exists, located at the exit of the village. Six convoys arrived, from 26 September 1944 to 18 February 1945. The construction of the camp was completed in August 1944 with the electrified enclosure; 7 blocks plus the appendices (Revier, kitchen, etc.) the inn and the barn replaced. When manpower reached 5,100 prisoners, in February 1945, there were 18 blocks. Manpower decreased then (4,400 people at the beginning of April 1945), the number of deaths exceeded the number of the newcomers by far. In the week from 19 to 25 March 1945, on 1308 dead deducted for Buchenwald and its Kommandos, Langenstein-Zwieberge had the unhappy privilege to arrive at the head, with 234 dead, in front of Ohrdruf (207) and Leau (69). Work As of the first days of their arrival, the deportees started to dig galleries in the still virgin site of the hills of Thekenberge. In ten months of terrible sufferings, the prisoners completed nearly 10 km of galleries, of a surface of 60.000 m¬≤. Some were enough vast to accommodate trains of coaches. Some had cost a death per meter of projection. Life expectancy for prisoners was six weeks. Prisoners worked in two 12-hour shifts under atrocious conditions, in dust, insufficient air, and under the blows of the kapos. Many returned to the camp exhausted, with barely enough energy to eat their soup. The principal goal of the excavations was to hide production facilities for the Junkers factories that would build new types of jets and weapons. With this in mind, the Junkers firm arranged a small camp of three huts inside the large camp in edge of the place of call to place there deportees specialists, 869 people, arrivals of Kommandos of Halberstadt, Aschersleben, Langensalza, and Niederorschel. The small camp, with neither reed nor straw mattress, the prisoners, like the others, were forced to dig tunnels. Deaths Dead prisoners were initially sent to the Quedlinburg by horse-drawn car, then by truck. The ashes of 912 victims, including 131 French, rest in the cemetery of this city. In March, the crematory couldn't continue its work for lack of fuel, and the bodies accumulated in a hut. They were buried, either in four large pits outside the camp that contain more than 700, or close to Revier, inside the camp, in a pit where several hundreds of other bodies lie. The corpses were transported, by two, in wooden cases carried by four prisoners after work. They emptied the cases into the pits and the downward file was going to seek a new loading until almost complete exhaustion of the mass grave. The last bodies, in full decomposition, untransportable, remained in the hut. The S.S. responsible for the loading closed again the hut with key because there had been flights of thighs of corpses. On the evening of 9 April 1945, ahead of the advance of the American troops, who reached the Elbe, 3,000 survivors of the camp, in six columns of 500, escorted by the S.S. marched east. The majority went during 15 days and, after 300 km, were found close to Wittenberg, on Elbe. One column was completely destroyed without a trace. Another column marched until 28 April and arrived close to Berlin with only 18 survivors. It is roughly estimated that 500 to 1500 survived these column marches. Liberation of the camp On 11 April 1945, the US 8th Armored Division, 83rd Infantry Division liberated the camp.https://83rdinfdivdocs.org/documents/331st/AAR/AAR_331_APR1945.pdfhttps://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/finding- aids/pdf/us-army-unit-records-6.pdf The first Allied soldier in the camp, First Lieutenant Raymond L. Reed, a medic with the U.S 8th Armored Division writes, \\"Sometime between Apr. 10 ‚Äì 15th I found Langenstein concentration camp when the townspeople told me there was a ‚ÄúConcentrations-lager‚Äù on the hill overlooking the town. I opened the gates and not a sound from the camp, no dogs, no guards, nothing. Drew my P-38 from my holster & opened the door of the 1st barrack & found a horrible sight ‚Äì emaciated men 3 to 4 to a bunk, some dead, some alive. No reaction ‚Äì living zombies just stared at me. Estimated 1,000 alive. Radioed back for field hospital. Only 100 remained alive 1 week later. Took book on prisoners from headquarters and gave to my commanding officer ‚Äì prisoners fed only water and potato peels.\\"Raymond L. Reed, MD Memoirs First Allied infantry soldiers to discover the camp, PFCs Norman Panagos and Irving \\"Ike\\" Olshaker of M Company, 331st Regiment, 83rd Infantry Division, report seeing German jeeps exiting the rear of the camp as the infantrymen approach the front gate. GIs were stunned at the sight and smell, and handed out what little rations and cigarettes they had on them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvylz2iyYe8&list;=PLnSox-385pif1YW5h2vWLwiae3c9pSm6Q&index;=3 Excerpt from an after action report of the 78th Armored Medical Battalion concerning the Langenstein concentration camp: ‚ÄúA camp for political prisoners. In fact it was an ‚Äúextermination‚Äù camp, the inmates being forced to work about 15 hour per day in the nearby mine on a small ration of dry bread and water. When prisoners became too weak to work there were generally executed bu the SS guards. Mortality averaged about 300 per month. They were buried in communal graves, a new layer being added each day. Number presently is about 1100, all male, roughly divided as follows‚Äî300 Poles, 200 Russians, 200 French, 100 Belgians and Dutch, 200 Czechs and 100 Germans. As a consequence of bad treatment by the Germans during the last days of their regime, the present death rate is between 25-30 per day. The average weight of the patients is 60 lbs, due to malnutrition. The men are all lousy and the barracks and wooden beds are full of lice, the there is no report of typhus. Practically all have dysentery. Most of the inmates are stretcher cases.‚ÄùCite web  url=http://www.8th-armored.org/pics/8cc/8cc_p03.htm title = 8th Armored Division - Photos}} An excerpt from an article in Stars and Stripes, Friday April 20, 1945, reads, ‚ÄúThe smell of death was there, even among the still living. In the hospital were those about to die. There was one man who had been beaten about the hips for stealing potato peelings. He just didn't have any flesh there any more. The rest of the men in the hospital had dysentery. They lay there in their own excrement, too weak to move. One man, stronger than the rest, stood ant the door. He wore only a short nightshirt. You could see he had no thighs, no calves, no hips. His legs were bones with great knobs for knees. His body was a skeleton covered with taut, gray skin.‚Äù On 18 April all these patients were taken by military ambulances to a barracks of Halberstadt which had been transformed into a hospital. The majority of the evacuees died there in the days that followed. Their remains rest in a common grave in the city cemetery.  The Langenstein-Zwieberge Memorial  On 11 September 1949 a memorial and a commemorative plaque were inaugurated at the place of the common graves. Since 1976 there exists a museum on the ground of the Memorial of Langenstein-Zwieberge.  References and sources = Testimonies  *Adler, H. G. Panorama. Roman in 10 Bildern. Olten 1968.

Taylor achieved notoriety in Germany for his eccentric appearance, notably his wig, which he fashioned himself from electrical tape.

Baskerville is classified as a transitional typeface , intended as a refinement of what are now called old-style typefaces of the period, especially those of his most eminent contemporary, William Caslon. Compared to earlier designs popular in Britain, Baskerville increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form, influenced by the calligraphy Baskerville had learned and taught as a young man. Baskerville's typefaces remain very popular in book design and there are many modern revivals, which often add features such as bold type which did not exist in Baskerville's time. As Baskerville's typefaces were proprietary to him and sold to a French publisher after his death, some designs influenced by him were made by British punchcutters. The Fry Foundry of Bristol created a version, probably cut by their typefounder Isaac Moore. Marketed in the twentieth century as \\"Fry's Baskerville\\" or \\"Baskerville Old Face\\", a digitisation based on the more delicate larger sizes is included with some Microsoft software. History The Folio Bible printed by Baskerville in 1763. Baskerville's first publication, an edition of Virgil. The design shows the smooth, gleaming finish of his paper and minimal title pages. Baskerville's typeface was part of an ambitious project to create books of the greatest possible quality. Baskerville was a wealthy industrialist, who had started his career as a writing-master (teacher of calligraphy) and carver of gravestones, before making a fortune as a manufacturer of varnished lacquer goods. At a time when books in England were generally printed to a low standard, using typefaces of conservative design, Baskerville sought to offer books created to higher-quality methods of printing than any before, using carefully made, level presses, a high quality of ink and very smooth paper pressed after printing to a glazed, gleaming finish. While Baskerville's types in some aspects recall the general design of William Caslon, the most eminent punchcutter of the time, his approach was far more radical. Beatrice Warde, John Dreyfus and others have written that aspects of his design recalled his handwriting and common elements of the calligraphy taught by the time of Baskerville's youth, which had been used in copperplate engraving but had not previously been cut into type in Britain. Such details included many of the intricate details of his italic, such as the flourishes on the capital N and entering stroke at top left of the italic 'p'. He had clearly considered the topic of ideal letterforms for many years, since a slate carved in his early career offering his services cutting tombstones, believed to date from around 1730, is partly cut in lettering very similar to his typefaces of the 1750s. The result was a typeface cut by Handy to Baskerville's specifications that reflected Baskerville's ideals of perfection. According to Baskerville, he developed his printing projects for seven years, releasing a prospectus advertisement for the project in 1754, before finally releasing his first book, an edition of Virgil, in 1757, which was followed by other classics. At the start of his edition of Paradise Lost, he wrote a preface explaining his ambitions. In 1758, he was appointed University Printer to the Cambridge University Press. It was there in 1763 that he published his master work, a folio Bible. Reception A detail view of Baskerville's Bible for Cambridge, showing the crispness of the impression. The crispness of Baskerville's work seems to have unsettled (or perhaps provoked jealousy in) his contemporaries, and some claimed the stark contrasts in his printing damaged the eyes. Baskerville was never particularly successful as a printer, being a printer of specialist and elite editions, something not helped by the erratic standard of editing in his books. Abroad, however, he was much admired (if not directly imitated, at least not his style of type design), notably by Pierre Simon Fournier, Giambattista Bodoni and Benjamin Franklin (who had started his career as a printer), who wrote him a letter praising his work. His work was later admired in England by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, who wrote that 'in his Italic letter...he stands unrivalled; such elegance, freedom and perfect symmetry being in vain to be looked for among the specimens of Aldus and Colinaeus...Baskerville was a truly original artist, he struck out a new method of printing in this country and may be considered as the founder of that luxuriant style of typography at present so generally prevails; and which seems to have attained perfection in the neatness of Whittingham, the elegance of Bulmer and the splendour of Bensley.\\" Thomas Curson Hansard in 1825 seems to have had misgivings about his work, praising his achievement in some ways but also suggesting that he was a better printer than a type designer. On his death his widow Sarah eventually sold his material to a Paris literary society connected to Beaumarchais, placing them out of reach of British printing. A. F. Johnson however cautions that some perhaps over-patriotic British writers on type design have over-estimated Baskerville's influence on continental type design: \\"there seems to be no trace of a Baskerville school outside Great Britain, except of course in the use of actual Baskerville types. Didot proceeded from the \\"romains du roi\\" and would have so proceeded if Baskerville had never printed. Even in England, where there was a Baskerville period in typography, the modern face came from the French, and not as a development from Baskerville.\\" Baskerville's styles of type and printing, although initially unpopular in Britain, proved influential for a brief transitional period in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, with printers and type designers such as Joseph Fry, Isaac Moore who may have been Fry's punchcutter, and Wilson of Glasgow. Bulmer, cut by the brother of Baskerville's foremen, was one design inspired by it, as is the Bell type cut by Richard Austin. Austin's biographer Alastair Johnston has described this period as a \\"glorious but short-lived\\" period of innovative type design in Britain \\"of harmonious types that had the larger-on-the-body proportions of the Romain du Roi, with the modelling of Baskerville but more colour and fine serifs\\". Philip Gaskell particularly highlights as a successful typeface of this period the Wilson foundry of Glasgow's 'startling' English-sized (14 pt) roman of 1760, following soon from Baskerville's first editions of 1757 and cut extremely large for its point size: \\"Baskerville's influence is obvious, but Wilson has outdone the master in the width, weight and even the size of the face. I think myself that with its large x-height, generous width and clean execution, this elegant fount carries out Baskerville's ideas better than did Baskerville himself.\\" This period saw an increasing influence of Didone printing from the Continent, in particular the types of the Didot family and the editions published by Bodoni. The style then disappeared from view altogether following a full trend towards Didone typefaces, often with a much darker style of impression; Updike suggests that this change mostly happened around 1815‚Äì20. The Scotch Roman genre which proved popular in Britain and America is something of an intermediate between Didone typefaces and Baskerville's influence. The succession of more extreme \\"Didone\\" typefaces quickly replacing Baskerville's style has led to Baskerville being called \\"transitional\\" on the road to the Didone style which dominated printing for a long period, although of course Baskerville would not have considered his design \\"transitional\\" but as a successful end in itself. The original Baskerville type (with some replaced letters) was revived in 1917 by Bruce Rogers, for the Harvard University Press, and also released by G. Peignot et Fils in Paris (France). Modern revivals have added features, such as italics with extra or no swashes and bold weights, that were not present in Baskerville's original work. Baskerville is used widely in documents issued by the University of Birmingham (UK) and Castleton University (Vermont, USA). A modified version of Baskerville is also prominently used in the Canadian government's corporate identity program‚Äînamely, in the 'Canada' wordmark. Another modified version of Baskerville is used by Northeastern University (USA), and the ABRSM. Characteristics Key features of Baskerville are its E where the bottom arm projects further than the upper, a W with no centre serif, and in the lower-case g where the bottom loop is open. Some fonts cut for Baskerville have an 'R' with a straight leg; in others it is curved. Many characters have clear ball terminals, in contrast to the more wedge-shaped serifs of earlier fonts. Most distinctive is the italic, in which the J has a centre-bar and many other italic capitals have flourishes, the 'p' has a tail pointing downwards and to the left (similar to the entrance stroke that would be made with a pen) and the w has a clear centre loop and swash on the left. In general, Baskerville's type has been described as 'rounder, more sharply cut' than its predecessors. (Some of these distinctive features are discarded in many revivals, as seen below.) Baskerville's type featured text figures or lower-case numbers, the only form which was used at the time (Roman numerals would be used to align with the capitals). The capitals are very bold, and (like Caslon's) have been criticised for being unbalanced to the lower-case at large sizes. Baskerville also produced a font for Greek, which survives at Oxford. It has sometimes been criticised as unidiomatic, and has not been particularly popular. He also had cut ornaments, many apparently copied or influenced from those offered by the Ensched√© type foundry of Haarlem. Metal type versions An American adaptation of Isaac Moore's type following Baskerville's style, from the late metal type period. Note the 'Q' and 'a', unlike Baskerville's. The lining figures are not original and the descenders have likely been shortened to fit the American \\"common line\\" standard. The Fry type foundry's copies of first Baskerville (above) and then Caslon (below), shown in a specimen attached to an edition of The Printer's Grammar, 1787. The image illustrates the limits of Baskerville's type's popularity, since they apparently felt the need to cut a copy of Caslon's type also, although the book is set in Baskerville-style type. The following foundries offered versions of Baskerville: * The original punches were sold by Baskerville's widow and eventually ended up in the possession of G. Peignot et Fils by way of Beaumarchais. Charles Peignot donated them to Cambridge University Press in 1953.Jaspert, W. Pincus, W. Turner Berry and A.F. Johnson. The Encyclopedia of Type Faces. Blandford Press Lts.: 1953, 1983, , p. 15Lawson, Alexander. Anatomy Of A Typeface. David R. Godine, Publisher, Inc.: 1990, p. 194 * With Baskerville's equipment unavailable in France, the Fry type foundry of Bristol cut its own version in the late eighteenth century, presumably by typefounder Isaac Moore who also showcased them on his own specimen. These designs feature a slightly different 'a' at large sizes followed in many revivals. Mosley comments that \\"In its larger sizes it is one of the most elegant types which have ever been cut, and it is by no means a simple derivative. The curves of the lower-case letters are flatter than Baskerville's and the serifs are slightly more tapered.\\" It was showcased in a specimen attached to a 1787 reprint of John Smith's Printer's Grammar, in which it was frankly admitted that \\"The plan on which they first sat out was an improvement of the Types of the late Mr. Baskerville of Birmingham\\" but, presumably failing to achieve sufficient popularity, they additionally created copies of Caslon's types. * When Fry's successors closed, this version was acquired and issued (and some sizes possibly recut) by Stephenson Blake under the name \\"Baskerville Old Face\\", with many imitations following its design, often adding lining figures at cap height and the cropped descenders necessary for \\"standard line\\" American printing. * The Fry Foundry version was also copied by American Type Founders. Finding Moore's italic unsatisfactory, they added an italic based on the slightly later Bell typeface cut by Richard Austin. * The British Monotype Corporation cut a copy of Baskerville in 1923 for its hot metal typesetting system, showcased in Penrose's Annual of 1924; it was extremely popular for printing in Britain during the twentieth century. As with other Monotype revivals, the design is sometimes called Baskerville MT. It is bundled with OS X in a somewhat slender digitisation.MacGrew, Mac, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, Oak Knoll Books, New Castle, Delaware, 1993, , p. 27. * Schriftgie√üerei D. Stempel issued a revival in 1926 under the name \\"Original- Baskerville\\". * Linotype AG, the German arm of Mergenthaler Linotype, adapted the Stempel cutting of the face for linecasting in 1927.Lawson, Alexander. Anaotomy Of A Typeface. David R. Godine, Publisher, Inc.: 1990, p. 192 * Linotype's Baskerville was cut in 1923 by George W. Jones, though it was subsequently re-cut in 1936. A bold version was cut by Chauncey H. Griffith in 1939. It may sometimes be called Baskerville LT. More loosely, the Scotch Roman genre of transitional types reflects the influence of Baskerville's work, with increasing influence of Didone type from the continent around the beginning of the nineteenth century; the font Georgia is influenced by this genre. Due to the cachet of the name, other completely unrelated designs were named 'Baskerville' in the hot metal period. Cold type versions Two Baskerville revivals. The top design (Baskerville Old Style in the common Microsoft release) is more suitable for headings and that below (Berthold's) with its thicker strokes for body text. Baskerville Old Style is based on Fry and Moore's recreation, distinguishable by the slightly different curve of its 'a'. As it had been a standard type for many years, Baskerville was widely available in cold type.

Digital versions italic. Monotype's, at top, favours historical accuracy and a quite light colour, retaining the elegant swashed N, Q and T of Baskerville's original. ITC's uses conventional capitals, presumably to offer a more homogenous appearance. Impallari's revival makes the same choice on a thicker structure, more suitable for use at small sizes or onscreen display where there will be no ink spread. As a somewhat precise design that emphasises contrast between thick and thin strokes, modern designers may prefer different revivals for different text sizes, printing methods and onscreen display, since a design intended to appear elegant in large text sizes could look too spindly for body text. Factors which would be taken into account include compensation for size and ink spread, if any (the extent of which depends on printing methods and type of paper used; it does not occur on screens). Among digitisations, Franti≈°ek ≈†torm's extremely complete range of versions is particularly praised for featuring three optical sizes, the text version having thicker strokes to increase legibility as metal type does. Meanwhile, the common digitisation of Baskerville Old Face bundled with many Microsoft products features dramatic contrasts between thin and thick strokes. This makes it most suited to headings, especially since it does not have an italic. Another common question facing revivals is what to do with some letters such as 'N' in italics. On faithful revivals such as the Storm digitisation (shown at top right) they have a swash, but this may be thought too distracting for general use or to space poorly in all-caps text. Accordingly, many revivals substitute (or offer as an alternate) capitals without swashes. Dieter Hofrichter, who assisted G√ºnter Gerhard Lange in designing a Baskerville revival for Berthold around 1980, commented: > We went to Birmingham where we saw original prints by Baskerville. I was > quite astounded by how sharp the printing of his specimens is. They are > razor-sharp: it almost hurt your eyes to see them. So elegant and high- > contrast! He showed in this way what he could achieve. That was > Baskerville's ideal - but not necessarily right for today. Many companies have provided digital releases (some of older Baskerville revivals), including Linotype, URW++, Bitstream and SoftMaker as well as many others. These may have varying features, for example some lacking small caps. Monotype Baskerville is installed on Macs as part of macOS, while many Windows computers receive Moore's adaptation under the name of Baskerville Old Face in the URW digitisation (that described above) without an italic or bold weight. Adaptations Mrs Eaves, a radical reimagination of the Baskerville style by Zuzana Licko, with a low x-height for display use. A particularly idiosyncratic Baskerville revival is Mrs Eaves (1996), designed by Zuzana Licko.Eye, Number 43, Volume 11, Spring 2002. Named after Baskerville's housekeeper-turned-wife, it uses a low x-height to create a bright page without reducing stroke width. Not intended for extended body text, it is often used on book titles and headings. It uses a variety of ligatures to create effects with linked characters. Licko later created a sans-serif companion, Mr. Eaves. Big Moore by Matthew Carter is a recent, complex digitisation of the larger sizes of Isaac Moore's early adaptation, that often called Baskerville Old Face, adding an italic.

The aim of the We Have A Right campaign is to counter the threat to civil liberties posed by religious extremist parties that dominate the political space opened up by the extensive reforms of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa since 1999. Both Sunni and Shia Islamist parties have used their new freedom to operate to try to curtail individual rights by seeking to pass legislation to force gender segregation at the University of Bahrain, ban consumption of alcohol and introduce Sharia Law.

The expedition also found a number of islands in the vicinity of Graham Land, including the Biscoe Islands that were named after him.  Early life  Biscoe was born in Enfield, Middlesex, England. In March 1812, aged seventeen, he joined the Royal Navy and served during the 1812‚Äì1815 war against the United States. By the time of his discharge in 1815, he had become a justice Master. Thereafter he sailed on board merchant shipping as a mate or master, mostly to the East or West Indies.  Southern Ocean expedition, 1830‚Äì1833  In 1830, the whaling company Samuel Enderby & Sons appointed Biscoe master of the brig Tula and leader of an expedition to find new sealing grounds in the Southern Ocean. Accompanied by the cutter Lively, the Tula left London and by December had reached the South Shetland Islands. The expedition then sailed further south, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 22 January 1831, before turning east at 60¬∞S. A month later, on 24 February 1831, the expedition sighted bare mountain tops through the ocean ice. Biscoe correctly surmised that they were part of a continent and named the area Enderby Land in honour of his patrons. On 28 February, a headland was spotted, which Biscoe named Cape Ann; the mountain atop the headland would later be named Mount Biscoe. Biscoe kept the expedition in the area while he began to chart the coastline, but after a month his and his crews' health were deteriorating. The expedition sailed toward Australia, reaching Hobart, Tasmania in May, but not before two crew members had died from scurvy. The expedition wintered in Hobart before heading back toward the Antarctic. On 15 February 1832, Adelaide Island was discovered and two days later the Biscoe Islands. A further four days later, on 21 February, more extensive coastline was spotted. Surmising again that he had encountered a continent, Biscoe named the area \\"Graham Land\\",The name \\"Graham Land\\" is now used to refer to the entire northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula. after First Lord of the Admiralty Sir James Graham. Biscoe landed on Anvers Island and claimed to have sighted the mainland of the Antarctic continent. Biscoe again began charting the new coastline the expedition had found and by the end of April 1832 he had become the third man (after James Cook and Fabian von Bellingshausen) to circumnavigate the Antarctic continent. On the journey home, in July, the Lively was wrecked at the Falkland Islands. The expedition nonetheless returned to London safely by the beginning of 1833. In 1833, Biscoe was again commissioned by Samuel Enderby & Sons to make another voyage of exploration. However, he resigned from the effort, probably because of his health. He instead engaged in the West Indies trade in a much warmer climate. He next took part in sailing ventures in Australian waters. John Biscoe died at sea in 1843 while on a voyage to bring his family from Tasmania back to England. He was 49 years old. Memorials A group of islands and a mountain are named for him. The Biscoe Islands were discovered off the west coast of Graham Land in February 1832, during his Antarctic circumnavigation aboard Tula and Lively. Mount Biscoe is a distinctive 700m black peak, the high point of Cape Ann in East Antarctica. Discovered by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen (by air in 1929) and Mawson (1930), it is thought to have been seen by Biscoe in 1831. Two British research ships have been named in his honour. After conversion to an ice-strengthened research ship for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, HMS Pretext was renamed . She reverted to RRS Pretext in 1956, to allow the name to be used for , a new ship with a longer range and greater cargo-carrying capacity.

The family has included a number of high-profile members, such as the scientists Louis and Alexander Agassiz, as well as the founder of the Longines watch firm, Auguste Agassiz. Family history The early history of the family is sketched out in A Short History of the English Branch of the Agassiz Family, by A.R.N. Agassiz and in Jules Marcou's Life, Letters, And Works of Louis Agassiz. The family was of the Protestant faith and many of their early members were ministers in the Church. The Rev. Jean Pierre Moise Agassiz (1705-1784) was Pastor of Lucens, Thierrens and Constantine, all of which were near Lake Neuchatel. His fourth son, Rev. Philippe Louis Agassiz was the father of the Rev. Louis Benjamin Rudolph Agassiz, who was the father of the naturalist Louis Agassiz and Auguste Agassiz. Louis's son, Alexander, was a geologist like his father but his interests also turned to mining operations. Auguste Agassiz moved to the Swiss town of Saint-Imier and set up his own watch firm in 1833 in partnership with Florian Morel and Henri Raiguel. In 1847 Agassiz became the firm's sole owner and in 1852 his nephew Ernest Francillon joined the firm. In 1866 Francillon acquired two plots of land called Les Longines ('long and narrow fields') and he built a factory there, allowing all the staff to be under one roof for the first time. In 1880 he registered the Longines brand and its famous winged hourglass symbol. The Reverend Jean Pierre Moise Agassiz had another son, David Louis Agassiz (1737‚Äì1807). He left Switzerland with his friend Jacques Necker, moving to Paris to take a job in finance. Necker went on to become minister of finance to Louis XVI, while David Louis moved to England and anglicised his name to Lewis Agassiz. He became a City magnate, amassing a fortune that would be worth many millions today.Arthur Rodolph Nunn Agassiz. A Short History of the Agassiz Family, Shanghai : Oriental Press, 1907 He married Mary Griesdale. His elder son Arthur David Lewis Agassiz (1771‚Äì1866) managed the family business and lost a great deal of his father's fortune. He married Jeanne Suzanne Prevost Rouviere (1776‚Äì1842). Among their many children, was Mary Ann (1799‚Äì1850), who married Joseph Frederick Edlmann (1794‚Äì1857), born in Hollenburg, Austria, and sent with the blessing of his uncle Reyer, of the Trieste trading company, Reyer und Schlitz, to open an office in London, after the fall of Napoleon. They lived in Peckham and are both buried in Nunhead Cemetery. Their son Frederick Joseph Edlmann (1829‚Äì1890), was a partner of the merchant bank Brown Shipley in the City of London, and bought the house Hawkwood, near Bromley, Kent. Another son, Joseph Ernest Edlmann (1831‚Äì1895) was a Major in the King's Dragoon Guards, based in Coventry, and lived in Kent House, Leamington Spa. Arthur's daughter Aldine Agassiz married the clergyman Charles Benjamin Tayler. David Louis's younger son was James John Charles Agassiz (1772‚Äì1858) was a Commander in the Royal Navy and was known for his gallantry in command of HMS Hound off the coast of Estaples, when he sent fire ships in amongst the French fleet. He was praised in despatches by Admiral Lord Nelson. James John Charles Agassiz's elder son Lewis Agassiz (1793‚Äì1866) served in the Royal Marines and was leading one of the firing parties into Washington D.C. as part of the burning of Washington during the War of 1812. The Agassiz family was granted a Coat of Arms, depicting a torch for this action.Agassiz (1907) p6: \\"The crest represents a man's forearm, bared, holding in the hand a torch made of rope. in recognition of the services of Captain J. J. C. Aggasiz RN on the 21st August 1801 ... and also in recognition of the services of Mr Lewis Agassiz at the capture of the city of Washington .. where the public buildings were destroyed by fire; in which act of devastation he assisted, having been in charge of one of the firing parties.\\" After he left the Royal Marines, Lewis Agassiz wrote A Journey to Switzerland, a travel book describing his family's travels in Europe back to his ancestral home. He continued to travel widely, becoming a friend of the King of Prussia who was godfather to one of his children and who bought another a commission in the British Army. Lewis Agassiz lived in the last years of his life at Stour Lodge, Bradfield, Essex. His eldest surviving son, Lewis Nunn Agassiz, also had a military career, but went on to become a pioneer in Canada. He and his family founded the town of Agassiz, British Columbia. Lewis Nunn Agassiz's daughter later wrote an account of pioneer life titled Memories of a Pioneer Life in British Columbia: A Short History of the Agassiz Family. Lewis Agassiz's other children included the Rev. Rodolph Agassiz (d 1899), Rector of Radnage, who married Matilda Isabella Shafto, granddaughter of Sir Cuthbert Shafto of Bavington Hall, Northumberland, from whom the Canadian mountain biker Graham Agassiz descends, and Alfred Agassiz, who emigrated to New Zealand and has many descendants among the Te Whakatohea tribe of the MƒÅori. The Agassiz family is now scattered throughout the world, in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Australia and New Zealand.

Kyle helped Hal defeat Sinestro, and Kyle and Hal both wound up being transported back to Kyle's own time when Sinestro accidentally shoved Hal into Kyle as the Guardians were sending him home. Story The main thrust of the story deals with a much younger Hal having to come to grips with the new reality he's in; specifically, the fact that he's (at that time) one of the most reviled villains, and that his friend Ollie Queen is dead. The other heroes are also unnerved at seeing their comrade back in prime condition and without any of the taint of the villainy his future self did. Kyle, for his part, mixes feelings of awe - at being teamed with 'the greatest Green Lantern' - and self-pity, as he now feels that he's being pushed out of the limelight. Hal winds up having some solo adventures in Kyle's time, including fighting Kalibak, another of Darkseid's sons, when Kalibak tries to challenge Hal to prove his own skill, and Vince Hardy, an old acquaintance who Hal knew during his fighter-pilot days. Hardy had fought against Hal for control of a fighter jet they were test-piloting, which Hardy intended to sell to arms dealers, but Hal fought him off and crashed the fighter jet, which resulted in him being discharged due to the need for a scapegoat for the lost plane, since Hardy had escaped during the fight. Hardy now intends to send a plane to Seattle with a bomb supplied by The Eden Corps, a group of radical environmentalists who were responsible for Ollie's death. Teamed up with the current Green Arrow, Connor Hawke- although he is shocked to learn of Connor's connection to Oliver-, Hal first loses his ring to Hardy, but eventually gets it back and saves the day with Connor's help, Hal preventing the plane from crashing into a mountain before capturing Hardy. The two later visit Ollie's grave, reflecting on how they each feel like they have lost him twice, given the limited time Connor spent with him and the fact that Hal comes from a time before his friendship with Oliver was as close as it would become later. The last two issues deal with Kyle vs. Hal vs. Hal. Parallax (before the events of Zero Hour #0), was jumping through space-time when he notices a disturbance and investigated. Sensing his past self in a time when he shouldn't have been there, Parallax intends to send Hal back to his proper time. Kyle fought against Parallax, but is unable to stop Parallax and Hal from squaring off against each other. After Parallax and Hal fight each other to a standstill- even travelling all the way back to Coast City mere seconds before it was destroyed as Parallax attempts to win Hal over-, Kyle intervenes yet again. Kyle explained that both men had to go back to their proper places in time - and what's more, they had to have no knowledge of these experiences. Hal refuses to go back if it meant that he would turn into Parallax, but Kyle explained that Hal had to go back- and Parallax had to go back, despite the fact that he would be defeated- because Parallax was needed to stop the Sun-Eater during The Final Night. Acknowledging that he is proud have him carry on the Green Lantern tradition, Hal hugged Kyle, whispering to him \\"You'll know what to do with it\\", before all three joined forces: Parallax would be responsible for returning everyone to their proper place in time, Hal's ring would wipe his and Parallax's minds of these events, and Kyle's ring acted to boost their power. With both Hal and Parallax back in their proper time - Hal having defeated Sinestro on his own and Parallax revealing himself as the main villain behind Zero Hour - Kyle reflects on recent events with Jen, his girlfriend... before revealing that Hal gave Kyle a copy of his Green Lantern ring. Aftermath Kyle eventually copies Hal's power ring and gives it to Alan Scott's daughter, Jennifer-Lynn Hayden, allowing her to follow in her father's footsteps as the first female Green Lantern of Earth. Green Lantern vol. 3 #107 In Green Lantern: The New Corps, during a weeks-long adventure in space, Rayner attempts to rebuild the Green Lantern Corps, recruiting Magaan Van'n Intraktus of the planet Van'n, Hammeroon, (a bounty hunter from Ilskado System), Anya Savenlovich, (a lieutenant colonel from Soviet Union Air Force who was in suspended animation after participating in a space mission in 1964), Garl Rathbone, (a miner from the debris belt over the planet Daffith), and Sool, (a judge, also from Daffith.) However, the group later discovered Van'n Intraktus was a traitor. Van'n had used his ring to enslave his home planet and planned to invade and conquer other worlds. The Green Lanterns eventually stopped the renegade after a battle, but at the cost of one of their own, Hammeroon. This led Kyle to the realization that he was not the right person to choose the future corps members and took all of the power rings back, until the time was right for the Corps' rebirth. After erecting a memorial for Hammeroon, Rayner returned to Earth. The former \\"New\\" Lanterns, no longer having their power rings, decided to continue their intergalactic adventures.Green Lantern: The New Corps #1-2 (1999) mini-series by Chuck Dixon, Scot Eaton, Anibal Rodriguez, and Chris Chuckry. Jennifer eventually gave back the power ring Kyle had given her after she regained her Starheart powers and became the superheroine Jade once more. Even so, she is still considered to many as a member of the Corps. John Stewart would eventually take the ring and return as a Green Lantern. Kyle would later being possessed by Ion, the willpower entity, granting him the vast power he needed to create a new generation of Guardians. During Green Lantern: Rebirth, Hal Jordan was resurrected and returned to his role as the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, along with Guy Gardner. Jordan's murderous activity during Emerald Twilight was retconned as being influenced by a fear entity, Parallax. After defeating and imprisoning Parallax, Ganthet and the reborn Guardians succeeded in rebuilding the Green Lantern Corps. Title The title is in keeping with some of the major storylines that have been told in dealing with Parallax, including Emerald Twilight (Hal going insane at losing Coast City and eventually becoming Parallax) and Emerald Fallout (Guy Gardner, in possession of a yellow power ring, fights with Hal, but winds up losing his power when his ring's charge fades - Guy needed to recharge from a Green Lantern power source).

Sir Alexander Colin Cole (16 May 1922 - 18 February 2001) was a long serving officer of arms at the College of Arms in London. Eventually, he would rise to the rank of Garter Principal King of Arms, the highest heraldic office in England. Early life and education Colin Cole was born in Surrey on 16 May 1922, the elder son of Edward Cole, a prosperous staples manufacturer. The family descends from John Cole, a yeoman in the parish of Twickenham, Middlesex, in the mid-17th century. Cole was educated at Dulwich College (where his portrait stands in the stairwell to the Great Hall), Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Brasenose College, Oxford where he read Law. During World War II he served as a captain in the Coldstream Guards. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1949 and pursued a legal career before aspiring to be an officer of arms. In 1944 Colin Cole married Valerie Card. They had four sons and three daughters. Heraldic career In 1953 Cole was Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary at the coronation of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Shortly after this, began his migration from the bar to the College of Arms. This came as a result of the revival, in 1954, of the High Court of Chivalry (which had not sat since 1737) to hear the case of Manchester Corporation versus Manchester Palace of Varieties for wrongfully displaying the city's coat of arms. Cole represented the Palace of Varieties but he lost the case. After a short term as Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary, Cole was appointed an officer in ordinary (a full member of the College of Arms) as Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary in 1957. He became Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in 1966. Cole also served as the College's registrar and librarian from 1967 to 1974. He was appointed Garter Principal King of Arms four years later, in 1978 and held that position until 1992. As Garter, Cole liberalised the rules devised by Sir Anthony Wagner for the admittance of new officers to the College. Previously they had always been university graduates who had also served a heraldic apprenticeship. Under Cole's leadership, this rule no longer applied and the majority of the pursuivants appointed had no pretensions to scholarship. Cole's strong streak of shrewdness and worldly wisdom was deployed to the benefit of the College; indeed, its role was advanced when he was at the helm. His heraldic practice became the largest and most successful of the last century. His achievements and service to his sovereign led to Her Majesty appointing him both KCVO in 1988 and KCB in 1992: the two knighthoods being in her personal gift. Many believe that Cole's chief achievement as Garter King of Arms was the part he played in the restoration of the College building. The structure of the building was overhauled and the brickwork and stone balustrades repaired under the direction of the estate agents Cluttons. This was one of the first times the repair of an important historic building had been entrusted to such a firm rather than to a specialist architect. A member of the Court of Common Council from 1964, Cole became Sheriff in 1977 but had to turn down the opportunity to proceed to Lord Mayor as his duties as Garter would have clashed. He was a Master of the Scriveners, Liveryman of the Basketmakers, and on the Court of the Painter Stainers Companies. He was also a very active freemason. Coats of arms designed *Margaret Thatcher and Denis ThatcherRobert Hardman, 'His and Her coats of arms for a baronet and his Lady', The Electronic Telegraph. Accessed 19 May 2010. Honours and appointments Colin Cole was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1977, was promoted to CVO in 1979, and KCVO in 1983. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1992. Military in bearing and vocabulary, Cole was proud of his rank of Lieutenant- Colonel, RARO (Brevet 1973). Until his knighthood in 1983, he called himself Colonel Cole on the strength of his position in the Honourable Artillery Company. He was honorary Colonel, 6/7 Battalion, the Queen's Regiment, from 1981 to 1986, President of The Royal Society of St George from 1982 to 1998, and Knight Principal of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor from 1995.

The complaint was first filed on 8 June 1994 and ultimately led to the equalisation of the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual acts.  Facts  The Applicant, Mr Euan Sutherland was born in 1977, and after realising he was homosexual, had his first sexual encounter with another homosexual man at the age of 16. Although the Applicant was never prosecuted, there was a justified fear that he may be since, in 1990, 455 prosecutions had given rise to 342 convictions and, in 1991, 213 prosecutions gave rise to 169 convictions. This fear led the Applicant to bring the complaint to the Commission. Under section 12(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 it was an offence for a person to commit buggery with another person and under section 13 it was an offence for a man to commit an act of \\"gross indecency\\" with another man, whether in public or private. The Sexual Offences Act 1967 stated that no offence is committed if both parties are aged 21 or over and consented to the acts.  Judgment  The Commission considered the application and following a hearing published its findings on 1 July 1997. The published findings show that the Commission considered a very wide range of opinions and factors, including the rationale for a higher age of consent for homosexual acts, opinions from medical staff as to what a suitable age limit is and whether a different age for heterosexual and homosexual acts is discriminatory. The commission found that the existence of different age limits was discriminatory and that no valid grounds existed to justify that discrimination. They therefore found that the age of consent for homosexual acts should be lowered to 16. In arriving at their conclusion the commission cited their reasoning in the previous cases, Dudgeon v United Kingdom and Norris v. Ireland. In response to the commission's findings the Applicant and the UK Government, on 13 October 1997, submitted an agreement that a Bill would be proposed to Parliament the summer of 1998 to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. They agreed that once the legislation was passed the Government would pay reasonable costs and the parties would apply to the Court for approval of a friendly settlement. The Government brought the Crime and Disorder Bill to Parliament in June 1998 which contained a provision to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. Those provisions were accepted by the House of Commons, but were rejected by the House of Lords. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 16 December 1998 and the relevant provisions were again endorsed by that house, but were later rejected by the House of Lords. The provisions were then reintroduced for a third time under the Parliament Act 1911 such they could pass into force after a delay of one year. On 28 January 2000, the Bill was re-introduced before the House of Commons and was passed by 263 votes to 102. It was then introduced into the House of Lords on 29 February 2000, where, on 11 April 2000 its Second Reading was not opposed, but some Lords stated they would propose amendments. As a result, the Bill was adopted under the Parliament Act at the end of the 2000 Parliamentary year and the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 received Royal Assent on 30 November 2000 and was brought into force on 8 January 2001. Following a series of requests for extensions, the Court received notification from the Government on 23 January 2001 that the age of consent had been equalised and then on 1 February 2001 that the Government had paid the Applicant's costs. Accordingly, on 27 March 2001, the case was struck out of the Court's lists.

Sony was a court case whose central focus was on whether violent video games played a role in Devin Moore's first-degree murder/shooting of three people in a police station. In August 2005, former attorney Jack Thompson filed the lawsuit against Sony. History Devin Moore was convicted in 2005 for the 2003 shooting of two police officers and a dispatcher as he was being detained for allegedly stealing a car. He grabbed one officer's .45 caliber pistol and killed all three before fleeing the station in a police cruiser he stole from the station. He was eventually caught and sentenced to death by lethal injection. In March 2005, Thompson announced he was filing a lawsuit on behalf of the families of two of the three victims in Fayette, Alabama. He was also featured in a 60 Minutes special on the case.Bradley, Ed. \\"Can A Video Game Lead To Murder?\\". 60 Minutes, 2006-03-05 On August 12, 2005, the third victim's family later joined the lawsuit. On November 1, 2005, Thompson sent an email to various websites commenting on the opening day of the civil trial. In it, he compared Sony and Take-Two Interactive's sale of the Grand Theft Auto video game to Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. According to Thompson, certain regional governments in Japan had prevented the sale of the Grand Theft Auto games to minors, though Sony continued to sell the game where its sale was not restricted in Japan and abroad (Microsoft is doing the same for its own video game console). Thompson also compared the distribution of violent games to the distribution of pornography. On November 4, 2005, Blank Rome submitted a motion to have Thompson removed from the case, stating that Thompson would \\"turn the courtroom into a circus.\\"DeWitt, Robert.

This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore; however, Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement.

He even implied that Spector could be served a subpoena to testify, even though the court's jurisdiction did not extend to Spector's place of residence.

He also claimed he \\"will likely be a witness in the case.\\" Although he gave no details as to what he would be a witness to, except that he claimed he had \\"warned, in writing,\\" Take-Two and Rockstar Games \\"that murders such as those in Alabama would occur by teens who had rehearsed the murders on their virtual reality killing simulators.\\" Judge Moore forbade Thompson from \\"[communicating] with the court or the judge\\" or he \\"would be held in contempt of court.\\" DeWitt, Robert \\"Judge denies attorney‚Äôs request to withdraw from Devin Moore case\\". Tuscaloosa News, November 19, 2005. While that order was appealed, it has not yet been ruled on. On February 16, 2006, Thompson sent a letter to the Alabama Bar, accusing Judge Moore of breaking the bar rules by publicly disclosing that he had filed a complaint about Thompson with the Alabama Bar. He accused Judge Moore of denying Devin Moore a fair trial, and claimed the FBI was investigating the Florida Bar's \\"disciplinary process\\". Thompson gave the Alabama Bar until \\"five o‚Äôclock p.m., Eastern time, February 17, 2006\\" to drop the complaint, or else he would file a \\"federal lawsuit in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida on Monday, February 20, 2006.\\" The Alabama State Bar rules state that a court official who revokes Pro Hac Vice due to conduct must refer the matter to the Bar for review, and the Bar decides if an investigation is needed. No complaint is required to open an investigation. Thompson's deadline of February 17 passed, without action from either party. On February 22, 2006, Thompson followed up with another letter, announcing that he had filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar, for investigating a complaint \\" which in fact was not even filed\\" in \\"violation of its own Bar Rules.\\" The Alabama Bar has not yet been served notice with any complaint from Thompson, nor has any Florida court acknowledged a civil suit being filed. Thompson announced that the Strickland v. Sony plaintiffs were still his clients, and vowed to represent them in-court when the trial resumes.Feldman, Curt \\"GTA killer case clears hurdle\\". GameSpot, March 30, 2006. On October 9, 2007, Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Alabama Bar with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The case has been assigned to the same judge who has had previously presided over attempts by Thompson to sue the Florida Bar, which were voluntarily withdrawn. Thompson claimed that his rights of \\"speech, petition, and religion\\" were violated when his Pro Hac Vice status was revoked. Dismissal appeal denied On March 29, 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore's ruling against the dismissal of the case. Law firm Blank-Rome, representing the defendants, had previously attempted unsuccessfully to have the suit dismissed during the pre-trial since it argued that the defendants had a right under the 1st Amendment to sell mature games to minors. At the time of the sale, there was no law preventing such a sale.

Devon VrMeer completed the trio as drummer. Their sound blended punk, heavy metal and jazz, making them difficult to categorize into a single genre. Allmusic says, \\"Since its inception, the trio has refused to be pigeonholed to any single musical style ‚Äî incorporating elements of hardcore punk, jazz, funk, hard rock, and noise into its challenging sound\\". They were known as one of the most musically diverse bands in the San Francisco underground music scene. Over the years, Victims Family went through four drummers and two break-ups. Their name was taken from a piece by the cartoonist B. Kliban. History In 1984, Victims Family played their first show at the Kennilworth Recreation Center in Petaluma, California, where they later opened for Faith No More and Suicidal Tendencies. In summer 1985, the band made their first U.S. tour, which they booked themselves by mailing out a cassette demo. They played with NOFX in Albuquerque and challenged Tales of Terror to a drinking contest in Dallas. Also that year, they opened for the Dead Kennedys, Descendents and Social Unrest at the Novato Theater, where they first caught the attention of Jello Biafra. In 1986, they opened for the Butthole Surfers and Camper Van Beethoven at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, and recorded their first album, Voltage and Violets, for Ruth Schwartz's Mordam Records, and regularly played The Farm and Club Foot in San Francisco. 1986 was also the year they played at a pizza parlor in Oakland with Nomeansno, beginning a long friendship between the two bands. In 1987, they barely completed a tour of the United States and missed their dates in Canada after being banned from that country for one year. Highlights included playing with Capitol Punishment in Fresno and Scratch Acid in Dallas. A second album, Things I Hate To Admit, was recorded in 1988 at Prairie Sun Studio in Cotati, California. In 1988, they began their friendship with Primus, with whom they shared the stage many times in the years to follow. In 1989, they were invited by Konkurrent, a record label in Amsterdam, for a European tour. VrMeer had left the band to raise a family, so Eric Strand was recruited as drummer. The band embarked on a five-week tour of Europe with Snuff from London supporting them. Highlights included helping to break down the Berlin Wall and being strip searched in Norway. After returning from Europe, Strand was replaced by the roadie Tim Solyan who continued to drum for Victims Family throughout the height of their touring days. Their third album, White Bread Blues, produced by the Nomeansno drummer John Wright, followed in 1990 and was received on a much wider critical and commercial scale than their earlier albums. It included the song \\"'Caged Bird\\", which reached No. 6 on the Dutch national radio charts. Around this time, Mr. Bungle and Green Day, then little known acts, often opened for Victims Family. Also in 1990, they supported Tad and Nirvana on the midwest leg of their cross-country tour. Numerous tours of the US and Europe cemented the group's reputation as an incendiary live act. Their fourth album, The Germ, released in 1992 and also produced by John Wright, was their first for Alternative Tentacles Records. The band's schedule began to take its toll, and in 1992 they took a break. Larry Boothroyd Ten months later, in spring 1993, Victims Family reformed, to play a sold-out show at the Kennel Club in San Francisco. A fifth album, Headache Remedy, was released by Alternative Tentacles in February 1994. Four Great Thrash Songs, the last album of the classic line-up was recorded live in 1994 at their final show at Melkweg in Amsterdam, the band's home from home. Founding members Spight and Boothroyd also formed the bands Saturn's Flea Collar and Hellworms, both of which toured the US and Europe and recorded albums for Alternative Tentacles. After the demise of Hellworms, Spight and Boothroyd continued under the name Victims Family with a new drummer David Gleza of My Name and they recorded the album Apocalicious in 2001. The band continued to tour relentlessly, including two trips to Texas for SXSW, and two more tours of Europe, causing the band to lose Gleza to tour fatigue. This time Spight and Boothroyd decided not to look for another drummer.Tim Solyan On December 11 and 12, 2004, Victims Family reunited, with Solyan back on drums, at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma, California, and in San Francisco at the Bottom of the Hill, to celebrate their 20th anniversary with all their different incarnations, including The Freak Accident (Spight's solo project) and Meowmeow and the Meowmeows (Boothroyd's new band). Also included at this time was a Saturn's Flea Collar 10th anniversary reunion and a Hellworms reunion. This sparked subsequent shows with both Hellworms and Victims Family. In 2006, Boothroyd began playing with the Bay Area band that came to be known as Triclops! and began touring and releasing records with them. The Freak Accident released an LP on Alternative Tentacles and toured Europe with Nomeansno. Triclops! released a full-length album, Out of Africa, on Alternative Tentacles in March 2008, and a their follow-up, Helpers On The Other Side, also on Alternative Tentacles, in 2010. Solyan has been in a few bands over the years including The Kehoe Nation (for whom he played select drum tracks on Music For Livers), Wingnut, Jerry Rigg & the El Chupos. He is currently back with Bryan Kehoe in a duo of guitar and drums called Black Cat Grave. In 2009, the band appeared at the Phoenix Theater in Petaluma with Nomeansno and also for Alternative Tentacles 30th Anniversary shows in San Francisco with Alice Donut, Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, Spight's latest band. In 2010, Victims Family was invited to play in the Czech Republic with Nomeansno, Le Silo (Japan), and a group of Cuban dancers and typewriter players to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday. This turned into a whirlwind mini-tour in Europe where they played nine shows in nine days. In 2012, they released the \\"Have A Nice Day\\" single on Alternative Tentacles, made another short tour of Europe and played a handful of Northern California shows.

Plot In this police thriller that partly takes place in Chicago Union Station (though filmed instead at Los Angeles Union Station), a railroad policeman, William Calhoun, is approached at work by an apprehensive passenger named Joyce Willecombe (Nancy Olson) who believes that two travelers aboard her train may have been up to no good. Joyce is the secretary to a rich man named Henry Murchison (Herbert Hayes), whose blind daughter, Lorna, has been kidnapped and held for ransom. The railway station where Calhoun works has been chosen as the location to pay off the ransom. Calhoun and fellow cop Inspector Donnelly race against time to find the kidnappers and bring them to justice. Cast * William Holden as Detective Lt.

Sydney Boehm's script for the film version was nominated for an Edgar in the screenplay category. Aside from changing the setting from New York City's Grand Central Station to Chicago's Union Station (though the Los Angeles Union Station was the actual filming location), and changing the kidnap victim from a little boy to a blind, teen-aged girl, the script was quite faithful to its source material. William Holden and Nancy Olson also appeared in Sunset Boulevard the same year. Filming locations Filming locations include: Union Station, Downtown Los Angeles, California. Also, it looks like it was filmed on Chicago's South Side El from 1892 to Indiana station, where the train is uncoupled to go on the Stockyards Branch, which ran until 1957. Normally, the branch ran as a shuttle. It terminated at Exchange station, which was the terminal after 1956.IMDb, Filming Locations section, ibid. Reception The staff at Variety gave actor William Holden a good review, writing, \\"William Holden, while youthful in appearance to head up the railway policing department of a metropolitan terminal, is in good form.\\"Variety. Film review, October 4, 1951. Last accessed: January 16, 2008. Channel 4's film review notes, \\"Despite the barely believable plot, the film has a real edge. Made in 1950, it obviously can't push to the extremes of Dirty Harry but it shares the same mean spirit. Mat√© capitalizes on the story's setting by using innocent passengers and the station's dramatic spaces to heighten the feverish atmosphere.\\"Channel 4. Film review, 2008. Last accessed: January 6, 2008. Critic Jerry Renshaw lauded the film and wrote, \\"On the surface, Union Station is a fairly routine action film for 1950, with its high level of suspense, strong-arm police procedural tactics, and caper-film trappings. However, a definite noir outlook is belied (sic) by the fact that the police play as rough as the bad guys, blurring the lines of good and evil. Audiences are used to seeing Barry Fitzgerald as a kindly Irish priest in most roles; during the scene on the empty platform, though, Fitzgerald's Inspector Donnelly tells the cops in his most charming Father O'Flaherty voice, 'Make it look accidental.' That's one of the more chilling moments of noir, more suited to James Ellroy than Fifties Hollywood. Director Mat√© also helmed the classic D.O.A. in 1950.\\"Renshaw, Jerry.

The Arusha Agreement was a treaty signed on 24 September 1969 in Arusha, Tanzania, between the European Community and the three East African states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1971, concomitant with the second Yaound√© Convention, with the aim of establishing better economic relations between the EC and the African states. At the end of their validity time, the Lom√© Convention was signed which substituted the previous agreements and enlarged them to 46 ACP countries.EU-ACP Trade Relations, Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development Retrieved 11 February 2012.  History  In 1967, three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) that were not members of the Associated African and Malagasy States (AAMS), but were instead member states of the Commonwealth of Nations combined to establish the East African Community (EAC). On 26 July 1968 the EEC signed an initial Association Agreement with the EAC. That Agreement did not enter into force because it was not ratified by all the countries involved. On 24 September 1969 in Arusha, a second Agreement was signed between the EEC and the EAC. That Agreement was signed at the same time as the Convention of Association between the EEC and the AAMS (Yaound√© II); both the Arusha Agreement and the Yaound√© II Convention entered into force on 1 January 1971 for a period of five years.  Content  The Arusha Agreement established a trade association (partial free-trade areas and joint institutions) but, unlike the Yaound√© II Convention, without financial and technical cooperation. Accordingly, the Agreement covered trade (Title I), the right of establishment and the provision of services (Title II), payments and capital (Title III), institutional provisions (Title IV), and general and final provisions (Title V).

Family He is the grandson of Todd Andrews, a leading Irish republican figure and member of Fianna F√°il following the foundation of the party. His father Niall Andrews and his uncle David Andrews both served as Fianna F√°il TDs, while his first cousin Barry Andrews was elected a Fianna F√°il TD at the 2002 general election and is now an MEP. He was the fourth member of his family to have sat in the D√°il. He is a cousin of the comedy writer and performer David McSavage, and another cousin, Ryan Tubridy, is a chatshow host of The Late Late Show on RT√â One. Andrews is married with two daughters. Political career In May 2007, Andrews topped the poll in the Dublin South- East constituency, on his second attempt, gaining 6,600 first preferences. He was a member of Dublin City Council between 1999 to 2004, 2006 to 2007 and 2014 to 2020. He was convenor of the Oireachtas Finance Committee, and was a member of the Trade, Enterprise and Employment Committee and the European Scrutiny Committee in the 30th D√°il. Andrews in 2014 Support for Palestine During the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict he called for an economic, diplomatic and political boycott of Israel, for its ambassador to Ireland to be expelled, and for shops to remove \\"settler produce\\" from Israel. He said that Israel had the right to defend itself, but that its disproportionate response meant that \\"...it can only now be classified as a terror state\\". He later told a Russian reporter that there was no electricity in Gaza throughout his time there. On 30 May 2010, he was one of three Irish politicians who were prevented from leaving Cyprus by authorities to join an international flotilla carrying aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip. In March 2011, Andrews set off on another flotilla to Gaza. His shipmates included Sinn F√©in's Aengus √ì Snodaigh. In November 2011, Andrews was reported to be on board another ship heading to Gaza on a humanitarian mission. Resignation from Fianna F√°il In the aftermath of the 2011 general election, in which he and many other Fianna F√°il members lost their seats as TDs, Fianna F√°il were struggling in the polls. In August 2012, Andrews left the Fianna F√°il party. He claims that he was disillusioned with the lack of direction the party was taking after it was revealed he had been using a Twitter account to anonymously attack party leader Miche√°l Martin and other senior members, including a constituency rival, Councillor Jim O'Callaghan. Andrews claimed that his decision to quit the party was not related to the Twitter account even though his resignation followed two days after he had been confronted about his online trolling activity and cyberbullying of party colleagues. As a member of Sinn F√©in In September 2013, he joined Sinn F√©in and successfully contested the 2014 local elections for the Pembroke South Dock local electoral area of Dublin City Council for the party. In February 2015, he was selected to contest the new constituency of Dublin Bay South at the 2016 general election; however, he failed to be elected. He was the Sinn F√©in candidate for the Dublin Bay South constituency at the 2020 general election and was elected. Daniel Ceitinn was co-opted to Andrews' seat on Dublin City Council following his election to the D√°il.

She was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of murder at her trial in July 1997 and served 14 years before being released from prison. Murder Andrews stabbed Harvey over 42 times with a pen knife after they had stopped in his car following an argument on the way to their flat in The Becks, Alvechurch, Worcestershire, during the early hours of 1 December 1996. At a press conference on 3 December 1996, she claimed that Harvey was killed in a road rage attack, saying that a \\"fat man with staring eyes\\" had stabbed him over 30 times after getting out of a Ford Sierra in which he was a passenger. Over the next two weeks, police carried out investigations to track down the murderer of Lee Harvey. On 5 December, Tracie Andrews was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose, and was still in hospital two days later when police first questioned her about the murder. After being discharged from hospital, she was charged with the murder of Lee Harvey on 19 December 1996 and released on bail. Andrews appeared at Birmingham Crown Court charged with murder on 1 July 1997, and was found guilty on 29 July 1997. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that she serve at least 14 years. Andrews appealed the sentence, claiming that she was the victim of a miscarriage of justice because of damaging publicity surrounding her case. In October 1998, the appeal was denied. In April 1999, Andrews admitted that she did stab Harvey to death, whilst still maintaining she acted in self-defence. Release Andrews was released in July 2011. She was banned from travelling within 25 miles of her victim's family without supervision. Andrews has a daughter, who was born in the early 1990s. Media based on the case The 1998 Catatonia song \\"Road Rage\\" was partially inspired by the murder. Maureen Harvey, Lee's mother, has written a book called Pure Evil: How Tracie Andrews Murdered My Son, Deceived the Nation and Sentenced Me to a Life of Pain and Misery. CBS Reality aired a documentary on the killing in 2018, titled Evidence of Evil: The Road Rage Killer.

It runs from the town of Sharon to the town of West Hartford. Route description Route 4 begins at the junction of Route 41 and Route 343 in Sharon as a rural, minor arterial road. In Cornwall, it briefly overlaps with US 7 to cross the Housatonic River on the Cornwall Bridge. Farther east in Cornwall, it intersects with Routes 125, 43, and 128 before crossing into Goshen. In Goshen, it meets Route 63 at a roundabout in the center of town. After entering Torrington, the road becomes more of a principal arterial road upon meeting the southern end of Route 272. After skirting the northern edge of downtown, it meets the Route 8 freeway at Exit 44, and briefly overlaps with US 202 just east of the interchange. The road turns southeast and returns to more of a rural character, meeting the southern end of Route 183 before entering Harwinton, where it turns easterly at the junction with the eastern end of Route 118. Shortly thereafter, it meets the western end of Route 72. In Burlington, it meets the northern end of Route 69 near the center of town, and descends into the Farmington River valley before meeting the southern end of Route 179. After turning southeast, it follows the Farmington River and enters the town of Farmington, where it crosses the river just before entering the village of Unionville. From here to its eastern end, it becomes a suburban primary arterial road known as Farmington Avenue. In the center of Unionville, Route 4 intersects Route 177, and it intersects the southern end of Route 167 on the east end of the village. After crossing the Farmington River once again, it intersects Route 10 in the center of town. It then meets SR 508, which provides access to I-84, while Route 4 eastbound traffic continues through one of the state's few jughandles. After passing the University of Connecticut Health Center, it enters West Hartford. State maintenance continues for another to the intersection of Boulevard, where Route 4 ends and Farmington Avenue continues as a local road through West Hartford Center and into Hartford, ending at an intersection with Asylum Avenue just west of Union Station and I-84 Exit 48/48A. A section in Harwinton around the Cooks Dam area, and a section in Sharon, are designated state scenic roads. History Most of modern Route 4 was first improved as portions of various turnpikes in the 19th century. The section of modern Route 4 between Sharon and Cornwall Bridge was the Sharon and Cornwall Turnpike; from Cornwall Hollow to Torrington, it was part of the Goshen and Sharon Turnpike (which used West Cornwall Road and Route 128 between Sharon and Cornwall Hollow); the portion between Harwinton to Burlington was the eastern half of the Litchfield and Harwinton Turnpike (the western half is Route 118); and the portion from Farmington to West Hartford was part of the Farmington and Bristol Turnpike (which used George Washington Turnpike and Red Oak Hill Road between Burlington center and Route 10).F.J. Wood, The Turnpikes of New England, (Marshall Jones, 1919) The road between Cornwall Bridge through Torrington to Collinsville in Canton (part of the Goshen and Sharon Turnpike and the Torrington Turnpike) was designated as State Highway 123 in 1922. The road from Collinsville to Farmington center was designated as State Highway 138 at the same time. Route 4 was created in 1932 from these two state highways, running as a continuation of old New York State Route 361 from Amenia, New York to Farmington at Route 10\\\\. In the Torrington area, Route 4 originally ran further north than it does today, along the current alignment of U.S. Route 202 from Torrington to Collinsville, then southward along modern Route 179 to Unionville, where it continued east on its current alignment. Route 4 was relocated in 1963 to its present-day route through the area, taking over part of Route 72 and part of Route 116 (now Route 118. The west end was truncated in 1966 to end at Route 41 and the section connecting to the state line was renumbered to Route 361 to match the New York route. New York has since turned its Route 361 over to the county. In the Hartford area, Farmington Avenue east of Route 10, from Farmington to downtown Hartford, used to be part of the original U.S. Route 6 alignment. When US 6 was rerouted in 1956, Farmington Avenue was assigned to an extended Route 4\\\\.

John founded the Society of Heraldic Antiquaries (now known as The Heraldry Society) in 1947, and Egan became managing editor of its journal The Coat of Arms.

He proposed that, if someone could \\"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game in 2006\\" that allows players to play the scenario he has written, in which the character kills video game developers, he will donate $10,000 to the charity of former Take-Two Interactive chairman Paul Eibeler's choosing. The title of the letter alludes to Jonathan Swift's 18th-century satire essay A Modest Proposal. Thompson stated that he thought such a game would never be made because developers would be afraid to \\"train\\" people to kill them. He was unaware that Running with Scissors had already released a commercial first-person shooter, Postal 2, in which the player could massacre the employees of Running with Scissors, including its CEO, Vince Desi, and actor Gary Coleman. Before that, some games had the game company buildings as Easter eggs, sometimes destroyable by the player (for example, MechWarrior 2 features the Activision headquarters in some levels), and Doom II even had the player essentially kill id Software co-founder John Romero in the final boss battle of the game. The \\"Modest Proposal\\" Jack Thompson wrote a letter that describes a game whose protagonist is Osaki Kim, the father of a high school boy beaten to death with a baseball bat by a 14-year-old gamer who played a game about beating people to death with a bat. The game intro shows the court session where the killer is sentenced to \\"only\\" life in prison. Osaki Kim then swears vengeance, and gets weapons, \\"even baseball bats. Especially baseball bats.\\" Kim goes to Long Island to kill Paula Eibel, the CEO of Take This, the company that made the \\"murder simulator on which his son's killer trained\\", along with her husband and kids, then urinates on their severed brain stems (as in Postal 2). (Take This is a parody of the name Take- Two Interactive, whose developers created the games Grand Theft Auto, Bully, and Manhunt, all of which are games which Jack Thompson lobbied against.) Kim then kills the lawyers of Blank, Stare, the Philadelphia law firm that defended Take This, \\"with singer Jackson Browne's 1980's hit Lawyers in Love blaring.\\" Kim then destroys high-tech video arcades called GameWerks. Lastly, he goes to E3 on its opening at May 10, 2006, destroying all video game industry execs in \\"one final, monstrously delicious rampage\\". Along the way, Kim steals supplies from Best Buy, Circuit City, Target and Walmart stores, and roughs up store managers and clerks, yelling \\"You should have checked kids' IDs!\\" Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator A group of modders known as the Fighting Hellfish (the name is taken from an episode of The Simpsons) had released exactly one week prior a mod for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, called Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator. The mod features Jack Thompson himself acting out a remarkably similar scenario, at one point even assassinating Doug Lowenstein. Acting under hypnosis, Thompson moonlights as Banman and takes to the streets in his \\"Bannedwagon\\" to destroy the entire shipment of Rockstar's Bully before it reaches distribution. Jack later assassinates Janet Reno after thwarting her coup, which forces him to confront the realization that his time spent researching violent games has turned him into his own \\"Manchurian Candidate\\". Although the team never asked him to donate the money, Thompson refused to when he discovered that the game existed. Initially he claimed that the game did not meet his criteria but later claimed that his proposal was satire and said that he would not donate the $10,000. Thompson argued that the game had to be released in 2006, that Paul Eibeler had yet to pick a charity, and that the game had to be released by a company, not thrown together by \\"anyone in a garage\\". Despite his former claim that his proposal was satire, he claimed the offer was still valid, and that only the description of the scenario was satire, the offer to donate money was real. I'm O.K ‚Äì A Murder Simulator In response to the \\"Modest Proposal\\", a team \\"[c]onsisting of 3 alcoholics and a foreign exchange student\\" formed a company called Thompsonsoft and created I'm O.K ‚Äì A Murder Simulator in January 2006. The game is based on the description of the \\"Modest Proposal\\", and features seven weapons. The story follows a disgruntled father of a killing victim who takes his revenge upon the games industry, which he blames for \\"training\\" the man who killed his son. The father begins a spree of murders in retaliation, attacking the offices of Take This, who made the game, and killing the chairman Paula Eibel and her family. The father then begins a road trip across the states, back to Los Angeles, then assaulting the law firm Blank, Stare who represent Take This and various gaming arcades and games stores before arriving at E3 and completing a \\"monstrously delicious rampage\\" on the participants. Thompson argued that the game industry would never make such a game, in which the targets are virtual representations of themselves, for fear of turning players into their own killers. Jack Thompson later claimed that the game did not come close to his proposal, although other than the fact that former Take-Two Interactive CEO Paul Eibeler has not officially picked a charity, he has not gone into detail as to what parts of his proposal are yet to be satisfied. He also announced that \\"the attorneys for these idiots will be contacted.\\" Penny Arcade On October 17, 2005, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade donated the promised $10,000 to charity on Jack Thompson's behalf. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money, under Thompson's name, to the Entertainment Software Association Foundation, the charitable arm of the Entertainment Software Association. Thompson e-mailed both Penny Arcade and Joystiq, who ran a story about the donation, demanding that the articles be taken down \\"or else.\\" The check was presented to the ESA Foundation at an ESAF fundraising dinner in San Francisco; in its memo line was written: \\"For Jack Thompson Because Jack Thompson Won't\\". In retaliation, Jack Thompson faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske, requesting assistance in halting the activities of Krahulik and Holkins. In his letter, he described how personnel within Penny Arcade were harassing him: the sale of an \\"I Hate Jack Thompson\\" shirt and frequent postings on their website where they allegedly admitted to harassment. According to GameSpot, as of 9:55a.m. PDT October 18, 2005, the Seattle Police Department had not received Thompson's fax, which at that point had been sent to GameSpot, Penny Arcade, and other sites. Thompson emailed GameSpot, claiming that he had fixed the URL for Penny Arcade (which was incorrect in the original fax) and faxed the letter, commenting, \\"They have it now.\\" Thompson also told GameSpot that he was not a \\"pixelated pi√±ata in a game.\\" He ended by saying that the \\"moral midgets\\" at Penny Arcade had chosen \\"the wrong target\\" and \\"I've been at this longer than he has.\\" These vague threats have been deemed \\"nothing to worry about\\" by Penny Arcade. The Seattle Police Department confirmed to GameSpot on October 21 that they had received a complaint from Thompson. On October 21, 2005, Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to John McKay, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the FBI involved. Thompson reiterated his claims of \\"extortion\\" and accuses Penny Arcade of using \\"their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment\\". Penny Arcade denies the charge of \\"extortion\\", noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and are asking nothing in return. Thompson also contacted the office of Washington State Legislature Representative Mary Lou Dickerson, and her office confirms they asked John McKay to look into the matter. Thompson has not clarified how he is being \\"extorted,\\" but accuses Penny Arcades Mike Krahulik of soliciting Florida Bar complaints against him through Mike posting the Florida Bar's link on Penny Arcades website. The link, however, is in a post asking fans to stop sending letters to the Bar because the Bar is fully aware of the current situation. On October 27, 2005, the Seattle PD acknowledged receipt of Thompson's complaint, although after the initial reading of the letter they noted that the complaint appeared to be a civil, rather than criminal matter. They passed the letter on to the chief of their criminal investigations bureau for review. Joystiq On April 4, 2006, Thompson commented on the online gaming blog Joystiq, suggesting a game in which the editors and writers for the blog were murdered. Thompson claimed that being targeted would let the writers know what it felt like to be a police officer or a woman after the release of Grand Theft Auto. Instead, Joystiq actively challenged its readers to develop such a game over the course of several weeks, running a contest with a prize of merchandise as incentive.

Austria was a case in the European Court of Human Rights concerning the age of consent. Austrian law, under Article 209 of the Austrian Criminal Code, provided for higher age of consent for male homosexual relations than for other (heterosexual or female homosexual) relations. The judgment of the court was delivered on 9 January 2003. Background S.L. was born in 1981 and reported himself to have been sure of his homosexuality at the age of 15. He lived in a rural area where homosexuality is still taboo, and suffered from the fact that he could not live his homosexuality openly and ‚Äì until he reached the age of 18 ‚Äì could not enter into any fulfilling sexual relationship with an adult partner without having a fear of exposing that person to criminal prosecution. Article 209 of the Criminal Code (in the version in force at the material time): \\"A male person who after attaining the age of nineteen fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained the age of fourteen years but not the age of eighteen years shall be sentenced to imprisonment for between six months and five years.\\" Judgement On 10 July 2002 ‚Äì following the judgment of the Constitutional Court ‚Äì the Parliament decided to repeal Article 209 and introduced a new Article 207b, which penalizes sexual acts with a person under sixteen years of age if that person is for certain reasons not mature enough to understand the meaning of the act and the offender takes advantage of this immaturity or if the person under sixteen years of age is in a predicament and the offender takes advantage of that situation. This article applies to every sexual acts irrespective whether the sexual acts at issue are heterosexual, homosexual, or lesbian. The Court ruled unanimously that the inequality of age of consent constituted a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and also unanimously ruled that there was no need to examine the complaints lodged under Article 8 alone. It was not disputed before the Court that the case falls within the ambit of Article 8. The development following the judgment of the Constitutional Court did not affect the applicant‚Äôs status as a victim. As regards the violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, the Court found no decisive difference between the present case and Sutherland v. United Kingdom. The Court examined whether there was an objective and reasonable justification why young men in the fourteen-to-eighteen-age bracket needed protection against any sexual relationship with adult men, while young women in the same age bracket did not need such protection against relations with either adult men or women. It came to the conclusion that to the extent that Article 209 of the Criminal Code embodied predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against the homosexual minority, these negative attitudes could not themselves provide sufficient justification for the differential treatment anymore.

He also distinguished himself as a Methodist Pastor and Presiding Elder, and as an editor and publisher of the M.E. Church. Birth and family Earl was born in Athens, Ohio, the third Bishop of the Methodist Church to have been born in Athens. Earl was said to have a vigorous body squarely built and above the average height for that day (mid-19th century). Among his ancestors were Roger Williams and John and Samuel Cranston, both colonial governors of Rhode Island. Earl was the son of Earl and Jane E. (n√©e Montgomery) Cranston. Earl Jr married Martha A. Behan in 1861. She died April 7, 1872. He then married Laura A. Martin, who died February 3, 1903. He then married Lucie M. Parker. Earl was the father of Earl M., Grace, James B., Dora, Ethel, Laura Alden, and Ruth (who became a well known writer and lecturer). Education and Christian conversion Earl graduated High School in Jackson, Ohio. He earned the A.B. degree (with honor) in 1861 and the A.M. degree in 1865, both from Ohio University. The Rev. Solomon Howard, D.D., LL.D., was the President of O.U. at the time. Earl was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. The Rev. William Taylor, (later Missionary Bishop of Africa) visited Athens during Earl's college years. Taylor held revival services, in which many students, including Earl, were converted to Christ. Military service and business career Earl entered the Union Army during the American Civil War as a Private. He progressed through the ranks, first as a First Sergeant, then as a commissioned officer, as a First Lieutenant, Adjutant and finally as a Captain. He left the U.S. Army in 1864. Following his military service, Earl studied for business, and was engaged in commercial affairs until 1867, when he entered the ministry.

From 1918, it was the base of the Air Ministry, and later from 1955, was the headquarters of Associated-Rediffusion/Rediffusion London, Independent Television News (ITN), TV Times magazine, the Independent Television Companies Association and, at first, Associated TeleVision. Later, It was the initial base for its successor, Thames Television. After Thames moved out, it was the headquarters of the General Register Office and subsequently of ExxonMobil. It is now known as 61 Aldwych. History=Adastral House The Kingsway area had been redeveloped at the start of the 20th century from slums and tenement housing into a broad avenue with grand office buildings and expensive town houses. After the formation of the Air Ministry in 1918, its headquarters was on Kingsway; one of two identical buildings opposite Bush House became Adastral House, the name being derived from the RAF motto. This remained the home of the Air Ministry through World War II, and the roof of the building in 1940 during The Blitz is where, while fire-watching, Arthur Harris, made the remark about the bombing to a companion, \\"Well, they are sowing the wind...\\". The building became known to the public after the war as it was announced during BBC weather forecasts that the Met Office had measured the temperatures and wind speeds in central London from its roof. Television House In 1954, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) awarded the first two contracts for the imminent ITV commercial television network. Because the BBC had previously held a monopoly on broadcasting, there were no non-BBC television studio facilities in the UK. Associated-Rediffusion, as one of the two contractors, needed to build from scratch a whole new facility. The company had hired Thomas Brownrigg as General Manager, partially due to his extensive knowledge of planning and project management, which would be needed in simultaneously building a new company and its studios and headquarters. British Electric Traction, majority owner of Associated-Rediffusion, bought the freehold on Adastral House from the government. Brownrigg engaged Bovis Limited (later Bovis Construction) to gut the building internally and build a new suite of offices, technical facilities and studios to be called Television House. This was begun in early 1955 and, with a planned start date for ITV of 22 September 1955, was worked on at great speed, virtually 24 hours a day. Four small studios (numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10) were built inside the building, mainly for current affairs and continuity use (the main large studios, later the Fountain Studios, were based at the former 20th Century Fox studios in Wembley in Middlesex). Additionally, office space and dining facilities for over 1,000 people was created. A suite of management offices, complete with oak-panelled boardroom, was built. The original headquarters and studio facilities of ITN were located on the seventh and eighth floors of the building. TV Times, part-owned by Associated-Rediffusion, occupied offices in the building from 1957 until April 1958. A computer room, housing an early mainframe computer that controlled advertising bookings, was added on the second floor in 1966. Associated TeleVision (ATV) inhabited Television House for the first few years of broadcasting, mainly as office accommodation rather than studio facilities. For a period early in ITV's history, Associated- Rediffusion provided this space for free as part of the effort to keep ITV afloat during the financial crisis of 1955-1957. St Catherine's House In the 1967 ITV contract round the ITA awarded the London weekday contract to a joint company formed from ABC Weekend TV and Rediffusion Television, Thames Television. This new company had a surplus number of studios in London. The Wembley studios were therefore sold to the then-new London Weekend Television. Thames, controlled by the former ABC, decided that a brand new studio complex, equipped from the start for colour broadcasting and located out of the centre of London would be more appropriate. Thames used Television House as its headquarters whilst the building of the new Thames Television House in Euston took place. When Television House was vacated in the early 1970s, it was again occupied by the government, this time by the General Register Office, where it housed the birth, marriage and death certificates of the English and Welsh populations. The building was renamed St Catherine's House. In the 1990s, the building was vacated by the General Register Office, which by then had become the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, which moved to Southport in Merseyside, and, after extensive refurbishment, it became the UK headquarters of ExxonMobil. Centrium After ExxonMobil left, the building was renamed \\"The Centrium\\" and housed several corporations, including Herman Miller, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, SVG Capital, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Ashmore Group, Tishman Speyer and Interconnector UK 61 Aldwych Later, the building was renamed \\"61 Aldwych\\" by the manager Tishman Speyer.61 Aldwych Tenants still include the Nursing and Midwifery CouncilNMC website and Herman Miller Herman Miller Production space * Studio 7: . 33' by 24' = 10 m x 7.3 m * Studio 8: . 38' by 25' = 11.6 m x 7.6 m * Studio 9: . 64' by 40' = 19.5 m x 12.2 m * Studio 10: . 26' by 12' = 8 m x 3.7 m * Master Control: . * Maintenance Workshop: . * VTR (with 2x Ampex video recorders): . * Telecine (with 2x Cintel, 1x RCA Vidicon and 2x EMI Flying Spot telecine machines): . * Rehearsal rooms x6: . * Projector theatres x 6 * Cutting rooms x15 * Dubbing theatre References * Croston, Eric ITV 1963 London: Independent Television Authority 1963 * Various authors A Guide to Rediffusion Television Studios London: Rediffusion Television Ltd April 1967 * Elliott, Ronald (Ed.)

Located in the historic resort community of Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard, the carousel was apparently first located in New York City before being moved to the island in the 1880s. The carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The carousel is one of only a handful of carousels that still have brass rings for a rider to attempt to grab as the carousel rotates. History Oak Bluffs, located on the northeastern part of the island of Martha's Vineyard, was originally settled as part of Edgartown in the 17th century. In 1835 the Methodist camp known as Wesleyan Grove (also a National Historic Landmark) was established in the area. Development of the area as a summer resort became more formally organized with the establishment of the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company in 1866. The company developed what was then one of the earliest planned communities, guiding the community's growth over the following years. The exact date of construction of the carousel is not known. Its artwork closely resembles that found in an 1870s catalog published by the Charles W.F. Dare Company, a major manufacturer of carousels in the late 19th century. At least one expert believes that artwork of the carousel itself was done by the same artist whose work appears in the catalog, suggesting its construction date to be between 1876 and 1878. In 1884, F.O. Gordon of New York City acquired the carousel and moved it to Cottage City, as Oak Bluffs was then known. Evidence of its use in New York is surmised from a stamp \\"Coney Island #4\\" on the inside of one of its decorative panels. It was originally sited near the entrance to Oak Bluffs Harbor. In 1889, the town of Oak Bluffs acquired the carousel and moved it to its present location at the base of Circuit Avenue, the town's business and entertainment district. The town sold the carousel to Joseph Turnell in 1896, and it then went through a succession of owners before its acquisition by the Martha's Vineyard Land Trust in 1986. This 1880s scene of Oak Bluffs shows the carousel in its first location. The carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. It is one of the two oldest operating carousels in the United States; the other, the Flying Horse Carousel in Watch Hill, Rhode Island (also a National Historic Landmark), is of a similar vintage, and is also a Dare Company carousel. Description The carousel is sited on a roughly triangular piece of land at the base of Circuit Avenue in Oak Bluffs that is bounded by Circuit Avenue, Oak Bluffs Avenue, Lake Avenue and Kennebec Avenue. Its address is 33 Oak Bluffs Avenue. Since being moved to the island, it has been housed in a somewhat utilitarian single-story building. It is sheathed in wood shingles, and has a low gable roof. A rider of the carousel reaches for the brass ring. The carousel is about in diameter. Fourteen spreader panels radiate from the central platform, and are secured to the upper canopy by the columns that also support the horses and carriages of the carousel. Despite the name \\"Flying Horses\\" (given by Joseph Turnell), the horses are stationary when the carousel is rotating. The horses have their original oxide eyes, but their original horsehair manes have been lost. The layout of the horses and carriages is as follows: a chariot, two pair of horses, a chariot, three pairs of horses, and then the entire sequence repeated. The panels that decorate the carousel, including those surrounding the central column housing the carousel machinery, depict equestrian and marine scenes. By the 1980s, these panels, needing restoration, had been removed and replaced by panels of local scenes done by a local artist. When the site was purchased by the Martha's Vineyard Land Trust, the Flying Horses underwent an extensive restoration, returning the carousel to its original appearance, complete with the historic panel paintings that were done by a Dare Company artist. Although originally powered by steam, the carousel was converted to electricity in 1900, and is powered by a 10-horsepower motor located in the building's basement. The gears and belts connecting the motor to the carousel were rehabilitated in the 1980s. The ride has a traditional ring assembly, where the lucky rider who successfully grabs a brass ring gets a free ride. The carousel‚Äôs music is provided by a 1923 Wurlitzer #103 Band Organ.

It was formerly incorporated as a village prior to 1979 when it amalgamated with four other municipalities to form Crowsnest Pass. Unlike some of the other communities in Crowsnest Pass, which relied on a single coal mine, Bellevue benefitted from the proximity of several successful mines and, despite setbacks from fire, strikes, mine accidents and fluctuations in the coal market, persisted as a successful community to the present day.  History  Bellevue was founded in 1905 on the flat land above the Bellevue Mine operated by the French-based West Canadian Collieries (WCC). Its post office opened in 1907. The naming of the town is credited to Elsie Fleutot, the young daughter of one of WCC's French Canadian principals, Jules J. Fleutot, after she exclaimed \\"Quelle belle vue!\\" (What a beautiful view!). In 1909 the Maple Leaf Coal Company commenced operations at the Mohawk Bituminous Mine and constructed the settlement of Maple Leaf adjacent to Bellevue. In 1913 WCC transferred many workers to Bellevue from its closed Lille operations. WCC displayed a five-ton coal boulder at the 1910 Dominion Exhibition in Calgary. This period of growth was not without setbacks. An explosion in the Bellevue Mine during a partial afternoon shift on December 9, 1910 killed 30 miners. In 1917 a fire destroyed most of Bellevue's business section, followed by smaller fires in 1921 and 1922. A shanty-town called Bush town, or Il Bosc, below Bellevue was flooded in 1923 but persisted for several years. West Canadian Collieries opened the Adanac Mine at Byron Creek in 1945, but by 1957 all of the Bellevue area mines were closed. The tipple at Bellevue continued to process coal from WCC's Grassy Mountain open-pit, but was removed in 1962 after that operation closed. These closures caused a critical reduction in Bellevue's tax base. Bellevue finally incorporated into a village in 1957. The realignment of Highway 3 in the 1970s led to a decline of Bellevue's business section, although the residential areas continued to thrive. Following amalgamation of five local school districts in 1966, Bellevue joined four other local communities in amalgamation into the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass in 1979 which restored a measure of financial stability, and Bellevue continues to thrive today.  Bellevue Caf√© shootout  On August 2, 1920, local miners George Arkoff, Ausby Auloff and Tom Bassoff robbed the Canadian Pacific Railway's train No. 63 at gunpoint, hoping to find wealthy rum-runner Emilio \\"Emperor Pic\\" Picariello aboard. Eluding the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Alberta Provincial Police and the CPR Police, Auloff escaped into the United States while Bassoff and Arkoff remained in the area. On August 7 the two were spotted in the Bellevue Caf√©. Three constables entered the caf√© through the front and back doors, and in the ensuing shootout Arkoff, RCMP Corporal Ernest Usher and APP Constable F.W.E. Bailey were killed while Bassoff, though wounded, escaped into the rubble of the Frank Slide. During the pursuit, Special Constable Nicolas Kyslik was accidentally shot and killed by another officer. Bassoff was eventually apprehended without incident on August 11 at Pincher Station, 35 kilometres to the east. Although testimony suggests that the police officers had failed to identify themselves and had probably fired first, Bassoff was found guilty of murder and hanged in Lethbridge, Alberta on December 22, 1920. Ausby Auloff was captured in 1924 near Butte, Montana after trying to sell a distinctive railway watch. Auloff, who had not been involved in the shootout, was returned to Alberta where he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and died in 1926.

It was once a hamlet under the jurisdiction of Improvement District (I.D.) No. 5 prior to 1979 when the former I.D. No. 5 amalgamated with four other municipalities to form Crowsnest Pass.  History  Hillcrest was named after Charles Plummer Hill, an early coal prospector and entrepreneur who also founded Porthill, Idaho. Hill grew up and was educated in Seaford, Delaware before moving to the Northwest. The Hillcrest Coal and Coke Company, incorporated on January 31, 1905, began constructing the town the same year, and the Canadian Pacific Railway soon built a spur for transporting coal from the Hillcrest Mine, and a station. Hillcrest soon grew to a population of about 1,000. The post office opened in 1907 with Charles P. Hill as the postmaster. Although the mine was successful, and considered one of the safest in the region, an underground explosion in 1914 (Canada's worst mine disaster) killed 189 men ‚Äî almost twenty percent of the town's population, and half the mine's workforce. A further explosion in 1926 killed two men. After the mine closed in 1939, Hillcrest experienced a period of economic decline. In 1979, the former I.D. No. 5, which included the former hamlet of Hillcrest, amalgamated with Bellevue, Blairmore, Coleman and Frank to form the municipality of Crowsnest Pass.

The magazine is published by the Japanese media giant , the parent company of Sunpros, a company owned by Inada, who is behind both the D1 Grand Prix series and Tokyo Auto Salon. Description During the earlier days, the magazines used to cover illegal street races held in expressways before it became illegal to do so. Also, it covers the exploits of Inada attempts at driving speed records, whether it was at Bonneville, at the German Autobahn or at the Silver State Classic, even by members of the magazine editorial team. Nowadays the series features Wangan competitions on closed roads and where it is legalised to do so. Beside speed tests and modified car features, other regular features includes, a rate-my-car feature where readers send a photo of their car to be judged by Manabu Suzuki, with a comedic result; a monthly features, where Keiichi Tsuchiya solves readers' problems that concern with drifting, a monthly column called Sugoiyo Osaru-san („Åô„Åî„ÅÑ„ÇàÔºÅ „Ç™„Çµ„É´„Åï„Çì) by Ken Nomura. Also it has a D1GP mini-magazine. Other contributors includes Eiji Yamada and Manabu Orido. The magazine also covered the buildup to his Silver State exploits that he has become known for. Other magazines in the Option line are Option 2, a similar magazine but less emphasises on feature cars but more on technical bits and DIY modifications; Option Wagon for modified MPV, Drift Tengoku, a magazine and video series dedicated to drifting and Video Option. The Option magazine is known to be very popular amongst JDM enthusiasts and people who work in the Import industry who use it to gain knowledge on new parts. Option also sponsors the HKS Premium Day's Option Fuji Super Lap, a major time attack competition for tuned cars held at Fuji Speedway. Project cars * StreamZ (ver.1) („Çπ„Éà„É™„Éº„É†Z in Katakana ) ‚Äî After one failed attempt to compete in the Silver State Classic held at Ely, Nevada in 1999 driving a Blitz modified R34 Skyline GT-R, Inada decided to return in 2003 for an attempt at the overall record which had been recorded into the Guinness Book of Records by a stock car based Chrysler LeBaron. The Stream Z was a Nissan Fairlady Z33 built to compete in the Unlimited category unlike the R34 which had been competing in the average category and is modified by tuner, JUN Auto. Its VQ35DE engine was enlarged to 3.8 liters and equipped with a Garrett T88-34D turbocharger giving out a total horsepower of 800. During the race, the rear left tire delaminated but did not lose air at 240 km/h; however, when attempting to slow down by dropping into 3rd gear at 240 km/h, the car left the road and rolled over seven times. Inada managed to survive without serious injuries but was to be taken to the nearby hospital. The accident had never been officially investigated, but the in-car camera video was reviewed and it is speculated that a last-minute incorrect rear-end alignment caused the tire to overheat and delaminate, and driver error caused the crash. The wrecked car was shipped back to Japan and, in January the following year at the Tokyo Auto Salon, was displayed at the magazine‚Äôs stand and became one of the show‚Äôs attractions that year, attracting more people than many of the show cars displayed. Option Stream Z, Silver State Classic 2006 * Stream Z (ver.2) ‚Äî After the show ended, the magazine and Dai decided on another attempt at the race, this time they took on another Z33 as a donor car but now with a wide arch kit to allow for wider tires. Whatever was intact in the old car had now been transferred into the newer car including the 3.8 litre engine. Now with the T88-38GK turbocharger giving out 100 extra horsepower to the previous car and for extra safety measures came equipped with a drag chute in the event of a tire failure. The Option crew also hired a helicopter to watch over the car in any event of incident but managed to finish third place overall without incident. : For the following year, the car was modified at the rear suspension allowing the rear camber to be altered. Unfortunately in 2005, on the day before the race, during a speed run, Inada drove the car off course after not noticing the finishing line (which was a set of cones), misreading co driver Susumu Koyama's (owner of tuner, JUN Auto) signal to slow down, and failing to slow down before a corner 2 km after the finishing line, causing mechanical damages to the car and putting the co-driver in hospital for whiplash injuries. As a result they were forced to miss out on the main race, but he was the winner of the shootout race that caused such misfortune for him. : During and his attempt at the Nevada Open Road Challenge on May 2006 which he retired with a broken crank pulley after 57 km, Inada announced his retirement and the following event would become his last race. During that September, during a run a day prior to the main race, he blew his engine. Both the magazine's project cars have made appearances in video games, its earlier project car, Option Speed Wagon have appeared in the 1998 Konami arcade game Racing Jam as a hidden car and the infamous Option Stream Z have appeared in both installments of the D1 Grand Prix game by Yuke's and the ver.2 in Gran Turismo 4 all as bonus cars.

It was formerly incorporated as a town prior to 1979 when it amalgamated with four other municipalities to form Crowsnest Pass. Blairmore is the principal commercial centre of Crowsnest Pass.  History  Old mine in Blairmore Originally a Canadian Pacific Railway stop called Tenth Siding or The Springs (for the cold sulphur spring to the east), the settlement was renamed Blairmore in November 1898 and it got a post office the following year. A ten-year dispute over land ownership between the CPR station agent and the section foreman stunted early development.Crowsnest and its People Crowsnest Pass Historical Society, 1979 Blairmore's principal industry was lumber and, after 1907, coal. Other industries followed and on September 29, 1911 Blairmore was incorporated as a town. With the declining fortunes of the nearby community of Frank, Blairmore soon became the region's economic centre. The Greenhill mine, located just north of Blairmore, became the mainstay of the community until its closure in 1957. One of the town's early characters was Emilio Picariello (1875 ‚Äì 1923). \\"Emperor Pic\\" settled in Blairmore in 1918 and operated several businesses, but also illegally imported alcohol from nearby British Columbia during prohibition. Picariello and Florence Lassandro were hanged in 1923 after the shooting death of Alberta Provincial Police constable Steve Lawson in 1922. Like many Canadian industrial towns in the 1930s, Blairmore had some sympathies with Communism. Canada's first Communist town council and school board were elected in Blairmore in 1933, which reformed the tax system, and refused to observe Remembrance Day as an Imperialist holiday and honoured the Russian Revolution instead. A street was named after the leader of the Communist Party of Canada, Tim Buck, a decision that was reversed by the next town council.Crownest Pass Promoter - street name controversy Blairmore amalgamated with four other municipalities to form the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass in 1979. Canadian Militia From 1946 to 1965, Blairmore was home to Canadian Militia units associated with the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers. From 1946 to 1950, No. 22 Armoured Workshop existed prior to being renamed as a Troop of 39 Technical Squadron (1950-1954) and eventually the 31st Technical Squadron (1954-1965). During this time, the Squadron had a band which regularly paraded within the town as well as a 535 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps which existed until 1971.  Geography  Far view of Blairmore. Note the Canadian Rockies in the background. Blairmore is located in southwest Alberta in the Canadian Rockies. It is approximately west of Lethbridge on Highway 3 (Crowsnest Highway) and approximately east of the British Columbia border. Fellow Crowsnest Pass communities Frank and Coleman are to the east and to the west respectively. Geology Volcanic rocks in the Blairmore area are related to the Crowsnest Formation. As a geological unit, the volcanics received some attention in the late 1980s when geologists stated they had found trace amounts of gold in certain units of the volcanics.Mineral Assessment Report 20060025 - A report for Assessment in reference to Metallic and Industrial Minerals Permit 9304091032 Blairmorite, a rare volcanic rock of the Crowsnest Formation, is named after Blairmore.

University of Kentucky. 19 November 2006. The original 1963 wing contains graduate and faculty offices for the accounting and economic departments and includes the MBA center. It also features one large auditorium. The 1992 extension added a new three-floor atrium, a new computer laboratory, and 24 classrooms. The facility has been well maintained, but, as with most facilities of its age, some of the basic mechanical and electrical components had reached the end of their useful lives by the 2010s. None of the then-current classrooms supported modern technology and the current structure of the facility allowed only limited renovations or expansions of smaller classrooms. Further, the existing building's limited floor-to-floor heights did not allow classrooms to be outfitted with modern learning technology. UK long had this facility as a top request. Prior plans had suggested a completely new facility with estimated project costs of approximately $100 million. The university recognized that the prior plan could not be achieved given 21st-century public financing realities, and turned to private philanthropy for the project. To that end, the university took a fresh look at the existing facility and reviewed the feasibility and cost of a dramatic renovation and expansion to house modern classrooms, an auditorium, and student assembly spaces. The ultimate concept was then estimated to cost $65 million.#BBNunited \\"Gatton College of Business and Economics: Building Executive Summary\\" On March 1, 2013, the University of Kentucky's Gatton College of Business and Economics celebrated the milestone of surpassing the halfway point in its fundraising efforts for the expansion and renovation of its facilities. Joined by UK President Eli Capilouto, Gatton College Dean David W. Blackwell announced that nearly $34 million in private funds has been donated or pledged toward the $65 million project. The project was part of UK's overall capital improvement plan (House Bill 7) approved by the Kentucky General Assembly and signed into law by Gov. Steve Beshear on February 21, 2013. No state tax dollars were used in any of the UK construction projects, which included the Gatton College, a new science building on campus, and improvements to Commonwealth Stadium (since renamed Kroger Field) and UK's football facilities. Construction of the Gatton expansion and renovation project began in late 2013. The original timetable called for completion of the project by the fall of 2015 or early in 2016,\\"Gatton College Reaches Fundraising Milestone\\" but the facility did not open until August 2016, with an official reopening ceremony that October.

The orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt The cultural and art historian Jacob Burckhardt Burckhardt, or (de) Bourcard in French, is a family of the Basel patriciate, descended from Christoph (Stoffel) Burckhardt (1490‚Äì1578), a merchant in cloth and silk originally from M√ºnstertal, Black Forest, who received Basel citizenship in 1523, and became a member of the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt in 1553. The family was represented in the Grand Council continuously from 1553 until the 20th century. In the 17th century and early 18th century, the family was the most powerful family of the canton of Basel.Burckhardt, Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz Branches of the family were based in Nantes and in the Kingdom of Naples from the 18th century, where it was ennobled as de Bourcard. The family's famous members include the traveller and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, the influential art historian Jacob Burckhardt and the international President of the Red Cross, Carl Jacob Burckhardt. The surname is derived from the dithematic Germanic given name Burkhard, from burg \\"protection\\" and hard \\"brave, hardy\\". The Burckhardt coat-of-arms has a shield of yellow background with a black S intertwined with a cross (the ‚ÄúS‚Äù is perhaps for Seidenkr√§mer - silk-merchant), which is surmounted by a crowned helmet with a fluttering black and yellow flag. The original crest was simpler and consisted only of a shield with the S intertwined with the cross. It was modified between 1558 and 1578.Basler Wappenkalender of 1917 (Basel Crests Calendar) Christoph Burckhardt married Ottilie Mechler in 1518 and in 1539 Gertrud Brand, daughter of Basel mayor Theodor Brand. There are six lines of the Burckhardt family, from the six sons born of Christoph's second marriage: #Bernhard: line extinct in the 17th century #Hieronymus: #Theodor: #Johann Rudolf #Samuel: #Daniel Of the six sons, five became merchants in cloth and silk, while Hieronymus entered the Teutonic Order In the 17th and 18th century, the Burckhardts intermarried with the other leading families of the Basel patriciate (Iselin, Merian, Sarasin, Staehelin, Vischer, Von der M√ºhll, Wettstein). Bernhard was elected to the great chamber of the city council in 1603, where the family remained present until 1878. The family reaches the peak of its political influence in the 18th century, but continues to be influential in the 19th century with several Burckhardt mayors and professors at the University of Basel. Prior to 1798, seven members of the family were burgomasters of Basel, and also in the 19th century, four Burckhardt family members were burgomasters.

Biographical notes  Born in Buenos Aires into a family of French and Spanish descent, Marechal became a primary school teacher and a high school professor after obtaining his degree despite enormous economic difficulties. During the 1920s he was among the poets who rallied around the movement represented by the literary journal Mart√≠n Fierro. While his first published works of poetry, Los aguiluchos (1922) and D√≠as como flechas (1926), tended towards vanguardism, his Odas para el hombre y la mujer showed a blend of novelty and a more classical style. It is with this collection of poems that Marechal obtained his first official recognition as a poet in 1929, the Premio Municipal de Poes√≠a of the city of Buenos Aires. He traveled to Europe for the first time in 1926 and in Paris met important intellectuals and artists such as Picasso, Basald√∫a and Antonio Berni. On his second visit to Paris in 1929, he settled in Montparnasse and widened his circle of friends, which now included artists Aquiles Badi, Alfredo Bigatti, Horacio Butler, Juan del Prete, Raquel Forner, Victor Pissarro and the sculptor Jos√© Fioravanti, who later sculpted the poet's bust in bronze. It is during this second Parisian experience that Marechal wrote the first two chapters of his novel Adam Buenosayres, which he did not publish until 1948. Some of its protagonists are based on his friends of the Martin Fierro group, including artist Xul Solar (as the astrologer Schultze), poet Jacobo Fijman (as the philosopher Samuel Tesler), Jorge Luis Borges (as Luis Pereda) and Ra√∫l Scalabrini Ortiz (as \\"el petiso\\" Bernini). Back in Buenos Aires, Marechal married Mar√≠a Zoraida Barreiro in 1934. Their two daughters, Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles and Mar√≠a Magdalena, were born some years after. Marechal again obtained the First Prize of the prestigious Premio Municipal de Poes√≠a in 1940 for his poetry book entitled Sonetos a Sophia. The poet's wife died in 1947, leaving him with two small children. The publication of the writer's Adam Buenosayres, considered by many as the fundamental novel of Argentine literature, did not have the expected repercussion, possibly due to the poet's open sympathies for the government of Juan Domingo Per√≥n, the controversial populist leader greatly influenced by his radical wife Evita. Among the novel's most ardent admirers was Julio Cort√°zar, who wrote a long critical study in the literary magazine Realidad in 1949.http://lamaquinadeltiempo.com/cortazar/marechal.htm Despite his and other writers' support, Marechal's novel and the rest of his monumental work remained widely ignored by many colleagues of the literary world, including Jorge Luis Borges, whose mother and sister had been imprisoned during Peron¬¥s presidency. Although the seminal influence of his first and subsequent novels has tended to classify him mainly as a novelist, Marechal is first and foremost a poet of primary importance. In fact, even his first novel, which is mainly autobiographical, is in his own words an extension of poetry: \\"When I wrote Ad√°n Buenosayres I never intended it to be other than poetry. Ever since my early youth, and taking Aristotle's Poetics as my starting point, I have always believed that all literary genres are and should be types of poetry, whether epic, dramatic or lyrical.\\" Marechal was not a widely recognized figure in Argentine literature until the 1965 reprint of Adam Buenosayres, which ignited a resurgence of interest in his work. His seminal novel has been translated into French by Patrice Toulat (Paris Grasset, Unesco 1995), into Italian by Nicola Jacchia (Vallecchi, Firenze 2010), and into English by Norman Cheadle and Sheila Ethier (McGill-Queen's University Press 2014). The poet was officially invited to Cuba in 1967, where he formed part of the international jury for the annual Casa de las Am√©ricas prize for literature. Marechal has since become a fundamental influence in Argentine poetry and fiction, although he continues to be a relatively unknown figure on the international scene.

Biography Shaikh Sal√≠m Chisht√≠ with Mughal Emperor Akbar The Mughal Emperor Akbar came to Chishti's home in Sikri to ask him to pray for a male heir to the throne. Chishti blessed Akbar, and soon the first of three sons was born to him. He named his first son Salim (later emperor Jahangir) in honor of Chishti. A daughter of Sheikh Salim Chishti was the foster mother of Emperor Jahangir. The emperor was deeply attached to his foster mother, as reflected in the Jahangirnama and he was extremely close to her son Qutb-ud- din Khan Koka who was made the governor of Bengal. His eldest son, Saaduddin Khan was ennobled Saaduddin Siddiky and was granted three jagirs in Gazipur District of Amenabad, Talebabad and Chandrapratap. Now his Great grandson Kursheed Aleem Chishti lives there he is the 16th generation of Salim chishti These descendants in Bangladesh include Chowdhury Kazemuddin Ahmed Siddiky, the co-founder of the Assam Bengal Muslim League and co-founder of the University of Dhaka, Justice Badruddin Ahmed Siddiky, Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky, the Commerce Minister of Bangladesh and Chowdhury Irad Ahmed Siddiky, a noted anti-corruption activist and candidate for the Mayor of Dhaka in 2015. The descendants of his second-eldest son, Shaikh Ibrahim who was granted the title 'Kishwar Khan' reside in Sheikhupur, Badaun in India.Qutubuddin Koka Akbar held the Sufi in such high regard that he had a great city Fatehpur Sikri built around his camp. His Mughal court and courtiers were then relocated there. A shortage of water is said to be the main reason that the city was abandoned and it now sits in remarkably good condition as a mostly deserted city. Now it is one of the main tourist attractions of India. Salim Chishti tomb Salim Chishti Tomb taken by Samuel Bourne in 1865 Another view of Salim Chishti Shrine Fatehpur Sikri: Salim Chishti's Tomb Chishti's tomb was originally built with red sandstone but later converted into a beautiful marble mausoleum. Salim Chishti's Mazar (tomb) is in the middle of the Emperor's Courtyard at Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, India. The mausoleum was constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire, as Jahangir. It is believed that by offering prayers at this mazar whatever one wishes will be fulfilled. There is also a ritual of tying a thread at the marble windows of this Dargah in order to have one's wishes fulfilled. The ancestral house of Shaikh Salim Chishti has a large Sun motif at its main door and inside has a beautiful array of impressive stone screen and exquisitely carved herring bone roof it is attached to the first building built in Fatehpur Sikri, which is known as \\"Sangtarash mosque\\" or Stone Cutter's mosque. One of the oldest buildings in Fatehpur Sikri, Stone Cutter's mosque is situated to the west of the Jami Masjid, which was built by the local stone cutters in honor of Chishti. It has some beautiful architectural features, marking the incorporation of indigenous architectural styles in the construction. Salim Chishti's mazar is one of the most notable accomplishments of Mughal architecture, surpassed only in reputation, and is flanked by the massive Buland Darwaza or Victory Gate on the southern side, the Badshahi darwaza or Emperor's gate on eastern side, and a grand mosque Jama masjid on western side, as well as by courtyards, a reflecting pool, and other tombs. Construction commenced in 1571 and the work was completed fifteen years later.

By 1940, US 213 was moved to a new alignment that crossed the Choptank River at Cambridge on a bridge built in 1935 and MD 331 was designated to run from Vienna to Easton. Both ends of MD 331 have been shortened since, with the southernmost portion of MD 331 curtailed following the completion of the US 50 bypass of Vienna by the 1990s and the northern terminus of the route cut back to US 50 in 2004 when the state-maintained portion of Dover Road to Dover Street in Easton was turned over to the city. Route description MD 331 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial within the town of Easton. Dorchester County Shields for MD 16 and MD 331 in PrestonMD 331 begins at an interchange with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) in Vienna, Dorchester County, a short distance west of the Nanticoke River. MD 331 signage continues south of US 50 on county-maintained Rhodesdale Vienna Road to an intersection with Old Ocean Gateway in Vienna. From this interchange, the route heads north on Rhodesdale Vienna Road, a two-lane undivided road. It passes through wooded areas, with a set of power lines and an abandoned railroad right-of-way owned by Delmarva Power and Light Company located along the east side of the road. MD 331 continues into farmland, with some rural residences alongside the road, before it approaches Reids Grove, where MD 819 (Reids Grove Road) loops to the west of MD 331. Past Reids Grove, the route continues through a mix of woodland and farmland, still paralleling the power lines and the abandoned railroad. View north along MD 331 at MD 16 near Petersburg MD 331 reaches Rhodesdale, where it intersects MD 14 (Rhodesdale Eldorado Road). At this intersection, the route makes a left turn to run concurrent with MD 14 along East New Market Rhodesdale Road, heading west through Rhodesdale. The road leaves Rhodesdale and heads into farmland. MD 331 splits from MD 14 in Shiloh Church by turning north on Shiloh Church Hurlock Road at an intersection. Along Shiloh Church Hurlock Road, MD 331 passes a few residences before heading through more farm fields. MD 331 enters Hurlock and heads into residential areas, with the name changing to Main Street at the Jackson Street intersection. It passes more residences before intersecting MD 392 (Delaware Avenue). Past MD 392, the road passes more homes before it heads into the downtown area of Hurlock, where it crosses the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Seaford Line and MD 307 (Broad Street). Past this intersection, MD 331 heads northwest on Academy Street past numerous homes before the road leaves Hurlock. Upon leaving Hurlock, the road becomes Waddells Corner Road and it heads into farmland. The road turns to the west and continues through agricultural areas with intermittent residences. It comes to an intersection with MD 16 (East New Market Ellwood Road), where MD 331 makes a right turn to head north along with MD 16. MD 16 and MD 331 head north through a mix of woods and farms with some residences. The road continues through rural areas with an increasing number of residences as it approaches the Preston area. The road intersects the western terminus of MD 318 (Preston Road) near businesses. Past this intersection, MD 16 and MD 331 continue northwest on Preston Road. Caroline and Talbot counties The northern terminus of MD 331 in Easton as viewed from eastbound US 50The road crosses the Hunting Creek into Caroline County. In Linchester, MD 817 loops off to the west of MD 16 and MD 331 on Linchester Road. Past MD 817, the road enters Preston, where it becomes Main Street, passing by residences and some businesses. The route intersects MD 324 (Maple Avenue) before reaching the center of town, where MD 16 splits from MD 331 by heading northeast on Harmony Road. Past this intersection, the route passes more residences before leaving Preston, where it becomes Dover Bridge Road. It heads north into rural areas of woods and farms with some residences along the road. The road turns to the northwest and intersects Tanyard Road. MD 331 turns west and continues to the residential community of Bethlehem, where it intersects MD 578 (Bethlehem Road). Past Bethlehem, the road continues past many rural residences. MD 331 enters wetlands as it approaches the Choptank River, which it crosses into Talbot County on the Dover Bridge, a high-level bridge. Upon entering Talbot County, the route becomes Dover Road and continues to the northwest through a mix of woodland and farmland. It turns to the west with the number of residences increasing as it approaches Easton. Upon reaching Easton, MD 331 heads into commercial and industrial areas. The route ends at the intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway), where Dover Road continues west as a local road toward downtown Easton. History MD 331 from Rhodesdale to Easton was one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909. In 1910, the only paved sections of the highway were the approaches to Dover Bridge in both Talbot County and Caroline County. The state road was paved from Hurlock to Shiloh Church in 1912, from Easton to Waddell's Corner in 1913 and 1914, from Waddell's Corner to Hurlock in 1915, and within Hurlock in 1916. When the U.S. Highway System was organized in 1926, the state road became part of US 213. The first section of the Vienna- Rhodesdale highway was of pavement south from Rhodesdale that was completed by 1923. The remainder of the highway was under construction by 1924, with another section of the road completed north from Vienna by 1927. The gap between Vienna and Rhodesdale was filled in 1928. When the Nanticoke River Bridge at Vienna was completed in 1931, US 213 was rerouted between Mardela Springs and Rhodesdale to pass through Vienna. A new Dover Bridge, replacing a bridge built in the 19th century, was completed in 1932. In 1939, the original MD 331 and US 213 swapped routes; US 213 also assumed MD 344 between Vienna and MD 16 at Mount Holly. MD 331 has seen little change since 1939. MD 331 and MD 16 were realigned around Ellwood and Linchester around 1960. MD 331's southern terminus was truncated at its newly constructed interchange with US 50 in Vienna in 1991 shortly after US 50 bypassed Vienna. MD 331's northern terminus has been rolled back twice in Easton. The state highway was rolled back from Washington Street to Park Street in 1983. MD 331 was truncated at US 50 in 2004. On October 14, 2014, groundbreaking for a new Dover Bridge took place, with Lieutenant Governor Anthony G. Brown and other state and local politicians in attendance. The new bridge, which was built to the south of the former swing bridge, was constructed as a fixed-span steel girder bridge. Construction on the new Dover Bridge cost $64 million. The new bridge opened to traffic on June 12, 2018. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Dover Bridge was held on June 13, 2018, with Governor Larry Hogan and other state and local officials in attendance.

He was a native of Volterra, Italy, and therefore is called Raphael Volaterranus or Raphael of Volterra; also Maffeus Volaterranus, or Raffaello Volterrano. Life From earliest youth he devoted himself to the study of letters, and in 1466 was called to Rome, with his brothers, by their father Gherardo Maffei, whom Pius II had appointed professor of law at the University of Rome, and had taken later for his secretary, a position he held also under Paul II and Sixtus IV. At Rome Raffaelo held himself aloof from the court, devoting his time to the practice of piety and to the study of philosophy of theology and of the Greek language, the latter under George of Trebizond. In 1477, he went to Hungary with Cardinal Louis of Aragon, on the latter's mission to Matthias Corvinus. Upon his return, Raffaelo was persuaded by Gaspare da Firenze not to become a Minor Observant, as Raffaelo intended to do; whereupon he married, and established his residence at Volterra. The remainder of his life was spent in study, in the practice of piety and of penance, and in the exercise of works of charity; in his own house, he established an accademia, in which he gave lectures on philosophy and on theology, while he founded the Clarisse monastery of Volterra. He died in the odor of sanctity; and, contrary to his desire, his brother erected to his memory a splendid monument in the church of San Lino, which Raffaello had endowed; the monument was the work of Silvio Cosini, Stagio Stagi, and Fra Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, OSM. Works Among the works of Maffei are Commentariorum rerum urbanarum libri XXXVIII (Rome, 1506; Paris, 1516), an encyclopedia of all subjects known at that time, prepared with great care, but not always with the best judgment. It consists of three parts; in the first, \\"Geography\\", he writes a history of the whole known world arranged by location; the second part, \\"Anthropology\\", is devoted, more especially, to the contemporaneous history of that time; the third part is devoted to \\"Philology\\" which encapsulates all of science and natural history as it was known. This encyclopaedia was printed eight times up to 1603. The 1603 edition contains 814 folio pages. The first book consists of the table of contents and a classed index; books 2-12, geography; 13-23, lives of illustrious men, the popes occupying book 22, and the emperors book 23; 24-27, animals and plants; 28, metals, gems, stones, houses and other inanimate things; 34, de scientiis cyclicis (grammar and rhetoric); 35, de scientiis mathematicis, arithmetic, geometry, optica, catoptrica, astronomy and astrology; 36-38, Aristotelica (on the works of Aristotle). Maffei's lives of Sixtus IV, Innocent VIII, Alexander VI, and Pius III, which appear as an appendix to Platina's Vitae Pontificum, and which were also published separately (Venice, 1518), are taken from the Commentarii; in them Maffei blames unsparingly the disordered life of the Roman court. At Volterra, he wrote a compendium of philosophy and of theology, De institutione christiana and De prima philosophia (Rome, 1518) in which he rather follows Scotus. He translated, from the Greek into Latin, the \\"Odyssey\\" of Homer, the \\"Oeconomics\\" of Xenophon, the \\"Gothic War\\" of Procopius, \\"Sermones et tractatus S. Basilii\\", some sermons of St. John of Damascus and of St. Andrew of Crete; he also wrote the \\"Vita B. Jacobi de Certaldo\\". On the other hand, he was in epistolary communication with popes, cardinals, and other learned men. The manuscript of the work which he called \\"Peristromata\\" remained incomplete; it went to the Biblioteca Barberiniana. Family The elder brother of Maffei, Antonio, was involved in the conspiracy of the Pazzi. Another brother, Mario, was a man of great culture. He was nuncio to France and, later, prefect of the building of St. Peter's (1507), regent of the penitentiaries, and Bishop, first, of Aquino (1516) and then of Cavaillon, he died on 23 June 1537.

The two formed a team of five, known as the 'Risktakers' and were undefeated in five 10-man tag team matches for the company. Devon Wrestling (2010‚Äì12) In 2010, Andrews began to wrestle for Joel Redman's startup company the Devon Wrestling Alliance, from his home county of Devon. Andrews won his first two matches in the company and won the DWA Tag Team championships with his brother, with a win over Danny and Mark Walsh.

A beach tag (also beach badge or beach token) is an admission pass that must be purchased to access a beach. It is commonly associated with the Jersey Shore in the U.S. state of New Jersey, where communities with the beach tag system restrict summer beach access to residents and visitors who pay a fee for a daily, weekly, or seasonal pass. Staff patrol the beach looking for people who are not displaying their tag, and visitors without one are asked to purchase a tag or leave. Beaches with a beach-tag program use the proceeds to offset the maintenance and staffing costs associated with running a beach, such as funding lifeguards, restrooms, and trash removal. Pricing Daily, weekly, and seasonal tags can usually be purchased at participating beaches, and each municipality sets its own rates and policies. Beaches typically do not charge for children under the age of 12 and may offer discounts to seniors. In certain municipalities, discounts are given for seasonal passes purchased before a specific date (e.g., May 15 in Seaside Heights, New Jersey). Tag polemics The goals of beach tags, or tokens, are to either restrict the beach to only community members, or to generate user fees for lifeguards and maintenance (e.g., trash removal). On the Jersey Shore, beach tags are controversial because the public trust doctrine generally gives the public the right to access the intertidal zone,Polis, Robert and McRae, Leslie. Back to the Beach: Bob Polis looks at surprising issues for beachgoers and beach property owners , December 1, 2005.Degener, Richard. Ruling expands access to beaches, Atlantic City Press, May 21, 2004. and guests may feel that a beach with beach tags should offer a superior service to free beaches. Additionally, detractors debate whether beach tags are actually to restrict beach use to people who are paying visitors of hotels, beach house rentals, and local residents. The beach tag offered by one municipality does not grant access to beaches in other municipalities, because each municipality has its own rules. For example, Long Beach Island, which is about twenty miles long, comprises six municipalities, each with its own beach tags, and beach-goers cannot purchase a tag in one Long Beach Island municipality and use it in another. Proponents of beach tags suggest that they improve the cleanliness and safety of the beaches, making the tag fees akin to user fees that prevent freeloading. In addition, proponents note that the beaches which require beach tags are those located in smaller municipalities, which because of beach tags are permitted to offer a similar product to the larger municipalities. New Jersey municipalities that do not enforce beach tags The following beaches did not require beach tags as of the 2015 beach season: *Atlantic City *North Wildwood *Strathmere (Upper Township) *Wildwood *Wildwood Crest Other places In Evanston, Illinois, \\"beach tokens\\" may be required for entrance to the beach for people and even pets. The beach tokens are often made of metal or other durable material, to enable them to withstand swimming. The bearer may either carry them, or wear them around their neck or on their swimsuit. The Village of Island Park and the city of Long Beach in Nassau County, New York issue beach tags for the use of their beaches.

The species is known as Bosc's monitor in Europe, since French scientist Louis Bosc first described the species. It belongs to the subgenus Polydaedalus, along with the Nile, the ornate and other monitors. Etymology The specific name exanthematicus is derived from the Greek word exanthem , meaning an eruption or blister of the skin. French botanist and zoologist Louis Augustin Guillaume BoscBeolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Bosc\\", p. 32). originally described this lizard as Lacerta exanthematica in reference to the large oval scales on the back of its neck. Description Savannah monitors are stoutly built, with relatively short limbs and toes, and skulls and dentition adapted to feed on hard-shelled prey. They are robust creatures, with powerful limbs for digging, powerful jaws and blunt, peglike teeth. Maximum size is rarely more than 100 cm. Their diet is much more restricted than that of other African monitor lizards, consisting mainly of snails, millipedes, orthopterans, beetles, and other invertebrates. The skin coloration pattern varies according to the local habitat substrate. The body scales are large, usually less than 100 scales around midbody, a partly laterally compressed tail with a double dorsal ridge and nostrils equidistant from the eyes and the tip of the snout. The Savannah monitor is often confused with the white-throat monitor (Varanus albigularis), which can grow to lengths of 5‚Äì6 ft. While similar in overall appearance, this species possesses significant morphological and ecological differences and is recognized as a very distinct species. Behaviour= Diet  Information about the diet of savannah monitors in the wild has been recorded in Senegal and Ghana. It feeds almost exclusively on arthropods and molluscs. In Senegal, Iulus millipedes were the most common prey of adults; in Ghana, small crickets formed the bulk of the diet of animals less than 2 months old; orthopterans (especially Brachytrupes), scorpions and amphibians were the most common prey of animals 6‚Äì7 months old.  Reproduction  Females dig a deep hole in the substrate, in which up to 40 or more eggs are laid, which hatch after about 156-160 days. Hatchlings start feeding a few days after the yolk sac has been absorbed, which may take 12 days or more after hatching. In captivity The Savannah monitor is readily available in the pet trade. Juvenile animals are collected from several countries in West Africa (mainly Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria) and exported worldwide. Animals sold as \\"captive bred\\", captive farmed or ranched are the offspring of gravid females collected during the breeding season whose eggs are incubated by exporters. Adult specimens frequently become unwanted pets and are reported as being the most common monitor lizards by animal rescue agencies. However the vast majority (estimated 90%) die within a year of capture and captive breeding is very rare. The skins of the species are important in the international leather trade and originate mainly from Chad, Mali and Sudan. Range Its range extends throughout sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Sudan and south almost to the Congo River and Rift Valley, where they are replaced by V. albigularis. V. exanthematicus is primarily a ground-dwelling species that shelters in burrows, although it is sometimes found in bushes or low trees. In the coastal plain of Ghana, V. exanthematicus juveniles are often associated with the burrows of the giant cricket Brachytrupes. Threats V. exanthematicus is listed as least concern by IUCN. The species is hunted for its leather and meat and for the international pet trade. The trade in wild collected savannah monitors is not of a global conservation concern due to the vast range of the species, in addition to the collection for the pet trade often occurring over a relatively small area.http://www.mampam.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=173&Itemid;=87 An average of 30,574 live specimens were imported into the US each year between 2000 and 2009; total imports of live specimens into the US between 2000 and 2010 was 325,480 animals. During the same period, 1,037 skins, shoes, and products of the species were imported into the US. Trade in live animals comes mainly from Ghana (235,903 animals exported between 2000 and 2010), Togo (188,110 animals exported between 2000 and 2010), and Benin (72,964 animals exported between 2000 and 2010). During the same period, total worldwide declared exports of skins and products of the species totalled 37,506. However, substantial undeclared trade in the species occurs from Sudan, Nigeria, and elsewhere  References Further reading * *Bennett, Daniel; Thakoordyal, Ravi (2003).

Aaron Copland referred to Orb√≥n as \\"Cuba's most gifted composer of the new generation.\\"Blau Juli√°n Orb√≥n Life=Family and early years Juli√°n Orb√≥n was born on August 7, 1925, in Avil√©s, Spain, to Benjam√≠n Orb√≥n.Baker's Juli√°n Orb√≥n was exposed to music at a very early age because his father, Benjam√≠n, was a composer and pianist. In 1932, Juli√°n Orb√≥n began taking piano lessons and basic music lessons from his father. At the age of ten, Juli√°n Orb√≥n attended the Oviedo Conservatory, where he received his first formal training.Baker's In 1938, the Orb√≥n family moved to Havana, Cuba. Here Orb√≥n continued his musical training in piano under his father and his training in composition under Jos√© Ard√©vol, a Cuban composer and conductor.Baker's While teaching at the Havana Conservatory, Ard√©vol co-founded a Cuban school of composers with Orb√≥n, called Grupo de renovaci√≥n musical, including many of Ard√©vol's students.Vega, \\"Latin American Composers in the United States\\" The members of this group included musicians Seraf√≠n Pro, Edgardo Mart√≠n, Argeliers Le√≥n, Harold Gramatges, Hilario Gonz√°lez, Dolores Torres Barr√≥s, and Juan Antonio C√°mara. This group was established to promote new Cuban music. While in Havana, Orb√≥n's father also co-founded the Orb√≥n Conservatory.Baker's Musical training and career When his father died in 1944, Juli√°n Orb√≥n took over as director of the Orb√≥n Conservatory.Vega, \\"Latin American Composers in the United States\\" A year later, he won a scholarship to study composition with Aaron Copland at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood in Lenox, Massachusetts.Baker's After studying with Copland for about a year, Orb√≥n returned to Havana to continue his position as director at the Orb√≥n Conservatory. He did not stay long, however, because the Cuban Revolution began in 1953. In the wake of this revolution, Orb√≥n permanently left Cuba and moved to Mexico City in 1960.Naxos While in Mexico City, until 1963 Orb√≥n taught composition alongside Carlos Ch√°vez, a famous Mexican composer, conductor, and educator, at the Taller de Composici√≥n of the National Conservatory of Music.Baker's In 1964 Orb√≥n moved to the United States to teach composition at Lenox College, Washington University in St. Louis, Barnard College, and the Hispanic Institute of Columbia University in New York City.Baker's He settled and lived in New York City the rest of his life. Later years Juli√°n Orb√≥n died of cancer at the age of 65 at the Sinai Medical Center in Miami, Florida.Blau Orb√≥n's sister, Ana Abril; wife, Mercedes; two sons, Andres and Jul√≠an; and two grandchildren are still alive.Blau Music and accomplishments=Musical style Juli√°n Orb√≥n created compositions that combined Spanish and Cuban styles and traits, Gregorian chant qualities, and African music styles.Blau His early style was influenced by composers such as Manuel de Falla, Rodolfo Halffter, and Ernesto Halffter, who used a Spanish neoclassic style in their compositions.Vega, \\"Latin American Composers in the United States\\" Orb√≥n's works such as Suite de Siete Canciones de Juan del Encina and Homenaje a la Tonadilla clearly illustrate this Spanish neoclassic style. Other characteristics of Orb√≥n's works include strong rhythmic activity and intense though straightforward expression. This strong rhythmic activity and intense and straightforward expression is a large part in Orb√≥n's Preludio y danza for solo guitar depicted below. Preludio y danza Later Orb√≥n was greatly influenced by Copland, Ch√°vez, and Villa-Lobos because of his close friendships with them. Through these different influences, Orb√≥n began to gradually compose pieces without the influence of the Spanish neoclassic style. His later style became more romantic and expressive, stemming from his sadness caused by having to leave Cuba. Reception Juli√°n Orb√≥n had many fellow musicians and composers who supported him and his music. Eduardo Mata, a Mexican conductor and composer, and Julio Estrada, a Mexican composer and historian, both praised Orb√≥n's compositions, which helped spread positive opinions about Orb√≥n throughout Latin America. Both Mata and Estrada were students of Orb√≥n when he was teaching alongside Ch√°vez in Mexico City.Vega \\"Juli√°n Orb√≥n, a Biographical and Critical Essay by Velia Yedra\\" Aaron Copland was also a supporter of Orb√≥n. However, much of Orb√≥n‚Äôs music is unknown today, and little is performed in Cuba. Awards Juli√°n Orb√≥n won many awards for his compositions over his lifetime.

Perpignan, 14 October 1197), was a viscountess of Narbonne from 1134 to 1192. She was the daughter of Aimery II of Narbonne and his first wife, also named Ermengarde. Youth Aimery II was killed at the Battle of Fraga on July 17, 1134, fighting against the Almoravids along with Alfonso I of Aragon. Aimery left only two underaged daughters as his heirs, Ermengarde and her half-sister Ermessinde (daughter of Aimery's second wife, also named Ermessinde). Aimery had at least one son, also called Aimery, attested in numerous charters, but he predeceased him (ca. 1130). Thus, the approximately five-year-old Ermengarde inherited the viscounty of Narbonne, which occupied a strategic place in the politics of Languedoc: it was desired by the counts of Toulouse, the counts of Barcelona, the Trencavel viscounts of Carcassonne, and the lords of Montpellier. denier minted by Alphonse at Narbonne during the minority of Ermengard (1134‚Äì43) bearing the obverse inscription DUX ANFOS and on the reverse CIVI NARBON In 1142, Alfonso Jordan, count of Toulouse, whose wife Faydid of Uzes had either recently died or been repudiated, married the now-adolescent Ermengarde. In reaction to this prospect, which overturned the balance of power in the region by adding Narbonne to the direct control of Toulouse, a coalition of Occitan lords led by Roger II of B√©ziers, viscount of Carcassonne, B√©ziers, Albi and Raz√®s formed an alliance against Toulouse. Alfonso was defeated by the coalition and taken prisoner, and was forced to make peace with Narbonne and restore Ermengarde and her new husband to the viscounty before being released. Following the dissolution of her marriage to Alfonso, Ermengarde was married to a vassal of Roger II, Bernard IV of Anduze. Political activity In 1177 she joined Gui Guerrejat (the lover of Azalais de Porcairagues), Bernard Ato V of N√Æmes and Agde, and Gui's nephews William VIII of Montpellier and Gui Burgundion, in an alliance in opposition to Raymond VI of Toulouse, whose power suddenly increased when he became ruler of Melgueil as widower of Ermessende of Pelet. Cultural activity Around 1190, a French cleric named Andr√© le Chapelain wrote a \\"Treatise on Courtly Love\\" (Latin De Arte honeste amandi). In the second part of the Treatise, \\"How to maintain love\\", the author spoke of twenty-one \\"judgements of love\\" which had been pronounced by the greatest ladies of the kingdom of France. Among them, three judgements were attributed to Eleanor of Aquitaine, seven to her daughter Marie, and five to Ermengarde. Although these \\"judgements\\" were probably fictional, they attest to the fame acquired by Ermengarde, even in the langue d'o√Øl in the north. She corresponded with many troubadours, including Peire Rogier, Giraut de Bornelh, Peire d'Alvergne, Pons d'Ortafa, and Salh d'Escola, as well as the trobairitz Azalais de Porcairagues. In addition it is believed that she welcomed to her court Rognvald II of Orkney, a Viking prince that became a saint, and poet, who composed skaldic poetry for her.Jacqueline Caille, ¬´ Une idylle entre la vicomtesse Ermengarde de Narbonne et le prince Rognvald Kali des Orcades au milieu du XIIe si√®cle ? ¬ª, dans G.

In 1192 Ermengarde abdicated the viscounty in favor of Peter and retired to Perpignan, where she died five years later.

The ultimate objective is to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of healthcare as well as access to healthcare through the efficient application of health information technology. RHIOs are also intended to support secondary use of clinical data for research as well as institution/provider quality assessment and improvement. RHIO stakeholders include smaller clinics, hospitals, medical societies, major employers and payers. RHIOs are intended to be key to the proposed US Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN). Background The US system of healthcare is highly complex and fragmented, with use of multiple information technology systems and vendors incorporating different standards. In contrast with other developed nations, healthcare accounts for a disproportionate percentage of the US GDP, and there is a concern about the economic viability of Medicare. Despite this significant expenditure, there is evidence of inefficiency, waste and medical errors, with a 2001 estimate by the Institute of Medicine of between 44,000-98,000 annual deaths due to medical errors. While numerous possible causes for this situation exist, much waste (e.g., duplication of laboratory tests) and medical errors (e.g., adverse drug reactions) are traceable to inability of healthcare providers (who are not the patients' primary providers) to access patients' existing medical information in a timely manner when needed: better and more ubiquitous health information technology might be part of the overall solution. In 2004 President W. George Bush issued for the development and nationwide implementation of an interoperable health information technology infrastructure to improve the quality and efficiency of health care with the goal that most Americans will have an EHR by 2014. In July 2004 the United States Department of Health and Human Services released their vision of how America's healthcare system could be rebuilt during the next decade. An aspect of the federal effort is the creation of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. One of the roles of ONC is to facilitate RHIO development. The planning stage of RHIO formation involves # identification of a shared vision/motivation # creating a governance structure # identifying a technology and network infrastructure for data integration # defining standards for data sharing, protection of data, and business practices to ensure patient protection during data exchange # defining educational and business strategies to ensure sustainability of the effort. Finally, RHIOs must implement the proposed strategies. Architecture types The two broad types of architecture, centralized and federated, correspond to the data warehouse and federated database system models of data integration. In the centralized configuration (e.g., The Santa Cruz Community and the Michigan UP Network), all providers send their data to the RHIO's central repository on a periodic basis (daily). In the federated model, the RHIO acts as a record locator service, the data stays at its original location, and the RHIO only has a \\"pointer\\" to that information. The pros and cons of each architecture follow from the approaches. ; Centralized : For the Centralized design, once data is centralized and restructured into a uniform data model, it is easier to query and analyze. However, because movement and restructuring is generally a complex batch process involving the well-known steps of \\"extract, transform, load\\", the centralized data may be somewhat out of date if the (logistically challenging) target of daily updates is not achieved. Also, there may be concerns among the individual RHIO participants who originate the raw data that they are giving up \\"control\\" and \\"ownership\\" once the data is copied to a central site. Also, creation of the central repository requires close collaboration to determine exactly what data will be centralized and how it will be structured. ; Federated : In federated systems the RHIO software only stores information about the locations where a patient's data is available. These are often more politically feasible than centralized systems. However, designing a protocol by which the RHIO can query (heterogeneously structured) individual provider data stores is technically challenging. The software at the individual sites must ensure authenticate electronic requests to ensure that they are legitimate and authorized, and no standards that can be used for this purpose currently exist. A federated setup requires greater network bandwidth than the centralized approach, because a request by a user of the central RHIO software can be farmed out to multiple provider systems. Centralized and federated approaches are not mutually exclusive, and hybrid setups can be employed. In one proposed hybrid model, the health record trust or health record data bank, all data for each patient would stay in a single repository as in the centralized model, but patients could choose which data bank to use for their records. Current status , 193 initiatives (including RHIOs) in the United States were working on health information exchange, and 57 of those were actively exchanging data used by healthcare stakeholders. RHIO initiatives exist at two levels, larger (statewide) and smaller (local and rural). Compared to local RHIOs, state-level initiatives, because of the larger number of stakeholders and patient base, and consequent financial strength, have a greater likelihood of being able to utilize national-level expertise both in health IT and policy-making. Most operational RHIO efforts tend to be larger efforts, though the risk of political battles and consequent failure is also amplified if several large stakeholders choose not to cooperate with each other. Compared to state-level RHIOs, stakeholders tend to be more heterogeneous with respect to line of business, use of technology and size. Rural RHIOs have a subscriber base of less than 100,000. The presence of numerous, smaller organizations with relatively limited IT budgets translates to numerous challenges due to the dis-economies of small scale. There is limited access to skilled technology professions, and health IT vendors pay less attention to small customers. Many stakeholders continue to deploy legacy software from long-defunct vendors and some may not deploy IT at all. In addition, stakeholders may be less IT-savvy, and even availability of high- speed Internet connectivity may not be assured. A significant sustainability challenge for smaller RHIOs involves funding. Some support models (e.g., used by Northwest, Louisville KY) are based on shared, subscription-based use of commercial health information software, and the shared use of scarce resources such as information technology professionals, who are unaffordable for smaller organizations acting individually. Irrespective of size, certain challenges remain, such as interoperability standards, as well as consistent standards with respect to privacy, security and appropriate use of the data. Currently, privacy/security issues vary across states, and federal efforts to ensure uniformity are desirable. Examples=INPC and IHIE The Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) ‚Äî originally the Indianapolis Network for Patient Care and Research (INPRC) ‚Äî operational since 1994, connects all five major hospital systems in greater Indianapolis. All INPC participants now deliver registration records, all laboratory tests, text reports, medication history and all UB92 records (diagnosis, length of stay, and procedure codes) for hospital admissions and emergency room visits to separate electronic medical record vaults in a central INPC server using a federated data store model. The message exchange standard that is used is HL7. The computer system standardizes all clinical data as it arrives at the INPC vault, laboratory, radiology, and other study test results are mapped to a set of common test codes LOINC with standard units of measure, and patients with multiple medical record numbers are linked. Implementation has been simplified because each participating institution uses the same data model and term dictionary which contain the codes, names (and other attributes) for tests, drugs, coded answers, etc. The data for any participating patient seen in any of the region's 11 emergency rooms can be presented as one virtual medical record. Stakeholders/ participants in this RHIO include: major and regional hospital systems, regional and national reference laboratories, state, federal, and private payors, pharmacy benefit management claims repository services, major physician practice organizations, individual providers, state government (Dept. of Health), major academic research institutions, and others. The statewide Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE), which uses the expertise of the same medical informatics/IT team as the INPC, combines clinical data in combination with administrative (claims) data to support electronic delivery of test reports to physician offices using faxes, printers, and e-mail, as well as Clinical Quality Services, which provide a \\"report card\\" (and incentives) on established quality measures to physicians, practice groups, employers, and payers. The IHIE is a rare example of a self-sustaining health information exchange (not reliant on government grants). Stakeholder satisfaction with this RHIO is apparently high. CalRHIO CalRHIO is an example of an RHIO failure due to political/turf battles; it shutdown January 8, 2010. Following heavy competition with California e-Health Collaborative (CAeHC) for designation as California's statewide HIE entity, both organizations were turned down by the state government in December 2009; large stakeholders such as Medicity Inc. and Kaiser Permanente subsequently followed suit and withdrew financial support. Reasons for CalRHIO's failure have been attributed to a limited business model dependent on state-entity designation. Healthcurrent Healthcurrent is the RHIO for the state of Arizona, formerly known as AZHeC. Healthcurrent hosts a physical health and behavioral health/crisis portal for health information exchange throughout Arizona. Healthcurrent links care providers to its standards-based HIE platform and holds a repository of data that is available to be shared with properly accredited care providers in the community. Arizona is an opt-out state for healthcare data flowing to the state HIE. Other examples In some states (e.g., Kansas), an alternative to a stakeholder-consortium-based state-level RHIO is being considered, namely direct involvement of the state governments in creating the RHIO infrastructure. This approach builds on the strengths of state governments as major employers and purchasers of healthcare services (e.g., University of Alabama at Birmingham, is Alabama's largest employer). Similarly, TennCare in Tennessee has roots in addressing the state's un- and under-insured population and is consequently more state driven. Utah's efforts are based on the state's prior efforts to process healthcare claims. Recent federal efforts (e.g., at the Veterans Administration) are aimed at creating a federal employee based electronic health record system, which might be considered a national RHIO.

It was built on the site of the former G√∂kt√ºrk imperial capital, 27 km north-to- northwest of the later Mongol capital, Karakorum. Its ruins are known as Kharbalgas in Mongolian meaning \\"black city\\". They form part of the World Heritage Site Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape. Location Ordu-Baliq is in a grassy plain called the Talal-khain-dala steppe, on the western bank of the Orkhon River in the Khotont sum of the Arkhangai Province, Mongolia, 16 km northeast of the Khotont village, or 30 km north-to-northwest of Kharkhorin. The Orkhon emerges from the gorges of the Khangai Mountains and flows northward to meet the Tuul River (the current capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, is on its upper reaches). A favorable micro-climate makes the location ideal for pasturage, and it lies along the most important east-west route across Mongolia. As a result, the Orkhon Valley was a center of habitation and important political and economic activity long before the birth of Genghis Khan who made it known to the wider world. History Poster showing Ordu- Baliq, capital of the Uyghur Khaganate (745‚Äì840) in Mongolia. In 744, after the defeat of the last G√∂kt√ºrk Kaghan by the Uyghur-Qarluk-Basmyl alliance, the Uyghurs under Bayanchur Khan (Bayan √áor) established their imperial capital Ordu Baliq on the site of the old √∂rd√º (\\"nomadic capital\\"). Ordu-Baliq flourished until 840, when it was reduced to ruin by the invading Yenisey Kyrgyzes. The capital occupied at least 32 square kilometers. The ruins of the palace or temple complex laying at coordinates ‚Äî which include the 10-meter- high double clay walls,4 meters apart,14 watch towers, 8 on the Southern side and 6 on the Northern side, two main entrances, one on East side and other on West side, a 12-meter citadel in the southeast corner and a 14-meter-high stupa in the center ‚Äî clearly indicate that Ordu Baliq or Urgin Balyq \\"Selenge Stone inscriptions\\" in Orkhon Runic Uyghur Script in Mongolia, composed in 759 CE on granite stele, line 34 was a large, affluent town. The urban area may be divided into three main parts. The central part consisting of numerous buildings surrounded by a continuous wall forms the biggest part. Ruin of a large number of temples and houses are to be found to the south beyond the center. The Khan's residential palace, which was also ringed by walls on all sides, stood in the northeastern part of the town, where the Russian archaeologist Nikolay Yadrintsev discovered a green granite monument with a statue of a dragon perched at the top and bearing a runic inscription glorifying the khagans. Ordu Baliq was a fully fortified commandry and commercial entrepot typical of the central points along the length of the Silk Road. The well-preserved remains now consist of concentric fortified walls and lookout towers, stables, military and commercial stores, and administrative buildings. There are remains of a water drainage system. Archaeologists established that certain areas were allotted for trade and handcrafts, while in the center of the town were palaces and temples, including a monastery. The palace had fortified walls around it and two main gates, north and south, as well as moats filled with water and watchtowers. The architectural style and planning of the city appear to have close parallels with T'ang Chinese models, although there are elements that appear to have derived inspiration from elsewhere.Arden-Wong, L.A. (2012) \\"The architectural relationship between Tang and Eastern Uighur Imperial Cities\\", in Zs. Rajkai and I. Bell√©r-Hann (eds.) Frontiers and Boundaries: Encounters on China's Margins. Asiatische Forschungen 156, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, pp. 11‚Äì47. Historical accounts An ambassador from the Samanid Empire, Tamim ibn Bahr, visited Ordu Baliq in 821 CE and left the only written account of the city. He traveled through uninhabited steppes until arriving in the vicinity of the Uighur capital. He described Ordu-Baliq as a great town, \\"rich in agriculture and surrounded by rustaqs (villages) full of cultivation lying close together. The town had twelve iron gates of huge size. The town was populous and thickly crowded and had markets and various trades.\\" He reported that amongst the townspeople, Manichaeism prevailed. The most striking detail of his description is the golden yurt or tent on top of the citadel where the khagan held court. The golden tent was considered the heart of the Uyghur power, gold being the symbol of imperial rule. The presence of a golden tent is confirmed in Chinese historical accounts where the Kirghiz khan was said to have vowed to seize the Uyghurs' golden tent.Êñ∞ÂîêÊõ∏ Xin Tangshu Chapter 217 part 2.

I will seize your golden tent, and in front of your tent my horses will gallop and my banners will be planted. If you can resist, come quickly, but if you cannot, then go away.\\" Discovery In 1871, the Russian traveler Paderin was the first European to visit the ruins of the Uighur capital. Only the wall and a tower were in existence, while the streets and ruins outside the wall could be seen at a distance. He was told that the Mongols call it either Kara Balghasun (\\"black city\\") or khara-kherem (\\"black wall\\").

It is an Irish, British and American co-production. Set in a remote Irish castle called Dromore Castle, Co. Limerick, High Spirits is a topsy-turvy comedy with thematic leanings towards Ireland's rich folklore regarding ghosts and spirits, where the castle starts to come to life with the help of such denizens.  Plot  Peter O'Toole is Peter Plunkett, the owner of a dilapidated Irish castle which has been converted to a bed and breakfast supplying the only employment for the local villagers. Owing money to an Irish-American businessman by the name of Brogan, Plunkett has the idea to turn the castle into \\"the most haunted castle in Europe\\" for the tourist trade, inspired by his mother's stories of the castle's history of ghosts. He and his wacky staff of Irish characters set about creating ghost costumes and effects for their first group of American lodgers. At first annoyed by the inept hauntings, the American guests (including Steve Guttenberg, Beverly D'Angelo, Connie Booth, Peter Gallagher and Jennifer Tilly) soon get what they paid for as the genuine ghosts of Castle Plunkett take umbrage with being cheaply exploited and stage a full-scale paranormal event. The ghosts of two dead people, Mary Plunkett and Martin Brogan (played by Daryl Hannah and Liam Neeson), become romantically entangled with Guttenberg and D'Angelo's characters. This romantic twist is the focus of most of the plot.

Woods was also portrayed in the Broadway adaptation of the same name.  In pop culture  Elle Woods first appeared as the protagonist of Legally Blonde, a novel by Amanda Brown. Later, Woods was portrayed by Reese Witherspoon in the films Legally Blonde (2001) and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde (2003). The character was then portrayed in a Broadway theatre adaptation of the first film, Legally Blonde - The Musical. Elle Woods is also the basis of a series of young adult fiction novels featuring the character and written by Natalie Standiford. The character is mentioned but not seen in a later direct-to-video sequel, Legally Blondes (2009), which portrays the adventures of her twin British cousins. In 2018 Ariana Grande referenced Elle in several scenes of her \\"Thank U, Next\\" music video.  Legally Blonde films  Entertainment Weekly put Elle Woods on its end-of- the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"She's blonde, bubbly and carries a tiny Chihuahua. But despite the inevitable Paris Hilton comparisons, Reese Witherspoon's Legally Blonde dynamo managed to be taken seriously. Case closed!\\"  Broadway adaptation  Since the start, Woods has been portrayed by eleven different actresses in different stagings of the show: Gabby Cinque, Olivia Mezzerina, Laura Bell Bundy, Bailey Hanks, Becky Gulsvig, Jessica Jung, Nikki Bohne, Luna Park, Jung Eun-ji, Sayaka Kanda, Barbara Obermeier and in the West End by Sheridan Smith OBE (who was later to be replaced by her Legally Blonde co-star Susan McFadden). From July 2011 Carley Stenson took over the role of Elle Woods with Susan McFadden leaving the show. Background In the film, Legally Blonde, Elle Woods is a sorority sister living at Delta Nu at the fictional California University Los Angeles (CULA) (UCLA in the musical) where she maintains a 4.0 GPA. Woods' boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, breaks up with her the night she expects him to propose, claiming that he needs \\"to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.\\" Warner is bound for Harvard Law School, and Woods becomes determined to gain admittance to the school to win him back. Once at Harvard, Woods learns that Warner has a new fianc√©e. Woods is able to exonerate a sorority sister accused of murder, and decides she does not need Warner. In the film's conclusion, Woods gives the commencement address to the law school class after proving herself and earning the respect of her peers, and beginning a relationship with Emmett Richmond. In the sequel to the original film, Elle is in the middle of planning her wedding while in line for a promotion at work. She decides to track down the birth mother of her beloved dog, Bruiser, and discovers that she is being used for animal testing. After getting fired for trying to bring up the testing facility, Elle goes to work on Capitol Hill, seeking to advance animal rights. She begins the film with na√Øve expectations about the motivations of members of Congress, and although these expectations are dashed, she perseveres and succeeds in the passage of the desired animal rights legislation. At the end of the movie, she marries Emmett in Washington, D.C., and is seen looking at the White House when she is asked where she wants to live.

The Arch of Janus is the only quadrifrons triumphal arch preserved in Rome. It was set up at a crossroads at the northeastern limit of the Forum Boarium, close to the Velabrum, over the Cloaca Maxima drain that went from the Forum to the River Tiber. It was built in the early 4th century CE, using spolia, i.e. material from earlier buildings, including bricks, together with pottery shards, and was covered with white marble, also from earlier buildings. The exact significance of the arch is poorly understood: it is thought to have been a boundary marker rather than a triumphal arch. An alternative view is that it was built to provide shelter for the traders at the Forum Boarium cattle market. Some researchers believe it was dedicated to Constantine I or Constantius II and was known as the Arch of the Deified Constantine. It is 16 meters high and 12 meters wide. The arch as it appeared in the mid-18th century; with its upper stage and fortifications still partly intact. Each pier of the arch has two rows of three niches. It seems logical that statues would have filled these 48 niches but none has been identified. The stone at the apex of the central arch on the north side is thought to depict Minerva, although others believe it may be Palladium. Its current name probably dates from the Renaissance or later, and was not used to describe it in classical antiquity. The name is derived from the structure's four-fronted, four-arched configuration. The ancient Roman god Janus (Ianus Quadrifons), was sometimes depicted with four faces and there are Janus-related structures mentioned in historic descriptions of ancient Rome. In the Middle Ages, the Frangipane family transformed the building into a fortress, and so it survived intact until 1830. Then, the attic and top were torn down because they were erroneously believed to not belong to the original structure. However, there is a staircase within the north-west pier which would have given access to this top floor. Iron pins originally held together the marble blocks but were removed in the Middle Ages, leading to the monument‚Äôs present pock-marked look. Fragments of the dedicatory inscription are still preserved inside the nearby church of San Giorgio in Velabro. The arch has not been accessible to the public since the explosion of a bomb in front of San Giorgio in Velabro, on the night of 27 July 1993. It is the one monument of the Forum Boarium that remains unrestored. The Arch of Malborghetto, just outside Rome, also includes the remnants of a former Roman quadrifons arch.

After attending UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich, Bernhard worked as an engineer at several companies and organizations including Texas Instruments and Litton Industries, receiving numerous patents in electronics. Early life and family Bernhard Einstein was the son of Hans Albert Einstein and Frieda Einstein (n√©e Knecht), who had married in 1927 in Switzerland. He was born on 10 July 1930 in Dortmund, Germany, where Hans Albert was involved in a bridge building project. Hans Albert was the only one of Albert Einstein's three children to marry and have children. Bernhard spent his early years in Switzerland until the age of eight, when his family moved to South Carolina. Albert Einstein was very worried about the rise of Nazi Germany and encouraged his son Hans Albert to emigrate to the United States as he himself had done in 1933. Hans Albert heeded this advice, and moved his family to Greenville, South Carolina, where he was a civil engineer working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Bernhard spent his teenage years in Pasadena, where his father was a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and in Berkeley. Bernhard first met his grandfather Albert when he was two years old. As a boy he travelled alone to spend time with Albert in New Jersey, and at Saranac Lake in upstate New York. Albert Einstein died in April 1955. Having shared his love of music with his grandson, he bequeathed Bernhard his violin in addition to a modest sum of money. In 1954, Bernhard married Doris Aude Ascher (born 1930), with whom he had five children: *Thomas Martin Einstein (born 1955 in Switzerland) *Paul Michael Einstein (born 1959 in Switzerland) *Eduard Albert \\"Ted\\" Einstein (born 1961 in Dallas, Texas) *Mira Einstein-Yehieli (born 1965 in the USA) *Charles Quincy Ascher \\"Charly\\" Einstein (born 1971 in the USA) Education and career Einstein was not a serious student in high school, or even in his first two years of college at University of California at Berkeley. He excelled only in German language at UC. He enlisted in the US Army in 1954, and finished basic training at Fort Ord, near Monterey, California. He was stationed in southern Germany where he met his first wife, Doris Aude Ascher whom he married in 1954. Einstein credited the army for giving him self-discipline, and after discharge he applied and was admitted to Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. He followed in both his grandfather's and his father's footsteps to study physics at the ETH. When he obtained his diploma at ETH, Einstein returned to the United States and worked as an engineer for Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas. Einstein then moved to California and worked at Litton Industries in the San Francisco Bay Area. His area of expertise was electron tube technology, and specifically light amplification devices for night vision. He filed and obtained four U.S. patents related to light amplification technology while he worked for Litton Industries. In 1974 Bernhard moved back to Switzerland and worked in laser technology at the Swiss Army Research Lab in Thun, obtaining a further US patent.  References  External links  * Terry Kirby.

The interaction with the virtual keyboard happens mostly via a touchscreen interface, but can also take place in a different form in virtual or augmented reality.  Types  On a desktop computer, a virtual keyboard might provide an alternative input mechanism for users with disabilities who cannot use a conventional keyboard, or for bi- or multi-lingual users who switch frequently between different character sets or alphabets, which may be confusing over time. Although hardware keyboards are available with dual keyboard layouts (e.g. Cyrillic/Latin letters in various national layouts), the on-screen keyboard provides a handy substitute while working at different stations or on laptops, which seldom come with dual layouts. Virtual keyboards can be categorized by the following aspects: * Virtual keyboards with touchscreen keyboard layouts or sensing areas * Optically projected keyboard layouts or similar arrangements of \\"keys\\" or sensing areas * Optically detected human hand and finger motions * Online virtual keyboards for multiple languages that don't require OS settings change * Depending on which device the keyboard is used (desktop / mobile / virtual reality / augmented reality) On the Internet, various JavaScript virtual keyboards have been created, allowing users to type their own languages on foreign keyboards, particularly in Internet cafes. Multitouch screens allow the possibility to create virtual chorded keyboards for tablet computers, touchscreens, touchpads and wired gloves.  Mobile devices  Virtual keyboards are commonly used as an on- screen input method in devices with no physical keyboard, where there is no room for one, such as a pocket computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer or touchscreen-equipped mobile phone. Text is commonly inputted either by tapping a virtual keyboard or finger-tracing. Virtual keyboards are also used as features of emulation software for systems that have fewer buttons than a computer keyboard would have.  Historical development  PDA = Virtual keyboard on a Pocket PC PDA The four main approaches to enter text into a PDA were: virtual keyboards operated by a stylus, external USB keyboards, handwritten keyboards, and stroke recognition. Many early PDAs were not primarily focused on virtual keyboards. Microsoft's mobile operating system approach was to simulate a complete functional keyboard, which resulted in a slightly overloaded keyboard layout. The main problem that early PDAs faced was support for multi-touch technology, and as a result, usability problems for the user. = First iPhone = When Apple presented the first iPhone in 2007, the decision not to include a physical keyboard was seen as a detriment to the device. But Apple brought the multi- touch technology into their new device, which enabled them to overcome the usability problems of PDAs. Apple's virtual keyboard design pattern has become a standard on mobile devices today. = Implementation and use = Both most common mobile operating systems, Android and iOS, give the developer community the possibility to individually develop custom virtual keyboards.  Android  Android Keyboard Settings The Android SDK provides a so-called InputMethodService. This service provides a standard implementation of an input method, which final implementations can derive from and customize, enabling the Android development community to implement their own keyboard layouts. The InputMethodService ships with it on Keyboard View. While the InputMethod Service can be used to customize key and gesture inputs, the Keyboard Class loads an XML description of a keyboard and stores the attributes of the keys. As a result, it is possible to install different keyboard versions on an Android device, and that the keyboard is only an application; a simple activation over the Android settings menu is possible.  iOS  Apple iOS UIInputViewController Apple also provides the possibility for the community to develop custom keyboards, but does not give any access to the dictionary or general keyboard settings. Further iOS is automatically switching between system and custom keyboards, if the user enters text into the text input field. The UIInputViewController is the primary view controller for a custom keyboard app extension. This controller provides different methods for the implementation of a custom keyboard, such as a user interface for a custom keyboard, obtaining a supplementary lexicon or changing the primary language of a custom keyboard. = Text entry performance = Next to the classic virtual keyboard implementation Android, iOS and custom keyboards, such as SwiftKey for example, are providing different features to improve the usability and the efficiency of their keyboards.  Autocorrection and spelling checker  The Android platform offers a spelling checker framework that offers the possibility to implement and access spell checking in the application itself. The framework is one of the Text Service APIs offered by the Android platform. Based on provided text, the session object returns spelling suggestions generated by the spelling checker. iOS is using the class UITextChecker, an object used to check a string (usually the text of a document) for misspelled words, commonly known as Apple's autocorrection. UITextChecker spell-checks are using a lexicon for a given language. It can be told to ignore specific words when spell-checking a particular document and it can learn new words, which adds those words to the lexicon.  Word suggestions  Diverse scientific papers at the beginning of the 2000s showed even before the invention of smart phones, that predicting words, based on what the user is typing, is very helpful to increase the typing speed. At the beginning of development of this keyboard feature, prediction was mainly based on static dictionaries. Google implemented the predicting method in 2013 in Android 4.4. This development was mainly driven by third party keyboard providers, such as SwiftKey and Swype. Both provide powerful word search engine with corresponding databases. In 2014 Apple presented iOS 8 which includes a new predictive typing feature called QuickType, which displays word predictions above the keyboard as the user types.  Gesture typing  iOS and Android allow developers to replace its keyboard with their own keyboard apps. This has led to experimentation and new features, like the gesture-typing feature that's made its way into Android's official keyboard after proving itself in third-party keyboards. Research by Google itself confirmed that gesture-typing is increasing the typing rate by 22% and is decreasing the error rate near to 0%. Google further showed that the gesture-typing method is also useful on smart watches. Their scientific research is primarily based on research made by I. Scott MacKenzie and papers about modeling finger touch with fitts‚Äô law.  Haptic Feedback  Haptic feedback provides for tactile confirmation that a key has been successfully triggered i.e. the user hears and feels a \\"click\\" as a key is pressed. Utilising hysteresis, the feel of a physical key can be emulated to an even greater degree. In this case, there is an initial \\"click\\" that is heard and felt as the virtual key is pressed down, but then as finger pressure is reduced once the key is triggered, there is a further \\"unclick\\" sound and sensation as if a physical key is respringing back to its original unclicked state. This behaviour is explained in Aleks Oniszczak & Scott Mackenzie's 2004 paper \\"A Comparison of Two Input Methods for Keypads on Mobile Devices\\" which first introduced haptic feedback with hysteresis on a virtual keyboard.  Special keyboard types  Keyboards are needed in different digital areas. Not only smartphones need a virtual keyboards, also devices which create virtual worlds, for example virtual reality or augmented reality glasses, need to provide text input possibilities.  Optical virtual keyboard  An optical virtual keyboard was invented and patented by IBM engineers in 1992. It optically detects and analyses human hand and finger motions and interprets them as operations on a physically non-existent input device like a surface having painted keys. In that way it allows to emulate unlimited types of manually operated input devices such as a mouse or keyboard. All mechanical input units can be replaced by such virtual devices, optimized for the current application and for the user's physiology maintaining speed, simplicity and unambiguity of manual data input.  Augmented reality keyboards  The basic idea of a virtual keyboard in an augmented reality environment is to give the user a text input possibility. A common approach is to render a flat keyboard into the augmented reality, e.g. using the Unity TouchScreenKeyboard. The Microsoft HoloLens enables the user to point at letters on the keyboard by moving his head. Another approach was researched by the Korean KJIST U-VR Lab in 2003. Their suggestion was to use wearables to track the finger motion to replace a physical keyboards with virtual ones. They also tried to give an audiovisual feedback to the user, when a key got hit. The basic idea was to give the user a more natural way to enter text, based on what he is used to.  Virtual reality keyboards  The challenges, as in augmented reality, is to give the user the possibility to enter text in a completely virtual environment. One big issue is that most augmented reality systems on the market are not tracking the hands of the user. So many available system provide the possibility to point at letters. In September 2016, Google released a virtual keyboard app for their Daydream virtual reality headset. To enter text, the user can point at specific letters with the Daydream controller. In February 2017, Logitech presented experimental approach to bring their keyboards into the virtual environment. With the Vive Tracker and the Logitech G gaming keyboard it is possible to exactly track every finger movement, without wearing any type of glove. 50 of such packages were send to exclusive developers, enabling them, in combination of Logitche's BRIDGE developers kit, to test and experiment with the new technology.  Security considerations  Virtual keyboards may be used in some cases to reduce the risk of keystroke logging. For example, Westpac‚Äôs online banking service uses a virtual keyboard for the password entry, as does TreasuryDirect (see picture). It is more difficult for malware to monitor the display and mouse to obtain the data entered via the virtual keyboard, than it is to monitor real keystrokes. However it is possible, for example by recording screenshots at regular intervals or upon each mouse click.Lake Software: Does not defeat keyloggers! TreasuryDirect login screen, showing virtual keyboard The use of an on-screen keyboard on which the user \\"types\\" with mouse clicks can increase the risk of password disclosure by shoulder surfing, because: * An observer can typically watch the screen more easily (and less suspiciously) than the keyboard, and see which characters the mouse moves to. * Some implementations of the on-screen keyboard may give visual feedback of the \\"key\\" clicked, e.g. by changing its colour briefly. This makes it much easier for an observer to read the data from the screen. In the worst case, the implementation may leave the focus on the most recently clicked \\"key\\" until the next virtual key is clicked, thus allowing the observer time to read each character even after the mouse starts moving to the next character. * A user may not be able to \\"point and click\\" as fast as they could type on a keyboard, thus making it easier for the observer.

Vega was a standout high school football star, and was named to All-Section, All-conference, and All-county 1st teams his junior and senior year. A knee injury prevented Vega from playing college football, however, he did go on to have a successful career in the Insurance business before deciding on pursuing a wrestling career. Ephraim Vega was a freelance journalist, and wrote a column for Examiner.com/Kansas City, under general sports. Vega currently works in law enforcement as a Police Officer. Professional wrestling career=Total Nonstop Action Wrestling In February 2006 at Against All Odds, Vega debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as \\"Machete\\", replacing Apollo as a member of The Latin American Xchange (LAX). The LAX lost the match to The James Gang (B.G. James and Kip James) when B.G. pinned Machete. LAX went on to defeat \\"La Migra\\" on Impact! and interfere in James Gang matches until the feud came to a head when LAX faced The James Gang in a rematch at Destination X on March 12 but lost after Machete was pinned by Kip. Machete made his return to TNA on the February 15, 2007 episode of Impact! pushing Konnan, who at that time was using a wheelchair due to hip surgery, to the ring for LAX's tag team match against Shark Boy and Norman Smiley. Machete would play a major role in keeping LAX Tag Champions by interfering first at Against All Odds then again at Destination X in matches against Team 3D. Later at an Impact! taping, he assisted Homicide in defeating Scott Steiner and Brother Devon in a three-way tag match. Vega would also keep Voodoo Kin Mafia (formerly The James Gang) from winning the belts on Impact! by again interjecting himself in the match. Vega was also involved in the Belting Pot match between Team 3D and LAX, which would turn into a gang scuffle between LAX Latino Nation members and Brother Ray's Italian Brotherhood. He would work as LAX's enforcer for a brief time before deciding to take an offer from the IWA in Puerto Rico. Independent career Ricky Vega began his independent wrestling career working for teacher Johnny Rodz and his World of Unpredictable Wrestling (WUW) company in Brooklyn, New York. Vega would capture his first title while wrestling for the WUW and win its annual royal rumble-battle royal. The object is to throw all of your opponents over the top rope and be the last man standing consisting of 20 to 50 wrestlers in the ring at a time. His North American title reign was short lived however after Rodz found that Vega had begun working the Pennsylvania independent circuit without his approval. Vega and Rodz would work things out and Vega began working for Pro Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW). 3PW owner's Jasmine St. Claire and The Blue Meanie were introduced to Vega by Matt Striker Vega also began working shows for Afa's World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) around the time he began his stint in 3PW. Vega wrestled against such notables as Samu, D-Ray 3000 and Matt Striker. Vega was also exposed to his first taste of television exposure in the North East. Dynamite Championship Wrestling Vega made his way to Dynamite Championship Wrestling in August 2006. He debuted by defeating Viper. With the win he earned an immediate Heavyweight title match due to Hector Guerrero vacating the championship. He would go on to defeat Matt Bentley and become champion. Vega would later be stripped and the title held vacant setting the stage for a title tournament. Vega would defeat Bobby Barretta and JB Cool to move into the finals against Glacier. Vega and Glacier had developed a friendship in DCW saving each other on past events. The match seemed to be competitive and fair until Don Kiko Cabana came down to ring side and assisted Vega in regaining the title. Vega would go on to feud with Glacier for the better part of that year, until it all came to a head when they faced off in a Lumberjack match. Vega would again defeat Glacier thanks to Benny Blanco and Simon Sez, who due to Vega's win became commissioner. Vega would go on to successfully defend his title against Team 3D member Brother Devon with the help of Bill DeMott, which set up a tables match with Team 3D facing off against Vega and Demott. The match would prove to be Demott's retirement match, and Team 3D prevailed by putting Vega through a table. Coastal Championship Wrestling Vega worked on again off again for the Coastal Championship Wrestling (CCW) company in Miami from 2005 through 2007. Some of his highlights include a pair of victories over Shane Mclain and wins over Preston James, Bruno Sassi, Gino Carruso and a West Miami battle royale. Other highlights include match of the year candidate for a three-way dance featuring Kahagas and Jerry Lynn as well as a CCW championship loss to Shawn Murphy. Vega traveled and worked with CCW in Coral Springs, Ocoee, West Miami and Cocoa Beach. National Wrestling Alliance Ricky Vega began his stint with the National Wrestling Alliance in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in fantastic fashion. He defeated Cassidy O'Riley in record-breaking fashion. His thirty-second destruction of O'Riley was and is the quickest victory in the company's storied history. Later Vega earned the honor of wrestling at the Philips Arena in a tribute show to Ric Flair for his induction into the NWA Hall of Fame. During this time Vega also began teaming with Glamour Boy Shane in their run for the IWA tag titles and eventual split and rivalry with one another in Puerto Rico. Federation X Entertainment Federation X Entertainment, also known as FXE, began running shows in Orlando, Florida after a very successful run as a wrestling school once headed by Devon Dudley, Matt Bentley and AJ Galant. Ricky Vega trained many of Florida's independent stars of today there and helped mold them with the launch of FXE's Crush Live shows. International Wrestling Association On August 17, 2007 Vega signed on with International Wrestling Association (IWA) in Puerto Rico. Vega won his debut match, and went to defeat other wrestler's including Cruzz and El Bacano. During an IWA and National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) interpromotional show, Rob Conway interfered in a match between Glamour Boy Shane and Billy Kidman, prompting Vega to come out to save Shane. This marked the formation of The RS Express tag team, which consisted of Shane and Vega. The RS Express debuted against the IWA World Tag Team Champions The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas), but lost the match by disqualification after The Star Revolution Corporation and Los Aerios, two other teams contending for the tag team title, interfered. The RS Express received a rematch on Total Impact, the IWA's television show, which ended in another disqualification after Douglas hit Vega with the championship belt. In another rematch, Douglas hit Shane with the championship belt, but the referee was distracted by Orlando Toledo, the manager of The Naturals, and so was not disqualified. This resulted in The RS Express challenging The Naturals to a hardcore street fight for the tag team championship belts; however, The Naturals prevailed again due to outside interference from Tim Arson. As a result, a four corners tag team elimination match was booked between The Naturals, The RS Express, Blitz and Chicano, and Tim Arson and Big Vito, with the winner going to Las Vegas to challenge the NWA World Tag Team Champions. The RS Express were eliminated when Arson hit Vega with a fire extinguisher, allowing Douglas to get the pin on Vega. This incident set the stage for a feud between Vega and Arson. Their first match ended in victory for Arson; however, Vega won the second, setting up a rubber match. Vega ended the feud by defeating Arson. In the middle of a feud with Apolo, Savio Vega began having differences of opinion with Vega concerning Savio's actions towards Apolo. During a no disqualification match between Savio and Apolo, Vega attempted to stop Savio from further assaulting Apolo, as did the IWA World Heavyweight Champion, Blitz. Savio refused to listen to them; however, when Blitz turned to seek further assistance from Vega, Vega attacked him, forming an alliance with Savio. The rest of their newly formed faction came down to ringside, after Vega's former tag team partner, Shane, tried to stop the beating. The faction, later called Los Autenticos, attacked Shane. Vega later blamed Shane for costing him the tag titles and defeated him in a grudge match. In a rematch, which was billed as a Puerto Rican street fight, Vega again came out victorious, and earned a shot at the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship; however, the match was not a singles match, but a five-way dance, also featuring Blitz as the champion, Shane, Mr. Big from the World Wrestling Council and Bison Smith, who was representing Japan. The five-way dance occurred after a title unification match between Blitz and Big, for the WWC World Championship and the IWA World Heavyweight Championship, the first ever Undisputed World Championship title in the history of Puerto Rico, which Blitz won. Prior to the match, Vega began referring to himself as The Alpha Omega, claiming that the wrestling business begins with and ends with him. Vega won the match, and the Undisputed World Championship by pinning Blitz. He went on to successfully defend the title against Shane Sewell, Germ√°n Figueroa, Ray Gonz√°lez, Miguel Perez and Freddie \\"Blitz\\" Lozada among others. In April 2008, a real-life disagreement between Mario Savoldi and Savio Vega meant that the company stopped promoting events, until Savio was awarded the company and its assets after court proceedings. IWA returned to television in May 2008, and a tournament was held for a new IWA Champion. The final match was between Blitz and Chicano; however, Vega returned to the IWA with the title in tow. Vega had been thought to be on the side of Savoldi in his dispute with Savio, which was why the tournament had been set up. Despite this, Vega was entered into the tournament final, making the match a three-way dance. Vega was knocked out of the match by Savio, but later returned to the match as the special guest referee after Savio, the original special guest referee, was knocked out by Blitz. Vega counted out Chicano, making Blitz the new champion. He then aligned himself with Blitz and La Rabia, and challenged Savio for his RXW World Heavyweight Championship. Vega defeated Savio in a non-title match, but then lost the championship match after Savio hired a villainous referee to ensure his win. After the match, Vega was given an emotional send off by the fans perhaps sensing the end was near for high level wrestling in PR and opportunities for the company to import top notch American talent. During his time with the IWA, Vega was recognized as the Undisputed Champion of Puerto Rico, wrestler of the year and was elected as the best wrestler in Latin America during his reign.

The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later. Archaeologist Philip A. Barker gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from Wroxeter that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone. Overview The Arch of Constantine in Rome Dating of the reliefs on the Arch of Constantine The practice was common in late antiquity. Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures. According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester (one 7th century and one 10th) are thought to have been deconstructed so that their building stone could be repurposed by St. Wulstan to construct a cathedral in 1084. And the parish churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, and Upton Magna are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of Viroconium Cornoviorum. Roman examples include the Arch of Janus, the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the Arch of Constantine, the colonnade of Old Saint Peter's Basilica; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the Panagia Gorgoepikoos church in Athens); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in St Albans Cathedral, in much of the medieval architecture of Colchester, porphyry columns in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and the colonnade of the basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the hypostyle mosques of Kairouan, Gaza and Cordoba. Although the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for \\"spoliation\\" could not be found. Bell tower of the Trieste Cathedral Interpretations of spolia generally alternate between the \\"ideological\\" and the \\"pragmatic.\\" Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of \\"spoils\\" or \\"booty\\" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context. Spolia had apotropaic spiritual value. Clive Foss has notedFoss, \\"Late Antique and Byzantine Ankara\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 31 (1977:65). that in the 5th century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at Ankara, where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the Temple of Augustus and Rome. Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the daimones that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage. Liz James extends Foss's observationJames, \\"'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople\\" Gesta 35.1 (1996:12‚Äì20) p. 16. in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the 7th century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in Miletus, Sardis, Ephesus and Pergamum: \\"laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit,\\" James observes. \\"Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes\\".James 1996, noting O. Hjort, \\"Augustus Christianus‚ÄîLivia Christiana: Sphragis and Roman portrait sculpture\\", in L. Ryden and J.O.

The community is located along Meeker County Road 2 near its junction with State Highway 24 (MN 24). The North Fork of the Crow River flows nearby. History In the late spring or early summer of 1855, John W. Huy, Benjamin Brown, and someone named Mackenzie, all employed by a St. Paul lumber company, paddled a canoe up the Crow River to the Minnesota Territory‚Äôs west-central area, the Big Woods, in search of pine timber. Not satisfied with their findings, they returned to St. Paul, but Huy organized another exploring party, consisting of a young lawyer named D. M. Hanson (called the first Swede to visit the area), Dr. Thomas H. Skinner, and Rudolph Schultz (1825-1910). Late that summer, the explorers took off for the same area and in the fall they stopped in what is now Harvey Township. There they planned to start a new town and call it Kar-i- shon, Sioux for ‚Äúcrow‚Äù, which is what the Indians called the area. But, for some reason, they moved on to the present day Forest City area where they met Dr. Frederick Noah Ripley. They preferred this area, so Schultz and Huy made a dugout house on the banks of the Crow River where it made a junction with a creek, (section 13 of Harvey Township), and Huy stayed in it through the following winter to make a claim on the land. He thus became the first permanent white resident of the county. The others, except for Dr. Ripley, returned to St. Paul where Hanson went before the legislature and urged them to create a new county, which would include the area he had just visited. The legislature complied and established Meeker County on February 23, 1856. The county was named in honor of Bradley B. Meeker (1813 -1873) of Minneapolis, who had been an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1849 to 1853. Early in 1856, the settlers in Forest City were Milton C. Moore and Elijah Bemis (b.1812). Moore became Meeker County‚Äôs first Register of Deeds and Bemis became the county‚Äôs first sheriff. James Benjamin Atkinson, Sr. (b.1822) opened the first store in Forest City on March 1, 1857. It was also the first in the county. In 1862, Atkinson took on a partner, Mark W. Piper, who ran the store starting in October 1863 while Atkinson enlisted to serve in the Union Army. In 1866, after Capt. Atkinson returned, Piper sold his half back to him and Atkinson ran it until 1879. D. M. Hanson and John W. Huy, who were appointed county commissioners, met in the newly started Forest City on May 6, 1856, and organized the county on paper. Ripley, another appointed commissioner, was to have joined them, but he had frozen to death on March 3, 1856, by the lake in Litchfield that hence bore his name. William S. Chapman found Ripley‚Äôs body later in that spring. With the nearby Crow River for transportation, more and more people gravitated to Forest City. It was named the county seat because it had a river for shipping goods. The addition of the railroad through Litchfield changed the population makeup of the county. A referendum was held and, with the difference of only eighty-nine votes, they changed the county seat to Litchfield. So, Litchfield had the courthouse that was in Forest City. The old Forest City Courthouse was moved to 15 East Fifth Street in Litchfield in 1870. Litchfield Village Council President Jesse Vawter Branham, Jr. owned the building and he leased it out residential because the city decided it was too small for a courthouse. After all, it was only a small wooden house painted white. Many of the buildings in Forest City became buildings in Litchfield. One of those was F. G. Alvord‚Äôs blacksmith shop. Other new settlers to Forest City in 1856 were Walter C. Bacon, James Bramhall, Henry Clinton, Charles E. Cutts, Wait H. Dart, Isaac C. Delamater, Edward Fitzgerald, John Flynn, John W. Griswold, Loring Huy, Thomas Carlos Jewett (came on June 20 and was the postmaster in 1863), John W. Johnson, John Kimball, Charles McAron, David Mitchell. Mitchell, who had traveled from Maine by covered wagon with his pregnant wife Belinda was representative of settlers who traveled considerable distance to their new home. Additionally, John Patterson, John A. Quick, Rev. John Robson, Wyman Ryan, Charles N. Shed, Mathew Miles Standish, Judson A. Stanton, Samuel and Dudley Taylor, George O. Thomas, Ogden T. Tuttle, William H. Van Ness, Leander L. Wakefield, Jacob Weymer, Joseph Weymer, Sr., John Whalen, and John Wigis were early arrivals.. The first 4 July celebration took place in Forest City in 1856. On June 22, Rudolph Schultz, Charles Johnson, and James W. Quick brought a large tree pole out of the woods and raised it in Forest City. A small tin pan was washed and nailed on the top of the pole and the flag was raised up to it. The U. S. flag was made from a white cotton shirt furnished by Thomas Carlos Jewett (1827-1900), some red flannel underwear given by Sgt. Matthew Miles Standish (1833-1864), and a blue denim overall offered by John W. Huy. What took place at the actual 4 July celebration was never recorded. Sarah Jane Dougherty, daughter of Thomas Dougherty, was born in a covered wagon in Forest City on July 15, 1856, and she has been called the first white child born in Meeker County. She died in 1952. The first post office in Meeker County was started in Forest City on October 4, 1856, with Walter C. Bacon as the postmaster. He was succeeded by James B. Atkinson, Sr. The post office remained in operation until 1907. The first death reported was Frank Parsons on November 12, 1856. The first religious service was by a Methodist minister, Rev. John Robson, Jr., in November 1856. Rev. Thomas Hardwood was the first permanent pastor. New settlers in 1857 were Henderson Marsh Angier, James B. Atkinson, H. N. Baker, Jacob Ball, Gilbert M. Blandin, Benjamin F. Butler, W. S Chapman, David Poster Delamater (1828-1907), Milton Gorton, Thomas Grayson, N. O. Griffin, L. F. Haines, A. F. Heath, John Heath, Azro B. Hoyt, Jacob Knapp, Michael Lenhart, John and Michael Murray, Isaac Perrine, William Richards, Hamlet Stevens, John Sullivan, Allen Teachout, H. S. Walker, Charles and William Willis, James Willis, and W. W. Woodman. Forest City was platted in 1857 and was named for its location near the Big Woods. The first Catholic mass in Meeker County was in the plain cabin home of John Flynn and it was officiated by Rev. Father Alexius in 1857. Two years later, Father Benedict administered the last rites of the church to one of Forest City‚Äôs first settlers. Father Benedict has been memorialized by one of the windows in the Church of St. Gertrude. Dudley Taylor and his wife operated the first hotel. It was a large log building. The first schoolhouse (District 2) was built in 1857. W. W. Woodman was employed to build it at a cost of $250. The first teacher was Thomas Carlos Jewett. A creek in Litchfield was named after Jewett, who came to Meeker County on June 20, 1856. At different times, Jewett was the Meeker County Sheriff, the registrar of deeds, a Justice of the Peace, and a United States Commissioner to Alaska, appointed by Grover Cleveland. There were another 20 settlers who came in 1858 when Minnesota had just become a state. In 1858, John Robson built the first steam-powered sawmill near the village. Fitch and Stanton opened a store than he ran from 1858 to 1862. J. A. Baird had a brickyard (the first in the county) briefly in 1858. Thomas H. Skinner started a store in 1862. When the Sioux attacked in August 1862, Jesse, V. Branham, Sr., at the age of fifty-nine, was the only person, of the six hundred assembled in Forest City, to volunteer to ride his horse to St. Paul to get help. That‚Äôs about a hundred miles or more on horseback. His son, Jesse V. Branham, Jr., was a scout with Capt. Richard Strout and it was Jr.‚Äôs idea to build the stockade at Forest City. While his father rode to St. Paul, Jesse, Jr. rode around the county, like Paul Revere, alerting settlers that the Indians were attacking. On August 17th, on Branham‚Äôs ride, during the skirmish with the Indians, Jesse, Jr. had stopped to reload his rifle and he was shot in the chest. The bullet passed through his lungs and came out his back. He never fell and he was able to walk instead to his team of horses and go for help. He rode without medical attention for eight hours until he reached Hutchinson. Jesse collapsed at a farmhouse. The wound was cleaned by running a silk handkerchief entirely through Jesse‚Äôs body before the doctor, who was summoned, came. ‚ÄúI can do nothing for this man,‚Äù the doctor said, after taking one look at Jesse. ‚ÄúMake him as comfortable as you can. He‚Äôll be dead in three hours.‚Äù Obviously, he was wrong. Branham survived and became Litchfield‚Äôs first Village Council President. The stockade had been begun before the uprising, but it wasn‚Äôt quite finished when the Indians had begun attacking the settlers. Luckily, the majority of the stockade went up in one day, on September 3. There were logs close by that were going to be used to build the Forest City Presbyterian Church and a road. The settlers hurriedly put the stockade up with about 1200 logs. They planted a double row of logs on end, three feet into the ground and ten feet protruding out, approximately 120 feet square. Henderson Marsh Angier took charge of the crew that was putting up the timbers for the stockade. He also went on many of the expeditions looking for the missing settlers and burying the dead. That night, just after midnight, the Sioux snuck up on the Forest City Stockade corral to take the horses so that the settlers would be trapped inside the fort. They had no problem accomplishing their task except for Peter Lund‚Äôs Indian pony, which shied away from the Indians and started making noise. (Months before, the Indians had abused the horse and finally sold it to Lund.) The pony bolted out of the corral and headed for the gate of the stockade where an aroused sentry let the horse inside. Thus, Lund‚Äôs pony was the only horse the settlers had during the attack until help arrived later. About 200 to 250 Indians attacked at around three in the morning on September 4, 1862, and they were driven back in a couple of hours. While attacking, they resorted to burning and random shooting. Ten to twelve Indians were reportedly killed (one source says 3), and one soldier was injured. Henderson Marsh Angier was with a group outside of the stockade fighting the Indians and he was standing next to Alsog Olson when Olson was wounded. He helped assist Olson, and William Branham, who was also wounded, back inside the stockade. A state of siege existed at the Forest City Stockade for ten days following the Indians‚Äô initial attack. No one could come or go and the provisions inside were meek. A young man risked his life running through the Indian camp under cover of darkness to return to his home for a sack of flour. Surprisingly, he made it back to the stockade. Finally, on September 15, 1862, Capt. George F. Pettit's Company B, 8th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers Regiment, hastily organized in Faribault as the ‚ÄúGuerrilla Guards‚Äù, arrived as the first military organization to help in Meeker County and the Indians scattered. The Sioux left in three groups by the Manannah Road, the Greenleaf Road, and the Rice City (Darwin) Road. As they left, they stole livestock and burned one barn and six houses belonging to William Richardson, Milton Gorton, James P. Howlett, Dudley Taylor, A. B. Hoyt, William Richards, and A. C Smith. Over time, the stockade disappeared from a combination of the elements and the desire to use it for building logs or firewood for surrounding settlers. On September 12, 1976, a restored Forest City stockade was dedicated in a grand ceremony and it is now open to the public. The replica stockade is located 6 miles northeast of Litchfield and approximately ¬Ω mile south of Forest City on Highway 24. The first homesteader recorded in Forest City was Michael Flynn (Lot 2, Sec. 34. D.E.) on January 1, 1863. Recorded means he was the first man to go to St. Cloud and register his claim. The first Masonic Lodge in Meeker County started up in Forest City on May 18, 1867. The original Meeker County News was Meeker County‚Äôs first newspaper. Frank Belfoy started it in Forest City in the spring of 1868 with Minnesota‚Äôs first printing press. The paper was moved to Litchfield, where it merged with the Litchfield Ledger in April 1882, becoming the News-Ledger. Frank Daggett and Wellington D. Joubert had established the News Ledger newspaper in April 1872 in Forest City. That paper was also moved to Litchfield where it was joined with the Meeker County News. The Church of St. Gertrude was built in 1867. John Dougherty and others hauled the lumber from St. Cloud to build it. It was located north of the stockade and was moved in 1897 to its present location. It has been remodeled and enlarged. The cemetery, which is a part of the church grounds, is one of the oldest in the county and contains the marked graves of many of the earliest pioneers. Among the graves in this cemetery is the one of John Dougherty, who helped build the church and assisted in the internment of the victims of the Acton Massacre in the cemetery at Ness Church by Litchfield. Anna Crusoe (Mrs. Joseph Crusoe, 1859-1943) came with her parents from Sherburne County in 1869. Also in 1869, a house was moved to 114 Marshall Avenue North in Litchfield from Forest City. Adam Klass had owned the house in Forest City. It was twenty-five by thirty- six feet and two-stories high. It had been Klaas‚Äô saloon in Forest City and it became the same in Litchfield, plus a boarding house. It eventually served as a unit of the Exchange Hotel, which was next door to the north. The original house is still at that address in Litchfield today. Otis C. McGray moved his dry goods cash store to Forest City from Litchfield in February 1873. The Baptists built a church in Forest City in 1879. There‚Äôs a phenomenon that occurs on a hill not far from the Forest City Stockade. It‚Äôs just north of the town of Forest City. The hill has acquired the name of ‚ÄúIndian Ghost Hill‚Äù. The phenomenon defies gravity, or it appears to. Some people suggest there is a gravity anomaly or a magnetic vortex there. When you drive to the site and reach the top of the hill, turn your car around so that you‚Äôre facing north and observe that it‚Äôs downhill in front of you and behind you towards the curve in the road. Then drive back down the hill. Put your car in neutral, turn your engine off (or not) and release your brake. As crazy as it sounds, your car will be ‚Äúpulled‚Äù backward, back up the hill. The folklore that is told is that ghosts of the Indian children killed there push your car back up the hill as a warning to not think about building a home on that land, which was thought to be sacred by the Indians. Here are instructions on how to get there, if you‚Äôd like to try it: Take County Road 2 north out of Forest City, going over a bridge. Go 1.5 miles from bridge to 330th Street, turn right and go .5 mile to 660th Street, turn right again and drive up the small hill. The hill is just before the curve to the left. Turn around to face north and observe that it‚Äôs downhill behind you and in front of you. Drive about halfway down the hill and stop. Put your car in neutral and take your foot off the brake. The farther you go down the hill the faster you will be pulled back up the hill. References Terry Tales by Terry R.

History The coaching centre is largely funded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). As of 2012 (with the inclusion of Cardiff South Wales and Leeds/Bradford), they are one of six MCC University teams in England who are considered a first-class team when playing against other first-class sides. This means that a game against another university would not be considered first class; only matches against a first-class county are accorded this status. Durham are one of only two MCCU sides to be drawn from a single university (the other being Loughborough). The cricket coaching at the MCCU was overseen from its inception in 2001 by coach and former Test player Graeme Fowler, the university's head coach from 1996, until he stepped down in May 2015. Former Essex coach Paul Grayson was announced as the new coach in September 2015. The team's home ground is The Racecourse, Durham University's home ground since 1843 and famous for hosting Durham County Cricket Club's first first-class match in 1992. Since obtaining first-class status in 2001, the university has produced a large number of cricketers who have obtained professional county contracts, while others such as James Foster have gone on to play international cricket. Prior to first-class status, players such as Andrew Strauss and Nasser Hussain played for the university's cricket club. In 2012, they were dismissed for 18 against Durham County Cricket Club. This was the lowest first-class innings total since 1983. The former Durham University Centre of Cricketing Excellence played 27 first-class matches from 2001 to 2009. As Durham Marylebone Cricket Club University, the team has played fifteen first-class matches (not including one abandoned) from 2010 to 2016.

The game is a sequel to Strikers 1945 II, chronologically taking place 54 years after the first two games in the series.  Gameplay  F-22 Raptor battling Specter on the USA stage The player chooses from one of six modern jet fighter aircraft and shoots through eight stages (the first four levels are randomly chosen, and the last four remain the same for each play). Once the game is beaten, a report showing the statistics of the player are displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game (on default settings) begins with three lives, and an extra life is earned at 600,000 (or 800,000). When all lives are lost, the option to continue is given but the score is reset. Another latest feature is the Technical Bonus. During a boss battle, a blue orb is revealed as the weak point. In order to get a 'quick kill', the fighter plane must be extremely close to the orb until it turns red by firing the orb while getting it close to it. Once the fighter plane 'embraces' the orb, the boss is destroyed quickly and adds points for the technical bonus. However revealing the orb from the boss will only take once when it unleashes an attack pattern that is also its weakness. For players, they have to memorize the attack pattern and shoot the orb while getting close to it for a quick victory. Power-Ups are released by shooting certain enemies. When a power up is collected, the player's normal shot becomes more powerful and a secondary shot may become available to the player. Up to three power ups can be collected, any after that are worth 4000 points. It is possible to 'power down' at any time by colliding with an enemy craft. At the beginning of the game, the player has a stock of two bombs. By destroying certain enemy craft, a bomb icon will be released and bounce around the screen. When collected, another bomb will be added to the player's stock. The game featured the F/A18 Hornet, F-22 Raptor, F-4 Phantom, F-117 Nighthawk and the Harrier as chooseable planes, with the X-36 being available as a secret plane via dip switch configurations. In September 30th, 1998, during the development it was also revealed by Psykyo that the Sukhoi Su-47 was originally planned as a secret plane too, but it didnt make in the final product for unknown reasons. Plot 54 years after the end of the last game, an extraterrestrial swarm of microscopic robots, called \\"nanites\\", have invaded earth and infiltrated military bases in every country, including F.G.R.'s forces. All military vehicles infected by these robots became fully automated and began indiscriminate attacks on every country in the world, resulting in mass devastation. The small number of military craft that have not been infiltrated yet by the small robots have been recovered. A small combat force has been assembled to fight against the entire world.

They were bred to use their loud, deep bark to drive sheep. The breed is relatively new, dating from the late-19th century, and distinguished only on working ability. There is no prescribed appearance or lineage, but they are usually black-and-tan coloured.

The vast pastoral runs or \\"stations\\", such as those in the high country of the South Island, required teams of dogs who could work mustering for days on end, covering great distances on rough steep country. High country stations typically cover many thousands of hectares, and were often unfenced.Robert Peden.

This characteristic was liked by some farmers, especially for driving sheep on rough, steep hill country where a dog may disappear from view, making a dog that drives stock by sight less useful. Collies and other working sheepdogs with the barking trait would have been crossed with any other breed that had other desirable traits, including size, stamina and a steady barking ability, as these are the traits that differentiate the huntaway from the heading dog today, but the exact lineage is not known. The earliest references to huntaways are in the late 19th century. A sheepdog trial with a specific class for huntaways was advertised in the Upper Waitaki in 1870.

They are generally very healthy, but some inheritable diseases have been identified.Inherited Diseases of Huntaway Dogs, Massey University Centre for Service & Working Dog Health Retrieved 2 December 2016 They are intelligent, friendly, very energetic, active dogs that require a lot of exercise. They have been bred to muster in the hills and mountains of New Zealand where it is difficult to walk or ride, so worded commands and whistles are used to communicate commands to these dogs when they are at a distance. They are well known for being a noisy dog, especially when working. There can be variation both in appearance but also in nature and abilities depending on the bloodline, some dogs being more suited to large station work which requires them to eagerly run and give noise all day, some being a more laid back and \\"handy\\" dog with an instinct to head stock off and use noise only when necessary while still being larger and more powerful than most heading dogs. They are becoming increasingly popular worldwide with a New Zealand Huntaway Club started in Japan and huntaways being bred and used in Australia for work and yard dog trials.

It was founded by Abdolmalek Rigi, who was captured and executed in Iran in 2010. It is believed to have between 700 to 2,000 fighters and, as of December 2014, is said to be responsible for killing 154 and injuring 320 Iranian citizens since 2003, while Jundullah commanders claim the group has killed up to 400 Iranian soldiers. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by Iran, Japan,http://www.moj.go.jp/psia/ITH/organizations/ME_N-africa/jondollah.html New Zealand and the United States and it has been linked to, and taken credit for numerous acts of terror, kidnapping and the smuggling of narcotics. According to many sources, the group is linked to al-Qaeda. Background Jundallah is thought to have begun in 2003 and it is known for attacks against high-profile Iranian targets, both military and civilian. Its origin and structure remain unclear. It has been suggested that it might be an offshoot of Baluchi Autonomist Movement, which was created and supported by Saddam Hussein along with other militant groups like Mujahideen-e Khalq, to wage a proxy war on Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War.Political Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases By Alex Peter Schmid, Albert J. Jongman, pp. 582‚Äì584 There appears to be at least another militant organization with the name of Jundallah operating independently in Pakistan. Iran accuses the United States and other foreign elements of backing Jundallah, possibly from Pakistani territory with Islamabad's support, despite Pakistan's alleged history of cooperation with Iran to suppress trans-border militants, whereas Jundallah denies any connections to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as foreign governments such as the United States and Great Britain. The United States also denies any support or involvement with this group. In an October 17, 2008 interview aired on Al-Arabiya TV, its leader Abdolmalek Rigi stated the group had given \\"over 2,000 men\\" military, political and ideological training but that the number of its members \\"in the mountains does not exceed 200.\\" It has also been alleged that Jundallah is involved in smuggling Iranian diesel fuel to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the price of which is more than five times cheaper than the diesel fuel in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The diesel fuel is then bartered with opium, which is smuggled into Iran from Afghanistan and Pakistan to be sold in Iran. Terrorist designation Though the United States State Department under Hillary Clinton considered designating Jundullah as a terrorist organization in 2009, it wasn't until November 3, 2010, that it designated Jundallah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, noting that Jundallah \\"has engaged in numerous attacks resulting in the death and maiming of scores of Iranian civilians and government officials. Jundallah uses a variety of terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings, ambushes, kidnappings and targeted assassinations.\\" Iran hailed the decision. Views and goals Jundullah have been referred to as separatists by various media, and Iranian leaders have stated that Jundullah is proxy group used by the enemies of Iran to destabilise the Islamic Republic. The group's (now dead) leader Abdolmalek Rigi, however, always denied the organization had any separatist agenda, or foreign links, claiming that they \\"merely fight for equal rights for Sunni Muslims\\" in predominantly Shi'a Iran. In an interview with Rooz (an Iranian online newspaper), Rigi declared himself an Iranian and stating Iran was his home, and that he merely aimed at improving the lives of Sunni Baluchis in a democratic Iran. Dan Rather's US cable channel HDnet's television news magazine Dan Rather Reports, also interviewed Rigi and showed a video of Rigi personally cutting off his brother in-law Shahab Mansouri's head. In the same interview, Rigi described himself as \\"an Iranian\\" and denied that his goal is to form a separate Baluch state. He claimed that his goal is to \\"improve conditions for ethnic Baluchis\\", and that his group is \\"fighting exclusively for the rights of Sunni Muslims in Iran\\". In an October 17, 2008 interview aired on Al-Arabiya TV, Abdolmalek stated, \\"the only thing we ask of the Iranian government is to be citizens. We want to have the same rights as the Iranian Shiite people. That's it.\\" He described his group as an Islamic awakening movement but denied any ties with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. He also told the interviewer that despite the fact that \\"many of us have been martyred ... we are prepared to reach an understanding with the Iranian government, Insha Allah.\\" International sponsorship=United States and Israel A report by Brian Ross and Christopher Isham of ABC News in April 2007 alleged that Jundallah \\"has been secretly encouraged and advised by American officials\\" to destabilize the government in Iran, citing U.S. and Pakistani tribal and intelligence sources. The report alleges that U.S Vice President Dick Cheney discussed the activity of the group against Iran during his visit to Pakistan. In a blog, the network stated that the support was believed to have started in 2005 and been arranged so that the U.S provided no direct funding to the group, which would require congressional oversight and attract media attention, drawing parallels between American support for Jundallah and U.S. involvement in Nicaragua. The report was denied by Pakistan official sources, but ABC stood by their claim despite the denial. Alexis Debat, one of the sources quoted by Ross and Isham in their report alleging U.S support for the Jundullah, resigned from ABC News in June 2007, after ABC officials claimed that he faked several interviews while working for the company.Howard Kurtz, Consultant Probed in Bogus Interview, The Washington Post, September 13, 2007 Ross went on to say the Jundullah story had many sources, adding, \\"We‚Äôre only worried about the things Debat supplied, not about the substance of that story.\\" According to Ross, ABC had found nothing that would undermine the stories Mr. Debat worked on. However, he acknowledged that as the stories of fabrications continue to roll in, the network \\"at some point has to question whether anything he said can be believed.\\" This caused the network in 2007 to send a second team of producers to Pakistan investigating the original reports. Gholamali Haddadadel, Iranian parliament speaker in 2007, told reporters that Jundallah is part of pressure tactics used by United States to subdue Iran, and hoped with Pakistani help, Iran would be able to defeat Jundallah. On April 2, 2007, Abdolmalek Rigi appeared on the Persian service of Voice of America, the official broadcasting service of the United States government, which identified Rigi as \\"the leader of popular Iranian resistance movement\\" and used the title of \\"Doctor\\" with his name. This incidence resulted in public condemnation by the Iranian-American community in the U.S, many of whom are opponents of the Iranian government, as well as Jundallah. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed another report in July 2008 that alleged that US congressional leaders had secretly agreed to former president George W. Bush's USD 400 million funding request, which gives the US a free hand in arming and funding terrorist groups such as Jundullah militants. Three days after the 2009 terror attack against Zahidan mosque, Iranian speaker of parliament Ali Larijani claimed, that Iran had intelligence reports regarding the United States links with certain terrorist groups operating against Iran and accused the United States of commanding them. He also said that the United States is trying to start a civil war between Shia and Sunni segments of Iranian society. Regarding the investigation of the terrorist act he added that Iran would want Pakistan to cooperate fully and not become a mere part of the designs against Iran. According to a 2007 article in The Daily Telegraph, Jundallah is just one part of a Black Operation Plan involving psychological operations and other covert operations to support dissents among minorities (Baloch, Arab, Kurds, Azeris, etc.) in Iran, which along with tactics of military posturing, risky maneuvers and occasional conciliatory gestures are designed to improve United States bargaining position in any future negotiation with Iran. Furthermore, these Black Operations build upon a coordinated campaign consisting of disinformation, placement of negative newspaper articles, propaganda broadcasts, the manipulation of Iran's monetary currency and international banking transactions. Iranian Interior Minister Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi has said United States intelligence operatives have been meeting and coordinating with Anti-Iranian militants in Afghanistan as well as encouraging drug smuggling into Iran. A former Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army General Aslam Beg has accused the Coalition Forces in Afghanistan of training and supporting Jundallah against Iran. After Rigi was arrested on 23 February 2010, Iran's intelligence minister Heydar Moslehi at a press conference in Tehran claimed that Rigi had been at a US base in Afghanistan 24 hours before his arrest. At a press conference, he flourished a photograph which he said showed Rigi outside the base with two other men, though he gave no details of where the base was, or how or when the photograph was obtained. Photographs were also shown of an Afghan passport and identity card said to have been given by the Americans to Rigi. Moslehi also alleged that Rigi had met the then NATO secretary-general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, in Afghanistan in 2008, and had visited European countries. He said agents had tracked Rigi's movements for five months, calling his arrest \\"a great defeat for the US and UK\\". On February 25 Iranian state television broadcast a statement by Rigi stating he had had American support and that > \\"The Americans said Iran was going its own way and they said our problem at > the present is Iran‚Ä¶ not al-Qaeda and not the Taliban, but the main problem > is Iran. We don't have a military plan against Iran. Attacking Iran is very > difficult for us (the US). They [Americans] promised to help us and they > said that they would co-operate with us, free our prisoners and would give > us [Jundullah] military equipment, bombs, machine guns, and they would give > us a base.\\" BBC News carried a report on the statements, noting that \\"It is not possible to say whether Abdolmalek Rigi made the statement freely or under duress.\\" The US has denied having links with Rigi's group, Jundullah. Reuters also reported that Geoff Morrell, Pentagon press secretary, dismissed claims by the Iranian government that Mr. Rigi had been at an American military base just before his arrest. Morrell called the accusations of American involvement \\"nothing more than Iranian propaganda.\\" According to a former U.S. intelligence officer, Rigi was captured by Pakistani officials and delivered to Iran with U.S. support: \\"It doesn't matter what they say. They know the truth.\\" On November 3, 2010, the U.S. Department of State officially designated Jundallah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, thereby making it a crime for any person in the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly provide material support or resources to Jundallah. In January 2012, an article by Mark Perry questioned the validity of the previous allegations, asserting that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) \\"had barred even the most incidental contact with Jundallah.\\" The rumors originated in an Israeli Mossad \\"false flag\\" operation; Mossad agents posing as CIA officers supposedly met with and recruited members of Jundullah in cities such as London to carry out attacks against Iran. President George W. Bush \\"went absolutely ballistic\\" when he learned of Israel's actions, but the situation was not resolved until President Barack Obama's administration \\"drastically scaled back joint U.S.-Israel intelligence programs targeting Iran\\" and ultimately designated Jundallah a terrorist organization in November 2010. Although the CIA cut all ties with Jundallah after the 2007 Zahedan bombings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and United States Department of Defense continued to gather intelligence on Jundallah through assets cultivated by \\"FBI counterterrorism task force officer\\"; the CIA co-authorized a 2008 trip McHale made to meet his informants in Afghanistan. According to The New York Times: \\"Current and former officials say the American government never directed or approved any Jundallah operations. And they say there was never a case when the United States was told the timing and target of a terrorist attack yet took no action to prevent it.\\" On November 9, 2014, The New York Times published an article on the front page of its Late Edition, which states that an FBI counterterrorism task force officer by the name of Thomas McHale \\"had traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and developed informants inside Jundallah's leadership, who then came under the joint supervision of the FBI and CIA.\\" United Kingdom Iranian authorities also accused the United Kingdom of supporting Jundallah. In a BBC production \\"Panorama: Obama and the Ayatollah\\", a terrorist organisation which has carried out acts of terror leading to death of civilians and children in Iran is briefly mentioned but not named, with the official prosecution files and their Interpol warrants blacked out in video. The international warrants call for their arrest under international anti-terrorism laws, which has not happened and Tehran blames western governments particularly the British government for protecting them from an international arrest. Pakistan Jundallah is also actively involved and conducts terrorist attacks having linked up with other banned religious groups . Pakistan has worked with Iran especially during the time of the Shah in fighting many of the separatist groups in Balochistan. Pakistan's assistance in the capture and arrest of Jundallah's leader. Despite denials, a few Iranian MPs have often even castigated Pakistan's efforts in tackling the Baloch-based insurgency. Hossein Ali Shahriari, Zahedan's representative in parliament, rhetorically asked, \\"Why does our diplomatic apparatus not seriously confront the Pakistani government for harboring bandits and regime's enemies? Why do security, military and police officials not take more serious action?\\". It has been claimed, Jundallah can not operate with at least some degree of support from within Pakistan and that elements from within Pakistani security establishment, particularly ISI with financial support of Saudi Arabia and its supplementation through the largest opium black market in the world have woven a complicated web of drug smugglers and terrorists to project power in the region and beyond. General Hasan Firoozabadi of Iranian Army said, one of the main bases of Jundallah has been identified and pointed out to Pakistan and Iran is awaiting for Pakistan's action on the matter. In a rare criticism Iranian Intelligence minister after the Saravan attack claimed Pakistan is not meaningfully cooperating with Iran on the issue of Jundallah. At least some Iranian analysts believe this huge transnational web comprising economic, political and military dimensions is ultimately being run by CIA (Special Activities Division), aiming to topple or at least weaken Iranian government; with Pakistan just being a pawn much like the earlier United States support for Mujahedin against Soviet Union with collaboration of Pakistan. These analysts believe the ideological element supporting Jundallah and similar groups come from religious madrassah's of Pakistan supported religiously and financially by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia Iran considers Jundallah as a group connected to Taliban and their opium revenues, as well as receiving financial and ideological support directly from Saudi Arabia in collusion with other hard-line elements within Pakistan and Afghanistan. Others alleged that United States has long supported Low intensity conflict and assassinations with Saudi money, especially against nationalists, socialists, and Shias. American journalist Dan Rather has traveled to Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Sweden, and France investigating Jundallah and its funding sources. On the US cable channel HDnet's television news magazine Dan Rather Reports, he indicated that support comes from Balochis in Sweden where Radio Baloch FM is broadcast from Stockholm. Timeline=2005 Attack on Iranian President The motorcade of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was ambushed during his visit to Balochistan province, in which at least one of his bodyguards was killed and others injured. 2006 Tasooki Attack On 16 March 2006, four days before Iranian new year, Jundallah blocked a road near Tasooki and killed 21 civilians. A thirteen-year-old student on his way to new year holidays was caught in the crossfire. 2007 Zahedan Bombing On February 14, 2007, a car bomb and gunfire directed at a bus killed 18 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Guards commander Qasem Rezaei said, \\"This blind terrorist operation led to the martyrdom of 18 citizens of Zahedan\\" and attributed the attack to \\"insurgents and elements of insecurity.\\"Report: Bomb kills 18 Revolutionary Guardsmen in Iran The Washington Post Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack on 15 February. Iranian security forces also arrested five suspects, two of whom were carrying camcorders and grenades when they were arrested, while the police killed the main \\"agent\\" of the attack.11 Guards killed in Iran bomb attack Gulf Times Among the arrestees was Said Qanbarzehi, a Balochi, who was hanged in Zahedan prison on 27 May 2007. He had been sentenced to death at the age of 17 along with six other Balochi men‚ÄîJavad Naroui, Masoud Nosratzehi, Houshang Shahnavazi, Yahya Sohrabzehi, Ali Reza Brahoui and Abdalbek Kahrazehi (also known as Abdalmalek)‚Äîin March 2007, despite the absolute international prohibition on the execution of child offenders. Two days later on Friday, Feb 16 2007, Jundallah bombed a girls school in city of Zahedan and the leader of the group took responsibility for it on the official TV of MEK. Mass abduction Jundallah militants kidnapped 21 Iranian truck drivers near Chabahar on August 19, 2007 and brought them to Pakistan. Pakistani forces later freed all of them. Police abduction In June, 2008, 16 police officers in Saravan were abducted and brought into Pakistan. Jundullah claimed responsibility and subsequently demanded the release of 200 militants from the Iranian government. Some sources claim that one of the hostages was released in September, 2008, while others assert that all 16 were killed by Jundullah in December. Saravan Bombing In a rare suicide bombing in Iran, a car bomb was driven into a security building in Saravan, on December 29, 2008. The explosion killed four Iranians. Saravan Ambush On January 25, 2009, 12 members of the Revolutionary Guards were ambushed and killed by Jundallah near Saravan. Zahedan Mosque Blast A bomb blast on May 28, 2009 rocked a mosque in the south-eastern Iranian city of Zahedan as mourners participated in a ceremony marking the death of the daughter of the prophet of Islam, which killed 25 people and injured 125 others, less than 3 weeks before the Iranian 2009 presidential elections. The Iranian government promptly accused the United States of having financed and orchestrated the attack in order to destabilize the nation in the leadup to its presidential election. Two days after the attack, three men were publicly hanged for smuggling the explosives used in the attack into Iran from Pakistan. The trio were already in prison at the time of attack and had been tried for previous attacks by Jundallah including the 2007 Zahedan bombings. Interior Minister Sadegh Mahsouli said in a statement posted on the Internet that \\"those who committed the Thursday bombing are neither Shia nor Sunni. They are Americans and Israelis.\\" Abdel Raouf Rigi, the spokesman for Jundallah, claimed responsibility on a Saudi Arabian state owned TV channel, Al-Arabiya. 2009 Pishin Bombing On October 18, 2009, 42 people were killed in a suicide bombing in the Pishin District of Sistan-Baluchistan, including at least 6 officers in Iran's Revolutionary Guards, including the deputy commander of the Guards' ground force, General Noor Ali Shooshtari, and the Guards' chief provincial commander, Rajab Ali. Jundallah claimed responsibility. Capture of Abdolmalek Rigi On February 23, 2010 Iran captured Abdolmalek Rigi. Heydar Moslehi, Iran's minister of intelligence, claims Rigi was at an American military base in Afghanistan prior to his capture and was arrested on a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan, but this has been disputed. Other accounts report that Rigi was apprehended in Pakistan and turned over to Iranian authorities. On February 26, Rigi appeared on Iranian TV, claiming that the U.S. promised him financial and military aid to fight the Iranian government, which the U.S. denied. He was executed on June 20, 2010 in the Evin Prison in Tehran. Activities following Rigi's execution In the wake of Rigi's capture and execution, Al-Arab claimed that Jundallah named Muhammad Dhahir Baluch as his replacement. 2010 Zahedan Bombings On July 16, 2010, 27 people were killed in a double suicide bombing at the Jamia mosque in Zahedan. The blasts, timed 20 minutes apart to maximize injuries, are believed to have killed several members of the Revolutionary Guard. December 2010 Chah Bahar bombings Two bombs near a mosque in south-eastern Iran which killed an estimated 39 people at a Shia mourning ceremony. The Fars news agency said there were four bombers: two of them detonating explosives attached to their belts, a third was shot at by Iran's intelligence service; and the fourth was arrested.

Later, Seyyed Baqer Husseyni, Majlis member, said that \\"the October 19th crime was committed by the same people who removed the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO ‚Äì opposition group) from the list of terrorists and who train mercenaries and use them against the people. They are guided by America and Israel.\\" A Sunni group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying \\"We, the Mujahideen of Harakat Ansar Iran, proudly bring you the news of our first successful operation from our new series of operations code named Ra'ad (operation storm). In this operation, approximately 20 officers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (Pasadaran) were killed by an explosive-rigged van in the city of Chabahar, Iran, while one brother Mujahid, Hamza Saravani, was martyred.\\" Offshoots The Baluch militant groups Jaish ul-Adl and Harakat Ansar Iran recruited many members of Jundallah in their continued violent campaign against the Iranian state.

It became famous during the Dakota War of 1862. Today, visitors to the site can visit a rebuilt stockade and see volunteers in 1800-style dress illustrate period rituals and activities. A threshing bee takes place across the road in August. The site of the stockade is between Litchfield and Forest City near Minnesota State Highway 24. The following is a list of those who defended the Forest City Stockade in September 1862 who were mustered in on August 24, 1862 (names noted w/*) and known as the 'Meeker County Volunteers' by August 28, 1862.

C. Smith, J. B Atkinson, Milton Gorton, and a few others headed for Acton, held an inquest, and upon return to Forest City appeared that 'the whole community was in a panic'. August 19, 1862 - news of the outbreak on the Minnesota River arrives and A. C. Smith prepares a dispatch to the Governor, asking for good guns and ammunition. August 20, 1862 - At 6am, sends his message to Governor Ramsey with Jesse V. Branham Sr, the only volunteer of 600 people assembled to deliver the message. August 21, 1862 - At 1am, the message is delivered to Governor Ramsey, who then found George Whitcomb in Saint Paul and gave him the responsibility with 75 muskets and ammunition. Between the 18th and nightfall, 98 teams, mostly double, have left Forest City east to Clearwater, most teams having between five and twelve people with as much goods as they could pack in a moments haste. August 22, 1862 - 72 more teams left Forest City. August 23, 1862 - At 11am, Whitcomb arrives in Forest City by way of Hutchinson and finds almost everyone had deserted Forest City, and decision was made by the ones who 'Never left Forest City' to stay and save what was worth saving. August 24, 1862 - a military organization was started, with people coming back after placing family with loved ones elsewhere. The first mission was to go to Kingston on this day and round up horses to use, which they rounded up 33. August 25, 1862 - 27 men set out west for Monongalia County (northern Kandiyohi County) in pursuit of Indians, but buried seven people, and passed by ruins of three dwellings and a number of mutilated cattle. This returned August 27, 1862. August 27, 1862 - 11 men left west to the Manannah-Union Grove area to obtain stoves, bedding, provisions and stock, stopped at Wilmot Maybee's home and had dinner, then to Carlos Caswells, where plans were made to spend the night so they left a yoke of cattle, and proceeded to Silas Caswell's house and put bedding and provisions into the Maybee two horse wagon. At this time, David Hoar, Chancey Wilson, Moody Caswell, Thomas Ryckman, James Nelson, N.C. Caswell, and R.D.C. Cressy set out to recover all the stock they could. Wilmot Maybee and Joseph Page, in Maybee's team, and Phillip Deck and Linus Howe, in Deck's one-horse team, approached the Carlos Caswell residence again, but approximately 15 Indians were waiting, hidden behind a pile of lumber, and shot Page out of the wagon, Deck and Howe were shot at and killed within 350 feet, and Maybee, who ran his team 700 feet before getting cut off, left the team and ran for 500 feet before he was killed. Wilson and Ryckman were close at hand but could not render assistance as their weapons were in the wagons. The party returned to Forest City via Main Prairie, thinking it a safer route, that evening. August 28, 1862 - 24 men under Lieutenant Atkinson went to the Manannah Massacre scene to bury the dead (three of the four - Maybee was not found until the following spring). August 30, 1862 - 24 men started for Hutchinson for the 31 guns left there by Whitcomb, but seeing they still needed them, came back August 31 without them.

B. Todd was injured as someone's gun accidentally discharged.

Sivanandan, was a Sri Lankan and British novelist, activist and writer, emeritus director of the Institute of Race Relations, a London-based independent educational charity. His first novel, When Memory Dies, won the 1998 Commonwealth Writers' Prize in the Best First Book category for Europe and South Asia. He left Sri Lanka after the 1958 riots. Early career The son of Ambalavaner, a worker in the postal system who came from the village of Sandilipay in Jaffna in the north of the island, Sivanandan was educated at St. Joseph's College, Colombo. There he was taught by J. P. de Fonseka, who inspired him with a love of the English language alongside his native Tamil.New Left Review (Volume 60, November‚ÄìDecember 2009). He later studied at the University of Ceylon, graduating in Economics in 1945. He went on to teach in the Ceylon \\"Hill Country\\" and then worked for the Bank of Ceylon, where he became one of the first \\"native\\" bank managers.Quintin Hoare & Malcolm Imrie, \\"The Heart Is Where the Battle Is\\", in Communities of Resistance: writings on black struggles for socialism, Verso, 1990; and Louis Kushnick & Paul Grant, \\"Catching History on the Wing: A Sivanandan as Activist, Teacher, and Rebel\\", in Against the Odds: Scholars who Challenged Racism in the Twentieth Century, eds Benjamin P. Bowser & Louis Kushnick, University of Massachusetts Press, 2002. On coming to the UK, after a spell as a clerk in Vavasseur and Co and unable to obtain work in banking, Sivanandan took a job in Middlesex libraries and retrained as a librarian. He worked variously in public libraries, for the Colonial Office library and in 1964 was appointed chief librarian at the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) in central London. The library on race relations built up by Sivanandan was, in 2006, moved to the University of Warwick Library, where it is known as the Sivanandan Collection.Ethnicity and Migration Collections, Incorporating the Sivanandan Collection of the Institute of Race Relations and the Collection of the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations. Warwick, Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations. At the Institute of Race Relations In 1972, following an internal struggle at the IRR (in which Sivanandan was a principal organiser) with staff and members on one side and the Management Board on the other, over the type of research the IRR should undertake and the freedom of expression and criticism staff could enjoy, the majority of Board members were forced to resign and the IRR was reoriented, away from advising government and towards servicing community organisations and victims of racism. Sivanandan was appointed as its new director.\\"Race and Resistance: the IRR story\\", Race & Class, Volume 50, no. 2, 2008; and Chris Mullard, Race. Power and Resistance, London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1985. In 1974 he was appointed editor of the IRR's journal Race, which was renamed Race & Class. Under his editorship, Race & Class ‚Äì a journal for Black and Third World Liberation ‚Äì became the leading international English- language journal on racism and imperialism, attracting to its editorial board Orlando Letelier, Eqbal Ahmad, Malcolm Caldwell, John Berger, Basil Davidson, Thomas Hodgkin, Jan Carew, and Manning Marable, among others. Writing and publishing Sivanandan was regarded as one of the leading political thinkers in the UK. Most of his work was first published in the journal Race & Class. \\"The liberation of the black intellectual\\" (1977) examined identity, struggle and engagement during decolonisation and Black Power.\\"The liberation of the black intellectual\\" (1977). \\"Race, class and the state\\" (1976) provided the first coherent class analysis of the black experience in Britain, examined the political economy of migration and coined the idea of state, structured racism.\\"Race, class and the state\\" (1976). \\"From resistance to rebellion\\" (1981) tells the story of black protest in the UK from 1940 to 1981.\\"From resistance to rebellion\\" (1981). \\"RAT and the degradation of black struggle\\" (1985) made the crucial distinction between personal racialism and institutional or state racism. \\"Race, terror and civil society\\" (2006) showed new racisms, such as the attack on multiculturalism and growth of anti-Muslim racism, thrown up by globalisation post-9/11.\\"Race, terror and civil society\\" (2006). Changes in productive forces, especially the technological revolution, were themes taken up in \\"Imperialism and disorganic development in the silicon age\\" (1979) and \\"New circuits of imperialism\\" (1989)\\"New circuits of imperialism\\" (1989). Sivanandan's political non-fiction articles were published in a number of collections: A Different Hunger: writings on black resistance, 1982 (Pluto Press); Communities of Resistance: writings on black struggles for socialism, 1990 (Verso); Catching History on the Wing: Race, Culture and Globalisation, 2008 (Pluto Press).

It is situated in the valley of B√≠l√° Byst≈ôice at 840 m above the sea level. It has approximately 650 residents. At the beginning of the 16th century, mining pioneers settled in the area dominated by dense forest. According to a legend, a bear found silver-stones there. The legend is preserved in the coat of arms and also in the German name (B√§r = Bear). In 1532, a settlement called Peringer was raised to mining town status. The town received further privileges in 1559 and 1562. The predominant industry was mining of silver and tin. The area between Pernink, Abertamy and Horn√≠ Blatn√° used to be called Silver triangle. Following the Thirty years war, most of the protestant miners left to neighbouring Saxony. Mining was gradually replaced by forestry and specialized crafts (e.g. lace-making). In the first part of the 19th century, Adalbert Meinl founded a textile factory. Small workshop for manufacturing wooden and iron products were established. In 1843, the town had almost 1800 residents, living in 207 houses. The economic situation was bolstered by opening of a railway line Karlovy Vary‚ÄìJohanngeorgenstadt in 1899. In the inter-war period, number of residents risen to approximately 3500. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. After the Second World War, almost 90% if the inhabitants had to move to Germany. Hundreds of new inhabitants came in 1946. Following closure of uranium mines in J√°chymov, the number of residents decreased. Many houses are currently used as weekend cottages. At present, the largest single employer is the textile factory. Tens of inhabitants work in services related to tourism. There are several ski- lifts and marked routes for both cross country skiing, hiking and cycling. The tourists can take advantage of the high elevation of the local railway station (902 m above the sea level, the highest one in Ore Mountains and second highest in the Czech Republic).

It is dedicated to the study of complex moral and policy issues in biomedical science, health care, and health policy. Established in 1995, the Institute seeks answers to ethical questions by promoting research in bioethics and encouraging moral reflection among a broad range of scholars, professionals, students, and citizens. Contributing to its mission are four divisions of the University: the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. General information The goals of the Institute are declared in its mission statement: conducting cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research; training the next generation of leaders in bioethics; helping to prepare students and trainees for the ethical challenges of professional and civic life; informing the public about bioethical issues; and contributing to more ethical public policies and practices. The Institute is named after Phoebe Rhea Berman, who established an endowment for the Institute, saying, \\"The work that is being done there has great meaning for me and can make a real difference in society.\\" She and her husband, pioneering surgeon and best-selling author Edgar Berman, most notably went to French Equatorial Africa to work with Albert Schweitzer as extended volunteers. His work inspired her, and her commitment to the need for ethical considerations in medical and scientific decision-making was reaffirmed and strengthened. Jeffrey Kahn is the Andreas C. Dracopoulos Director of the Berman Institute, a position he assumed in July 2016. From 2011, he has been the inaugural Robert Henry Levi and Ryda Hecht Levi Professor of Bioethics and Public Policy. He works in a variety of areas of bioethics, exploring the intersection of ethics and health/science policy, including human and animal research ethics, public health, and ethical issues in emerging biomedical technologies. The founding director of the Institute is Ruth Faden, Ph.D., M.P.H. Dr. Faden is the author and editor of numerous books and articles on biomedical ethics and health policy including Social Justice, the Moral Foundations of Public Health and Health Policy; A History and Theory of Informed Consent; AIDS, Women and the Next Generation; and HIV, AIDS and Childbearing: Public Policy, Private Lives. She has served on several national advisory committees and commissions, including the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, which she chaired. Johns Hopkins University president William R. Brody had the following to say about the Berman Institute of Bioethics: ‚ÄúThe Berman Institute of Bioethics is the intellectual crossroads of the University and a wonderful resource for the nation. It is at the Institute that our diverse and specialized paths of inquiry intersect. No collective undertaking is more vital to the future of Johns Hopkins.‚Äù Programs Research and educational programs are the foundations of the Institute's activities. The Institute's programs are divided into five main areas of focus: biomedical research and discovery; ethics of clinical practice; public health ethics and health policy; research ethics and global health ethics and research. Biomedical Research and Discovery The Institute focuses on two main Biomedical programs: The Stem Cell Policy and Ethics Program and The Program in Ethics and Brain Sciences. With support from the Greenwall Foundation, the Institute's (SCoPE) Program, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering, focuses on ethical issues in the transition from stem cell science to clinical research, and from clinical research to clinical practice. Program in Ethics and Brain Sciences is formed in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Brain Sciences Institute, and focuses on the careful analysis ethical and social issues of revolving around brain sciences. Clinical Practice The Program on Ethics in Clinical Practice (PoECP) has been established to promote education, research, and service into ethical issues in clinical and medical practice at Johns Hopkins Institutes and beyond. Research in clinical ethics focuses on ethics at the end of life, ethics and palliative care, and improving the process whereby organs are solicited and procured. The Program is funded by Morkton K. and Jane Blaustein Foundation,Freeman Family Scholars Program, and The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Research Ethics The Program in Research Ethics addresses difficult ethical challenges in research involving human subjects in the U.S. and worldwide. In partnership with faculty of the Brain Sciences Institute, the Bioethics Institute seeks to define ethical questions in the exploration of the structure and function of the brain. Public Health and Health Policy Building on Johns Hopkins‚Äô leadership in public health and health policy, Institute faculty contribute to ethical and public policy questions related to HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases, rationing and the allocation of scarce medical resources, intervention in unhealthy life styles, and disparities in health outcomes among ethnic groups and globally. The Levi Leadership Program seeks to inspire intensive moral discussion about critical issues in health and social policy among those responsible for their resolution. The Institute works with the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies to explore ethical questions in alternative responses to the threat of bioterrorism, with a focus on smallpox vaccine policy. Academic Training The Institute also develops and evaluates innovative methods for providing young clinicians with an ethics education, and performs research in clinical ethics. The Berman Institute mentors trainees through the following programs: PhD concentration in bioethics and health policy, the Greenwall Fellowship Program, the Johns Hopkins-Fogarty African Bioethics Training Program; the Arts and Sciences minor in bioethics; the bioethics certificate, and various summer intensive courses in bioethics.

It uses a pre-recorded contour map of the terrain that is compared with measurements made during flight by an on-board radar altimeter. A TERCOM system considerably increases the accuracy of a missile compared with inertial navigation systems (INS). The increased accuracy allows a TERCOM- equipped missile to fly closer to obstacles and generally lower altitudes, making it harder to detect by ground radar.  Description =Optical contour matching The Goodyear Aircraft Corporation ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) system for the MGM-13 Mace was the earliest known TERCOM system. In August 1952, Air Materiel Command initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the MGM-1 Matador. This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from topographic maps. Preparation of the maps required the route to be flown by an aircraft. A radar on the aircraft was set to a fixed angle and made horizontal scans of the land in front. The timing of the return signal indicated the range to the landform and produced an amplitude modulated (AM) signal. This was sent to a light source and recorded on 35 mm film, advancing the film and taking a picture at indicated times. The film could then be processed and copied for use in multiple missiles. In the missile, a similar radar produced the same signal. A second system scanned the frames of film against a photocell and produced a similar AM signal. By comparing the points along the scan where the brightness changed rapidly, which could be picked out easily by simple electronics, the system could compare the left-right path of the missile compared with that of the pathfinding aircraft. Errors between the two signals drove corrections in the autopilot needed to bring the missile back onto its programmed flight path. Altitude matching Modern TERCOM systems use a different concept, based on the altitude of the ground the missile flies over and comparing that to measurements made by a radar altimeter. TERCOM \\"maps\\" consist of a series of squares of a selected size. Using a smaller number of larger squares saves memory, at the cost of decreasing accuracy. A series of such maps are produced, typically from data from radar mapping satellites. When flying over water, contour maps are replaced by magnetic field maps. As a radar altimeter measures the distance between the missile and the terrain, not the absolute altitude compared to sea level, the important measure in the data is the change in altitude from square to square. The missile's radar altimeter feeds measurements into a small buffer that periodically \\"gates\\" the measurements over a period of time and averages them out to produce a single measurement. The series of such numbers held in the buffer produce a strip of measurements similar to those held in the maps. The series of changes in the buffer is then compared with the values in the map, looking for areas where the changes in altitude are identical. This produces a location and direction. The guidance system can then use this information to correct the flight path of the missile. During the cruise portion of the flight to the target, the accuracy of the system has to be enough only to avoid terrain features. This allows the maps to be a relatively low resolution in these areas. Only the portion of the map for the terminal approach has to be higher resolution, and would normally be encoded at the highest resolutions available to the satellite mapping system.  TAINS  Due to the limited amount of memory available in mass storage devices of the 1960s and 70s, and their slow access times, the amount of terrain data that could be stored in a missile-sized package was far too small to encompass the entire flight. Instead, small patches of terrain information were stored and periodically used to update a conventional inertial platform. These systems, combining TERCOM and inertial navigation, are sometimes known as TAINS, for TERCOM-Aided Inertial Navigation System.  Advantages  TERCOM systems have the advantage of offering accuracy that is not based on the length of the flight; an inertial system slowly drifts after a \\"fix\\", and its accuracy is lower for longer distances. TERCOM systems receive constant fixes during the flight, and thus do not have any drift. Their absolute accuracy, however, is based on the accuracy of the radar mapping information, which is typically in the range of meters, and the ability of the processor to compare the altimeter data to the map quickly enough as the resolution increases. This generally limits first generation TERCOM systems to targets on the order of hundreds of meters, limiting them to the use of nuclear warheads. Use of conventional warheads requires further accuracy, which in turn demands additional terminal guidance systems.  Disadvantages  The limited data storage and computing systems of the time meant that the entire route had to be pre-planned, including its launch point. If the missile was launched from an unexpected location or flew too far off-course, it would never fly over the features included in the maps, and would become lost. The INS system can help, allowing it to fly to the general area of the first patch, but gross errors simply cannot be corrected. This made early TERCOM-based systems much less flexible than more modern systems like GPS, which can be set to attack any location from any location, and do not require pre-recorded information which means they can be given their targets immediately before launch. Improvements in computing and memory, combined with the availability of global digital elevation maps, has reduced this problem, as TERCOM data is no longer limited to small patches, and the availability of side-looking radar allows much larger areas of landscape contour data to be acquired for comparison with the stored contour data.  Comparison with other guidance systems = DSMAC  DSMAC was an early form of AI which could guide missiles in real time by using camera inputs to determine location. DSMAC was used in Tomahawk Block II onward, and proved itself successfully during the first Gulf War. The system worked by comparing camera inputs during flight to maps computed from spy satellite images. The DSMAC AI system computed contrast maps of images, which it then combined in a buffer and then averaged. It then compared the averages to stored maps computed beforehand by a large mainframe computer, which converted spy satellite pictures to simulate what routes and targets would look like from low level. Since the data was not identical and would change by season and from other unexpected changes and visual effects, the DSMAC system within the missiles had to be able to compare and determine if maps were the same, regardless of changes. It could successfully filter out differences in maps and use the remaining map data to determine its location. Due to its ability to visually identify targets instead of simply attacking estimated coordinates, its accuracy exceeded GPS guided weapons during the first Gulf War.\\"Image Processing For Tomahawk Scene Matching\\". Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Volume 15, Number 3. Geoffrey B. Irani and James P. Christ. The massive improvements in memory and processing power from the 1950s, when these scene comparison systems were first invented, to the 1980s, when TERCOM was widely deployed, changed the nature of the problem considerably. Modern systems can store numerous images of a target as seen from different directions, and often the imagery can be calculated using image synthesis techniques. Likewise, the complexity of the live imaging systems has been greatly reduced through the introduction of solid-state technologies like CCDs. The combination of these technologies produced the Digitized Scene- Mapping Area Correlator (DSMAC). DSMAC systems are often combined with TERCOM as a terminal guidance system, allowing point attack with conventional warheads. MGM-31 Pershing II, SS-12 Scaleboard Temp-SM and OTR-23 Oka used an active radar homing version of DSMAC (digitized correlator unit DCU), which compared radar topographic maps taken by satellites or aircraft with information received from the onboard active radar regarding target topography, for terminal guidance.  Satellite navigation  Yet another way to navigate a cruise missile is by using a satellite positioning system as they are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation system becomes inoperable. Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary. On the other hand, to be ready for a conflict with a technologically advanced adversary, one needs missiles equipped with TAINS and DSMAC.

He provides David and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), who are having an affair, somewhere to meet in secret. Barry later helps Cindy escape the UK when she is wanted by the police for the attempted murder of her husband, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Barry is the son of car dealer Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). He moves to Albert Square when Roy and Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) begin a relationship and move in together. Barry initially manages Roy's car business, Manor Wood, while Roy goes into partnership with Pat's son David by investing in his car lot in Walford. Problems arise in 1996 when Pat's former husband, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), returns and tries to reclaim Pat, his house and his business (the car lot) from Roy. Barry tries to frighten Frank away by hiring a man to torch the car-lot. When the arsonist is caught by the police, Barry is implicated and imprisoned. Upon his release, Barry is entrusted by Roy to run the car-lot on Albert Square while he enjoys retirement: the business is renamed Evans & Son. Barry is forever searching for the respect and pride of his father, but more often than not he succeeds in disappointing Roy. He risks the business and his family's savings by handing monetary assets over to con- woman, Vanessa Carlton. Barry is fooled into believing that Vanessa wants a relationship with him and, after persuading him to invest the money in a fabricated business venture in 1997, she disappears, leaving Barry to face up to a furious Roy. Barry's blunder forces Roy out of retirement and Barry is never able to regain Roy's full trust again. Losing his job at the car lot, Barry is forced to seek employment elsewhere and he uses malicious means to replace Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) as manager of the local film rental shop. It is around this time that Barry seeks the help of a dating agency to find a girlfriend. This leads to him meeting Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) who runs 'Romantic Relations'. The two grow closer as Natalie sets him up on several disastrous dates. After much bumbling from Barry, he eventually realises that he has feelings for Natalie and a romance begins. Natalie moves in with Barry, Roy and Pat and they marry in a millennium double wedding with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Barry and Natalie are happy for a while until Natalie discovers she is pregnant. Barry is overjoyed but Natalie is not and almost aborts the baby. However, Barry promises to help out with the baby duties so Natalie can keep working and in 2002 Jack (Samuel and Joseph Timson) is born. Barry has a turbulent time when his half-brother Nathan Williams (Doug Allen) comes onto the scene. Born out of an affair between Barry's father and Nathan's mother Jane Williams (Ann Mitchell), Nathan resents Barry for his closeness to Roy. Barry struggles to learn that his father had been unfaithful to his deceased mother and relations at the Evanses are strained. Despite attempts by Barry and Roy to make Nathan feel part of the family, Nathan does his best to exclude and diminish Barry. Things climax when Barry discovers Nathan has kissed his wife and, realising Nathan's agenda, Roy disowns him. When Natalie grows weary of marriage to Barry, she begins an affair with her former lover Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Natalie and Ricky plan to leave Walford with their sons but Barry catches them. Barry attempts to change her mind but Natalie is adamant their marriage is over. However, she opts to leave Walford alone, having discovered that her trust in Ricky is misplaced. In the aftermath, Roy discovers Pat has been aware of Ricky and Natalie's affair and has not told Barry. Roy is incensed and dies from a heart attack, brought on during the resulting blazing row. Devastated, Barry blames his father's death on Pat for cheating on Roy with Frank, which depressed and angered Roy. During an argument with Pat, she tells him Natalie never loved him and Barry trashes the house. As Barry is the sole beneficiary of his father's estate, he throws Pat out and leaves her with nothing. Barry spends a long time feeling sorry for himself and becomes reclusive. His employee Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), sensing an opportunity to make money, starts manipulating Barry. Helped by her secret boyfriend Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), she concocts a plan to make Barry fall in love with her so she can get her hands on Barry's wealth. Feeling vulnerable since his split from Natalie, Barry falls for Janine and they get engaged. When a mix-up at Barry's doctor makes Barry believe that he only has a short time left to live, Janine believes she will inherit all his money and agrees to a rushed wedding in Scotland. They marry but Janine is mortified when Barry reveals he is not dying after all. Barry forces Janine to go for a walk on the Scottish Moors but, unable to stand being near Barry, Janine verbally abuses him. She confesses their relationship is a sham and that she has been having an affair with Paul. Barry still wants her and says that he will forgive her if she stays with him. He begs Janine not to leave him and goes to hug her but she pushes him away. Barry stumbles before falling over a cliff edge and hitting his head on rocks, dying shortly thereafter. Janine inherits all of his estate while Barry's son, Jack, inherits nothing. Creation and development An early image of Barry in the 1990s.The character was originally intended to appear in four episodes, debuting in December 1994. According to Barry's actor Shaun Williamson, the character was originally conceived as a tall, blond haired man. Williamson was neither particularly tall nor blond, and after being called for an audition to read for the part, he thought about dropping out as he was not a physical match. However, the director stated that \\"nothing is laid in cement\\" with regard to the character, so Williamson went ahead with the audition. Williamson has said that Barry was meant to be a vehicle to bring his father Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) into the show, as Roy was being scripted as a new love interest for the regular character Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement); in Barry's first appearance he meets Pat to apologise for a dodgy car he had sold her, paving the way for Roy to be introduced to her. For the next year and a half, Barry made sporadic appearances, in Williamson's own words \\"popping in and out\\". When a storyline in 1996 saw Barry imprisoned for arson, Williamson has said that he was uncertain whether his character would appear again; however the character was brought back on a more permanent basis later in the year. In 1999, executive-producer Matthew Robinson decided to introduce a new love- interest for Barry. He decided to bring back a former character, unrelated to Barry but who had connections with several other characters in the serial. The character was Natalie Price, played by Lucy Speed, who had appeared from 1994‚Äì1995. The biggest storyline involving Barry and Natalie in 1999 was their joint double wedding with the characters Ian Beale and Melanie Healy (Adam Woodyatt and Tamzin Outhwaite) - the lead up to which included a hen/stag night celebration episode, which was filmed on-location in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The episode evoked criticism by the Broadcasting Standards Commission for its inclusion of ‚Äúalmost relentless drunken and promiscuous behaviour, sexual innuendo and drug-taking, before the watershed‚Äù, which included Natalie having to acquire three love bites from strangers. The BBC defended the episode, claiming that its content would have ‚Äúcome as no surprise to viewers‚Äù and adding that the depiction of this behaviour conformed to an EastEnders tradition - that questionable conduct \\"only leads to further trouble‚Ä¶One character's quest for drugs led to embarrassment and nausea and a drinking binge led to the calling off of [Barry and Natalie‚Äôs] wedding while the prospects for another became bleaker.\\" Natalie and Barry‚Äôs screen wedding was featured as part of the Millennium Eve episodes, which drew in 20.89 million viewers ‚Äì the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: \\"This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square.\\" The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical ‚Äúhaunt for New Year's Eve revelers‚Äù. In 2001, a pregnancy was written into the Evanses' narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed by the prospect of being a mother and planned to have an abortion. Viewers saw a ‚Äúdevastated Barry‚Äù react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) ‚Äì the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie‚Äôs saga and scenes between Steve Owen and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An EastEnders spokesman said: \\"We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama. All four actors give incredible performances.\\" The following episode Barry was seen to chase Natalie to the abortion clinic, where he persuaded her to go through with the pregnancy. The scenes between Natalie and Barry have been described as some of ‚Äúthe most powerful moments in soap, with the couple battling to decide the fate of their unborn baby‚Äù. Viewers saw Natalie and Barry‚Äôs marriage sour towards the end of 2002 when, in the New Year‚Äôs Eve episode, Natalie rekindles a secret affair with her former lover Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), which continued into 2003. Speed commented ‚ÄúNatalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry.\\" The storyline reached its climax in March 2003. On-screen Natalie's plan to abscond with Ricky were thwarted by Barry‚Äôs discovery of the affair, leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson has commented ‚ÄúBarry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can‚Äôt believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and would do anything to make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.‚Äù The storyline signified the end of the characters‚Äô three-year marriage. In popular culture In 2002 the character was featured in a spoof of the Michael Jackson hit video, Thriller, which was made as part of the annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Shaun Williamson (as Barry) played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed (as Natalie) took on Ola Ray‚Äôs role as his date. The spoof saw Natalie transformed into a zombie, as Jackson was in the original video. Several cast members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. Following his stint on EastEnders, Shaun Williamson had a regular role as a comically unemployable version of himself in the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant comedy series Extras, in which his career has bogged down partially as a result of the incompetence of his agent Darren Lamb (played by Merchant). A frequent running gag is that even Lamb is unable to remember his client's real name, instead referring to him as \\"Barry off EastEnders,\\" in reference to Williamson's EastEnders character. The character of Barry Evans has also been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show 2DTV. On 20 January 2017, EastEnders actor Jake Wood and Channel Four posted a satirical video showing \\"Barry\\" singing (Something Inside) So Strong at the inauguration of President Donald Trump on Twitter. The video actually shows Shaun Williamson performing at the 2014 World Indoor Bowls Championship in Great Yarmouth. In March 2020, Jade Thirlwall, English singer and songwriter, and member of the British girl group Little Mix, appeared in a FaceTime interview on Capital FM's Breakfast Show, wearing a 'Barry' t-shirt.

EcoHealth is an emerging field of study researching how changes in the earth‚Äôs ecosystems affect human health. It has many prospects. EcoHealth examines changes in the biological, physical, social and economic environments and relates these changes to human health. Examples of these changes and their effects abound. Common examples include increases in asthma rates due to air pollution, PCB contamination of game fish in the Great Lakes of the United States, and habitat fragmentation leading to increasing rates of Lyme disease. Recently virulent new infectious diseases such as SARS, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, bird flu and hantavirus have all been found to result from ecosystem change created by humans. These diseases have high death rates and very few effective therapies. EcoHealth is bringing together physicians, veterinarians, ecologists, economists, social scientists, planners and others to study and understand how ecosystem changes affect human health. EcoHealth strives to provide innovative, practical solutions to reduce or reverse the negative health effects of ecosystem change. History Ecosystem approaches to health, or ecohealth, emerged as a defined field of inquiry and application in the 1990s, primarily through the global research supported by the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa (IDRC), Canada (Lebel, 2003). However, this was a resurrection of an approach to health and ecology that can be traced back, in Western societies, to Hippocrates, and to much earlier eras in Eastern societies. The approach was prominent among many scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries, but fell into disfavour in the twentieth century, when technical professionalism and expertise were assumed to be sufficient to deal with health and disease. In this relatively brief era, evaluation of the negative human health impacts of environmental change (both the natural and built environment) was allotted to the fields of medicine and environmental health. One medicine, as championed by scholars and practitioners such as Calvin Schwabe, was largely considered a marginal activity. Integrated approaches to health and ecology re-emerged in the 1990s, and included one health, conservation medicine, ecological resilience, ecological integrity, health communities, and a variety of other approaches. These new movements were able to draw on a tradition that stretches from Hippocrates, to Rudolf Virchow and Louis Pasteur, who did not recognize the boundaries between human and animal medicine, and environmental and social change; to William Osler, who was a member of both the McGill medical faculty and the Montreal Veterinary College; Calvin Schwabe, whose 1984 book, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, is a classic in the field; and James Steele, who founded the first veterinary public health unit in the United States. Ecohealth approaches as currently practiced are participatory, systems-based approaches to understanding and promoting health and wellbeing in the context of social and ecological interactions. What differentiates these approaches from earlier integrative attempts is a firm grounding in complexity theories and post-normal science (Waltner-Toews, 2004; Waltner- Toews et al., 2008). While a variety of organizations promote integrative approaches such as One Health, the primary funder and promoter of ecohealth in particular, world-wide, is the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa (https://web.archive.org/web/20100126030738/http://www.idrc.ca/ecohealth/). After a decade of international conferences in North America and Australia under the more contentious umbrella of \\"ecosystem health\\", the first \\"ecosystem approach to human health\\" (ecohealth) forum was held in Montreal in 2003, followed by conferences and forums in Wisconsin, U.S., and M√©rida, Mexico, all with major support from IDRC. Since then the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the journal Ecohealth have established the field as a legitimate scholarly and development activity (www.ecohealth.net). Differences EcoHealth studies differ from traditional, single discipline studies. A traditional epidemiological study may show increasing rates of malaria in a region, but not address how or why the rate is increasing. An environmental health study may recommend the spraying of a pesticide in certain amounts in certain areas to reduce spread. An economic analysis may calculate the cost and effectiveness per dollar spent on such a program. An EcoHealth study uses a different approach. It brings the multiple specialist disciplines together with members of the affected community before the study begins. Through pre-study meetings the group shares knowledge and adopts a common language. These pre-study meetings often lead to creative and novel approaches and can lead to a more \\"socially robust\\" solution. EcoHealth practitioners term this synergy transdisciplinarity, and differentiate it from multidiscipline studies. EcoHealth studies also value participation of all involved groups, including decision makers and believe issues of equity (between gender, socioeconomic classes, age and even species) are important to fully understand the problem to be studied. Jean Lebel (2003) phrased transdisciplinarity, participation and equity the three pillars of EcoHealth (Lebel, 2003). The IDRC now speaks of six principles, instead of three pillars, namely transdisciplinarity, participation, gender and social equity, system-thinking, sustainability and research-to-action (Charron, 2011). Examples A short example of a transdisciplinary study in the field of EcoHealth appears below. This is excerpted from HEALTH: An Ecosystem Approach, by Jean Lebel. (IDRC 2003, .) > ‚ÄúIn Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s, close to 24 000 of the 2.4 million people > who caught malaria every year died as a result. Massive use of the powerful > insecticide DDT was the linchpin of the government's effort to eradicate the > disease. Over time, some progress was made against malaria, but the war was > far from won. The use of DDT also posed its own threats to the health of the > ecosystem. Moreover, as required by the North American Free Trade Agreement, > Mexico had to completely eliminate the use of DDT by 2002. To meet this > challenge, an EcoHealth research project was set up to pool the knowledge of > a team of specialists in epidemiology, computer science, entomology, and > social sciences, from both government and academia. This team has > accumulated volumes of information about the prevalence of malaria in 2 000 > villages. Data from powerful geographical information systems enabled them > to conclude that mosquitoes do not travel very much. \\"If you have a place to > lay your eggs and feed yourself, why go elsewhere?\\" explains Mario Henry > Rodriguez, Director of Research on Infectious Diseases at the National > Institute for Public Health (NIPH). In addition, as confirmed by Juan > Eugenio Hern√°ndez, NIPH's Director of Informatics, it is now believed that > \\"human beings are the vectors of malaria,\\" which explains why more cases of > malaria are found in villages located alongside roads.‚Äù With community help, > the team studied the population's living conditions, including behavioural > differences between men and women. It was found that while women are more > likely to be bitten by mosquitoes early in the morning when they go to fetch > water, the men are likely to be bitten in the coffee plantations at night. > Several preventive actions have been taken. The scientists have proposed a > new insecticide that, unlike DDT, does not persist in the environment. They > have also developed a more effective pump that can spray 40 homes a day > instead of 8, and uses less insecticide. A new malaria testing kit now > detects the presence or absence of parasites in a patient's blood in only a > few minutes, unlike laboratory tests that take three to four weeks to > confirm a diagnosis. Previously, the need to wait for test results forced > the authorities to treat everyone who showed vague symptoms of the illness, > such as a high fever or headaches. Now, volunteers administer these tests to > the people in close to 60 villages. \\"We have given communities the means to > take care of themselves,\\" says Mario Rodriguez. The fight against malaria in > Mexico is now no longer solely the responsibility of government employees. > Women also play a role by removing, every two weeks, the algae that harbour > mosquito larvae in bodies of water. As a result, the number of cases of > malaria in the state of Oaxaca has dropped from 15 000 in 1998 to only 400 > today ‚Äî and all without using any DDT. \\"Our experience has taught us that we > need to bolster the social science research component if we want to extend > this program to other parts of the country, while maintaining it in Oaxaca. > The challenge is to draw the lessons that will lead to application of the > program on a much wider scale,\\" says Dr Rodriguez.‚Äù This study reveals both the nature of the complex interactions of the problem and the extent to which a successful solution must cross research disciplines. The solution involved creative thinking on the part of many individuals, and produced a win-win situation for researchers, business and most importantly, for the community. Although many of the dramatic effects of ecosystem change and much of the research is focused in developing countries, the ecosystem of the built environment in urban areas of the developed world is also a major determinant of human health. Obesity, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease are all directly related to how humans interact with the local urban ecosystem in which they live. Urban design and planning determine car use, food choices available, air pollution levels and the safety and walkability of the neighborhoods in which people live. Other examples of the EcoHealth approach can be found in Linking Social and Ecological Systems: Management Practice and Social Mechanisms for Building Resilience, edited by Fikrit Berkes and Carl Folke (1998, Cambridge University Press, ) and Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, edited by Lance H. Gunderson and C. S. Holling (2002, Island Press, ). EcoHealth 101: education for ecosystem approaches Courses in ecosystem approaches to health have been developed and delivered in several North American and Australian universities. One innovative Canadian course involved a collaboration of all of Canada's veterinary colleges, and focused on integrative field cases in all parts of the country; another Canadian course was a joint effort of the medical school at the University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. In the years after 2003, communities of practice for ecosystem approaches to health in Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa (largely supported by the IDRC) created intensive graduate level courses that integrated systems approaches with participatory approaches, and used actual case studies so that students gained applied clinical experience in \\"transdisciplinary\\" problem solving (see www.copeh-canada.org for one example). CoPEH-Canada organizes a yearly professional development and graduate level intensive training course in ecosystem approaches to health and have created a teaching manual with much of their material which is free on their site in English, French and Spanish (www.copeh-canada.org). Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison created a website to promote education in this area EcoHealth (Environmental Change and Our Health). The website examines the changes that are transforming Earth and what they can mean for our health. This website is geared to middle-school students and their teachers, and delivers scientific information in a kid-friendly, engaging, and visually vibrant manner. Since its initial partnership with the Journey to Planet Earth television mini-series, hosted and narrated by actor Matt Damon and aired on PBS in Spring 2003 and 2004, the website has become an educational complement to this TV series, as well as a dynamic stand-alone tool for students and teachers. Since then, the site's appeal has grown far broader, reaching high- school students, and anyone interested in environmental and health issues‚Äîor simply wanting a reliable and fun resource for being able to sort the science from the sound bites. EcoHealth 101 provides the in-depth analysis and context behind today's headline news. \\"The idea for the site grew from the positive feedback following public lectures I've given on global environmental health\\", says Dr. Jonathan Patz, associate professor at the University of Wisconsin & adjunct associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \\"'Students should really learn about how their health is tied so closely to the global environment,' was the comment I often heard.\\" \\"The site is very exciting because it deals with serious and thought-provoking topics\\", adds Dr. Patz. \\"Nonetheless, it shows middle-school students how to have fun with the visual elements and discover what potential solutions exist for alleviating the negative effects of climate change and other changes to our planet.\\" In a rapidly changing world, our school curriculum must expand to include accurate science on global warming, environmental degradation, and its negative effects on human, wildlife and ecosystem health. The mission of EcoHealth 101 is to educate and inform the next generation of leaders who may have the answers to today's problems. Chapters from the website include Global Warming, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, The Balance of Nature, Modern Agriculture and Drinking Water, and Globalization and Disease Without Borders. The site was reviewed for accuracy and fairness by science, health, and environmental experts in a wide range of specialties. Visit http://ecohealth101.org.

They took place in 1988, 1990 and 1992. Each lasted for 27 hours and all were hosted by Michael Aspel. The final telethon in July 1992 raised ¬£15,012,989. Thames Telethon (1980 & 1985) The ITV Telethon originated from the 10-hour Thames Telethon, which ran in the Thames/London ITV region only, on 2 October 1980, one month before the BBC's Children In Need appeal the same year. Thames broadcast another Telethon on 29‚Äì30 October 1985. ITV Telethon (1988‚Äì1992) The US-style continuous broadcast raised ¬£1.25 million, and was considered such a success that a 27-hour marathon was broadcast across the entire network over 29 and 30 May 1988 (a Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday), involving participation and input from all of the regional broadcasters around the country. It had the aim of raising money for disability charities across the United Kingdom. A further two ITV Telethons followed in 1990 (across Sunday 27 May and Monday 28 May) and 1992 (across Saturday 18 July and Sunday 19 July), raising ¬£24m and ¬£15m respectively. Michael Aspel was the frontman for all three. Telethon helped thousands of charities in the UK. Many local ITV companies like Tyne Tees Television and Television South West contributed from company profits. In the TVS region alone, TVS donated ¬£1 million from its own charity, the TVS Trust in late May 1990. Like the telethons in the US, the ITV Telethons also offered regional cut-ins by ITV companies all over the country, featuring personalities and local celebrities from that region such as Richard Whiteley for Yorkshire Television or Ruth Madoc for HTV Wales. One regional cut-in for the 1992 Telethon took place in the grounds outside Granada TV, Quay Street studio, and a non stop 27-hour live stage presentation 'The Blackpool Roadshow' was gifted and coordinated by brother and sister Shirley Pearson and Johnnie Doolan. Amongst the many stage appearances was reportedly the first ever live set from the later famous band Oasis with guest appearances from chart topping artists, and choreographed sets from Blackpool show - Mystique. Bisto gravy powder drums and packets sponsored the event.  Protests and closure  The 1990 and 1992 ITV Telethons were subject to protests organised by Block Telethon, an informal protest group of disabled people that believed that the telethons reinforced negative stereotypes of disabled people. The 1990 protest was modestly attended, whereas the 1992 protest with over 1000 disabled people outside the LWT studios on the South Bank was credited with ending the Telethon series, and indirectly leading to developments such as Comic Relief. This protest group Block Telethon formally became the Disabled People's Direct Action Network in 1993, which campaigned with other organisations against discrimination and for civil rights, leading up to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.

The college was founded in 1846 and was incorporated by royal charter as The College of Preceptors in 1849. A supplemental charter was granted in 1998 changing the College's name to The College of Teachers. A further supplemental charter granted in 2017 changed the college's name to The Chartered College of Teaching, updated its objects and gave it the right to award the professional status of Chartered Teacher (CTeach). The college's patron is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. History The college was founded in 1846 by a group of private schoolmasters from Brighton who were concerned about standards within their profession.ArchiveOur history The College of Teachers A provisional committee was set up in early 1846 under the chairmanship of Henry Stein Turrell (1815‚Äì1863), principal of the Montpelier House School in Brighton. After meetings in London and Brighton a general meeting was held at the Freemason's Tavern in Great Queen Street, London, on 20 June 1846. Some 300 schoolmasters attended, some 60 members enrolled and founding resolutions were passed, including: :That in the opinion of this meeting, it is desirable for the protection of the interests of both the scholastic profession and the public, that some proof of qualification, both as to the amount of knowledge and the art of conveying it to others, should be required, from and after a certain time to be hereinafter specified, of all persons who may be desirous of entering the profession; and that the test, in the first instance, should be applied to Assistant Masters only. :That in the opinion of this meeting, the test of qualification should be referred to a legally authorised or corporate body, or college, consisting of persons engaged in tuition. :That for the purpose of effecting this object ‚Äì viz., the formation of a corporate body ‚Äì the members of the profession who enrol their names at this meeting, do resolve themselves, and are hereby resolved, into the College of Preceptors; and that those persons now enrolled, shall incur no liability beyond the amount of their respective annual subscriptions. :That a Council, consisting of the members of the Provisional Committee, with power to add to their number, be now appointed for the purpose of conducting the business of the institution, and that Mr Turrell be appointed President of the Council. The college created a system for the formal examination and qualification of secondary school teachers. It was also one of the first bodies to examine and provide certificates for secondary school pupils of both sexes, from all over England and Wales, in a wide variety of subjects. In 1873 it became the first institution to appoint Professors of Education, During the 1870s the college helped to establish education as a subject worthy of study at university level, resulting in the appointment of Joseph Payne as the first Professor of Education in 1873. The power to appoint Professors of Education is recognised in the college's current royal charter. Frances Buss (1827‚Äì1894) and Sir John Adams (1857‚Äì1934) were also connected to the college. During the 1950s the college pioneered management training schemes for teachers (at the time these were known as school administration courses).

This enzyme is useful for transcript mapping, removal of single-stranded regions in DNA hybrids or single-stranded overhangs produced by restriction enzymes, etc. It has an activity similar to Nuclease S1 (both are EC 3.1.30.1), but it has higher specificity for single-stranded molecules. The enzyme degrades single-stranded DNA or RNA to nucleoside 5‚Äô-monophosphates, but does not digest double-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, or DNA / RNA hybrids. Mung Bean Nuclease catalyzes the specific degradation of single-stranded DNA or RNA, and produces mono and oligonucleotides carrying a 5‚Ä≤-P terminus. Mung bean nuclease has a stringent single-stranded specificity for DNA or RNA. Mung bean nuclease has an estimated molecular weight of 39 kDa by SDS-PAGE. A glycoprotein, 29% of this mass is sugars. , the specific gene encoding for this protein is unknown, and all production relies on a purification process on bean sprouts from 1980. Some is known about its structure, with one exposed Cysteine residue and 3 pairs of disulfide bonds. Some is known about its amino acid composition. Requirements Mung bean nuclease requires Zn2+. The addition of EDTA or SDS causes irreversible inactivation. Mung bean nuclease is not active at pH below 4.6, nor at low salt concentration.  Description  Nuclease MB is a specific DNA and RNA exo-endonuclease which will degrade single-stranded extensions from the ends of DNA and RNA molecules, leaving blunt, ligatable ends. Its higher single-strand specificity makes it the enzyme of choice for most applications requiring a single-strand-specific nuclease. Unlike S1 Nuclease, Mung Bean Nuclease will not cleave the intact strand of nicked duplex DNA. Its ability to recognise double-stranded nucleic acids depends on the base sequence. It tends to cleave at ApN and at T(U) pN. It completely degrades ApA, but does not degrade G and C. Unlike S1 Nuclease, it does not cleave the strand opposite to that which has been nicked. Mung Bean Nuclease catalyzes the specific degradation of single-stranded DNA or RNA, and produces mono- and oligonucleotides carrying a 5‚Ä≤-P terminus. More than 1000- fold amount of enzyme can degrade oligomer into all mononucleotides. An excess of the enzyme is required to degrade double-stranded DNA or RNA and DNA-RNA hybrids, and in this case, AT-rich regions are selectively degraded. This enzyme work well at A‚ÜìpN, T ‚ÜìpN sites, and especially A‚ÜìpN sites are 100% degraded. However, it is difficult to degrade C‚ÜìpC, C‚ÜìpG site. Mung bean exonuclease is a nuclease derived from mung beans that removes nucleotides in a step-wise manner from single stranded DNA molecules and is used to remove such ssDNA from a mixture also containing double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Unit Definition: One unit of Mung Bean Nuclease converts 1 ¬µg of heat-denatured calf thymus DNA into an acid-soluble form in 1 minute at 37 ¬∞C under standard assay conditions.  Applications in biotechnology and biochemical research  * Removal of hairpin loops during cDNA synthesis. * High-resolution mapping of the termini and exon structures of RNA transcripts (commonly termed Berk-Sharp or S1 Mapping) using either internal-labelled or end-labelled probes. * Restriction-site modification or removal by digestion of single-stranded protruding ends. * Cleavage of single-basepair mismatches, as a replacement for CEL 1 Nuclease in TILLING. * Unidirectional deletion of large DNA (in combination with Exonuclease III) to generate ordered deletions for sequencing. * Removal of 3¬¥ and 5¬¥ extensions from DNA or RNA termini. * Transcriptional mapping. * Cleavage of hairpin loops. * Excision of gene coding sequences from genomic DNA.

It was the second episode to be produced, and first aired on 16 December 1963, during the first season. The storyline involves a team of scientists who use an incredibly strong magnetic field to open a door to another dimension. Opening narrationPlot In an accident, Professor Ian Fraser encounters a magnetic field that reverses the form of living matter. When his hand is caught in the strong magnetic field, it is altered, becoming a mirror of itself. Realizing the importance of magnetic fields, Fraser theorizes that a much stronger magnetic field has the potential to open a door into another world. Knowing the cost, Fraser approaches Dwight Hartley, a wealthy magnate grieving over the loss of his son. At a dinner party given by the millionaire, Fraser, his wife and colleague Eva, and another colleague watch as Mrs. Palmer, a medium, appears to contact Hartley's dead son. However, Fraser exposes her as a fraud. After Hartley angrily dismisses Palmer, Fraser reveals his discovery. Hartley appears skeptical, until Fraser shows that his left hand, the hand that had been caught in the electrical field, has now become a right hand. Hoping that Fraser's discovery might allow him to reach his dead son, Hartley agrees to support him. With Hartley's support, the Frasers, and fellow scientist Lincoln Russel, set up power electrical equipment inside of a metropolitan power plant. While experimenting on inanimate objects and small animals, Fraser is approached by Benson Sawyer, Hartley's managing director. Sawyer, who has designs on Hartley's company, insists that Fraser's discoveries should go through him. Ultimately, Fraser enters the test box, and Eva engages the field. Now within a much more powerful magnetic field, Fraser finds himself approaching what may be a boundary between his universe, and another one. Unknown to either of them, Mrs. Palmer and her assistant Edgar Price have appeared at the power plant, and watch as Fraser's experiments proceed. Angry at Fraser for revealing Mrs. Palmer as a fraud, Price seeks to sabotage the experiment. Palmer urges caution, warning that they could be meddling in something extremely important. Price isn't dissuaded, arguing that it is Fraser who is meddling. With Fraser within the magnetic field, Price shorts one of the plant's generators, electrocuting himself in the process. With the field losing power, the boundary begins to collapse. Fraser, now trapped in the field, can see his wife, but can't hear or reach her. Not knowing if he can be heard, Fraser shouts out his observations, that the world looks transparent, and that another landscape appears superimposed over it. Fraser has no way of knowing if he is looking at a different planet, or Earth in another time. Remembering Hartley, Fraser calls out to Dion, Hartley's dead son. Hartley, overcome by emotion, also calls out to Dion. Knowing that the world is fading out to him, Fraser reaches through the field with his hand. Eva, knowing she may lose her husband, grasps his hand, ultimately pulling her husband back to their world. Hartley, desperate to reach his son, enters the magnetic field, and is apparently vaporized. Eva, having brought her husband back, holds him tight.

A certain Edmund at the same date was holding one hide in Sway which Algar had held from King Edward. Romsey Abbey also held one hide in Sway. Some time before 1150 Hugh de Witteville gave \\"his whole land of Sway with its men and one mill\\" to Quarr Abbey, and about the same date Ralph Fulcher donated land at Sway to the same abbey. In the 13th century Christchurch Priory also gained land in Sway, which increased in the 14th century by the grant of land in Sway from John, vicar of Christchurch. Free warren in Sway was granted to the priory in 1384. Romsey Abbey also held land in Sway, afterwards known as the manor of Sway Romsey or South Sway. The Abbess of Romsey was holding land in Sway together with the Abbot of Quarr and the Prior of Christchurch in 1316. In 1543, at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the lands possessed by Quarr and Christchurch were granted to Sir John Williams and others, by whom it was subsequently conveyed to John Mill, the purchaser and grantee of much monastic property in the neighbourhood. The combined lands became known as the manor of Sway Quarr. The manor of Sway Romsey (South Sway) remained separate but were also granted at the Dissolution to Sir John Williams and henceforth had the same owners as Sway Quarr. The estate then followed the descent of Battramsley manor until 1627, when it was sold by George Wroughton to John Button of Buckland Lymington, and in 1670 he or his son appeared before the justice seat held at Lyndhurst as the lord of the manor of Sway. Before the end of the 17th century, however, it had passed to Edmund Dummer of Swaythling.

Sway Tower was built by eccentric Yorkshireman Andrew Peterson in 1879 Sway Tower Sway is perhaps best known for Sway Tower, a folly which stands 66 metres (218 ft) tall at the southern entrance to the village. The building is Grade II listed since 1975 and also known as \\"Peterson's Folly\\" and \\"Peterson's Tower\\". Built by Andrew Thomas Turton Peterson on his private estate from 1879‚Äì1885, both its design and the use of concrete as a building material were influenced by the follies Peterson had seen during his time in India. Peterson‚Äîa proponent of spiritualism in his later life‚Äîalso claimed to be guided by the spirit of Sir Christopher Wren in the building of the tower. It is constructed entirely out of concrete made with Portland cement, with only the windows having iron supports. At the time, it was the first major building in Britain to be built entirely from concrete, and it remains the tallest non-reinforced concrete structure in the world. It was originally designed as a mausoleum, with a perpetual light at the top. However, this was not allowed by Trinity House, as it was thought the light would confuse shipping.JAMES, J.

TPN) is a National Park located in the Tatra Mountains in Tatra County, in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship‚ÄîMa≈Çopolska region, in central-southern Poland.en.poland.gov: Tatra National Park . accessed 5.12.2013 The Park has its headquarters in the town of Zakopane. The Tatra Mountains form a natural border between Poland to the north and Slovakia to the south, and the two countries have cooperated since the early 20th century on efforts to protect the area. Slovakia created an adjoining national park, and UNESCO later designated the combined effort a transboundary biosphere reserve. Park history The first calls for protection of the Tatras came at the end of the 19th century. In 1925 the first efforts to create a national park, in cooperation with Slovakia, took place. Formally the park was created in 1937, on an area that belonged to the state forests authority. In 1947, a separate administrative unit, Tatra Park, was created. In 1954, by decision of the Polish Government, Tatra National Park was created. It was established originally with an area of , but it is currently slightly smaller, at . Of this, is forest and the remainder mainly meadows. Strictly protected zones account for , of which are forest ecosystems. In 1992, the Polish and Slovakian national parks in the Tatras were jointly designated a transboundary biosphere reserve by UNESCO, under its Man and the Biosphere Programme. Geography ;Mountains The National Park covers one of the two Alpine mountain ranges in Poland. The Polish Tatra range, which is a part of the Western Carpathian Mountains, is divided into two sections: the High Tatras (Tatry Wysokie) and the Western Tatras (Tatry Zachodnie). The landscape consists of sharp-edged peaks and hollows with numerous rock formations. The highest peak in Poland, Rysy ( AMSL), is located here. ;Caves There are around 650 caves in the park, of which the Wielka Sniezna cave system is the longest (), and the deepest (maximum depth ). Six caves of this system are open to public. ;Water There are several streams, the longest stream reaching . Waterfalls, such as Wodogrzmoty Mickiewicza are popular with tourists. The highest waterfall is Wielka Siklawa at ). The park has over 30 mountain lakes, called staw (Polish: pond). These water bodies are an important part of the High Tatra landscape. The largest lakes are: Morskie Oko with an area of 349,000 m¬≤ and maximum depth of ); and Wielki Staw with an area of 344,000 m¬≤ and maximum depth of ). Biology and ecology Tatra National Park Red Fox in the park Flora Up to there are mainly Silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests. Higher levels, up to , are covered with European spruce (Picea abies) forests, which turn into meadows and grasslands at higher elevations up to . The highest elevations, above , have alpine flora habitats. Other typical species include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra), Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum), and Stemless carline thistle (Carlina acaulis). Spring in the Ko≈õcieliska Valley is notable for the fields of Giant crocus (Crocus vernus, syn: Crocus scepusiensis). Fauna The National Park contains several endemic fauna species, and many endangered and protected ones. Animals include: the Tatra chamois and marmot, both protected since the mid-19th century; brown bear, Eurasian lynx, gray wolf, European otter, lesser spotted eagle, and falcon. Culture=The G√≥rale The Podhale region of the Tatras is home to the G√≥rales or the Goral (highland) people. Distinctive elements of their culture include the Podhale dialect (language), music, and traditional artisan customs such as clothes, wooden vernacular architecture, cheesemaking, and craft works.National Geographic Magazine; \\"The G√≥rale People\\"; c. 1980s issue; pp 105 - 130. The historic G√≥rale culture was traditionally passed on in oral stories. Environment The area of the Tatra mountains was exploited by human activities in the past. During summer numerous herds of animals (such as goats, sheep, and cows) pastured on the meadows and these practices caused erosion processes. In the 18th and 19th centuries several mines and ironworks were built here, industries that used substantial harvests of local timber. Current environmental threats include: the proximity of the fast-developing town of Zakopane; and air pollution from the industrial zones in Krak√≥w, Ostrava, and Orava. Fauna is threatened by poachers and habitat loss. The high number of tourists is the largest threat to Park‚Äôs ecosystem currently. Also, the infrastructure, such as hotels and car parks, is not sufficient for the current volume of visitors. Tourism Tourism was first developed in the Tatras in the late 19th century, and continues in the 21st. It is the most visited of the national parks in Poland. There are more than of hiking trails in Tatra National Park.

It first aired on 23 December 1963, during the first season. Plot Domineering millionaire John Dexter drives a group of explorers and scientists to pursue an ancient lake monster that is reputed to live in the waters of a South American dictatorship. Using underwater detection equipment aboard Dexter's yacht, the creature is spotted swimming along the lake bed. After several attempts, the creature is captured and taken to the local university for study. The creature is immobilized and stored inside a freezer to aid in its preservation while out of water. Meanwhile, Dexter makes plans to transport it to the United States to place it on display. San Blas' absolute ruler, Juan Mercurio, has his own plans to use it to attract tourists to his country's faltering World's Fair, claiming the animal as a national treasure. During its captivity, the creature is revived due to an inept guard's negligence, and emits ultrasonic waves that cause the freezer door to implode. It is recaptured before it can fully escape its confines, and an armed guard from Mercurio's palace is ordered to stand watch. Dexter overpowers him, and arranges for the creature's transport on his private plane back to the States. As Dexter and his assistants prepare the monster for its trip, they are shocked to see more of the creatures emerging from the lake. A marine biologist, previously employed by Dexter, urges them to turn the creature loose. Reluctantly, they comply, watching as it joins the others. Dexter, shooting at the creatures in an effort to stop them, is abruptly halted by a piercing, ultrasonic pulse. The creatures crawl back into the lake and disappear under the water. With the combined energy of their earth-shattering sound waves, the creatures topple the dam created by Mercurio during his reign of power, killing him, and flooding San Blas, destroying all that he had built. Opening narration \\"In Man's dark and troubled history, there are vestiges of strange gods. This stone statue was, once, such a god a thousand years gone by in the central mountains of Pan America. Today, new gods have emerged - the god of power, the god of money. The Republic of San Blas lies west of the Orinoco Basin, slightly north of the Equator. Its principle exports are coffee, copra, mahogany, maize and saffron. In a hundred odd years, the reigns of government have changed many times; in blood, and fire, and death. The last of these revolutionaries was led by Juan Mercurio - the most absolute and powerful ruler of them all. Only the Indians who live close to the old gods in the volcanic uplands are unimpressed. They have seen the coming of the Conquistadors, with the power of their guns and flashing flags...the Revolutionaries, with the power of their zeal and their willingness to die...the Americans, with the power of their money, and bulldozers; with their summer houseboats in the crater lake of Ari Pana; with their gadgets, and machines, and devices...\\" Act I narration \\"Moving through the deep, protected only by a tank of air and a hunting spear, the scientist/explorer descends beyond the San Blas shelf; but, all unknown to him, the observer is, himself, observed. Hidden in the sinuous rills of seaweed, sightless eyes, blind for centuries, stare out of the abyss. The legendary creature of the deep, sensing through neuro-receptors in its skin, becomes aware of the alien invader - Man...\\" Act IV narration \\"Stressed and strained by constant drilling of ultrasonic beams, the concrete face of the dam cracks and falls. Ten million tons of pressure build towards ultimate collapse...\\" Closing narration \\"The forces of nature will not submit to injustice. No man has the right, nor will the checks and balances of the universe permit him, to place his fellows under the harsh yoke of repression. Nor may he, again, place the forces of nature under the triple-yoke of vanity, greed and ambition. In the words of Shelley, 'Here lies your tyrant who would rule the world, immortal.'\\" Background * Unlike the other episodes, this one has two additional narrations, one during Act I and another in Act IV.

Prafulla and Khudiram Bose tried to assassinate the District Judge, Mr. Kingsford by throwing bombs at the carriage in which Kingsford was supposed was travel but he was not in the carriage and two British women were killed. Prafulla committed suicide when he was about to be arrested by the Police. Khudiram was arrested and tried for the murder of the two women and sentenced to death. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi did not approve this violence and regretted the deaths of two women. He stated \\"that the Indian people will not win there freedom through these methods\\". However, Bal Gangadhar Tilak in his newspaper Kesari, defended the two young men and called for immediate swaraj. This was followed by the immediate arrest of Tilak by the British colonial government on charges of sedition.  Early life  Prafulla Chandra Chaki was born in a well to do Jotdar family on 10 December 1888 in Bihar, a village in Bogra district of current day Bangladesh, then a part of Bengal Presidency. His father's name was Rajnarayan Chaki and mother's name was Swarnomoyee Devi. Rajnarayan's ancestor Prankrishna Chaki (his grandfather) was a residents of Chanchakia, Pabna, Their original surname was Bosu but people living in Chanchakia were also called Chaki. He was the fifth child in his family. Rajnarayan was an employee in the Nagar estate. He started his education at Namuja Janada Prasad English School, an English medium school in Baguda. After completing his primary education he came to Rongpur with his elder brother Pratap Chandra Chaki whose father-in-law was a reputed person in Rongpur. He was expelled from Rangpur Zilla School in Class 9 for taking part in a students' demonstration that violated East Bengal law. He then joined Rangpur National School where he came in contact with revolutionaries and became a believer and practitioner of revolutionary philosophies. He loved horse riding and swimming. As an athlete, he was a renowned wrestler, lathikhalowar (stick-fighter).  Revolutionary activities  Barin Ghosh brought Prafulla to Kolkata and he was enlisted in the Jugantar party. His first assignment was to kill Sir Joseph Bampfylde Fuller (1854-1935), the first Lieutenant Governor of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. However, the plan did not materialize. Next, Prafulla, along with Khudiram Bose was chosen for the assassination of Kingsford, the magistrate of Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Kingsford, during his previous tenure as the Chief Presidency Magistrate of Calcutta, was unpopular for passing harsh and cruel sentences on young political workers of Bengal. He was also noted for inflicting corporal punishments on such workers. This led to the planning of his murder, and Chaki and Bose were selected and sent to Muzaffarpur to execute this task. Prafulla took the fake name of 'Dinesh Chandra Roy' in this operation.  The Muzaffarpur killing  Khudiram and Prafulla watched the usual movements of Kingsford and prepared a plan to kill him. In the evening of 30 April 1908, the duo waited in front of the gate of European Club for the carriage of Kingsford to come. When a vehicle came out of the gate, a bomb was thrown into the carriage. There was a mistake of identification by them, as the vehicle was not carrying Kingsford, but wife and daughter of Mr Pringle Kennedy, a leading pleader of Muzaffarpur Bar. The daughter died soon and his wife succumbed to her injuries. The revolutionaries fled.  The manhunt and suicide  Prafulla and Khudiram took separate routes to escape. Prafulla reached Samastipur where he was given shelter and clothing by a railway staff member, Triguna Charan Ghosh. Ghosh also provided him an inter-class ticket in the night train for Mokama. Nandalal Banerjee, a police officer in the same compartment, suspected Prafulla and attempted to arrest him on the Mokama station platform, but Prafulla committed suicide with his own revolver. His head was severed from his body and sent to Kolkata for further identification by Khudiram who was captured. Khudiram was later arrested and was hanged to death. The police inspector, Nandalal Banerjee, was assassinated by two young revolutionaries, Srishh Pal and Ranen Ganguly. Their relatives lives in Uttar and Dakhin Dinajpur, West Bengal. Pratap Chanda Chaki's great grandson Subrata Chaki lives in Kolkata.

Introduction  An alien world demands that Earth provide a penal colony for its criminals. The criminals are grotesque, rat- sized, ant-like insectoids with almost human faces. Opening narrationPlotline Military forces have cordoned off a ghost town, aptly named Morgue, located in a remote section in the deserts of California while awaiting the arrival of a spacecraft from the planet Zanti. The perfectionist rulers of that planet, after making radio contact with our government, have decided that the Earth is the \\"perfect place\\" to exile their undesirables and criminals in exchange for sharing technological advances with Earth. They threaten total destruction if their penal ship is attacked, or if their privacy is not maintained. During the negotiations, Ben Garth, a bank robber on the run, along with his reluctant, morally deficient accomplice/girlfriend, Lisa, cross the cordon, and run down an armed sentry during the approach of the Zanti ship. After seeing the ship land, Ben climbs a small mesa to investigate the landing site. A Zanti regent emerges from an open hatch of the ship and kills Garth. The Zanti are revealed to be grotesque oversized ant- like beings with malicious human-like faces. The Zanti regent pursues Ben's now-terrified accomplice. Believing that their privacy was violated, the remaining Zanti prisoners commandeer the penal ship and land it atop the roof of the military command post. When the Zanti prisoners attack Earth's nervous soldiers, a brutal firefight ensues, and all of the aliens are massacred. The soldiers and airmen anxiously await the expected reprisal, but, instead, they receive a message of thanks from the Zanti leaders who explain that they were incapable of executing members of their own species so they sent them into the hands of a race who possessed no qualms about killing ‚Äî the human race, referring to us as \\"born executioners\\". Closing narrationSpecial effects Jim Danforth provided the stop-motion effects of the Zantis for this episode. During the Zantis' initial attack after landing on the roof of the command post, the creatures are seen descending an exterior wall; however, with the technology of the time, the stop-motion effect was not able to be used during this scene. Here, the Zantis are mere models being lowered on wires, their movements erratic, with their legs not moving. Contemporary usage \\"Zantis\\" and \\"Zanti Misfits\\" have been used to describe certain patterns of extremely high-frequency stock trading.http://www.nanex.net/FlashCrash/CCircleDay.html The 1986 horror film Critters featured an interstellar prison warden named Zanti, presumably an homage to this episode, in which the concept of an alien prison is pivotal.

Opening narrationPlot Deimos and Phobos One are two Martians ‚Äî their names also happen to be those of Mars' moons ‚Äî the latter being a researcher who wants to understand the concept of murder (they are portrayed by actors Carroll O'Connor and Barry Morse, respectively, as a type of Holmes-and-Watson team). Upon his arrival on Earth, Phobos One contacts Deimos, whose 'cover' is working as a pawnbroker in a large American city. The duo, inconspicuously, investigates a shooting that is about to take place in a downtown hotel lobby that resulted from a love triangle, predicted and then reported by Martian Central Control. Using a machine that can manipulate the flow of time in a manner much the same as one might do with recorded video, they review this same event over and over again. They rewind time in order to watch the incident unfold at various speeds, forward and backward. Finally, they slow the passage of time down to such an extent that the participants seem to be standing still, the bullet suspended in flight, so that they can examine all of the nuances that, at \\"normal\\" speed, pass by too quickly for adequate, scientific observation. Phobos One, however, is unable to simply remain a passive observer, and finally gives in to the temptation to tamper with the scenario and alter the outcome; he arranges the scenario so that the bullet is deflected at the last moment, preventing the murder from ever taking place. Phobos decides to remain on Earth indefinitely, finding that he enjoys life as a human being.

Opening narration :Human life strives ceaselessly to perfect itself, to gain ascendancy. But what of the lower forms of life? Is it not possible that they, too, are conducting experiments and are at this moment on the threshold of deadly success? Plot Ben Fields, married to Francesca Fields, is an entomologist seeking a lab assistant. Regina, a giant mutant queen bee in human form, who is searching for a human mate to evolve her species, takes the job. Regina is accepted into their household after fabricating a story of accused infidelity by her 'former' employer's spouse, whom she chose to keep anonymous to prevent anyone from knowing about the alleged affair. When the subject of drones comes up, Regina is oddly enthusiastic about the beauty of the bee's mating ritual and the willingness of the drones to die in the process. Suspicious of her background, while being treated with disrespect and contempt, Francesca discovers Regina has lied; as well as seeing her abruptly morphing into a giant bee while apparently drawing nectar from a flower in their garden. At one point, due to the metabolic changes while in human form, Regina experiences spasms of pain, and is examined and treated by the Fields' personal physician, who reveals to them his belief that Regina may not be who she appears to be. Later, with her knowledge of Regina's attempts to seduce her husband, Francesca confronts her, whereupon Regina unleashes the bees of her hive kept in Ben's laboratory, attacking and then stinging Francesca to death. Ben, grief-stricken, accuses Regina of murdering his wife. Now understanding and horrified by her true identity and purpose, he forcefully rejects her advances, and gives her his view of the human mating ritual, in contrast to her earlier statements. In an ensuing struggle, she falls from his bedroom's second story balcony to the ground below. She is not killed, transforms back into a queen bee, then flies off.

The station was down the line from London Fenchurch Street station via Rainham. History A 1946 Ordnance Survey map showing the station, Tilbury Town and the triangular junctionIt was opened on 13 April 1854 as part of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, providing an interchange with Tilbury Docks to take advantage of the increasing steamboat traffic in this area of the river Thames. The station was opened as Tilbury, and it became Tilbury Riverside on 3 August 1934. It used to provide an interchange with the Gravesend - Tilbury Ferry. Tilbury engine shed was sited in the triangular junction to the north of Tilbury Riverside station. Most trains from Fenchurch Street via Tilbury Town would reverse at this station and continue to Westcliff and Benfleet, with a few to or from Fenchurch Street starting or ending here, and there were also a few services operating short to or from Upminster. However, in 1986, London trains ceased calling here and the services were shortened to operate only from Upminster to Tilbury Riverside, East Tilbury and Stanford-le-Hope. Tilbury Marine Tilbury Marine was a short-lived station built by the Port of London Authority to serve boat trains, it was located within the docks area to the west of Tilbury Riverside. It opened on 15 May 1927 and closed on 1 May 1932. The station suffered bomb damage in World War 2 but was still largely intact in 1947. Closure On 30 November 1992, the station was closed. For many years prior to closure, the station was served only by certain trains on the local service from Upminster via Grays, because the nearby Dartford Crossing and increased car ownership had caused a decline in its importance as a passenger ferry terminal. There was some opposition to closure, but British Rail cited financial reasons for the closure with the annual cost of running the service at ¬£180,000 against income of ¬£11,000. The large and empty circulating area in Tilbury Riverside station 5 June 1986 The station building can now be reached by a shuttle bus service from Tilbury Town railway station, which was a requirement of the line closure. Conditions placed include that the bus service is at least as frequent as the train service at closure, and also that any withdrawal of the bus service go through the same process as closure of the rail service. The station building is now an indoor car park for Tilbury passenger terminal.

It first aired on 3 February 1964, during the first season. Introduction A government agent infiltrates a secret organization, known as The Invisibles, intent on using alien parasites to take over the bodies of important humans. Opening narration > \\"You do not know these men. You may have looked at them, but you did not see > them. They are newspapers blowing down a gutter on a windy night. For > reasons both sociological and psychological these three have never joined or > been invited to join society. They have never experienced love or > friendship, or formed any lasting or constructive relationship, but today, > at last, they will become a part of something. They will belong. They will > come a little closer to their unrealistic dreams of power and glory. Today, > finally they will join th... I almost said the human race, and that would > have been a half-truth, for the race they are joining today is only half > human.\\" Plot Three of society's outcasts ‚Äî men named Spain, Plannetta, and Castle ‚Äî are taken to a compound that serves as the headquarters of a subversive secret society known as the Invisibles. In their initial debriefing, Spain immediately recognizes the man speaking to them as the governor of an unnamed state. The \\"governor\\" rebuts him, saying that his only role is as ruler of the society of the Invisibles. Their purpose is to infect key government and business figures with crab-like creatures who attach themselves to people's backs and take over their minds. By doing so, the Invisibles plan to conquer the world. Each of the new recruits will be given a target to infect following his inoculation. Castle's inoculation is unsuccessful, and he ends up deformed, as is one of the aides at the compound. It turns out that Spain is actually an agent for the GIA, sent to infiltrate the Invisibles. He sneaks out to meet his contact in the woods and states his plan to try to establish a friendship with the desperately lonely Plannetta so he can get Plannetta to call his \\"kid brother\\" so that they can meet up later. In reality, the number is that of GIA headquarters. Spain's plan hits a hitch when Johnny (his contact) is killed and brought in as a corpse for the trainees to practice on. Spain is assigned to infect General Hillary Clarke in Washington, D.C., while posing as his faithless wife's chauffeur. However, the reality is that the Invisibles are onto him. Clarke is already infected, and Spain was sent there so that Clarke could infect him when his inoculation wore off. Spain manages to escape when Clarke says too much and is momentarily tortured by his Invisible. As Spain flees, Clarke's wife is driving up, and she hits him with the car, breaking his leg. Spain blacks out from the pain. When he comes to, Mrs. Clarke is tending to his injury, but he limps away and steals a car before Clarke can find him. Spain finally manages to find Plannetta, only to meet another twist of fate: he was Plannetta's target all along. Weeping because he thinks Spain betrayed him, Plannetta sets an Invisible on the ground, which begins to crawl toward Spain. The Invisible does not move quickly, but neither does Spain in his condition. In the nick of time, his fellow GIA agents arrive, shooting both the creature and Plannetta, thus saving Spain's life. However, Spain can only think of the fact that the Invisible menace is everywhere. Closing narration > \\"You do not know these men. You may have looked at them, but you did not see > them. They are the wind that blows newspapers down a gutter on a windy night > -- and sweeps the gutter clean.\\" Trivia There is an unusual pause in the course of the opening narration which seems to indicate that the Control Voice makes a mistake of appreciation: ‚ÄúToday, finally, they will join the hu... I almost said the human race.‚Äù The Control Voice then explains the Society of Invisibles are only half human. Neil Hamilton, who plays Gen.

The show's main character is Pelle Hermanni, a clown who lives in his own trailer at a circus trailer park. He was played by Veijo Pasanen. There is no major continuing plot, instead the episodes consist of Hermanni talking about his life and daily events in a funny, clownish, somewhat childish way. His comedic antics are further increased by the comically misproportioned props and his way of fumbling over difficult words. Hermanni would often ask questions from his children audience, and then pretend to actually hear what they answered, saying such things like \\"Right, Annika there knew the answer!\\" In by far the most of the episodes, Hermanni is the only human actor shown. Other characters include Vekkari, Hermanni's large alarm clock which starts ringing when Hermanni least wants, and Kepakko, a wooden teacher's staff who feels intellectually superior to Hermanni and often insults him by laughing at him. Hermanni is especially fond of his dear old mother and the pancakes with strawberries she makes, and he often phones her to see how she's doing. Hermanni's telephone is a large, complex contraption with its own video communications screen. Because the show predates actually feasible real-world video communication by more than a decade, this only adds to the comedy. Hermanni is in love with Sylvia, the circus's fortune teller, but she has a rival suitor in Max, the circus magician. For by far the most of the show, both Sylvia and Max remained unseen characters, with Hermanni only visiting their trailers where they were not present. In later episodes, both Sylvia and Max were briefly seen.

It is the seat of the Catholic Bishop of Passau and the main church of his diocese. Since 730, there have been many churches built on the site of the current cathedral. The current church, a baroque building around long, was built from 1668 to 1693 after a fire in 1662 destroyed its predecessor, of which only the late gothic eastern side remains. The cathedral's overall plan was made by Carlo Lurago, its interior decoration by Giovanni Battista Carlone, and its frescos by Carpoforo Tencalla. Passau Cathedral's used to be the largest organ in the world. It still is the largest church organ outside USA. Over time, it has been outgrown by more recent instruments, for instance Wanamaker's organ in the USA. The organ currently has 17,774 pipes and 233 registers, all of which can be played with the five- manual general console in the gallery. Portions of the organ have their own mechanical-action or electric-action consoles, for a total of six consoles. The cathedral has eight large bells in the bell rooms in the north and south towers. The heaviest,\\"Pummerin\\" at 7550 kg cast in 1952 and \\"Sturmerin\\" weighing 5300 kg cast in 1733 hang in the south tower. The other six bells hang in the north tower.

It first aired on 10 February 1964, during the first season. There are several similarities in the story's theme, plot, and structure to William Shakespeare's Macbeth, and many critics agree it was the series' take on that play.The Bellero Shield review Opening narration > \\"There is a passion in the human heart which is called aspiration. It flares > with the noble flame, and by its light Man has traveled from the caves of > darkness to the darkness of outer space. But when this passion becomes lust, > when its flame is fanned by greed and private hunger, then aspiration > becomes ambition ‚Äì by which sin the angels fell.\\" Plot A scientist, Richard Bellero (Landau), builds a powerful laser device that he shoots into the sky from a laboratory on the top floor of his home, but the invention is not practical enough to satisfy his demanding father, Richard Sr. (Hamilton), who views his son as a failure and has made plans to hand control of the Bellero company to someone outside the family, to the great chagrin of Richard's ruthlessly ambitious wife Judith (Kellerman). One night after Richard has left the lab, a peaceful bioluminescent extraterrestrial from a world which \\"hovers just above the ceiling of your universe\\" rides the laser down to earth. Judith tries to shoot the alien with a laser gun, but the alien protects himself by using a small device in his hand that instantly raises a powerful shield around him. Recognizing that this technology would bring her husband great acclaim and fortune, Judith gets Richard to leave the house by persuading him to go fetch his father. She then tries to coax the alien into giving her his shield's control device, but he disagrees, fearing his technology would fall into the wrong hands. Judith then tricks him into lowering his shield and shoots him, stealing his shield control device. Judith and her maid Mrs. Dame (Rivera) secretly drag the apparently dead alien's body to the cellar. During a demonstration in front of Richard and his father, who do not know that the alien has been shot, Judith raises the shield, but is unable to take it down and becomes trapped inside it. Mrs. Dame, desperate to save Judith from death by asphyxiation, goes to the cellar and is startled to find the alien still alive but very weak. The maid begs him \\"Can you help?\\" The alien replies, \\"Can I not?\\" Just before dying, the alien lowers the shield by using his own glowing blood, the substance that powers the control device. Despite her being rescued, however, Judith insists that she is still trapped by the shield‚Äîthe imagined shield, perhaps, of her own guilt over killing an alien that thought only of helping her. As the episode ends, she places her hands helplessly on the \\"shield\\" that is no longer there. On one hand is a spot: a glowing drop of the murdered alien's blood that presumably will stain her palm forever. Closing narration > \\"When this passion called aspiration becomes lust, then aspiration > degenerates, becomes vulgar ambition, by which sin the angels fell.\\"  Interpretation  The most obvious parallels to Shakespeare's Macbeth lie in Judith's overweening and heartless ambition (similar to that of Lady Macbeth), both women's apparent madness by the end of their respective tales, and the \\"damn'd spot\\" that will not \\"out\\" from either woman's hand, a physical manifestation of their guilt. However, Judith's husband Richard shares none of Macbeth's brutality or desire for power. Northwestern University professor Jeffrey Sconce interprets the \\"shield\\" as a metaphor for television, a tool of \\"domestic asylum\\" that kept women of that era locked up within the home. Legacy Skeptics have pointed to this episode as an origin for the grey aliens described in the 1961 Betty and Barney Hill abduction. In his 1990 article Entirely Unpredisposed, Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney's memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by the episode, which was broadcast twelve days before Barney's first hypnotic session. Between the alleged 1961 abduction and the airing of the episode in 1964, Betty Hill's writings had described the aliens as short black-haired men with large \\"Jimmy Durante\\" noses. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes who says, \\"In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak.\\" The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote: :\\"Wraparound eyes are an extreme rarity in science fiction films. I know of only one instance. They appeared on the alien of an episode of an old TV series The Outer Limits entitled \\"The Bellero Shield\\". A person familiar with Barney's sketch in \\"The Interrupted Journey\\" and the sketch done in collaboration with the artist David Baker will find a \\"frisson\\" of \\"d√©j√† vu\\" creeping up his spine when seeing this episode. The resemblance is much abetted by an absence of ears, hair, and nose on both aliens. Could it be by chance? Consider this: Barney first described and drew the wraparound eyes during the hypnosis session dated 22 February 1964. \\"The Bellero Shield\\" was first broadcast on \\"10 February 1964. Only twelve days separate the two instances. If the identification is admitted, the commonness of wraparound eyes in the abduction literature falls to cultural forces.\\" When a different researcher asked Betty about The Outer Limits, she insisted she had \\"never heard of it\\".Clark, Jerome.

It first aired on March 2, 1964, during the first season. Opening narration :When fear is too terrible, when reality is too agonizing, we seek escape in manufactured danger, in the thrills and pleasures of pretending-in the amusement parks of our unamusing world. Here, in frantic pretending, Man finds escape and temporary peace, and goes home tired enough to sleep a short, deep sleep. But what happens here when night comes? When pretending ends, and reality begins? Plot Frustrated and disillusioned physicist Dave Crowell (Don Gordon) has found a temporary and undemanding job - 'piloting' a flying saucer mock-up spaceflight simulator at a third-rate amusement park - to escape from his former Defense Department employers' demands to develop more effective weapons of mass destruction. However, an alien from the planet Empyria (Simon Oakland) stealthily modifies the attraction into an actual interplanetary spacecraft; and, passing himself off as a weird roving sideshow, invites aboard a group of misfits, each of whom is refusing to confront unpleasant realities in his/her life. The Empyrian offers the group a second chance to better themselves - an opportunity to colonize a small planetoid called Tythra that, paradoxically, will threaten both the alien's home world and Earth, just 82 years down the line; by inhabiting it, the colonists will alter its orbital path and thus avert the disaster. However, to turn this dream into a reality, each must overcome an entrenched unwillingness to face his or her own true nature to pull together as a group. As violence escalates quickly between the distressed abductees and the flight crew, with one passenger accidentally being ejected into space during a physical altercation, Crowell eventually manages to convince the Empyrian that the operation is doomed to failure; he explains that it is against human nature to expect someone to freely accept their shortcomings and admit their failures. Instead, he advises him to seek help directly from Earth's governments and scientists, in order to initialize a proper collaboration for the sake of each individual, by asking for volunteers to accompany them to Tythra - he assures the alien that he would probably have a whole ship full of people willing to receive a second chance at life. Approving of Crowell's choice, the Empyrian states that \\"he trusts his judgment\\", and reverses the course of the ship to return the reluctant abductees back to Earth. Closing narration This episode has no closing narration. Background The original script for this episode was written by Sonya Roberts (whose previous credits included episodes of Surfside Six, Hawaiian Eye, and 77 Sunset Strip) and titled \\"Joy Ride\\", and takes place at Jollyland, (changed to Joyland). The script was rewritten as \\"Second Chance\\" by Lou Morheim, who retained the basic plot but threw out most of the emotional depth and humor of the characters, supposedly because ABC wanted monsters and simplistic stories. In \\"Second Chance\\", for example, the Empyrian frightens whoever he encounters by suddenly appearing in front of them, whereas in \\"Joy Ride\\" Roberts cleverly has him appear as if he is part of the park, wearing a sandwich board that reads 'GREETINGS EARTHMEN, I AM FROM THE PLANET EMPYRIA IN OUTER SPACE'. Likewise, in \\"Second Chance\\", the Empyrian forces Arjay to buckle his safety belt by hypnotizing him with his alien medallion, but in \\"Joy Ride\\" he achieves this by getting Arjay to \\"pretend\\" everything is for real, pulling out his ray gun and threatening to burn him to a cinder if he doesn't, and Arjay, playing along, complies laughing. Believing the resulting script to be inane, Sonya Roberts had her name removed from the script and employed the pseudonym Lin Dane. Fun Fact The exterior of the Braniff Space Rover attraction at Freedomland U.S.A. reportedly was used as a reference for the exterior of the flying saucer in this episode. In one scene, two actors are seen outside the flying saucer in a park with a carousel in the distance. While Freedomland's Space Rover may have served as a reference for the flying saucer in the program, the clip provides evidence that the episode was not filmed at Freedomland.

Lunar Expedition One: Here a handful of brave scientists and technicians pave the way to the future. Their mission: to collect information that will eventually enable Man to inhabit the Moon; to use the Moon as a springboard to the stars. Once during each twenty-four-hour period, a force of three, commanded by General Lee Stocker and including Lieutenant Travers and Major Clint Anderson, makes its slow, uncharted way across the lunar surface, a surface whose depths and desires are, as yet, unprobed‚Ä¶ Plot Scientists and researchers in a base on the Moon discover living creatures, encased in a seamless, perfectly round orb, which proves to be the repository of a benevolent alien intelligence that is fleeing tyranny in its own system. The beings inform the startled scientists that they are the five greatest minds in the universe, having escaped their home planet, Grippia, located in the constellation Xenes, to prevent their advanced knowledge from being used to conquer the galaxy. They had landed on the Moon due to a lack of sustainable energy, with our sun being too weak to provide them with enough power to continue their flight. The scientists offer the aliens sanctuary while they attempt to re-energize; and, in exchange, they begin to record their combined wisdom on the base's computers to preserve it before they are captured. When the Tyrants arrive in pursuit, the researchers have to decide how much they should risk in the gathering of knowledge. The Grippians convince the scientists to release them to the Tyrants to prevent their imminent destruction, following the death of one of the researchers when trying to defend them. This act of compassion and sacrifice, in the face of almost certain death, is demonstrated as the Grippians self-destruct before allowing to be taken aboard the Tyrants craft, thus denying them the knowledge that they were so desperately seeking.

The Moon surface itself was a four inch deep layer of sand that had been dyed different colours to give the moonscape different gradations of tone when filmed in black and white. Paintings by astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell were used as background plates for sequences of the two Moonstones moving over the lunar surface.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), p.138 The Grippians were designed at Projects Unlimited by father and son team Marcel and Victor Delgado.

Introduction Researchers on an alien planet live in fear of a man wearing goggles, a man who is paranoid and powerful‚Äîand can read minds. Opening narration :At this very moment, our horizon is menaced by two explosive forces, both man-made. One is a deadly wonder; the other, wondrously alive. Both forces have compelled Man to reach out for worlds beyond his own, new worlds where he may find peace, and room to grow. This is the first of those new worlds. The United Nations of Earth have claimed it, and called it Annex One. It is almost identical to Earth, except that there is no night‚Äîsunlight is constant. Early reports from the small expeditionary team stationed on Annex One indicated that the ancient planet appeared suitable for colonization by Earth's overflowing population. But the most recent reports have contained unspoken, oddly disturbing undercurrents, and the United Space Agency has decided to investigate. The man chosen: Dr. Evan Marshall, psychiatrist. Plot An astronaut lands on an alien planet to investigate the death of one of a group of Earth scientists who are testing to see if the planet is suitable for colonization. The scientists, including Julie, his old flame, behave strangely, but refuse to explain why. They are particularly nervous around Reese Fowler, a fellow researcher who seems to wear his polarized goggles all the time, necessary due to the extreme brightness of the planet's sun. One of the scientists attempts to leave a hastily scribbled note in the astronaut's spacesuit pocket, warning him of what has been happening; he exits the room, only to bump into Reese, who seems to read his mind, and then destroys him with a mere touch. The astronaut is led to a remote cave by Julie and another researcher where he discovers that the others live in fear of Reese, who developed superhuman abilities when he was accidentally exposed to the planet's radioactive isotope-laden rainfall, which has mutating properties, resulting in the scientist's loss of hair and in the development of protruding eyes. Reese, knowing that if the others return to Earth he will be left behind because of the danger he poses, has been holding the others captive, while threatening his touch if they reveal the secret of his plight, all the time searching for a cure. The astronaut must somehow overcome a man who can read minds, and kill with a touch. To prevent Reese from knowing of his plans, the investigator is given a post-hypnotic suggestion to forget what he has learned, then‚Äîprovided with a code word to recall the events‚Äîinform his superiors on Earth following his return. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Reese discovers the deception, and pursues the investigator and Julie into the cave, where they had met once before, with the intent to destroy them; however, due to his sensitivity to darkness, Reese apparently dies from the intense pain while trying to absorb the dim glow of a candle's flame into his light-starved eyes. Closing narration :The forces of violence and the forces of nature compel man to reach out toward new horizons, where peace and sanity may flourish, where there is room to grow. But before we run, should we not first make certain that we have done all that can be done here to end madness, quiet the disturbers of peace and make room for those who need so little to grow in?

History and formation On 7 November 1854, Leslie Hudson, a member of British Parliament raised a question about British Government's plan to open medical colleges in India which was under the rule of British East India Company then. Replying to that, Sir Charles Wood, the minister concerned announced that by 1861 medical colleges would be opened in five cities of India, namely Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Lahore and Allahabad. Pt. Motilal Nehru was the chief spokesperson of the deputation that called on Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, on 17 November 1904 at Allahabad in leadership of Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya. During this meet, Pt. Motilal Nehru reminded the Viceroy of the promise made by the British Government 50 years back and told him that it was a matter of deep regret that there was no medical college in Allahabad, which at that time was the capital of the United Province. Moti Lal Nehru Medical College was formally inaugurated on 5 May 1961 by the President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, just one day prior to Nehru's 100th birthday, and a century after the proposed time by the British Govt. Initially the premises of the British District Jail at South Malaka were acquired for the college. Pt. Motilal Nehru was kept imprisoned there in 1930 during British rule for his leading role in the freedom movement and released only after severe illness, which resulted in his death on 6 February 1931. Later, in 1963, the Government House, which used to be residence of the Governor of United Province, was acquired for the college while the jail premises were transformed into Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital (named after Pt. Motilal Nehru's wife). Today the college is recognised by Medical Council of India for imparting medical education of undergraduate and post graduate degree /diploma level in various specialities. Academics Every year a batch of 200 students is admitted to the first year of MBBS degree course of the college. 180 students are admitted through state counseling based on UP state rank in NEET, 20 are admitted through all India counseling based on all India rank in NEET conducted by NTA . Similarly admissions to various postgraduate courses are also taken through similar entrance test organised by the government. Upgradation The Government of India has decided to upgrade the institute on lines of All India Institute of Medical Sciences as part of phase-3 of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) whereby the Central Government will bear 80% of the cost of upgradation and 20% cost will be borne by State Government.http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/six-medical-college- hospitals-in-up-will-be-upgraded-harsh-vardhan_957068.html Notable alumni * Dr. Ram Babu Harit, MBBS - Former Minister of Health and Medicine, Uttar Pradesh * Dr Suhail Ahmad, M.D. - Medical Director, Hypertension Clinic, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, USA. * Dr Sanjay P.Singh, M.D. - Chief of Staff-Creighton University Medical Center (only Indian American chief of a University Hospital) Chairman & Professor, Department of Neurology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE., USA. * Dr Sanjay Dixit, Professor Of Medicine At The Hospital Of The University Of Pennsylvania And The Veterans Administration Medical Center * Ajai Khanna.

It first aired on March 23, 1964, during the first season. Introduction A leather-jacketed young man is forced against his will to walk up the stairs in an old house to a room where he encounters an alien being. Plot Wade Norton, a young drifter, finds an old man dying by the side of a remote country road. He picks up the man's pocketwatch, which contains a large photo of a young woman. Seeking help, he enters a mansion he sees atop the hill, whose inhabitants are surprisingly unhelpful but uncannily curious about the age of the man whom he found. With the exception of a soulful young woman whose image is in the watch, all seem mean-spirited and uninterested. Trying to leave through the front door, Norton is forced backward and upstairs by a mysterious compulsion to discover that the house is the lair of an amorphous, gelatinous alien being who is keeping the group of desperate humans suspended in time until it can comprehend the disposition of humanity. It interrogates him then returns him to the group residing in the house where he is to learn the reason for their captivity. The young woman, knowing the potential fate of the drifter, leads Norton to an escape route, which is through a gate attached to a small cemetery plot accessible from the mansion. However, she discloses to him that she cannot accompany him through the gate because all her years will catch up with her, and she will die. Thus, the drifter chooses to remain with her in spite of the warnings. As she realizes he will be trapped among them for eternity, she departs through the gate herself and, having eschewed her protection from the passage of time, withers and turns to dust. The observing alien has found the factors missing in its equation: love and self- sacrifice. Releasing Norton, who has discovered in himself hope, it proceeds to deconstruct the house and destroy its tenants. The mansion returns momentarily to its true appearance, that of a rock shaped like an enormous brain, and then disappears. Notes This episode has no opening or closing narration by the Control Voice. Background Donald S. Sanford was hired by Lou Morheim on the strength of his work on the Boris Karloff anthology series Thriller, for which he had scripted fifteen episodes including 'The Incredible Dr. Markesan' and 'The Cheaters', as Joseph Stefano had been looking for story material with a heavy emphasis on the Gothic to provide director Curtis Harrington with an 'Outer Limits' episode. (Harrington had directed the low- budget film Night Tide, an offbeat version of the Lorelei myth, in 1961 which had impressed Stefano.) A script by Charles Beaumont was given to Sanford for revision, though in the end Sanford came up with his own more Gothic plot, Harrington backed out and Paul Stanley directed. Charles Beaumont, who had written many memorable episodes of The Twilight Zone, sold Joseph Stefano a script titled \\"An Ordinary Town\\" (dated Jan 3 1964), which was quite similar to a Twilight Zone episode he had written the previous year titled \\"Valley of the Shadow\\", in which a newspaper man, Philip Redfield, is trapped in an isolated rural town that keeps the benefits of a wondrous technology (possibly brought by aliens) to itself. \\"An Ordinary Town\\" substitutes Redfield with two protagonists and makes the alien influence a gigantic brain that controls the town. The only thing carried over from Beaumont's script to Sanford's is the shot of the enormous brain sitting atop a hill where a mansion should be. Everything else in 'The Guests' is Sanford's own story. Sanford's script needed so little revision that Stefano neglected to add on the customary Control Voice speeches.

Interior of San Giorgio. San Giorgio in Velabro is a church in Rome, Italy, devoted to St. George. The church is located next to the Arch of Janus in the rione of Ripa in the ancient Roman Velabrum. According to the founding legend of Rome, the church was built where Roman history began: it is here that the she-wolf found Romulus and Remus. History of the Church of San Giorgio in Velabro, The attack of July 1993 http://www.sangiorgioinvelabro.org/eng/storia.html The ancient Arcus Argentariorum is attached to the side of the church's fa√ßade. San Giorgio in Velabro is the station church for the first Thursday in Lent. History The first religious building attested in the place of the current basilica is a diaconia, funded by Pope Gregory the Great. The current church was built during the 7th century, possibly by Pope Leo II, who dedicated it to Saint Sebastian. A 482 inscription in the catacombs of St. Callixtus probably refers of a church in the same zone. Its plan is irregular, indeed slightly trapezoidal, as a result of the frequent additions to the building. As can be seen from the lower photograph, the interior columns are almost randomly arranged having been taken from sundry Roman temples. The church was inside the Greek quarter of Rome, where Greek-speaking merchants, civil and military officers and monks of the Byzantine Empire lived -- the nearby Santa Maria in Cosmedin, for example, was known as in Schola Graeca at the time. Pope Zachary (741-752), who was of Greek origin, moved the relic of St. George to here from Cappadocia, so that this saint had a church dedicated in the West well before the spreading of his worship with the return of the Crusaders from the East. After a restoration of Pope Gregory IV (9th century), the church received the addition of the portico and of the tower bell in the first half of the 13th century. The apsis was decorated with frescoes by Pietro Cavallini in the 13th century. In 1347, the Roman patriot Cola Di Rienzo posted a manifesto announcing the liberation of Rome on the doors of this church.Medieval history site. Between 1923 and 1926, the Superintendent of Monuments of Rome, Antonio Mu√±oz, completed a more radical restoration programme, with the aim of restoring the building's \\"medieval character\\" and freeing it from later additions. This was done by returning the floor to its original level (and so exposing the column bases) reopening the ancient windows that gave light to the central nave, restoring the apsis, and generally removing numerous accretions from the other most recent restorations. During this process, fragments (now displayed on the internal walls) were found indicating a schola cantorum on the site, attributed to the period of Gregory IV. The building as we see it today is largely a product of the 1920s restoration. However, five years' further restoration followed the explosion of a car bomb, parked close to the facade, at midnight on 27 July 1993. That explosion caused no fatalities but left the 12th century portico almost totally collapsed and blew a large opening into the wall of the main church, as well as doing serious damage to the residence of the Generalate of the Crosiers (Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross) next door. The Ministry of Cultural Heritage researched and catalogued what was damaged or destroyed, placing the fragments in 1050 crates with dates and locational references before restoring the building with them, although some details, particularly in the portico, were deliberately left unrestored as a memorial to the bombing.

It first aired on 30 March 1964, during the first season. Opening narrationPlot Mike Benson, ex-boxer and small-time crook, and Laura Hanley, a divorcee, each emotionally wounded by life, are abducted at critical points in their lives by The Senator, a sporting alien representing the citizens of the planet Andera. The Anderans have overcome war, pestilence, avarice and envy, are no longer driven by wants and needs, and find that their lives have become quite stagnant; therefore, they replace their boredom with a constant supply of \\"fun & games\\". Mike and Laura are \\"electroported\\" to an arena planet where they are to be pitted in mortal combat against two primitive aliens from the Caligo galaxy for the entertainment of the jaded audience on Andera. The goal of the tournament is species survival; the home planet of the losing team will be obliterated in a cataclysmic display lasting five years for the further enjoyment of the citizens of Andera. During the combat, Mike and Laura learn to function as a team. When the male Caligo alien, having killed its mate to double its own food supply, confronts Mike on a footbridge over a river of lava, Laura kills the creature with its own saw- bladed boomerang. Mike, hanging by his fingertips and weakened by the ordeal, finally falls off the bridge into the lava. Laura, believing Mike to be dead, mourning his passing and praising his efforts in defending the human race from extinction, is informed by The Senator that since the alien perished in the lava first, Mike's life was spared, and they are declared the winners, thus saving Earth. In that split second, they are electroported to safety, unaware of what had transpired and free to resume their mundane lives. Background Robert Specht's original script titled 'Natural Selection' was slightly different. Here Mike Adams, a computer expert for the U.N., walks through his office door into a black vortex and meets Em, a powerfully-built alien who remains in the darkness unseen. He tells Mike that he is Specimen #172, and that he is to be tested. Mike meets Loris Harper, a medical missionary worker, that Em has kept prisoner for two days, and they both fight off a jellyfish monster as their first test. After further tests, he is satisfied they are hardy survivalists. Em tells them his homeworld is equidistant between Earth and Andera. One planet will have its population exterminated to make room for the overspill from Em's world. Mike and Loris are to fight two Andrites on an arena planet, armed only with pistols that fire explosive charges. The male Andrite kills his partner, and Mike pretends to do the same to lure it out of hiding. Mike trips a snare, is hit by a spear, loses his pistol and falls over the edge of a cliff. As he hangs there bleeding the Andrite emerges and Loris shoots it dead with the pistol Mike dropped. Later, Mike tells Em that his kind could colonize Earth peacefully, believing Em's race is not dissimilar to humans. Em says, \\"Unfortunately, we are.\\" as he steps into the light, revealing his true appearance; that of an intelligent ape.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), p. 230 Joseph Stefano rewrote 'Natural Selection' as there were too many costly aliens and visual effects called for, and that the testing procedures endured by Mike were too complicated, redundant or riddled with technical gibberish. He also felt Em's revelation as an ape was too similar to the end of another episode, \\"The Sixth Finger\\", and that The Outer Limits did not need another Earth take-over story. The story is very similar to a subsequent Star Trek episode titled \\"Arena\\". The plots of both Specht and Stefano's scripts also have elements in common with \\"Arena\\", the 1944 short story by Fredric Brown on which the Star Trek episode is based; it may have inspired Specht's story, but Stefano had not read it.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion, p. 231 The Caligo Alien mask (without its bulging eyes) and the taloned hands, made by Projects Unlimited, were reused (with an added hairy bodysuit) in the Star Trek pilot \\"The Cage\\". When Captain Pike attempts to strangle the Keeper he causes Pike to hallucinate that he is strangling a ferocious hairy alien instead (the creature is also seen in another cage near Pike's when he first awakes in captivity).The Outer Limits: The Official Companion, p. 233 This episode has no closing narration.

In this case Joseph Stefano was able to stretch the minimal footage, shot by Gerd Oswald, in the editing suite at KTTV. Thanks to the plot, which keeps jumping back to the murder of the Poker Dealer, Mike's frantic search for a place to hide in Laura's apartment building is seen three times, and many of the shots on the Arena planet are seen twice.

Mr. Zeno apparently uses his mental ability to make the man jump out of the window against his will. Plot Roy Benjamin and his wife, Aggie, are delighted, but puzzled when they meet Mr. Zeno, who explains that he is a government educator sent to cultivate the mind of their gifted son, Kenny. Roy becomes worried, however, when he discovers that Kenny is learning things that are not accepted by earthly science, including a device given to Kenny by Mr. Zeno that has the ability to control weather patterns. When Roy discovers that the government's Educational Enrichment program knows nothing about Mr. Zeno, he confronts the educator, only to discover that he is an alien, re-educating children in a plot to take over the world. Kenny now has super-human knowledge, and even possesses a few mental powers, having seemingly become loyal to the alien. Nonetheless, it is revealed in the end that Kenny knew of Mr. Zeno's plans since the beginning (Zeno having believed children to be more easily impressionable and more gullible than adults), and decided to feign loyalty in order to better thwart them. Managing to render the alien powerless by using the sound-wave-powered weather machine against him, removing the essential element from the atmosphere that would enable his kind to survive on Earth, Kenny forces Mr. Zeno to retreat back to his homeworld, Venon, thus ruining the alien's plans of conquest.

Balela, a Mediterranean bean salad Cultures around the world have their own version of bean salad. Balela is a Middle Eastern salad that typically uses chickpeas and black beans with tomatoes, herbs, and lemon juice. South American bean salad features poroto beans with tomatoes, parsley, oil and vinegar, and is served with grilled steak. It is common in some parts of the United States to refer to this sort of salad by the number of different beans it contains, e.g. \\"three bean salad\\" or \\"four bean salad.\\" The generic term \\"bean salad\\" can also be used to refer to related dishes, like variants containing starches such as barley, pasta, or rice.

Preparation and storage  The principal ingredients, the beans, have already been cooked and the vinaigrette helps to temporarily preserve the dish without refrigeration. If refrigerated, bean salad can last between three and five days and should be discarded when left out more than two hours.

It first aired on 13 April 1964, during the first season. It was remade in 1997 as part of the revived The Outer Limits series with a minor title change: \\"Feasibility Study\\". Opening narration :The planet Luminos: A minor planet, sultry and simmering. Incapacitated. Earth scientists have concluded that there could be no life on Luminos, that it is too close to its own sun, and that its inhabitants would be victimized by their own blighting atmosphere. But there is life on Luminos ‚Äî life that should resemble ours, but doesn't. Desperate life, suffering a great and terrible need. The Luminoids have begun to search the universe in an effort to gratify that need. They seek a planet on which life is healthy, vibrant, strong, and mobile. They need such people to do their work, to labor and slave for them, to manufacture their splendored dreams. The Luminoids need slaves, and they have chosen the planet off which their slaves will be abducted. Not too many at first, a neighborhood-full, perhaps. A neighborhood like mine or yours. Those who will be abducted sleep in dreamy ignorance, unaware that they are about to become the subjects of a grotesque and sophisticated experiment... a feasibility study. Plot The inhabitants of a six-block suburban area are abducted one night by an alien probe, using a means of teleportation to transport the entire neighborhood to another planet, Luminos. The intention of the Luminoids is to study the feasibility of enslaving the human race for manual labor on their planet, since Luminoids themselves suffer from a genetic disease which condemns them to become as immobile as rocks as they age. Initially, the humans are not aware they've been kidnapped, as the neighborhood appears normal. But a thick fog blankets the area, and the sun doesn't rise when it should. Eventually, one of the group is introduced to the Luminoid rulers, who are a hideous sight to behold. They make clear what their plans are and the punishment for disobedience, which is to be touched and contract the terrible disease. The abductees now realize they're trapped with no chance of ever returning home. They come to accept the fact that their lives are over. Full submission to the Luminoids cannot protect them from inadvertent infection. All that's left is defiance and the will to protect the rest of humanity. Forming a circle, they willfully contract the disease from one of their own party, making clear that mankind will choose death over slavery on Luminos. Closing narration :\\"Do not enter upon or cross this area. Do not touch or remove possibly radioactive dirt or rocks. If you have any knowledge concerning this disappearance, please contact your nearest police department.\\" It could have happened to any neighborhood. Had those who lived in this one been less human, less brave, it would have happened to all the neighborhoods of the Earth. Feasibility study ended. Abduction of human race: Infeasible.

It first aired on 20 April 1964, during the first season. The plot involves workers at a nuclear research plant wearing radiation suits, who are taken over by some odd glowing substance that fills their suits and causes them to act as puppets of the force inside. Mentioned in the episode are many modern physics concepts such as neutrinos, antimatter, quasi-stellar objects (at that time just discovered and perhaps mentioned here in TV fiction for the first time) and subatomic particles with the property of \\"strangeness\\" (a quantum property of matter which had been chosen a few years before by physicists, despite objection at the time that it was no more \\"strange\\" or odd than any other property of subatomic particles). The episode name is close to that of an actual Physical Review paper of 1956, titled \\"Cloud-Chamber Study of the Production and Decay of Strange Particles.\\" Opening narration :In recent years, nuclear physicists have discovered a strange world of subatomic particles, fragments of atoms smaller than the imagination can picture, fragments of materials which do not obey the laws of gravity. Antimatter composed of inside-out material; shadow-matter that can penetrate ten miles of lead shielding. Hidden deep in the heart of strange new elements are secrets beyond human understanding ‚Äì new powers, new dimensions, worlds within worlds, unknown. Plot While experimenting on subatomic particles, a team of physics researchers start a chain reaction that seemingly controls the researchers themselves. As one scientist after another is consumed and turned into nuclear 'zombies' by what seems to be a form of sentient particles from another dimension, the reaction grows towards a terrible climax, and the survivors fear they may be powerless to stop it. Just as the ever-expanding particles are about to engulf the lab and explode into an atomic cataclysm that could destroy the world, the head of the research facility calculates a formula to reverse the effects of the reaction, incorporates a random element, and succeeds in desensitizing the new lifeform, rendering it powerless. Closing narration :As Man explores the secrets of the universe, strange and inscrutable powers await him. And whether these powers are to become forces of destruction or forces of construction will ultimately depend upon simple but profound human qualities: Inspiration. Integrity. Courage.

He was the greatest of the Western Chalukya kings and had the longest reign in the dynasty. He earned the title Permadideva and Tribhuvanamalla (lit \\"lord of three worlds\\").Chopra, Ravindran and Subrahmanian, (2003), p.139, part 1 He had several queens who ably assisted him in administration. One of his queens, Chandala Devi, a princess from the Shilahara ruling family of Karad was called Abhinava Saraswati for her skills as an artist. Queen Kethala Devi administered the Siruguppa region and Savala Devi was in charge of an Agrahara in Naregal.Kamath (1980), pp.105‚Äì106 According to the historian Kamath, Vikramaditya VI was a \\"great king who ruled over South India\\" and he finds a \\"pride of place in Karnataka history\\". More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the Vijayanagara era.Kamath (1980), p.105 Vikramaditya VI is noted for his patronage of art and letters. His court was adorned with famous Kannada and Sanskrit poets.Sastri (1955), p. 174; Kamath (2001), p. 104‚Äì106 In Kannada, his brother prince Kirtivarma wrote Govaidya on veterinary science and the poet Brahmashiva wrote Samayaparikshe (\\"Analysis of the doctrine\\", c. 1125) and received the title Kavi Chakravarti (lit, \\"Emperor among poets\\")Kamath (1980), p. 115; Sastri (1955), p. 358 Noted Sanskrit scholars such as Bilhana who earned the title Vidyapati (\\"pundit\\") came to his court from faraway Kashmir and wrote a panegyric on the life of his patron king in Vikramankadevacharita. The poet compared his rule to Ramarajya (\\"Rama's Kingdom\\"). Vijnaneshwara the noted jurist in his court wrote Mitakshara, a commentary on Yagnavalkya Smriti (on Hindu family law). Of the king he wrote \\"A King like Vikramarka is neither to be seen nor heard of\\".Cousens (1921), p.12 Vikramaditya VI is known to be a Shaiva by faith. His rule saw prolific temple building activity. Notable constructions include the Mallikarjuna temple,Sinha (2000), p.142 the Mahadeva templeCousens (1921), p.101 the Kaitabheshvara templeHardy (1995), p335 and the Kalleshvara temple. According to historian Sen, the 50-year reign of Vikramaditya VI was overall a peaceful and prosperous one. Sen estimates at his peak Vikramaditya VI controlled a vast empire stretching from the Tumkur district and Cuddapah in the south to the Narmada river in the north, and up to the Khammam district and the Godavari district in the east and south-east.Sen (1999), p.387 Vikramaditya's rebellion, rise to power and Chola relations Vikramaditya displayed his military ambitions even as a prince, prior to 1068, during the rule of his father Someshvara I when he led successful military campaigns as far east as modern Bihar and Bengal.B.P. Sinha in George E. Somers (1977), p.214Sen (1999), p.282Majumdar, R. C. (1952), p.320 After his father's death, as soon as his elder brother prince Someshvara II who administered the Belavola-300 and Puligere-300 provinces came to the throne, Vikramaditya VI started to plan to overthrow him and contend with the growing Chola power. He achieved his ends with skillful opportunism and diplomacy: by making use of the Chola invasion of Gutti and Kampili and striking diplomatic relations with Virarajendra Chola, gaining the support his younger brother Jayasimha and of the Chalukya feudatories, the Pandyas of Ucchangi, the Seuna, the Hoysalas of Malnad, the Kadambas of Konkan and Hangal. Someshvara II had the support of the Kulothunga Chola I (also called Rajendra II of the Eastern Chalukya-Chola royal family of Vengi) and the Kadambas of Goa. This sudden change in diplomatic relations practically bifurcated the Chalukya kingdom into two halves, giving Vikramaditya VI independent rule over the southern half (Gangavadi). Vikramaditya married one of Virarajendra Chola's daughters bringing an age-old feud between the two kingdoms to a temporary end.Sastri (1955), p.171-172Kamath (1980), p.104 The balance of power changed again in 1069 with the death of Virarajendra Chola. Vikramaditya VI proceeded via Kanchi where he quelled a rebellion and installed his younger brother-in-law Athirajendra Chola on the throne at Gangaikonda Cholapuram. But this went against the designs of Kulottunga Chola I who had plans of his own. Kulothunga expelled the Vengi ruler Vijayaditya. In a civil uprising in the Chola capital, Athirajendra was killed making way for Kulothunga Chola I to crown himself the monarch of the Chola empire.Sastri (1955), pp.171‚Äì172 In 1070-72, when Vijayabahu revolted to rid Ceylon of the Chola rule and succeeded, Vikramaditya VI wasted no time in declaring the new king of Ceylon his \\"natural ally\\". By 1076, despite being surrounded by enemies at home (Someshvara II) and in Vengi and Chola country (Kulothunga Chola I), Vikramaditya VI successfully defeated his elder brother and took him captive. He then crowned himself the Chalukya monarch and began a new era, the Vikrama Varsha.Sastri (1955)Cousens (1926), p.11 Hoysala threat There was a rebellion by the emperor's younger brother Jayasimha, the viceroy of Banavasi, around c.1080-1082 which was quelled and the rebel pardoned.Sastri (1955), p.175 The real threat, however, was from the Hoysala dynasty who rose to prominence from the Malnad region in modern Karnataka. Their territory effectively acted as a buffer between the Chalukya and Chola kingdoms. For several decades, the Hoysalas had been faithful vassals of the Chalukyas. King Someshvara I (Vikramaditya's father) had taken a Hoysala princess as his queen. The Hoysala kings Vinayaditya, Ereyanga and Veera Ballala I had maintained cordial relations with Vikramaditya VI. But Ballala I's younger brother Vishnuvardhana, who according to historians Sastri and Kamath was a \\"great warrior\\" and an ambitious ruler had expansionist plans. He had the support of the Pandya ruler of Ucchangi and Kadamba king Jayakesi II of Goa. The Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana began to expand their territory initially by defeating the Cholas in the famous battle of Talakad in 1116 resulting in the Hoysala annexation of Gangavadi (part of modern Southern Karnataka).Sastri (1955), pp.174-175Kamath (1980), p.105Sen (1999), p.386Cousens (1926), p.11 It was only when Vishnuvardhana turned his attention to the north, conquered Nolambavadi, marched beyond the Tungabhadra river and reached Ballary and Kummata that Vikramaditya VI saw an imminent threat to his power. The Chalukya emperor dispatched his trusted generals Achugi II and Permadi of the Sinda family of Yerambarge (or Yelburga) to deal with the situation. After several pitched battles in Goa, Kannegala, Halasur and Hosavidu between c.1117-1122, Vishnuvardhana and his supporters had to accept Chalukya suzerainty. Success in Chola and Gurjara country From the beginning of his rule, Vikramaditya VI maintained the policy of interference in the affairs of Vengi and Kanchi. He invaded and captured Kanchi in 1085 and held it for a few years. He managed to conquer parts of Vengi in 1088. He held the Kollipakei-7000 province of Vengi for many years. Vengi came under his rule again from 1093 to 1099. The Cholas re-captured it in 1099. In 1115 Kulothunga Chola I recalled his son Vikrama Chola who was the viceroy of Vengi to focus on affairs in Kanchi. Encouraged by the Hoysala success against the Cholas at Talakad and utilising the vacuum in the leadership in Vengi, Vikramaditya VI sent his famous general Anantapala to invade Vengi which was duly conquered and came under his rule from 1118 to 1124. Western Chalukyan commanders are seen controlling some other parts of Telugu country also and the Chola influence over Vengi disappeared for many years. After Vikramaditya's death in 1126, the Cholas began a slow process of encroachment over Vengi. By 1133 Vikrama Chola was able to re-capture Vengi from Vikramaditya VI's mild son Someshvara III.Sastri (1955), pp.175-176Kamath (1980), p.105Sen (1999), pp.386-387 Before 1088, Vikramaditya VI subdued the recalcitrant Shilahara King Bhoja I and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri. He invaded Lata (modern Gujarat), plundered and burnt the royal capital of the Gurjara Chalukya King Karna, and stopped the advances of Kalachuri king Jajjaladeva of Ratnapur. He dealt firmly with the revolting Kadamba feudatory of Goa but gave his daughter Maila Devi in marriage to King Jayakeshi II.Kamath (1980), p.105Sen (1999), p.387 Gallery File:Old Kannada inscription (1083 AD) in Kalleshvara temple at Ambali.JPGOld Kannada inscription (c.1083) of King Vikramaditya VI, at the Kalleshvara Temple, Ambali File:Old Kannada inscription (c.1107 AD) of Kalyani (Western) Chalukya King Tribhuvanamalla Vikramaditya VI.jpgOld Kannada inscription (c.1107 AD) of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI File:Old Kannada inscription (c.1108 AD) of Kalyani (Western) Chalukya King Tribhuvanamalla Vikarmaditya VI.JPGOld Kannada inscription (c.1108 AD) of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI File:Old Kannada inscription (1112 CE) of King Vikramaditya VI in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi.jpgOld Kannada inscription (1112 CE) of King Vikramaditya VI in the Mahadeva temple at Itagi File:Old Kannada inscription (c.1122 AD) of Kalyani (Western) Chalukya King Tribhuvanamalla Vikramaditya VI.jpgOld Kannada inscription (c.1122 AD) of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI See also * Vikrama Chola * Vishnuvardhana Hoysala * The title Vikramaditya Notes References     * * Category:11th-century births Category:1126 deaths Category:Western Chalukya Empire Category:11th-century Indian monarchs Category:12th-century Indian monarchs ","title":"Vikramaditya VI"},{"id":"4151690","text":"Chicken salad is any salad with chicken as a main ingredient. Other common ingredients may include mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg, celery, onion, pepper, pickles (or pickle relish) and a variety of mustards. Description In the United States, \\"chicken salad\\" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing or cream cheese. Like tuna salad and egg salad, it may be served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or some combination of these. It may also be used for sandwiches. Typically it is made with leftover cooked or canned chicken. It may also refer to a garden salad with fried, grilled, or roasted chicken (usually cut up or diced) on top. In Europe and Asia the salad may be complemented by any number of dressings, or no dressing at all, and the salad constituents can vary from traditional leaves and vegetables, to pastas, couscous, noodles or rice. Early American chicken salad recipes can be found in 19th-century Southern cookbooks, including Sarah Rutledge's The Carolina Housewife: Or, House and Home (1847) and Abby Fisher's What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking (1881). Rutledge details a recipe for \\"A Salad To Be Eaten With Cold Meat Or Fowl\\" that explains how to make a mayonnaise from scratch, before adding it to cold meats (chicken and seafood). Abby Fisher similarly describes making a homemade mayonnaise, before adding it to chicken and white celery. One of the first American forms of chicken salad was served by Town Meats in Wakefield, Rhode Island, in 1863. The original owner, Liam Gray, mixed his leftover chicken with mayonnaise, tarragon, and grapes. This became such a popular item that the meat market was converted to a delicatessen.

He was a teacher in Guijuelo (Salamanca) & Piedrah√≠ta (√Åvila). His poetry is quite conservative both in its thematic and its structure: he defended tradition, family, race, catholic dogma or simple rural life. Life He was born into a peasant family that owned its own lands. He spent his childhood in his hometown, where he attended school. At 15, he left for Salamanca in order to go on with his studies. His first verses can be traced back to that early period. Simultaneously, he starts working in a textile warehouse. In 1888, he graduated for being a school teacher and he is assigned a working position in Guijuelo, about 20 km away from his hometown. After a brief stay in Guijuelo, he departs again for Madrid, this time for keeping on with his studies in the Escuela Normal Central (\\"Normal Central School\\"). He was to live there for a very short period, for the metropolis caused disgust in him (he actually mentioned it as 'Modern√≥polis' in some of his letters). After finishing his studies, he is sent to Piedrah√≠ta (town in the √Åvila province), where he puts his newly acquired pedagogic knowledge into practice. Such period of his life is characterised by a gloomy frame of mind, he signed the letters to his friend as \\"El Solitario\\" (\\"The solitary one\\"). In those years the young teacher develops his characteristic sad and melancholic personality, with profound religious beliefs (which he got from his mother, Bernarda), which can be perceived in his poems. It wasn't until he met his wife, Desideria, (who she mentions as \\"Mi vaquerilla\\" (my little cowgirl)) that he undergoes a radical change, which becomes even deeper from his wedding on, the 26th of January 1898, in Plasencia. He resigns from his job as a teacher and sets up his new residence in Guijo de Granadilla, in the C√°ceres province, where he administers the dehesa El Tejar, property of his wife's uncle. It's there where he can find the time and tranquility for shaping his poetic style. As his first son is born (Jes√∫s, 1898) he writes El Cristu Benditu, the first of his famous Extreme√±as. He died on 6 January 1905, a victim of pneumonia. The city hall of Guijo de Granadilla currently still maintains the house in which he lived, as a museum devoted to him, where his manuscripts and personal objects are displayed (all of which were donated by his heirs). Works His poetry cannot be included within the modernist movement of that time, for it contains many of the more conservative elements present both in the structure and topics of the poems: he defends tradition, family, lineage, catholic dogma or the virtue of the peasant's life. Besides, his poetry contains archaic words aplenty, which had already fallen out of use by that time, which convey manners and customs of a former epoch.

It first aired on May 4, 1964, and was the final episode of the first season. It was filmed in a dual format as both a regular episode of The Outer Limits and as a pilot episode for a possible series called The Unknown. The opening and closing narration listed here are only in The Unknown version and not in the broadcast The Outer Limits episode. There are plot differences between the two versions as well. Opening narration (for The Unknown) There is a fear that is unlike all other fears. It has a special, clammy chill, a deadly gift for inspiring deeper, darker dread. It is the fear of unentered rooms, of bends in lonely roads. It is the fear of the phone call in the middle of the night, of the stranger you recognize, perhaps from a nightmare. It is the fear of the unexpected, the unfamiliar. It is the fear of... THE UNKNOWN. Plot The plot involves two women who kill a blackmailer. Driving through the countryside with the body in the trunk, looking for a good place to bury him, they take refuge from a storm in a house containing a blind man and a strange young inventor who is experimenting with time. Unlike the traditional \\"time travel\\" devices, this one is intended to \\"tilt the cycles of time\\" and bring the dead back to life...which is what happens to the murdered blackmailer. Detailed synopsis The story begins in the French countryside, where a car can be seen driving at high speed. The driver, Andre Pavan a wealthy playboy, is kissing his girlfriend Kassia Paine while Kassia's friend Leonora Edmond sits in the back seat. Andre decides to stop at a small lake for a swim, stripping down to his swim trunks. He orders the women to make him a drink, and they do so ‚Äì but lace the cocktail shaker with a leaf from the deadly Thanatos plant. Andre, with jovial cruelty, makes the women serve his drink while he stands in the water, ruining their \\"fine stilletto heels\\" as he puts it. He drinks a toast to blackmailing Leonora's father in London, and dies immediately, but with a strange smile on his face. The women load Andre's corpse and clothing into the trunk of the car and drive in search of a place to bury it. Leonora is unnerved by the whole thing, and becomes more nervous after they encounter a funeral procession. When night falls and a thunderstorm starts, Leonora's nerves are on edge. Kassia tries to calm her, but then the trunk comes open. They stop the car to check on Andre, who hasn't moved. But a lightning flash makes it seem to Leonora as though he had blinked, and she runs off, frightened. Kassia catches up to her and tries again to calm her, but both women see a shadowy figure standing nearby. This is too much for Leonora, who runs to a nearby house. A blind man, Monsieur Colas, answers the door and lets the women in from the storm. Colas explains that \\"Mr. Hobart\\" is not at home, but will return soon. The house is spacious but oddly decorated: the most prominent features are a broken clock with a clown face, and a toy tightrope walker. Leonora seems particularly drawn to the tightrope walker. At last, Tone Hobart, an odd inventor, comes home. He apologizes to the women, explaining it was he they saw outside. He goes upstairs to his room, asking not to be disturbed as he works on his invention. As he opens the door, Andre's corpse can be seen placed on a strange device. Kassia decides to check on the car ‚Äì and Andre, leaving Leonora alone. Leonora looks on in mesmerized fascination at the tightrope walker. Hobart enters the room and asks her about what happened to Andre. Leonora answers truthfully, seemingly under hypnosis. When Hobart \\"snaps her out of it\\", he invites her upstairs to see Andre live again and be free of her guilt over the murder. He explains he'd created a device that can \\"tilt\\" the past into the present and resurrect the dead, including himself. Reluctantly, Leonora agrees to see the device. They come to Hobart's room ‚Äì which is dominated by the time tilter, a large collection of clocks all connected by wires to a pole in the center of the room. The loud ticking is too much for Leonora, who runs back downstairs and faints. Hobart is more interested in the fact that Andre is not there. When Leonora awakens, Kassia has returned. Hobart has gone outside to look for Andre ‚Äì and takes a moment to look through the window from outside, unnervingly. Colas explains, with some indignation, that he is not Hobart's servant, as the women had supposed, but the house's owner, and Hobart is his boarder. Colas explains further that Hobart had apparently died, and when his body was placed on the time tilter, he came back to life. The women decide to leave but get no further than the front door when they see the car has backed up to the entrance, the trunk opens and a fully clothed Andre pops out, smiling and holding his empty cocktail glass. He cheerfully asks, \\"Refill?\\" This is too much for Leonora, who runs upstairs into what seems to be an empty room. Colas goes outside to find Hobart, and finds him lying in the road between a set of tire tracks, but unhurt. Hobart now realizes that he has unleashed a monster and comes back to the house to correct that mistake. Surprisingly, Kassia and Andre are kissing passionately. Andre takes a moment to ask how he died, and when Kassia tells him they used a leaf from the Thanatos plant. Andre is still intent on blackmail. Kassia tries to dissuade him as Andre is already rich. Andre replies, \\"I'm loud rich. I want to be quiet rich.\\" Kassia says one has to be born to that and comments on Andre's motivations. Andre cheerfully replies, \\"You've pierced the heart of my psychic disorder,\\" but remains intent on carrying out his plot. Hobart loads a pistol, intending to force Andre to return to the time tilter. Andre is more amused by this than anything else, especially when Hobart becomes enthralled by the tightrope walker toy, allowing Andre to disarm him. Andre fires a shot into the easy chair, inches from Hobart's head. He tosses the pistol aside, singing \\"London Bridge is falling down\\" and drives off with Kassia. They do not get far, though. Kassia leaps out of the car and Andre stops, backs up, and then tries to run over Kassia as she lies in the road. Kassia is able to leap out of the way and the car crashes, killing Andre again, with an odd smile on his face. Hobart realizes he has failed and goes upstairs, seeing Leonora near an open briefcase. Inside is a letter that Hobart wrote when he was a boy, which Hobart reads to Leonora from memory, apologizing to his father for leaving school to find a way to bring dead people (initially his mother) back to life. (There is an inconsistency here, as the camera clearly shows the words on the letter saying that Hobart actually apologized to his father for \\"killing the cat\\".) Hobart asks Leonora to destroy the time tilter after he has used it to return himself to the past, where he is dead. Leonora panics, runs into the time tilter room and closes the door behind her. Hobart is able to open the door and push Leonora away from the device. He steps into it and disappears. Production The show was filmed with two endings and was allotted double the normal production time. In the pilot version: Andre reveals there is no Thanatos plant, and was thus not dead; the time tilter did not in fact work; Hobart was not dead but merely in a coma; and lastly, Kassia uses the pistol to kill Hobart, thinking he is attacking Leonora. Closing narration (for The Unknown) Murder, madness, and other lurking horrors are the raw certainties that await you in the depths of the Unknown. And no switch of time, no twist of plan can cancel your meeting with it. For some night, in some blind panic, you will venture into the world of dark reality. And on that night, you will keep your rendez-vous with... THE UNKNOWN. Technique The episode is considered an unusual one, even for The Outer Limits. More than almost any other, it is filled with weird camera angles, atmospheric photography, gothic sets, creepy music (much of which surfaced later in the TV series The Invaders), and offbeat writing and performances, giving the episode something of an \\"art house movie\\" feel.

The suburb forms the western part of Wembley and is centred around west of Wembley Central railway station. Sudbury is an historical area having once extended from the 'South Manor- Sudbury' (thought to have been on Harrow Hill) to the area that is now known as Wembley Central. Much of the land that once formed Sudbury Common until the 1930s has now been developed as a relatively green residential suburb of London. Much of Sudbury was once in the ownership of the Barham family who give their name to a number of local landmarks including Barham School and Barham Park. Today, Sudbury covers a narrow area with Wembley to its east, North Wembley to its north, Sudbury Hill to the west, and North Greenford, in the London Borough of Ealing, directly south. Its section in the borough of Harrow is around Sudbury Court Drive, which is technically located within North Wembley. History=Early history Sudbury, in the parish of Harrow, was in the Hundred of Gore in the former County of Middlesex, and was one of ten hamlets which formed the larger of the Archbishop of Canterbury's two Harrow manors.Sudbury Middlesex: A Short History and Guide to the Parish Church of St Andrews (1968) Wembley History Society The road to London and the proximity of Harrow School enhanced its status. Its upkeep was supported in part by Sir John Lyon, founder of Harrow School. Georgian era Wealthy sisters and local philanthropists the Copland Sisters after which many local landmarks from streets to schools were named commissioned Sir George Gilbert Scott, the architect who later designed the Albert Memorial and St Pancras station, to build the Church of St John in 1846 which marks the easterly extent of Sudbury. Opposite is Copland House, now a home for the elderly. The Coplands built Sudbury Lodge in the grounds of their father's home in Crabbs House. This would later change hands and be owned by another wealthy and philanthropic family; the Barhams. During the late Georgian period Sudbury was the home of the Express Dairy Company Limited run by the Barham Family. It was the first British Dairy to use glass milk bottles, the first to use milk churns and glass lined tanks to carry 30 0000 gallons of milk by train into London every night and one of the first to introduce pasteurisation to sterilise milk. It even supplied milk to Queen Victoria. For his services the owner and managing director George Barham Sr. was knighted in 1904. He died in 1913 leaving his business to his son Titus Barham. Nineteenth century to modern times Jubilee Gardens Titus Barham died aged 77 years in 1937. On the day of his death he had been due to be made the first Mayor of the new ward. He left considerable lands for the benefit of the public in this rural area. His former mansion in Barham Park was demolished in 1956. Much of the area originally given over to arable land for use by dairy herds was lost during the interwar period. Urbanisation began in earnest in the late 19th century with the arrival of the railways. Sudbury town became part of the London commuter belt. The demand for housing was such that within the short interwar period much of the area became urbanised. Despite this it remains a relatively green area mainly due to strict planning control. In 1928 land was given over for the Vale Farm sports fields. There has been a swimming pool on the site since 1932. Parks and recreation Barham Park Barham Park is a landscaped garden dating from the 18th century. The foundations of Sudbury Lodge, formerly the home of George Barham, founder of Express Dairies, still stand amidst his walled gardens. Also in the park is a surviving Georgian building, formerly Crabb's House, which is now used as a library. The park has a floral display, three ponds, a conifer plantation, a large and modern children's play area, and a war memorial. Sport Sudbury was the former home of London Wasps rugby union team who moved there in 1923. During the late nineties they relocated to Loftus Road to share with QPR before moving to Buckinghamshire in 2001, and subsequently Coventry in 2014, and the ground at Sudbury Town has been developed for housing. The club house still stands and is still considered the club's spiritual home. A large swimming pool, outdoor tennis courts, cricket pitches and nets, AstroTurf pitches and a sports complex are located at Vale Farm. The complex is also the home ground of Wembley F.C., and contains a stadium with a 2,000 seat capacity. Other sports clubs in the district include Sudbury Golf Club, Sudbury Squash and Tennis Club, and Sudbury Court Running Club. The Lyons' Sports Club hosted the field hockey preliminaries for the 1948 Summer Olympics.1948 Summer Olympics official report. p. 46. Historical buildings Walled Garden, Barham Park In the 19th century Sudbury was a large meadow stretching from Wembley to Harrow Hill. It was dotted by many farm houses and grand residences. A few buildings from this era still remain and a notable example is Hundred Elms Farm of Elms Lane to the North of Sudbury Town. Now a residential care home, the actual building is well maintained but is not open to the public. Religious buildings Church of St. John, Western Aspect Sudbury Methodist Church is situated opposite Butlers Green, and St. Andrew's Church of England (COE), St. George's Catholic and the Church of St. John the Evangelist are located several hundred yards further up the Harrow Road. St George's was designed by prominent British \\"Arts & Crafts\\" architect James Leonard Williams (d. 1926); his other work include Royal School of Needlework, All Saints Church in Oxted, The Pound House in Totteridge, etc. St Andrew's Church started its life in 1904 as a mission church to Harrow Parish Church. The new church was designed by Arnold Mitchell (1863‚Äì1944) as part of the Harrow Church Extension Scheme, at a nett cost of ¬£2,000 . The new mission church was dedicated on Wednesday 10 May 1905, by the Suffragan Bishop of Islington, and the first vicar was Reverend A M Bashford who served from 1910 to 1922. The church served as a place of worship until 1926, it is now used as the church hall. In June 1911 plans were laid to build a new church capably of holding 500 parishioners, the foundation stone was laid on 4 April 1925, and the new Church of St Andrew was Consecrated by the Lord Bishop of London on 20 March 1926. The first vicar was the Reverend A Stone who served the parish from 1922-1930 Egan,H (1968) Sudbury Middlesex: A Short History and Guide to the Parish Church of St Andrew Middlesex: Wembley History Society The church of St John was designed by Gilbert Scott and originally built in the 1800s. It has had at least three extensions since then. Over the past year extensive work has been completed in the Church of St John's. This church, located at the eastern edge of Sudbury where it borders Wembley, dates from the Georgian era. Through the late 80s and mid 90s, it had fallen into a state of disrepair. Significant subsidence had threatened its foundations. Thanks to charitable works the extensive underpinning work on the historic church has been completed, saving it for future generations. Phase 2 of the restoration contracted to building firm BRICKSTONE has restored the rusted and broken ornate railings and gate to its former glory. Phase 3 involving restoration of the Lychgate was completed in time for the mayoral visit on remembrance Sunday 2009. Demography As of the 2011 census, Indians were the largest ethnic at 31%, followed by 17% Other Asian and 11% White British. The most spoken foreign language is Gujarati, main language of 2,072 residents.

Falsely believing that the saucer contains nuclear material, the authorities decide on a wild scheme: they recruit Louis Mace (Robert Duvall), a disaffected CIA agent, to infiltrate the ship. Genetically modified to pass as an alien, Mace finds that he has unique insight into the alien \\"invaders\\" nature, the genetic material that has been used to modify his appearance seemingly taking precedence over his human nature. He also begins to question his allegiance, and eventually sides with the aliens, finding out that they're benevolent and have no desire to come in contact with humans in any way, being simply stranded on Earth after their ship's engine broke down. Accepting to lend their trust to Mace and acknowledging him as one of them, the aliens propose that Mace return to their home planet with them. Torn between his desire to be free and his loyalty towards his superiors, Mace first reacts aggressively, killing one of the two aliens, but he eventually realizes the cruelty of his act and feels remorse for showing these harmless visitors what dark instincts inhabit the human nature. It is also implied that the alien that Mace killed was the one whose DNA had been used to modify Mace's anatomy; effectively making him a duplicate of the creature. The remaining alien nonetheless forgives him and allows him to leave Earth with them. At first distressed by that choice, Mace's superior eventually allows him to do so, believing this would be a chance for Mace to be at last free of his condition.

The procedure replaces the head of the femur and the acetabulum with prosthetic implants. Because animals under about carry their own weight with little strain on each leg, hip modification surgeries are often sufficient to restore hip function in many cases. As a result, while hip replacement on animals can be seen in any animal of any size, from cats upwards, it is most often performed in the medium-large breeds of dogs. An animal suffering from hip dysplasia may have been in some degree of chronic pain all its life from a very young age but mat show no overt sign of pain. Rather, they have adapted to the pain over an extended period, and learned to live with it. As a result, in many animals, successful hip replacement is gives animals a level of playfulness and happiness not previously seen. As with all surgeries, results vary, and there is both risk and uncertainty involved. Implant material Animal hip replacements are usually made from the same material as human replacements were, historically, made‚Äîa metal (cobalt chrome or titanium) femoral component, and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular component. Since animals have a shorter life than humans, their hip replacements can safely be assumed to be lifelong and will not wear out or need replacing. By contrast, human hip replacements are sometimes deferred until older, to avoid the possible need for replacement later on in life. Considerations and aftercare Other treatments may give a good quality of life with fewer attendant risks. Surgery for dogs, as with humans, is a final alternative when non-invasive methods are unable to treat a condition, since they are irreversible and carry risk. Conditions such as hip dysplasia and arthritis can often be treated with appropriate medications that help the body handle pain, inflammation, or joint wear and tear. Animals which are prospective candidates for hip replacement should have no other spinal, neural, or rear leg abnormalities, in order to be significantly helped by a hip joint procedure. Since the reduced joint mobility seen in conditions such as dysplasia may result in loss of muscle mass and quality as a dog ages, there is often an advantage in having hip replacement whilst the dog is at an early age, while muscle is more likely to re-develop, rather than in old age when convalescence is longer and more difficult. However this is a major surgery taking several months to fully recuperate, involving the large muscle groups of the hips, and is irreversible. Whilst it has a high success rate (circa 95%) in the hands of a good surgical team, even in older dogs, it is therefore often recommended to avoid it until quality of life is seriously affected beyond the capability of medication to control. Thus the benefits of hip replacement at a younger age must be set against the risks and the existing quality of life attainable with medication, lifestyle change, or non- surgical handling. Usually a course of medications is tried in any event, to assess how the animal responds to them. An animal will usually need a minimum of 2 months convalescence to recover from hip replacement surgery. This allows the new artificial acetabular cup (the caput, or hip socket) to bond properly to the pelvis (hip bone). During this period, the animal must be restricted to carefully limited mobility and exercise, as the joint is still bonding and new bone is being laid down. So animals must be prevented from over exercise, or from climbing, jumping or putting any strain whatsoever beyond gentle use, on the joint. The animal must also be kept away from slippery or smooth flooring such as tiles, marble or polished wood since these put considerable lateral (sideways) strain on the hips. This can be a difficult process for a dog as many usual behaviors must be strictly prevented for this period. A pet crate may be a sensible precaution, if in doubt. Usually, in the case of a double replacement (both hips), whenever possible one hip is operated on at a time and allowed to heal before the other is replaced. This ensures that there is always the maximum natural support during the healing process, although bilateral (double) hip replacements are possible and can be performed if appropriate. Variations in vets' views Some vets will recommend hip replacement at any age over puberty, if suitable conditions are met. Others view it as a surgery to be avoided at all costs unless there is no alternative. The issue here appears to be threefold: consideration of cost, avoidance of surgery where possible, and historical reasons that this has usually in the past been a treatment afforded older dogs and not usually considered for young and middle aged animals or less advanced conditions. Aftercare recommendations vary also. Some vets recommend as little as 1‚Äì2 days in hospital after replacement, others as much as 4‚Äì7 days. All vets agree that movement must be restricted for a significant time after surgery. Some suggest that normal activity can be resumed after 5 weeks, others state it is unsafe until after 8 weeks. In both cases, a cautious approach will probably do no harm, if there is doubt. History The first feline hip replacement in the New York area was performed in March 2007.

Purpose This technique of orchestration is used to provide composers with the option of allowing a diverse group of voices or instrumentalists the ability to perform their music.\\"\\"Grainger, Percy.\\" by Malcolm Gillies and David Pear, Grove Music Online An example of this is when a composer or arranger provides extra sheet music parts so a flute quartet (four flutes) can play the same piece as a group comprising two flutes, alto flute and bass flute, resulting a choir-like sound. In other words, a subtle re-engineering of the original work. This technique involves making extra and/or interchangeable musical parts which provide substitutions for more or fewer musicians depending on what is required for an individual performance. This also allows a musical work to be played in smaller communities where the required instruments may not always be available. One of the main tenets of elastic scoring is that the new arrangement preserve as much as possible the original interval relationship (to the closest octave) between notes while not being overly concerned with timbre (tone colour) or number of instruments. Timbre is the aspect of music varied most through changing instrument or number of instruments. Techniques Besides providing alternative instrumentation in the form of sheet music parts, the elastic scoring concept allows three subsets of scoring music. Lateral scoring Lateral scoring can be said to have occurred when a piece of music is set for one or more instruments from the original number of instruments. An example of this is if a piece of music set for flute and piano is re-scored for clarinet and piano. In this instance, the intervallic relationships remain the same, but the tone colour has changed. Expansion scoring Expansion scoring is a style of arranging or orchestration that lets composers and arrangers enlarge the original work from a smaller score to a larger one. An example of this is when a string quartet is expanded to become a piece for string orchestra. Contraction scoring Contraction scoring lets composers and arrangers reduce the original work from a larger score to a smaller score, such as when an orchestral work is reduced to piano part. The resulting piano score is more commonly known as a piano reduction.

He currently tours under the name Badfinger in the United Kingdom. CareerIndian Summer and Ross Jackson formed his first professional rock band, named Indian Summer, in 1969. The band released a debut album, Indian Summer, on Neon Records in 1971, but disbanded the following year in the wake of business difficulties. Jackson and bandmate Alan Ross decided to develop another band, named Ross, in 1973. The band released two albums on RSO Records: Ross in 1973, and The Pit and the Pendulum in 1974. Despite touring extensively in the United States with Eric Clapton, the band failed to capture an audience. Directly after completing studio sessions in Los Angeles, Jackson left the group. Badfinger 1974 Badfinger was a British rock band that, in their most successful lineup, consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Joey Molland. The band evolved from an earlier group named The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David \\"Dai\\" Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. The Iveys were the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968. Over the next five years the band recorded five albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution. The band renamed themselves Badfinger and in 1969 Griffiths left and was replaced by Molland. In 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \\"Come and Get It\\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney), \\"No Matter What\\", \\"Day After Day\\" (produced by George Harrison) and \\"Baby Blue\\", the latter of which - in 2013 - made a resurgence onto the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 14 after it was featured in the finale of the television series Breaking Bad. Their song \\"Without You\\" has been covered many times, including a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson. After Apple Records folded, Badfinger signed to Warner Bros. Records, but Polley's financial machinations resulted in internal friction that soon caused Ham to quit Badfinger, to be replaced by Bob Jackson on keyboard and guitar, Ham rejoined and Molland then left the band instead. However, a lawsuit filed by Warner's music publishing arm against Polley over missing escrow account money led Warner to withdraw Badfinger's 1974 album Wish You Were Here from the market seven weeks after its release, which effectively cut off the band's income. Warner's then refused to accept (or pay the band for) Badfinger's next album, Head First (which was the final album that would feature Pete Ham and Tom Evans as Badfinger), because of the dispute with Polley, leaving the band destitute. Three days before his 28th birthday, on 24 April 1975, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself, leaving a note that included damning comments about Polley. Over the next three years, the surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits, which tied up the songwriters' royalty payments for years. The Badfinger albums Airwaves (1979) and Say No More (1981) (both of which excluded both Gibbins and Jackson) floundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between cooperation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, \\"I wanna be where he is.\\" On 19 November 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging. The Dodgers Badfinger disbanded following Peter Ham's suicide in 1975. Jackson remained in contact with Evans, and the two formed a band named The Dodgers in 1976. The Dodgers released a handful of singles and one album by 1977, but that year Jackson was released by the band following management problems. The Searchers and The Byron Band Jackson was hired by The Searchers in 1979, contributing to the group's tours and two subsequent album releases, The Searchers (1979) and Play For Today (1980). In 1980, Jackson and Mel Collins joined The Byron Band that had been formed by Uriah Heep's former lead singer. Jackson departed from the band in 1981, after the band recorded the album On The Rocks for Creole Records. Badfinger 1982 Jackson reteamed with Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins in 1982 to form a new Badfinger lineup, touring and recording exclusively in the United States. However, Evans committed suicide in late 1983, upon which Jackson disbanded Badfinger. He later invited Joey Molland to join him and Gibbins for another Badfinger outing in 1984 for a specialty tour in the United States. Although well received, the lineup did not last. Jackson began concentrating on writing and recording, making home recordings for demonstration records but not touring. The Fortunes Jackson appeared on two CDs in the 1990s: 7 Park Avenue and Golders Green, adding parts to posthumous releases by Pete Ham. He was subsequently hired by The Fortunes in 1995, and he remained with the group off and on for the next ten years, releasing three albums and performing on several tours. On 18 May 2006, Jackson rejoined the Fortunes and has toured extensively with them ever since. The band's Past & Present theatre shows featured many Badfinger songs and anecdotes. Jackson played on several albums, and appeared in the United Kingdom, Australia, Dubai, Las Vegas, Hong Kong, Netherlands and Belgium. The band also successfully played the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Netherlands, and Sweden during 2009. Other activities Peter Ham Blue Plaque In 2000, Jackson finally succeeded in getting Snapper Records to issue the 1974 recordings for the Badfinger album Head First, along with personal demos, as a double CD package. Various outings have included sessions alongside Pete Brown, Jack Bruce, Jeff Beck, Andy Fairweather Low, The Motors, and many others. Jackson and Tom Evans joined a side project, Cheetah, and performed at Mide Festival, France. In 2013, Jackson organised and performed at the unveiling of the Pete Ham Blue Plaque for Swansea Council, celebrating the achievements of Ham and Badfinger.

Great-circle navigation or orthodromic navigation (related to orthodromic course; from the Greek ŒøœÅŒ∏√≥œÇ, right angle, and Œ¥œÅ√≥ŒºŒøœÇ, path) is the practice of navigating a vessel (a ship or aircraft) along a great circle. Such routes yield the shortest distance between two points on the globe. Course Figure 1. The great circle path between (œÜ1, Œª1) and (œÜ2, Œª2). The great circle path may be found using spherical trigonometry; this is the spherical version of the inverse geodesic problem. If a navigator begins at P1 = (œÜ1,Œª1) and plans to travel the great circle to a point at point P2 = (œÜ2,Œª2) (see Fig. 1, œÜ is the latitude, positive northward, and Œª is the longitude, positive eastward), the initial and final courses Œ±1 and Œ±2 are given by formulas for solving a spherical triangle :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tan\\\\alpha_1&=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\sin\\\\lambda_{12}}{ \\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\phi_2-\\\\sin\\\\phi_1\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\cos\\\\lambda_{12}},\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha_2&=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\lambda_{12}}{-\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\sin\\\\phi_1+\\\\sin\\\\phi_2\\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\cos\\\\lambda_{12}},\\\\ \\\\end{align} where Œª12 = Œª2 ‚àí Œª1In the article on great-circle distances, the notation ŒîŒª = Œª12 and ŒîœÉ = œÉ12 is used. The notation in this article is needed to deal with differences between other points, e.g., Œª01. and the quadrants of Œ±1,Œ±2 are determined by the signs of the numerator and denominator in the tangent formulas (e.g., using the atan2 function). The central angle between the two points, œÉ12, is given by :\\\\tan\\\\sigma_{12}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\phi_2-\\\\sin\\\\phi_1\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\cos\\\\lambda_{12})^2 + (\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\sin\\\\lambda_{12})^2}}{\\\\sin\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\phi_2+\\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\cos\\\\phi_2\\\\cos\\\\lambda_{12}}. (The numerator of this formula contains the quantities that were used to determine tanŒ±1.) The distance along the great circle will then be s12 = RœÉ12, where R is the assumed radius of the earth and œÉ12 is expressed in radians. Using the mean earth radius, R = R1 ‚âà yields results for the distance s12 which are within 1% of the geodesic distance for the WGS84 ellipsoid. Finding way-points To find the way-points, that is the positions of selected points on the great circle between P1 and P2, we first extrapolate the great circle back to its node A, the point at which the great circle crosses the equator in the northward direction: let the longitude of this point be Œª0 ‚Äî see Fig 1\\\\. The azimuth at this point, Œ±0, is given by :\\\\tan\\\\alpha_0 = \\\\frac {\\\\sin\\\\alpha_1 \\\\cos\\\\phi_1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha_1\\\\sin^2\\\\phi_1}}. Let the angular distances along the great circle from A to P1 and P2 be œÉ01 and œÉ02 respectively. Then using Napier's rules we have : \\\\tan\\\\sigma_{01} = \\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\phi_1}{\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1} \\\\qquad(If œÜ1 = 0 and Œ±1 = œÄ, use œÉ01 = 0). This gives œÉ01, whence œÉ02 = œÉ01 + œÉ12. The longitude at the node is found from : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tan\\\\lambda_{01} &= \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_0\\\\sin\\\\sigma_{01}}{\\\\cos\\\\sigma_{01}},\\\\ \\\\lambda_0 &= \\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_{01}. \\\\end{align} Figure 2. The great circle path between a node (an equator crossing) and an arbitrary point (œÜ,Œª). Finally, calculate the position and azimuth at an arbitrary point, P (see Fig. 2), by the spherical version of the direct geodesic problem.,\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\lambda_{12} &= \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\sin\\\\alpha_1} {\\\\cos\\\\phi_1\\\\cos\\\\sigma_{12} - \\\\sin\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1},\\\\ \\\\lambda_2 &= \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_{12},\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha_2 &= \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\alpha_1} {\\\\cos\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\tan\\\\phi_1\\\\sin\\\\sigma_{12}}. \\\\end{align} The solution for way-points given in the main text is more general than this solution in that it allows way-points at specified longitudes to be found. In addition, the solution for œÉ (i.e., the position of the node) is needed when finding geodesics on an ellipsoid by means of the auxiliary sphere.}} Napier's rules give : {\\\\color{white}.\\\\,\\\\qquad)}\\\\tan\\\\phi = \\\\frac {\\\\cos\\\\alpha_0\\\\sin\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\cos^2\\\\sigma + \\\\sin^2\\\\alpha_0\\\\sin^2\\\\sigma}}, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tan(\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_0) &= \\\\frac {\\\\sin\\\\alpha_0\\\\sin\\\\sigma}{\\\\cos\\\\sigma},\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha &= \\\\frac {\\\\tan\\\\alpha_0}{\\\\cos\\\\sigma}. \\\\end{align} The atan2 function should be used to determine œÉ01, Œª, and Œ±. For example, to find the midpoint of the path, substitute œÉ = (œÉ01 + œÉ02); alternatively to find the point a distance d from the starting point, take œÉ = œÉ01 + d/R. Likewise, the vertex, the point on the great circle with greatest latitude, is found by substituting œÉ = +œÄ. It may be convenient to parameterize the route in terms of the longitude using :\\\\tan\\\\phi = \\\\cot\\\\alpha_0\\\\sin(\\\\lambda-\\\\lambda_0). Latitudes at regular intervals of longitude can be found and the resulting positions transferred to the Mercator chart allowing the great circle to be approximated by a series of rhumb lines. The path determined in this way gives the great ellipse joining the end points, provided the coordinates (\\\\phi,\\\\lambda) are interpreted as geographic coordinates on the ellipsoid. These formulas apply to a spherical model of the earth. They are also used in solving for the great circle on the auxiliary sphere which is a device for finding the shortest path, or geodesic, on an ellipsoid of revolution; see the article on geodesics on an ellipsoid. Example Compute the great circle route from Valpara√≠so, œÜ1 = ‚àí33¬∞, Œª1 = ‚àí71.6¬∞, to Shanghai, œÜ2 = 31.4¬∞, Œª2 = 121.8¬∞. The formulas for course and distance give Œª12 = ‚àí166.6¬∞,Œª12 is reduced to the range [‚àí180¬∞, 180¬∞] by adding or subtracting 360¬∞ as necessary Œ±1 = ‚àí94.41¬∞, Œ±2 = ‚àí78.42¬∞, and œÉ12 = 168.56¬∞. Taking the earth radius to be R = 6371 km, the distance is s12 = 18743 km. To compute points along the route, first find Œ±0 = ‚àí56.74¬∞, œÉ1 = ‚àí96.76¬∞, œÉ2 = 71.8¬∞, Œª01 = 98.07¬∞, and Œª0 = ‚àí169.67¬∞. Then to compute the midpoint of the route (for example), take œÉ = (œÉ1 + œÉ2) = ‚àí12.48¬∞, and solve for œÜ = ‚àí6.81¬∞, Œª = ‚àí159.18¬∞, and Œ± = ‚àí57.36¬∞. If the geodesic is computed accurately on the WGS84 ellipsoid, the results are Œ±1 = ‚àí94.82¬∞, Œ±2 = ‚àí78.29¬∞, and s12 = 18752 km. The midpoint of the geodesic is œÜ = ‚àí7.07¬∞, Œª = ‚àí159.31¬∞, Œ± = ‚àí57.45¬∞. Gnomonic chart A straight line drawn on a gnomonic chart would be a great circle track. When this is transferred to a Mercator chart, it becomes a curve. The positions are transferred at a convenient interval of longitude and this is plotted on the Mercator chart.

It opened the second season of shows on September 19, 1964. For the second season, Ben Brady took over as producer from Joseph Stefano. This is the first of two episodes written by Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction author Harlan Ellison, and is adapted from his 1957 short story \\"Soldier from Tomorrow.\\" Plot Eighteen hundred years in the future, two infantrymen clash on a battlefield. A random energy weapon strikes both, and they are hurled into a time vortex. While one soldier is trapped in the matrix of time, the other, Qarlo Clobregnny (Michael Ansara), materializes on a city street in the United States in the year 1964. Qarlo is soon captured and interrogated by Tom Kagan (Lloyd Nolan), a philologist, and his origin is eventually discovered. Qarlo has been trained for one purpose - to kill the enemy, and that is all he knows. Progress is made in \\"taming\\" him after Kagan translates his seemingly unintelligible language - \\"Nims qarlo clobregnny prite arem aean teaan deao\\" - into colloquial English...\\"(My) name is Qarlo Clobregnny, private, RM EN TN DO\\"; his name, rank and serial letters, which is what any soldier would reveal if captured by the enemy. After a short time in captivity, Qarlo comes to live with the Kagan family, despite the reluctance expressed by Tom Kagan's government associates. However, the time eddy holding the enemy soldier slowly weakens. Finally, he materializes fully, and tracks Qarlo to the Kagan home. In a final hand-to-hand battle, Qarlo kills the enemy soldier, but the question is posed whether he sacrifices his life just to kill the enemy or to save the Kagan family he has become attached to. Production Interiors were shot at Paramount Studios. Qarlo's \\"War Zone\\" was shot on the Paramount Sunset stage, a gigantic stage the size of three stages put together. A sky cyclorama ran all the way round it and a horizon line of mountains was placed in front of that in diminished perspective. A fog machine provided the landscape with a smokey haziness. The gun shop scene was filmed on the Paramount Backlot, on New York Street.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (Ace Trade, 1986), page 295. The Terminator Ellison brought suit against The Terminator production company Hemdale and distributor Orion Pictures for plagiarism of this episode, since both works involve a soldier from the future who goes back in time and saves the life of a present- day woman from an enemy soldier from the future. According to the Los Angeles Times, the parties settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount, and an acknowledgement of Ellison's works in the credits of Terminator. The credits were added only to the home video releases of Terminator and read simply, \\"Acknowledgment to the Works of Harlan Ellison\\". James Cameron emphatically denied Ellison's allegations and was opposed to the settlement, stating \\"For legal reasons I'm not suppose [sic] to comment on that (the addition of acknowledgement credits) but it was a real bum deal, I had nothing to do with it and I disagree with it.\\" Cast * Lloyd Nolan ‚Äì as Tom Kagan * Michael Ansara ‚Äì as Qarlo Clobregnny * Tim O'Connor ‚Äì as Paul Tanner * Catherine McLeod ‚Äì as Abby Kagan * Jill Hill ‚Äì as Toni Kagan * Allen Jaffe ‚Äì as The Enemy * Ralph Hart ‚Äì as Loren Kagan * Marlowe Jensen ‚Äì as Sgt.

It first aired on 3 October 1964, during the second season. Introduction A two-dimensional creature called Eck who lives in a two-dimensional world finds himself transported to our three-dimensional world and seeks to return home with the help of special glasses made by an eccentric optical engineer. Opening narration > \\"Since the first living thing gazed upward through the darkness, Man has > seldom been content merely to be born, to endure, and to die. With a curious > fervor he has struggled to unlock the mysteries of creation and of the world > in which he lives. Sometimes he has won. Sometimes he has lost. And > sometimes, in the tumbling torrents of space and time, he has brief glimpses > of a world he never even dreams...\\" Plot Dr. Robert Stone, an absent-minded optic engineer, is a brilliant researcher in a field that few appreciate. His brother, a prominent government physicist, refuses to take him seriously and has essentially shut Dr. Stone out of his life. Dr. Stone's attractive secretary, Ms. Elizabeth Dunn, is in love with him and has read all of his recondite scientific papers, but Stone is blind to her feelings and myopically perceives only the details of his science. The story begins as policemen investigate the destruction of Dr. Stone's office, the latest in a series of attacks on optometric facilities. After they leave, Dr. Stone realizes that his own glasses are broken and decides to try a pair of prescription lenses designed for patients who suffer from double vision, lenses made from meteoric quartz. Putting on the glasses, he recoils in horror as he sees a creature that appears to be made of energy. The creature attacks him, smashing his glasses, steals a page from Stone's notebook on which are written the names of patients who have been prescribed the lenses, and quickly vanishes. Stone ascertains that the creature must exist in only two dimensions, as when he turns sideways he becomes invisible, and is able to move through walls. Stone visits his physicist brother to talk over the idea, but his brother dismisses him as mad. Dr. Stone has his secretary order several new pairs of the meteoric eyepieces, and tries to track down the patients sought by the two-dimensional creature. One has been injured, another is found dead, and the third, a welder, managed to ward off the creature with his welding torch (later Stone is told by the creature that in the second dimension, fire is all-powerful because two-dimensional organisms, like dry leaves or paper, are easily set aflame). It is also discovered that a large building has been cut in half. Stone's brother and the police begin to investigate these occurrences. Meanwhile, in the excitement of the moment, Stone suddenly seems to notice the love-struck Ms. Dunn for the first time, remarking after putting on a different pair of glasses that something about her \\"looks different,\\" as she glows with adoration towards him. Soon, the creature appears again to Stone after he puts on a pair of the meteoric glasses. The creature, the titular Eck, explains that he was trapped in our dimensional plane when he fell through an experimental portal. He needs to return to the second dimension through the rift and close it, or else the rift could cause all kinds of things from his dimension to spill through. Eck is unable to see properly in three-dimensional space, and requires lenses to correct his two-dimensional vision so that he can find the rift. Eck gives Stone one of his eyes, a translucent triangle shaped object, though he asserts that a lens must be constructed in 24 hours as he is dying. Stone begins to grind the interdimensional lens. Meanwhile, Eck watches a TV broadcast about himself. Thinking the broadcaster is also two-dimensional, he jumps into the TV set to seek help. This causes him to become luminous, and thereafter can be seen without the special glasses. The now-visible Eck wreaks more havoc in the city, then returns to Dr. Stone's office. The police and Stone's brother have determined that Stone is harboring the creature, and break into his office with a flamethrower. They attack Eck with fire, and apparently kill him. After they leave, Dr. Stone and Elizabeth find Eck alive, having deceived his attackers. They produce the interdimensional lens, which Eck tries to take with him through a wall but cannot as the lens is three-dimensional. Stone and Elizabeth offer to bring the lens with them to the public square, where the rift is located. Eck exits through the wall, Stone asks Elizabeth if she would like to go to the square to \\"say goodbye to a friend,\\" and the two exit as a couple, Stone's arm still around Elizabeth's waist. Closing narration > \\"Paradoxically, Man's endless search for knowledge has often plundered his > courage and warped his vision, so that he has faced the unknown with terror > rather than awe, and probed the darkness with a scream rather than a light. > Yet there have always been men who have touched the texture of tomorrow with > understanding and courage. Through these men, we may yet touch the stars.\\" Background The idea of a two dimensional world was lifted from the 1884 novella Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbott. Writer William Cox wove a lighthearted comedy treatment around the two dimensional concept called \\"The Reluctant Monster\\" (this had no relation to Flatland other than the idea of a 2-D world). It was then passed to John Mantley, later the producer of western TV series Gunsmoke (from 1965-1967/Exec.Prod:1968-1975), to write the final teleplay.

Synthetic vision is also a generic term, which may pertain to computer vision systems using artificial intelligence methods for visual learning, see \\"Synthetic Vision using Volume Learning and Visual DNA\\". Functionality Synthetic vision provides situational awareness to the operators by using terrain, obstacle, geo-political, hydrological and other databases. A typical SVS application uses a set of databases stored on board the aircraft, an image generator computer, and a display. Navigation solution is obtained through the use of GPS and inertial reference systems. Highway In The Sky (HITS), or Path-In-The- Sky, is often used to depict the projected path of the aircraft in perspective view. Pilots acquire instantaneous understanding of the current as well as the future state of the aircraft with respect to the terrain, towers, buildings and other environment features. History A forerunner to such systems existed in the 1960s, with the debut into U.S. Navy service of the Grumman A-6 Intruder carrier-based medium-attack aircraft. Designed with a side-by-side seating arrangement for the crew, the Intruder featured an advanced navigation/attack system, called the Digital Integrated Attack and Navigation Equipment (DIANE), which linked the aircraft's radar, navigation and air data systems to a digital computer known as the AN/ASQ-61. Information from DIANE was displayed to both the Pilot and Bombardier/Navigator (BN) through cathode ray tube display screens. In particular, one of those screens, the AN/AVA-1 Vertical Display Indicator (VDI), showed the pilot a synthetic view of the world in front of the aircraft and, in Search Radar Terrain Clearance mode (SRTC), depicted the terrain detected by the radar, which was then displayed as coded lines that represented preset range increments. Called 'Contact Analog', this technology allowed the A-6 to be flown at night, in all weather conditions, at low altitude, and through rugged or mountainous terrain without the need for any visual references. Synthetic vision was developed by NASA and the U.S. Air Force in the late 1970s and 1980s in support of advanced cockpit research, and in 1990s as part of the Aviation Safety Program. Development of the High Speed Civil Transport fueled NASA research in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1980s, the USAF recognized the need to improve cockpit situation awareness to support piloting ever more complex aircraft, and pursued SVS (also called pictorial format avionics) as an integrating technology for both manned and remotely piloted systems. Simulations and remotely piloted vehicles In 1980 the FS1 Flight Simulator by Bruce Artwick for the Apple II microcomputer introduced recreational uses of synthetic vision. HiMAT Remotely Piloted Aircraft Cockpit with Synhthetic Vision Display NASA used synthetic vision for remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs), such as the High Maneuvability Aerial Testbed or HiMAT. According to the report by NASA, the aircraft was flown by a pilot in a remote cockpit, and control signals up-linked from the flight controls in the remote cockpit on the ground to the aircraft, and aircraft telemetry downlinked to the remote cockpit displays (see photo). The remote cockpit could be configured with either nose camera video or with a 3D synthetic vision display. SV was also used for simulations of the HiMAT. Sarrafian reports that the test pilots found the visual display to be comparable to output of camera on board the RPV. The 1986 RC Aerochopper simulation by Ambrosia Microcomputer Products, Inc. used synthetic vision to aid aspiring RC aircraft pilots in learning to fly. The system included joystick flight controls which would connect to an Amiga computer and display.Stern, D: \\"RC Aerochopper Owners Manual\\", Ambrosia Microcomputer Products, Inc., 1986 The software included a three-dimensional terrain database for the ground as well as some man-made objects. This database was basic, representing the terrain with relatively small numbers of polygons by today's standards. The program simulated the dynamic three-dimensional position and attitude of the aircraft using the terrain database to create a projected 3D perspective display. The realism of this RPV pilot training display was enhanced by allowing the user to adjust the simulated control system delays and other parameters. Similar research continued in the U.S. military services, and at Universities around the world. In 1995-1996, North Carolina State University flew a 17.5% scale F-18 RPV using Microsoft Flight Simulator to create the three-dimensional projected terrain environment.

In 2005 a synthetic vision system was installed on a Gulfstream V test aircraft as part of NASA's \\"Turning Goals Into Reality\\" program. Much of the experience gained during that program led directly to the introduction of certified SVS on future aircraft. NASA initiated industry involvement in early 2000 with major avionics manufacturers. Eric Theunissen, a researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, contributed to the development of SVS technology. At the end of 2007 and early 2008, the FAA certified the Gulfstream Synthetic Vision- Primary flight display (SV-PFD) system for the G350/G450 and G500/G550 business jet aircraft, displaying 3D color terrain images from the Honeywell EGPWS data overlaid with the PFD symbology. It replaces the traditional blue- over-brown artificial horizon. In 2017, Avidyne Corporation certified Synthetic Vision capability for its air navigation avionics. Other glass cockpit systems such as the Garmin G1000 and the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion offer synthetic terrain.

He has held public office multiple times. Biography Della Vedova, a long-time Radical, started to be active in politics in 1994, when he followed Marco Pannella, founder and leader of the Radical Party and the Transnational Radical Party, into the Pannella List, of which he was briefly secretary. During his career, Della Vedova was member of the European Parliament for the Bonino List (1999‚Äì2004) ‚Äì the electoral successor of the Pannella List ‚Äì, candidate for President of Lombardy (2000), president of the Italian Radicals (2001‚Äì2003), founder and president of the Liberal Reformers (2005‚Äì2009) ‚Äì which was then re-booted as Libertiamo ‚Äì, member of the Chamber of Deputies for Forza Italia (2006‚Äì2008), The People of Freedom (2008‚Äì2011) and Future and Freedom (2011‚Äì2013), member of the Senate for Future and Freedom (2013), Civic Choice (2013‚Äì2015) and the Mixed Group (2015‚Äì2018), and under-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Renzi Cabinet (2014‚Äì2016) and Gentiloni Cabinet (2016‚Äì2018). More specifically, from 2001 to 2003 Della Vedova was president of the Italian Radicals, a party launched after the defeat of the Bonino List in the 2001 general election. In 2003 he was the strongest challenger to Daniele Capezzone for the leadership of the party, on a platform based on free-market economic liberalism and the hidden proposal of joining Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right House of Freedoms coalition, but was soundly defeated. In 2005 he left the Italian Radicals, which, under the leadership of Pannella, Bonino and Capezzone, had decided to join forces with the Italian Democratic Socialists in the Rose in the Fist and support Romano Prodi and his centre-left The Union, and launched the Liberal Reformers. In the 2006 general election Della Vedova was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the list of Forza Italia, Berlusconi's party and dominant force in the House of Freedoms. Re-elected to the Chamber in the 2008 general election, he later distanced from Berlusconi and the centre-right, joined Future and Freedom, was elected senator in the 2013 general election, switched to Civic Choice and was appointed in centre- left governments led by Democratic Prime Ministers. In 2017 Della Vedova launched Forza Europa and later, in the run-up of the 2018 general election, he was a founding member of More Europe, part of the centre-left coalition. Having been defeated in the single-seat constituency of Prato, Tuscany, he was appointed coordinator of More Europe. In January 2019 he was elected secretary at the party's founding congress.

It serves the area of Stranraer, the Rhins, and parts of the Machars. The original Stranraer Academy was opened in 1845 on the site of the present Stranraer Campus of Dumfries & Galloway College. In 1965 a new Academy (B Block) was built alongside a new High School (A Block) and in 1970 the schools joined together. Recent history The Academy is a six-year comprehensive school, with a school roll above 1000, and is the second-most attended secondary school in Dumfries and Galloway. Nearly 100 full- and part-time teachers work at the academy, and are aided by a team of support staff. In May 2006 the school's rector announced his retirement, following an unfavourable HMIe report in January 2006, and left the following August. Following his retirement, Joanna Pallet became Acting Head Teacher for a period, until a replacement (Norman Dawson) could be found. The school received a follow-up report from HMIe January 2008. The inspectorate stated that there have been \\"significant improvements\\", particularly in terms of the overall quality of learning and teaching and that there had also been some improvements in pupils' attainment, relative to schools with similar characteristics. They also stated that more now remained to be done to rebuild the school's reputation in the community, improve attainment levels, address staffing difficulties and deal with outstanding health and safety issues. Buildings Part of the Academy's Phase 1 Project. Up to the mid-1990s the school consisted of three buildings built in the 1960s and 70s. At this time Dumfries & Galloway Council drew up plans to rebuild the entire school by 2000. Phase 1 was opened in 1997. In February 2000 A Block was vacated and classes moved into newly refurbished areas in B and C Block, creating a more compact campus. Due to funding problems (particular with [PPP] projects) Phase 2 was continually delayed by the council, along with the demolition of 'A' Block, which lay empty and derelict for five years. After campaigning by the local newspaper, school, school board, and student council, demolition work on 'A' Block finally begun in 2005, being completed in January 2006. As part of Dumfries and Galloway's ¬£100 million public private partnership (PPP) project to build nine new schools within Dumfries and Galloway (e4d&g;), the new school was completed in early 2010. Delays in completion of Phase 2 of the Academy has led to a deterioration in the building quality of the 1997 New Building, and thus as part of the e4d&g; project this building is to be fully refurbished.

A Fellow of the Royal Society from 1665, he was a Royalist supporter before being falsely implicated by Titus Oates in the later discredited \\"Popish Plot\\", and executed for treason. He was beatified as a Catholic martyr by Pope Pius XI in 1929. Early life William grew up in a nominally Anglican household, his father having converted to the Church of England in 1616. William was undoubtedly exposed to Roman Catholic influences, as almost all of the Howard family remained loyal in private to that faith, even those who conformed outwardly to the Established Church. His grandfather, Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel had been imprisoned by Elizabeth I in the Tower of London for being a Catholic and had died there in 1595 after 10 years' imprisonment. In 1620, William was placed in the household of Samuel Harsnett, Bishop of Norwich for an education, then attended St John's College, Cambridge, at age 11 in 1624, but did not receive a degree. He was still regarded as a member of the Church of England in 1633, when he was listed as an Ecclesiastical Commissioner. Marriage and children He married Mary, daughter of Edward Stafford (died 1621) and Ann Wilford, and sister of Henry Stafford, 5th Baron Stafford (died 1637) by a licence granted 11 October 1637. The Staffords were Catholics and the marriage was conducted by a Catholic, not an Anglican, priest, to the reported embarrassment of the groom's father. Following Henry Stafford's death, and the forced (and probably illegal) surrender of the barony, on the ground of his poverty, by the next heir, Mary's distant cousin Roger Stafford, 6th Baron Stafford in 1637, the Howard family secured the title for William, he and Mary being created Baron and Baroness Stafford on 12 September 1640. Two months later, William was created Viscount Stafford. The couple had 3 sons and 6 daughters, of whom at least 8 are known:Profile at Tudorplace.com * Henry Stafford Howard, 1st Earl of Stafford, 2nd Viscount Stafford. Married Claude-Charlotte, daughter of Philibert de Gramont and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Hamilton; died without issue and was succeeded by his brother John's son William. * John Stafford Howard. Married firstly Mary, daughter of Sir John Southcote of Merstham; married secondly Theresa, daughter of Robert Strickland; father of William, 2nd Earl of Stafford and John, 4th and last Earl. * Francis Stafford Howard, who married Eleanor, daughter of Henry Stafford. * Ursula Stafford Howard, who became a nun. * Delphina Stafford Howard, who became a nun at Leuven: she published her father's last letter to her, in which he wrote in moving terms of his innocence of the charges of treason brought against him. * Alethea Stafford Howard, who became a nun. * Isabella Stafford Howard, who in 1669 married as his third wife John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester, but had no issue. * Anastasia Stafford Howard, who married George Holman, of Warkworth, Northamptonshire, and had issue including Anne, who married her cousin William, 2nd Earl of Stafford. Exile and return William and his family left England in August 1641, moving to Antwerp; his parents had also left England and were living in the same area. He was allowed by Parliament to return to England with his wife, in 1646 and 1647; but in 1649 his estates were sequestered and he was forced to compound for recusancy and royalism. At his trial in 1680, he claimed to have performed many duties for King Charles II during the 1650s, travelling between England and the Low Countries, and visiting Rome, the Palatinate and Heidelberg; in this last he was arrested for claims of debt against the Arundel estate. Stafford was imprisoned in 1656 in the Netherlands, this time for his father's debts. There were many family quarrels over the Howard inheritance, especially between William and his elder brother's family, who pursued a series of lawsuits against William and his mother for money allegedly due to them. Stafford's principal character flaw seems to have been his quarrelsome nature. During the Popish Plot he pointed out the absurdity of linking him with Lord Arundell as a co-conspirator, since it was well known that they had not been on speaking terms for 25 years. Over the years he quarreled with many of his Howard relations, including Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, the head of the family, which was to prove unfortunate for him in 1680 when several of his Howard cousins sat as his judges to try him for treason. According to John Evelyn, an eye-witness, of his close relatives in the House of Lords who sat in judgement, only the Earl of Arundel voted Not Guilty, showing, as Evelyn rightly remarked, that Stafford was a man \\"not beloved by his family\\".Evelyn \\"Diary\\" 7 December 1680 He returned to England at the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and was restored to his estates. He was never really prominent in political affairs nor among the Catholic community, although he did promote the removal of the anti-Catholic penal laws with King Charles II and James, Duke of York, and in the 1670s he apparently tried to mediate between James and the leaders of the Whig opposition. At his trial in 1680 he said vaguely that he might have promoted a policy of religious toleration in his speeches in the House of Lords, but could not remember this in any detail. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society from 1665 onwards, becoming a council member in 1672. His relative obscurity was held against him during the Plot; informers like Stephen Dugdale cunningly invented quite plausible speeches in which he lamented the King's ingratitude and the lack of reward the Howards had received for their loyalty. In fact Stafford, like his fellow Plot victim John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse, thought that under the tolerant regime of Charles II, the Catholic nobility were as well off as they could reasonably expect to be; at his trial he maintained that he had always argued that \\"we (i.e the Catholic peers) have no other interest than to be quiet.\\"Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue p.46 For example, it was well known to the authorities that the Catholic Mass was regularly celebrated at his London town house, but no action was taken against him as a result.Kenyon p.33 He was frequently abroad: his visits to Paris in the late 1670s, though apparently quite innocent, were later to have fatal results, when he was accused by the informer Edward Turberville of going to Paris to hire a killer to assassinate Charles II.Kenyon pp.231‚Äì2 Stafford for his part denied that he had ever seen Turberville in his life. Popish Plot In 1678, he was implicated in Titus Oates's later discredited \\"Popish Plot\\", and sent to the Tower of London on 31 October 1678, along with four other Catholic peers. They were due to be put on trial in early 1679, but Charles prorogued Parliament and it was delayed. The King initially seems to have had some suspicions about Stafford's loyalty, especially after hearing the seemingly plausible evidence of Stephen Dugdale, and went so far as to offer Stafford a royal pardon if he would confess; but he later altered his opinion. Scepticism about the plot grew and it was thought that the imprisoned peers might be released, but anti-Catholic feelings revived in 1680 and Stafford was put on trial in November for treason. As a peer he claimed the privilege of peerage to be tried before the House of Lords, presided over by the Lord High Steward. As events would show, however, a peer could not take the sympathy of his fellow peers, even those who were his blood relations, for granted.Kenyon p.231 Trial The main evidence against Stafford came from Titus Oates, who said he had seen a document from the Pope naming Stafford as a conspirator; and from Stephen Dugdale, who testified that Stafford had tried to persuade him to kill the King when Stafford was visiting Dugdale's employers, the Astons, at their country house, Tixall, Staffordshire. A third and particularly dangerous witness, Edward Turberville (a professional soldier, and thus a plausible choice as an assassin) said that he had visited Stafford in Paris in 1676, where Stafford had tried to bribe him to kill Charles II. There were several inconsistencies in his story, especially concerning the relevant dates, but Stafford, lacking expert legal assistance, failed to exploit them properly. Stafford, like all those who were charged with treason until the passage of the Treason Act 1695, was denied defence counsel and forced to conduct his own defence,7 Howell's State Trials, 1293, 1339 (House of Lords, 1 December 1680; he could not have counsel with him while evidence was being presented against him). A very detailed transcript of the proceedings is available from Google books. bringing forward witnesses to counter the evidence against him. One such witness would have been Richard Gerard of Hilderstone, who had come to London to testify on Stafford's behalf but was imprisoned on the word of Stephen Dugdale; Gerard died in jail before the trial.John Kenyon, The Popish Plot (1972), pp. 51, 164. Although the Lord High Steward, Heneage Finch, conducted the trial with exemplary fairness, this was not enough to secure Stafford's acquittal: while Stafford maintained his innocence with vigour, John Evelyn, a spectator, thought his speeches \\"very confused and without method\\". He failed, where a good defence counsel might have succeeded, in exposing the inconsistencies in the evidence of Turberville, or to discredit the unsavoury Oates, whose public standing had declined notably over the preceding year. As Evelyn also noted Stafford was \\"not a man beloved by his own family\\", and seven out of eight peers of the Howard dynasty who sat on the Court voted him Guilty. Stafford was convicted by a majority of 55 votes of Guilty to 31 of Not Guilty and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the punishment of traitors, which was commuted by the King to beheading. The King, even though he is not thought to have had much personal regard for the unpopular Stafford, later said that he had signed the death warrant \\"with tears in his eyes\\", but in the current state of public opinion a reprieve was impossible.Kenyon p.232 Charles added that Stafford's accusers had his blood on their hands, just as he later told Lord Essex that the blood of Oliver Plunkett was on his head.Kenyon p.234 Execution Stafford was executed on Tower Hill on 29 December 1680. Gilbert Burnet wrote that he was quickly forgotten, but others thought that the publication of a version of his final words, addressed to his daughter Delphina (who was a nun at Leuven), in which he spoke eloquently of his innocence ‚Äì \\"My good child, I pray God bless you. ...Your poor old father hath this comfort, that he is totally innocent\\" ‚Äì helped to turn public opinion against the Plot.Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p.400 The early deaths of Dugdale and Turberville, the principal informers against him, were seen by some as proof of the innocence of Stafford and other victims of the plot: Stafford himself was said to have prophesied correctly that Turberville would follow him to the grave within the year. To the surprise of many, Turberville to the very last maintained the truth of his charges against Stafford: Gilbert Burnet thought Stafford's innocence or guilt a mystery beyond solution.Kenyon p.279 Attainder Stafford was attainted and the family lost the title. The well-intentioned efforts of King James II in 1685 to have the attainder reversed failed, due to deadlock between the two Houses of Parliament on the issue, and later to the King's unwillingness to recall his increasingly obstructive Parliament. The title of Baron Stafford was returned to the Howard line in 1824, with the attainder being reversed, but the title of Viscount was extinct as there were no male heirs. His widow, Mary, had her titles restored with the accession of James II, as a consolation for the failure to reverse the attainder on her husband, and she was created Countess of Stafford on 5 October 1688, at the same time her son was created Earl of Stafford.Kenyon p.296 AncestryNotesReferences * External links *Blessed William Howard High School Stafford U.K. *Speech given from the scaffold by Blessed William Howard Category:1614 births Category:1680 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:English Roman Catholics Category:English beatified people Category:Cavaliers William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford Category:Barons Stafford (1640 creation) Category:People executed under the Stuarts for treason against England Category:Executed English people Category:Victims of the Popish Plot Category:Recusants Category:17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:16th-century venerated Christians Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People executed by Stuart England by decapitation Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of England Category:Place of birth missing Category:English politicians convicted of crimes Category:One Hundred and Seven Martyrs of England and Wales ","title":"William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford"},{"id":"4151918","text":"List of programs broadcast by ABC may refer to: *List of programs broadcast by American Broadcasting Company *List of programs broadcast by ABC Television, program lists of Australian Broadcasting Corporation ","title":"List of programs broadcast by ABC"},{"id":"4151927","text":"The Apostolic Church of Queensland is an Australian church which has its roots in the restoration movement of the Catholic Apostolic Church of the early 19th century. It was founded 1883 in Queensland, Australia by H. F. Niemeyer and took its actual name in 1911. It is a member church of the United Apostolic Church which was founded in D√ºsseldorf, Germany in 1956. Logo of Apostolic Church of Queensland The church's logo is a 4R-symbol as it is used by the South African sister church, too. The four \\"R\\"s stand for: RIGHT - ROYAL - RIGHTEOUS - RICH. RIGHT according to the bible, ROYAL as the Bride to have membership with Christ, RIGHTEOUS in partaking of the body and blood of Christ and RICH in the promises Christ gave to his apostles. History The young evangelist Heinrich Friedrich Niemeyer, commonly referred to as H.F. Niemeyer, was not sent to mission in Australia by the former new apostolic chief apostle Friedrich Krebs in 1883 - rather he said, \\"and if all heaven falls in I will go\\" when his expression to go to Australia was opposed by the Apostles in Europe. He settled in Hatton Vale and started his mission among German immigrants. After a short period he gathered 80 people. In 1886, he was ordained as Apostle during a visit in Germany. After the death of Friedrich Krebs the new chief apostle Hermann Niehaus tried to strengthen his position in comparison to the other apostles and introduced reforms whereof a conflict occurred. After a general apostles' meeting in 1911 Niemeyer was not expelled from his office and the church but withdrew himself from it. All Australian church members followed him with the exception of a handful of families. Later others returned to the New Apostolic Church as they saw the difference of teaching and blessings! Therefore, the apostolic church of Qld history only starts in 1911.(see the Mt Beppo Church signage states est 1884 and then a small flag displaying 1911 separately was added some time later. Looking at cemeteries there and Binjour Plateau, as well as Monto and Tarampa (1885-1905), many New Apostolic members were interned there prior to the rift in 1911. During the World War I Niemeyer was imprisoned because of preaching in German. His health weakened therefore and shortly after his release he died in 1920. His son Wilhelm Niemeyer took over the church's leadership. He was ordained as apostle already in 1912. From 1918 on the language in which divine services were held was changed from German to English. At this time there probably still existed a prophet's office which calls the other offices. It obviously was abolished afterwards as then visions and dreams revealed new talents for church ministries. Wilhelm Niemeyer's successor was Emil Zielke who ordained two apostles, Arnold Edward Zielke (1905-1988) and Arnan Niemeyer (1908-1995) in 1961. The church was divided into a Northern and Southern district. In 1977 Mervyn Zischke (1927-1988) succeeded Arnan Niemeyer. In 1988 suddenly both apostles died and it was up to the European apostles of the federation to look for new leaders. At that time differences between Europe and Australia became evident as on the 5th continent dreams and visions were very important for choosing new ministries. Only on 23 September 1990 the Elder Kenneth Dargusch (South-Queensland) and the Priest Clifford Flor (North- Queensland) were ordained in the Hatton Vale central church with 2,000 members attending the service. The Southern district comprises 11 congregations that are administered from Hatton Vale by Apostle Kenneth L. Dargusch. The Northern district consists of 16 congregations that are led by Apostle Clifford Flor from Mackay. On 1 September 2018, Bishop Shayne Dargusch was ordained to the Apostle Office for the Southern District. On 26 January 2020 Priest Wayne Schneider from Maryborough congregation was ordained as apostle in Bundaberg for the northern area. From 1990 on the Australian congregations started a mission on the Philippines and founded the United Apostolic Church of the Philippines with actually 19 congregations in three districts. There are also missionary activities and community growing in India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Kenia and Canada. Teaching The apostles of the United Apostolic Church started to reform the new apostolic teachings from 1970 on. In 1984 a sort of catechism the so-called Book of Faith was edited by all apostles of the union. From 1990 on the European apostles started to discuss ordination of women and decided upon in 2004. They also changed the views on the understanding of the nature of church, the sacraments and the ministries. The Australian and South- African partners (see also: Apostolic Church of South Africa - Apostle Unity) did not follow completely. Therefore, there are actually not only differences in liturgy but also in teaching. The ministry of the apostle is much more relevant for salvation in the Southern hemisphere and the priesthood of all believers is much more neglected.

According to the hagiographies, Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. Gregory of Tours (Historia Francorum I, 30), using the acta of Saturninus, affirms that Paul was among those priests consecrated at Rome and sent to replant the Christian communities in Gaul. Saturninus of Toulouse and Dionysius (Denis) of Paris were martyred, but Paul survived to establish the church at Narbonne as its first bishop and die in peace. The claim of Prudentius that Paul's association with the city of Narbonne had made it famous may be read as literary hyperbole. There is a brief Vita Antiqua perhaps of the 6th century, which has been edited by the Bollandists. It tells that Paul converted the inhabitants of B√©ziers, setting over them a bishop, Aphrodisius, before turning his attention to Narbonne, where he founded two churches. An anecdote recounts how two of his acolytes set a woman's slippers at the foot of his bed, to accuse him of improprieties, but Paul was able miraculously to confound and pardon them. Identification with Sergius Paulus Medieval legends moved the seven apostles of Gaul back in time to the apostolic generation (see especially Martial of Limoges), in order to strengthen local traditions with apostolic connections; such a legend identified third-century Paul with the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was converted by Paul the Apostle (). The historical Paul is still venerated in Narbonne as Saint Paul-Serge through this connection. He is said to have been accompanied by Aphrodisius, who later became the first bishop of B√©ziers and whom developing tradition identified as the man who sheltered the Holy Family during their flight into Egypt.Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Montpellier\\" At Narbonne the basilica of Saint-Paul-Serge is a collegiate church built over the burial site of Paul, the first bishop. The site is at the border of an extensive necropolis of early Christian burials. The early shrine was a small basilica, 12 meters by 6.5 meters, built in the 4th century, destroyed by fire in the 5th century, then occupied by a monastery. As a place of pilgrimage first mentioned in 782 it was rebuilt more than once, most recently between 1180The abbot Imbert was buried in the quire in 1185. and 1200, during a period of renewed urban prosperity, reusing old materials and always retaining its ancient foundations.

It was established in 1965, in the capital Puerto Princesa City, by Ramon Oliveros (Ray Oliver) Decolongon. The station faced many difficulties in its early years. Although Palawan could receive some broadcasts from Manila and neighbouring Visayan islands, radio ownership among the 20,000-strong population was not high. The Tinio Electric Plant provided electricity only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and to less than half the population. Then, in 1966, Decolongon was killed in a plane crash: his father, Emilio Decolongon, took over as company president. In September 1972 martial law was declared throughout the Philippines and all broadcasting stations were shut down, but DYPR was able to reopen fairly quickly after making its case as a provider of essential services.

Model of the Arch of the Argentarii The Arcus Argentariorum (Latin: Arch of the Money-Changers; in Italian: Arco degli Argentari), is an ancient Roman arch that was partly incorporated in the seventh century into the western wall of the nearby church of San Giorgio al Velabro in Rome, Italy.  History  It is a widespread misconception that it is a triumphal arch, but it is in fact entirely different in form, with no curves and more resembling an architrave. Its actual purpose is unknown, but the most probable scenario is that it formed a monumental gate where the vicus Jugarius entered the Forum Boarium. As the dedicatory inscription says, it was commissioned not by the state or emperor, but by the local money-changers (argentarii) and merchants (negotiantes), in honour of Septimius Severus and his family. The top was possibly once decorated with statues of the imperial family, now long gone. It was finished in 204 AD and is tall and the passage (between two thick pillars supporting a flat lintel) is wide. It is built of white marble, except for the base which is of travertine. The dedicatory inscription is framed by two bas- reliefs representing Hercules and a genius. The panels lining the passage present two sacrificial scenes ‚Äî on the right (east), Septimius Severus, Julia Domna and Geta, and on the left (west) side Caracalla with his wife Fulvia Plautilla and father-in-law Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. The figures of Caracalla's brother, father in law and wife on the passage panels and on the banners on the outside, and their names on the dedicatory inscription, were chiselled out after Caracalla seized sole power and assassinated them. These sacrificial scenes gave rise to the popular but incorrect saying about the arch that Past treasure-hunters interpreted this to mean that there was a treasure hidden inside the arch. They drilled many holes in it, which are still visible. Above the main reliefs, are smaller panels with Victories or eagles holding up victors' wreaths, and beneath them more sacrificial scenes. The external decoration of the pillars includes soldiers, barbarian prisoners, military banners (with busts of the imperial family) and a now-damaged figure in a short tunic.

It is situated on the river Main and has a population around 3,700. Geography=Location Freudenberg is located in the extreme northeast of the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, on the left bank of the river Main which here is the border to Bavaria. Across the river is the municipality of Collenberg. The old town of Freudenberg faces Kirschfurt, an Ortsteil of Collenberg. Freudenberg lies approximately 15 km west of Wertheim am Main, and 30 km south-east of Aschaffenburg. Freudenberg is the terminus of the hiking path Nibelungensteig which starts at Zwingenberg (Bergstrasse). It is also located on the ', a tourist route from Worms to Wertheim. The hills on the left bank of the Main are part of the Mittelgebirge Odenwald while those on the opposite side of the river belong to the Spessart. The municipal territory totals 3,478 hectares and stretches far into the wooded hills. Subdivisions Freudenberg has the Stadtteile Boxtal, Ebenheid, Rauenberg and Wessental in addition to Freudenberg town proper. History Freudenberg was first mentioned around 1100. In 1803, the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss awarded Freudenberg to the House of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg. Mondfeld, Rauenberg and Wessental (previously ruled by Mainz) became part of Amt Freudenberg. In 1806, Freudenberg became a part of the Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1907, the first (sandstone) bridge over the Main was built. In 1928‚Äì34, the Staustufe Freudenberg followed. In 1935, with the ' and the laws that followed, Freudenberg lost its status as town. A year later, the Bezirksamt Wertheim was dissolved. Freudenberg became a part of the Amtsbezirk/' (part of the Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe). Towards the end of World War II, the first Main bridge was blown up. From 1946‚Äì50, a ferry boat linked Kirschfurt and Freudenberg. In 1950, the second (current) bridge was built. In 1955, Freudenberg asked the Interior Minister of Baden-W√ºrttemberg for a reinstatement of the status of town. This was confirmed in February 1956. Six years later, Freudenberg was awarded the current municipal coat of arms. In 1968, Freudenberg and Boxtal became publicly recognized resorts. On 1 January 1972, as a result of Gebietsreform Boxtal, Ebenheid and Wessental were merged to Freudenberg, followed by Rauenberg on 31 December. In 1973, the Tauberbischofsheim district was abolished and Freudenberg has since been a part of the Main-Tauber-Kreis. Economy Notable businesses in the town include ', a furniture manufacturing company, established in 1897. Freudenberg also hosts the high-end distillery Brennerei Ziegler, which has been manufacturing spirits since 1865.

O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the government had failed to show a compelling interest in prosecuting religious adherents for drinking a sacramental tea containing a Schedule I controlled substance.. After the federal government seized its sacramental tea, the Uni√£o do Vegetal (UDV), the New Mexican branch of a Brazilian church that imbibes ayahuasca in its services, sued, claiming the seizure was illegal, and sought to ensure future importation of the tea for religious use. The church won a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which was affirmed on appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court also disagreed with the government's central argument that the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) does not allow for exceptions for the substance in this case, as Native Americans are given exceptions to use peyote, another Schedule I substance.  Background  On May 21, 1999, U. S. Customs agents seized over of hoasca (ayahuasca) tea which was shipped to the Santa Fe, New Mexico branch of the Brazil-based UDV; ayahuasca contains dimethyltryptamine, which is outlawed for most purposes under the Controlled Substances Act. While no charges were filed, the United States chapter, led by Seagram heir Jeffrey Bronfman, filed suit claiming that the seizure was an illegal violation of the church members' rights. They claimed their usage was permitted under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), , a law passed by Congress in direct response to Employment Division v. Smith (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that unemployment benefits could be denied to two Native Americans fired for using Peyote. In filing suit, the UDV sought a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from barring their usage of hoasca. In August 2002, U.S. District Chief Judge James Aubrey Parker granted the church's motion, finding it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim under RFRA. In September 2003, United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit Senior Judge John Carbone Porfilio, joined by Judge Stephanie Kulp Seymour, affirmed, over the dissent of Judge Michael R. Murphy. In November 2004, a divided majority of the en banc 10th Circuit again affirmed in a per curiam decision, by a vote of 8-5. Judge Murphy, joined fully by Judges David M. Ebel, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., and Terrence L. O'Brien, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the correct standard but should not have granted the preliminary injunction. Judge Seymour, joined by Judges Deanell Reece Tacha, Porfilio, Robert Harlan Henry, Mary Beck Briscoe, and Carlos F. Lucero, wrote separately to argue that the district court used the wrong standard but reached the correct result. Judge Michael W. McConnell, joined in full by Judge Timothy Tymkovich, argued that the district court used the correct standard to reach the correct result, and partially joined those parts of the other opinions that said so. As it worked its way through the appellate courts, the Supreme Court lifted a stay in December 2004 thereby permitting the church to use hoasca for their Christmas services. One-hour of oral arguments were heard on November 1, 2005, where Edwin Kneedler, the Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the government.  Opinion of the Court  On February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously delivered judgment in favor of the church, affirming and remanding to the lower court. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court of eight justices.. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of the case because he was not on the Court when the case was argued. The Court found that the government was unable to detail the government's compelling interest in barring religious usage of Hoasca when applying strict scrutiny as required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The Court first found that the standard under RFRA for a preliminary injunction is the same as at trial, just as it would be for a constitutional claim.. Disagreeing with the District Court, the Supreme Court found that Hoasca is covered under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which is implemented by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).. The Court rejected the District Court's reliance on the official commentary to the convention, reasoning that the United Nations had incorrectly interpreted the treaty when it found that tea made from plants is a naturally occurring material.Gonzales v. O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 437 (2006) citing U. N. Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 387, 385 (1976). However, because the government had failed to submit any evidence on the international consequences of granting an exemption to CSA enforcement by allowing UDV to practice its religion, the Court ruled that it had failed to meet its burden on this point. The Supreme Court ruled that the government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea. The ruling upheld a preliminary injunction allowing the church to use the tea pending a lower court trial on a permanent injunction, during which the government would have had the opportunity to present further evidence consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling.  Subsequent developments  The ruling is not binding on states. The Act was amended in 2003 to only include the federal government and its entities, such as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.Sullivan, Winnifred. 2005.

West Publishing Co. St. Paul. . Bronfman next sought to move the church's services from the yurt outside his home to a new building in Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico, prompting opposition from neighbors. When the county refused to grant the church a building permit, Bronfman sued under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, and Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez of the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a statement of interest in support of the church. In late 2012, a settlement was reached in which the county agreed to allow the church to be built.

History Alexander bodied Dennis Dominator at Sheffield bus station, 1998 Alexander PS bodied Volvo B10M in March 2009 Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart in September 2008 In 1989 the Mainline brand was introduced by South Yorkshire Transport. Buses operated with Sheffield Mainline names in a bright red and yellow livery, replacing the previous \\"coffee and cream\\" livery. It was followed by Doncaster Mainline in a silver grey and red livery relieved by a light yellow band and finally Rotherham Mainline, whose buses were painted blue and yellow. In 1992 the locality was dropped when Mainline became the standard fleetname across South Yorkshire. A common red and yellow livery with silver and blue bands was introduced. In November 1993 South Yorkshire Transport sold Mainline in a management buyout.South Yorkshire Transport Authority Sells Off Bus Company to Staff Local Government Chronicle 18 November 1993 Shortly after Stagecoach purchased a 20% stake in the company, however this was sold in 1995 to FirstBus. In 1998 FirstGroup purchased the remaining 80% shareholding and renamed the business First Mainline. Buses were repainted in a simplified red and yellow livery, reminiscent of the original 1989 Sheffield Mainline livery. In 2000 First Mainline was rebranded as First South Yorkshire and the corporate light grey, blue and pink livery introduced. In 2013, First South Yorkshire began to paint buses into First's new Olympia corporate livery, which is an updated version of the former livery. At the same time, the individual First Sheffield, First Rotherham, First Doncaster and First X78 brands were introduced. The First X78 brand was superseded by the Steel Link brand in 2015, while the First Rotherham brand was retired with the closure of the Rotherham depot in 2017. It was announced on 27 May 2020 that First South Yorkshire and First Midlands will be merged to form the operating company First South Yorkshire and Midlands, under the management of First Midlands CEO, Nigel Eggleton. Routes First South Yorkshire operate services in Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Due to bus services history and number changes, some routes share service numbers within South Yorkshire. Route X78 is a service which runs from Sheffield Interchange to Doncaster Frenchgate Interchange via Meadowhall, Rotherham and Conisbrough. From Monday to Saturday it operates every fifteen minutes during the day and every twenty minutes on Sundays and week day evenings. Route X4, Airport Services, departs from Doncaster Frenchgate Interchange and arrives approximately twenty-two minutes later at Doncaster Sheffield Airport. This service was later withdrawn in 2018 and replaced by services 57 and 58.This is what you need to know about changes to bus services in Doncaster Doncaster Free Press August 2018 In September 2016, Steel Link route X1 commenced operating from Sheffield to Maltby via the Bus Rapid Transit North.¬£29.8 million Bus Rapid Transit scheme set for launch Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council 2 September 2016Steel Link service for new ¬£29.8 million BRT scheme Bus & Coach Professional 8 September 2016Bus X1 Travel South Yorkshire First also run Peak District services 271 and 272, from Sheffield, across the South Yorkshire boundary and into Derbyshire in the Peak District.

The school is progressive and ecumenical in theology, with Baptists, United Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and members of other denominations on its faculty and in its student body. The school also shares a partnership with Bexley Hall Seabury- Western Theological Seminary, an Episcopal seminary. It is accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools. History=1820s-1960: Early History Four Baptist institutions merged over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries to form Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School (CRCDS) as it exists today. Its earliest roots are in the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution (later Colgate Theological Seminary), which began in Hamilton, New York in the early 1820s under the auspices of the New York Baptist Union for Ministerial Education. Soap and candle magnate William Colgate, a devout Baptist, was an influential trustee in the Union for Ministerial Education and took an active role in financing and championing Hamilton Institution. Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution later evolved in part into Colgate University. The present-day seminary's second heritage institution, the Rochester Theological Seminary, was formed in 1850 at the founding of the University of Rochester by a group from Colgate Theological Seminary who sought a more urban educational setting. Women were accepted, enrolled, and graduated as regular students beginning in 1920. The remainder of the Hamilton seminary had moved to Rochester by 1928, when the two seminaries merged to become Colgate Rochester Divinity School and moved to the 1100 South Goodman Street campus in Rochester. 1960s: Time of Turbulence In 1961, the school was joined by its third legacy institution, the Baptist Missionary Training School, a women's school in Chicago founded by the Women's Baptist Home Mission Society. Persuaded by student advocacy and protest throughout 1968 and 1969---namely by the school's Black Student Caucus ---Colgate Rochester Divinity School hired more African American professors to join the school's overwhelmingly white faculty, increased course offerings in African American religious and cultural studies, and formally established the Martin Luther King, Jr. Program of Black Church Studies in 1969. It was one of the first such programs instituted at a predominantly white seminary or divinity school in the U.S. 1970-present: Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School The last significant institutional merger took place in 1970, when Crozer Theological Seminary moved from Upland, Pennsylvania to merge with Colgate Rochester Divinity School, and form Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester, NY. The Divinity School shared its South Goodman Street facilities with several organizations over the years. St. Bernard's School of Theology and Ministry, a Roman Catholic theological school, occupied the South Goodman Street campus from 1981 until 2003, when it relocated to another site in the area. The American Baptist Historical Society, serving the American Baptist Churches USA, also occupied the South Goodman Street campus in varying capacity from 1955 to 2008, when the Society's offices and archival collections were relocated to Mercer University in Atlanta. After selling its historic 90-year-old campus next to Highland Park in 2016, Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School moved 2.2 miles north in 2019 to Village Gate Square in Rochester's Neighborhood of the Arts, near the George Eastman Museum and Memorial Art Gallery.

Plautianus was originally from Leptis Magna, southeast of Carthage (modern Libya, North Africa). He was a maternal cousin and long- time friend of the Emperor Septimius Severus. Plautianus' father was another Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, born c. 130, whose sister, Fulvia Pia (c. 125 - after 198), was married to Severus' father Publius Septimius Geta.Anthony Birley, Septimius Severus, The African Emperor, revised edition (New Haven: Yale University, 1988), p. 220 Plautianus was Praefectus vigilum (commander of the Vigiles in Rome) from 193 to 197.Ostia inscription Plautianus was appointed prefect of the Praetorian Guard in 197. Due to their friendship, Severus rewarded Plautianus with various honors, including a consular insignia, a seat in the Roman Senate and the Consulship of 203. During his consulship, Plautianus' image was minted on coins along with Severus' second son Publius Septimius Geta. He assisted Severus in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful. Severus made him his second in command, with his beloved woman Julia Domna. In 202, Plautianus married his daughter Publia Fulvia Plautilla to Caracalla (Severus‚Äô first son and co-emperor) in Rome. Plautianus began to conduct himself like a ruthless ruler, having those who opposed him assassinated or executed at will. Plautianus became so powerful that Caracalla and his mother, Julia Domna, began to be concerned. Aware of her reservations, Plautianus sought to disrepute great power Julia. He had her servants and friends arrested and tortured in hopes of extracting some damaging testimony against her, however in doing so he achieved nothing. The marriage between Caracalla and Publia Fulvia Plautilla was not a happy one. In fact, Caracalla loathed both her and her father, threatening to kill them after becoming sole emperor. When Plautianus discovered this, he plotted to overthrow Severus' family. When Plautianus' treachery was discovered, the imperial family summoned him to the palace and ordered his death on 22 January 205. After his death, Plautianus‚Äô property was confiscated, his name was erased from public monuments, and his son of the same name, daughter and granddaughter were exiled to Sicily.

The relative strength assigned to the role of technical or technological progress in impacting society and social advancement differs among different schools of Marxist thinkers. A related concept is technological determinism. On a prescriptive level, this view places a strong emphasis on the necessity of strengthening the productive forces of the economy as a precondition for the realization of socialism, and within a nominally socialist economy, essential to achieving communism. This theory was held by many orthodox Marxists as well as Marxist‚ÄìLeninists, playing a crucial role in informing the economic policies of current and former socialist states.  Empirical support  The most influential philosophical defence of this idea has been promulgated by Gerald Cohen in his book Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence. According to this view, technical change can beget social change; in other words, changes in the means and intensity of production causes changes in the relations of production, i.e., in people's ideology and culture, their interactions with one another, and their social relationship to the wider world. This view point is a foundation of orthodox Marxism. In this view, actual socialism, being based on social ownership and a wide distribution of an abundant surplus product, cannot come to pass until that society's ability to produce wealth is built up enough to satisfy its whole population and to support socialist production methods. Using this theory as a basis for their practical programmes meant that communist theoreticians and leaders in most socialist states, while paying lip service to the primacy of ideological change in individuals to sustain a communist society, actually put productive forces first and ideological change second. The theory of the productive forces is encapsulated in the following quote from The German Ideology:  Socialist states  Based on the theory of the productive forces and related perspectives, in the economic systems of the former Eastern Bloc and the present-day socialist states, the State accumulated capital through forcible extraction of surpluses from the population for the purpose of rapidly modernizing and industrializing their countries, because these countries were not technologically advanced to a point where an actual socialist economy was technically possible, or where a socialist state could actually try to reach a communist mode of production. The philosophical perspective behind the modernizing zeal of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China was based on the desire to industrialize their countries.

A tradition in Belarus is to let the cat into the house first. A house-warming party is a party traditionally held soon after moving into a new residence. It is an occasion for the hosts to present their new home to their friends, post- moving, and for friends to give gifts to furnish the new home. House-warming parties are generally informal. Origins The term \\"housewarming\\" is descended literally from the act of warming a new house, in the days before central heating. Each guest would bring firewood, and build fires in all the available fireplaces, offering firewood as a gift. Aside from warming the house, this was also believed to repel evil spirits by creating a protective atmosphere of warmth. Uninhabited houses were considered targets for vagrant spirits, and therefore used to require a certain level of cleansing before a house was safe to be occupied by young children. The origin is from the medieval times. In French-speaking countries detail of Le Christ chez Marthe et Marie, ca. 1600‚Äîa chimney hook in use. A housewarming party is called a pendaison de cr√©maill√®re, literally \\"hanging of the chimney hook\\". The expression comes from medieval times. When the construction of the house was finished, it was customary to invite all those who participated in its building to eat dinner as a vote of thanks. The food was prepared in a large pot, the temperature of which was controlled by a chimney hook, which could adjust the pot so it sat higher or lower over the fireplace. This hook was the last thing to be installed in the new house, marking the beginning of the thank you meal.

V. Narayanaswamy was an Indian musician, widely considered to be among the finest Carnatic music vocalists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1986. He was described as the \\"Perfect Knight\\" of Carnatic music, a phrase from Geoffrey Chaucer, by V. K. Narayana Menon, prominent art critic of India and recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship. Dr.Narayana Menon, An Essay on Shri K.V.Narayanaswamy, 1986 Early life and background KVN was born to Kollengode Viswanathayyar and Muthulakshmi Ammal in Palghat, Kerala, to a Palakkad Iyer family, a district renowned for its cultural and musical traditions, on 15 November 1923. Narayanaswamy was born into a family of illustrious musicians and artists. His great-grandfather Viswam Bhagavatar was renowned for his evocative Ashtapadis and rendered services for Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal, ruler of the princely state of Travancore from 1860 to 1880. In return Viswam Bhagavatar was bestowed with government aid and hereditary royal privileges. Viswam Bhagavatar's son, Narayana Bhagavatar continued his father's legacy. His son was violin maestro, Viswanathayyar (soon came to be known as 'Fiddle' Viswanathayyar), KVN's father. K.V.Narayanaswamy learned basic music lessons under his father and grandfather. After studying in Palghat till the fifth form, he moved to Coimbatore, where he briefly dabbled in theatre. KVN even managed a role as the young Kanappan in the movie Kannappa Nayanar. The movie bombed at the box office.Neelam, K.V.Narayanaswamy:Foremost Disciple of Ariyakudi, pp.25‚Äì31, 2001 KVN first began extensive training under Mridangam maestro, Padma Bhushan, Palghat Mani Iyer. Mani Iyer proceeded to place KVN under the tutelage of Sangeetakalacharya C.S. Krishna Iyer, a highly competent vocalist, musicologist and composer in Palghat, and then under violinist and Sangeetha Kalanidhi Papa Venkataramiah. Viswanatha Bhagavatar was however very keen that KVN should train under Sangeetha Kalanidhi Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar or Sangeetha Kalanidhi Padma Bhushan Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, who were two of the four most dominant musicians of the first half of the twentieth century along with the likes of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and G. N. Balasubramaniam. Mani Iyer soon judged KVN to be ready for gurukulavasam under Ariyakudi and in 1942, KVN took the giant step. He entered the home of Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar and remained an ardent disciple until the latter's death in 1967.Hemmige.V.Srivatsan, Palghat K.V.Narayanaswamy:Quiet flows a river of music, Sruti Magazine, Issue 27/28, December 1986 Performing career KVN's major break came at a Madras Music Academy concert in 1954, when he was unexpectedly forced to substitute his Guru, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar who was not in a position to attend the conference under unforeseen circumstances. Accompanied by doyens Palghat Mani Iyer and Papa Venkataramayya, this concert proved to be a milestone in Narayanaswamy's career. The training under Palghat Mani Iyer allowed KVN to develop a solid knowledge of rhythmic nuances. This in turn would enable him to be at ease in the company of such legends of percussion as Palani Subramaniam Pillai, Palghat R. Raghu, Mavelikkara Velukkutty Nair, and Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman to name a few.Neelam, K.V.Narayanaswamy:Foremost Disciple of Ariyakudi, pp.34‚Äì41, 2001 KVN, Palghat R. Raghu and violin maestro T.N.Krishnan would soon become a frequent and much admired combination on stage. K.V.Narayanaswamy was intimately connected to the Travancore Royal Family following his skilful rendition of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's Navaratri compositions. Another landmark in KVN's life came in 1964 when he participated in the East-West Encounter concerts in New Delhi. This was followed by a widely acclaimed concert at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland in 1965.Neelam, K.V.Narayanaswamy:Foremost Disciple of Ariyakudi, pp.54‚Äì56, 2001 On being made professor of music at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, between 1965‚Äì67, he went on a coast-to-coast concert tour of US. He was one of four artists including Bismillah Khan, Ali Akbar Khan, and Ravi Shankar who participated in the hugely popular Hollywood Bowl music festival in Los Angeles in the summer of 1967.In 1974, KVN went to teach in Berkeley, California for a year, in the company of dancer Balasaraswati and sitarist Nikhil Banerjee. Invited by the American Society of Eastern Arts, he travelled to North America, Europe (Berlin Music Festival in 1976) and Australia (Adelaide Arts Festival in 1988) multiple times thereafter on various concert tours. He also joined the Music College in Madras as a lecturer in 1962 when Musiri Subramania Iyer was its principal, and retired as Professor of Music in 1982.In 1984, Narayanaswamy was to become the first Indian musician to be awarded the Fulbright Scholarship and went to San Diego State University in California as an artist-in-residence under the scholarship.

Geography View of Hilchenbach Location Hilchenbach in Siegen-Wittgenstein The map shows Hilchenbach's location in Siegen-Wittgenstein district. It is about 15 km northeast of Siegen. The town borders in the south on Netphen, in the west on Kreuztal, in the north on Kirchhundem and in the east on Erndtebr√ºck. Geology The town's largest flowing body of water is the Ferndorfbach, a tributary to the river Sieg. The municipal area's average elevation is 427 m above sea level, with its highest elevation being at 678 m at the Riemen, a peak in the Rothaargebirge. Constituent communities Constituent communities The town is made up of the following centres: Allenbach, Dahlbruch, Grund, Hadem, Helberhausen, (Alt-)Hilchenbach (alt means \\"old\\"), L√ºtzel, M√ºsen, Oberndorf, Oechelhausen, Ruckersfeld and Vormwald. The recent political unit of Hilchenbach was founded in 1969. History The town of Hilchenbach was first mentioned in documents in 1292, when it went by the name Heylichinbach in a donation document from Countess Agnes von Nassau and her eldest son Heinrich to the Keppel Monastery. There are however clues that a church was established in this area sometime between 950 and 1000 by the Corvey Monastery, implying that there was settlement there. In a document from 20 July 1365, a \\"firm house\\" ‚Äì \\"festes Haus\\" ‚Äì (Wilhelmsburg) in Hilchenbach is mentioned, which from 1489 to 1622 was enfeoffed to the Wischen von Langenau noble family. A castle with a moat was mentioned in 1623. It supposedly replaced Count Wilhelm von Nassau-Siegen- Hilchenbach's Ginsburg residence. In 1687, the village of Hilchenbach was raised to Flecken ‚Äì market town. In 1689 and 1844 nearly the whole town of (Alt-)Hilchenbach was destroyed by fire. Hilchenbach and the villages in the surrounding were a part of the former County of Nassau. During the Napoleonic Wars in 1807 it became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1815 after the Congress of Vienna Hilchenbach and other villages in the Siegerland became part of the Prussian province of Westphalia. Politics=Town council The town council's 38 seats are apportioned thus, in accordance with municipal elections held on 26 September 2004: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"95%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  width = \\"9%\\" width = \\"9%\\"  CDU  width = \\"9%\\"  SPD  width = \\"9%\\"  Greens  width = \\"9%\\"  Free Democratic Party (Germany)  width = \\"9%\\"  FW  width = \\"9%\\"  total - align=\\"center\\"  2004  8  10  5  4  11  38 } Note: FW is a citizens' coalition. Mayor The mayor has an unusual r√¥le in Hilchenbach owing to one council member's decision to switch allegiance in autumn 2005. The member in question left the \\"Free Voters\\" (UWG or FW) and joined the CDU, leaving the former with 10 seats and giving the latter 9 seats. The governing bloc of the FDP, FW and Greens then had 19 seats instead of 20, while the CDU and SPD together also had 19 instead of 18, creating a deadlock where there had been none before. It therefore now falls to the mayor to break the deadlock between the two blocs. Coat of arms Hilchenbach's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: The shield in azure a wolf statant Or langued gules, the crest a crenellated castle with three crenellated towers argent. The arms were last approved in this form on 13 April 1970. The first version of the coat was approved in 1911 by German emperor Wilhelm II. The wolf charge refers to the charge in preserved examples of the old Hilchenbach jurymen's seal, which had the circumscription \\"S. der scheffen von helchenbach\\" (\\"S\\" stood for Siegel ‚Äì seal ‚Äì and the rest is archaic German for der Sch√∂ffen von Hilchenbach ‚Äì of the Jurymen of Hilchenbach), and which appears on documents from 6 October 1477 and 17 November 1485. Town partnerships The town of Hilchenbach maintains town friendship links with the following places: * Arendsee in the Altmark, Saxony- Anhalt * Seiffen, a spa town in the Erzgebirge, Saxony Culture and sightseeing=Theatre *In the constituent community of Dahlbruch is found the Viktoriakino, a cinema also used as a theatre. Viktoria Filmtheater Museums At the mining museum in M√ºsen, the finds from digs in the Altenberg area are on display. Furthermore, there is a mining gallery for visitors. BuildingsGinsburg= Ruins of the Ginsburg over Hilchenbach-Grund The Ginsburg, lying high above the constituent community of Grund was mentioned in 1255 as a Nassau border fortification. The castle achieved historic importance in 1568 when William I of Orange-Nassau drafted plans to free the Netherlands at the castle, also making final preparations for the campaign there. On the Ginsburg Heath was the meeting point for the third army group under Count Ludwig von Nassau, making the Ginsburg, and thereby also Hilchenbach, into a starting point for the Dutch struggle for freedom. Nowadays, only the castle's keep is still fully preserved, the rest of the complex lying in ruins. =Keppel Convent= This convent from 1239 was documented by a Sir Frederick (Ritter Friedrich). After the Reformation, Keppel became a noble convent. A Gymnasium is today housed in the buildings. Elsewhere in Hilchenbach was, from 1867, a teachers' college, which lasted until after the First World War. Later, the Jung-Stilling-Gymnasium was housed in the college's old building. Hilchenbach is thereby the town with the second longest ‚Äì after Siegen ‚Äì education tradition in the Siegerland. =Breitenbachtalsperre= Between the constituent communities of Dahlbruch and Allenbach lies the Breitenbachtalsperre, or Breitenbach Dam, which furnishes a water supply to the Siegerland. For the hiker, there are many trails here to choose from. Natural monumentsAltenberg= At the Altenberg between the constituent community of M√ºsen and Kreuztal-Littfeld are found the remains of a settlement from the 13th century. A hiking trail leads through this former mining settlement. Archaeological finds are on display at the mining museum in M√ºsen. Owing to their prominence in mining history documentation, a great number of finds have been taken up by the German Mining Museum in Bochum. Exhibited to the visitor there, around a complete coalpit display and with the help of the museum finds, is the mediaeval miners' way of life.

The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by actress Marnette Patterson. Developed in response to the WB's request for a new character, Christy was originally planned to expand the show in a new direction for a possible ninth season or spin-off. It was later confirmed that all future plans for the show were cancelled following the WB's closure to launch The CW. Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she secretly collaborates with the demonic council known as the Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the greater good. Billie kills Christy in self- defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is shown to be a powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels. Christy has received mixed commentary from critics‚Äîmuch of it relating to her storyline with Billie, which was compared to those from previous seasons. Her role as a villain received positive attention, while Patterson's acting was cited as exaggerated. The exact nature of Christy's morality and her status as the season's antagonist have been the subject of debate among television critics and the series' fans.  Development = Creation and casting  The WB Television Network (the WB) renewed Charmed for an eighth season on condition that it incorporated new characters that could either sustain a ninth season or lead to a spin-off series. The WB reached this decision after the show's three lead actors lead actors Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs, and Rose McGowan choose to not renew their contracts for future seasons.Gallagher & Ruditis & Ungerfeider (2006): p. 228 Executive producer Brad Kern scripted the sisterhood between Christy and Billie Jenkins as a way to preserve the series' focus on family. Kern said the inclusion of Patterson and Cuoco as Christy and Billie Jenkins was done to \\"take the series out the way it began\\" through a focus on sisters. In an interview with Starry Constellation Magazine, Marnette Patterson said she enjoyed the opportunity to join an established series and be featured in its finale. She added that she had an instant chemistry with her co-star Kaley Cuoco. During the WB's merge with United Paramount Network (UPN) to form the CW Television Network (The CW) in 2006, network executives announced that there was not enough room in the schedule for a Charmed spin-off. Cuoco confirmed that a spin-off involving her character would not be developed during an interview with E!'s Kristin Veitch, and said \\"Charmed is done\\". Following the show's cancellation, Brian Krause, who played Leo Wyatt, expressed confusion over the direction of its final season. He questioned the decision to prominently feature Patterson and Cuoco, stating: \\"I don't know if they were trying to groom talent to go on to something else\\".  Characterization  Developed as a recurring character,Riggs (2007): p. 184 Christy has been noted as a \\"source of fandom controversy\\" over the exact definition of her morality. When discussing Christy's kidnapping and subsequent imprisonment by demons, Kern raised the question of whether or not she was experiencing a form of Stockholm syndrome. He cited the nature versus nurture debate as one of the factors behind the development of the character. Kern said the character returned to: \\"[a question] we've played with and toyed with and worked every way possible over the last eight years, and [for the finale] we would like to return to it.\\" Even though Kern intended for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist. Brittany Spanos of Vulture.com determined that Christy was an evil witch due to her betrayal of Billie and the Charmed Ones, and SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington identified her as the season's big bad. In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's prot√©g√©e.Gallagher & Ruditis & Ungerfeider (2006): p. 109 Ruditis followed this up in a later interview by calling Christy a pawn under the control of the Triad rather than a proper villain; he found that the series lacked a strong, female antagonist.  Powers  Christy is the older of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects through the use of a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. Christy also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.  Appearances = Television  As a child, Christy was kidnapped by a demon called Reinhardt (Brian Oerly) as part of a plan by the demonic council known as the Triad (Steven J. Oliver, S√∏ren Oliver, and Leland Crooke) to destroy the Charmed Ones: Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), and Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Prior to her abduction, the Triad sent the demon Dumain (Anthony Cistaro) to pose as Christy's imaginary friend and corrupt her. It is implied that Christy had some awareness about the Triad as her parents found the council's symbol on the final page of her diary. During the fifteen years of her kidnapping, Christy is taught to believe that it is her destiny to unite with her sister Billie Jenkins (Kaley Cuoco) and stop the Charmed Ones since they have become corrupted by their selfish desires. After gaining the power to warp reality, Billie travels back in time to speak with an 11-year-old Christy, and tracks down her location. She rescues Christy off-screen between the episodes \\"12 Angry Zen\\" and \\"The Last Temptation of Christy\\". With the Halliwells' help, Billie attempts to help Christy reintegrate back into everyday life and to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy as the key to unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power. Christy attempts to convince Billie that the Charmed Ones only use their powers for their own personal gain rather than to support the greater good; however, Billie expresses doubts about whether or not it is really their destiny to stop the Charmed Ones. Billie agrees with Christy's plans to kill the Halliwells after exploring the sisters' dreams and believing their \\"inner-truths\\" were driven by selfish desires. After turning the magical community against the Halliwells, Billie and Christy engage in the ultimate battle with the sisters, which destroys the Halliwell Manor and kills Christy, Phoebe, and Paige. Billie uses her projection power to travel back in time to save Christy, and discovers that she knowingly working with the Triad. She questions Christy's morality, and reunites with the Halliwell sisters to help them defeat the Triad. Christy and Dumain steal the cupid Coop's (Victor Webster) ring to travel back in time to warn the Triad about the outcome of the ultimate battle. Billie helps the sisters project back in time to vanquish the Triad and the past and present versions of Dumain. Billie unsuccessfully attempts to convince Christy to come back home with her. Christy refuses and throws a fireball at Billie and the Halliwell sisters; Billie telekinetically deflects it back at her and kills her.  Literature  Christy is also referenced in the comic books and novels based on the Charmed television series. In \\"Trickery Treat\\", Paige experiences guilt over her inability to prevent the massacre of the magic community instigated by Christy.Gallagher & Burge (2007): p. 15-16 Leo is also shown as still coping with Christy's betrayal. He keeps a scorch mark left by Christy on one of the manor's walls as a reminder to Piper that the house is no longer a \\"danger-free zone\\", and that she is not invincible.Gallagher & Burge (2007): p. 6 In the Charmed: Season 9 issue \\"The Heavens Can Wait\\", Prue Halliwell reveals that Billie and Christy were not destined to be powerful enough to confront the Charmed Ones. She explains that her bond to the Charmed Ones prophecy, extending even after her death, restricted her sisters from reaching their true powers and made them vulnerability to the Triad's plot with Billie and Christy. Christy does not make a physical appearance in either instance.  Reception  Television critics have expressed differing opinions about Christy's story arc with Billie. DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson felt that Billie and Christy were the strongest parts of the season, and Sheldon Wiebe of the entertainment website Eclipsemagazine.com regarded the characters as re-establishing a \\"dark undercurrent\\" reminiscent of the show's first and second seasons. Shawn S. Lealos of CHUD.com agreed that Billie and Christy's story was the highlight of the season, but asserted that more screen-time should have been given to properly develop Christy's character. Christy's role as a villain has been widely praised by television commentators, though Patterson's performance was the subject of negative criticism. Spanos placed Christy as number three on its list of 161 of the series' antagonist as rated by scariness. Demain praised Christy as an interesting character following the reveal that she was secretly working for the Triad. Gavin Hetherington, on the other hand, wrote he was indifferent about Christy, and found Billie to be the stronger character of the two. The story arc was criticized by Digital Spy's Hugh Armitage, who felt it was weakened by Patterson's \\"habit of pulling 'evil' faces when no one could see her like a pantomime villain\\". Jon Langmead of PopMatters summarized Patterson's acting as \\"huff[ing] and puff[ing] through her on-camera time\\". Critics have commented that Christy was a sign of the show's declining quality. Christy and Billie were identified as one of the eight things that derailed the series by Armitage, who called them \\"the gruesome twosome\\". Hetherington opined that the Jenkins sisters were disappointing villains for the show's final season compared to Gideon (Gildart Jackson) and Zankou (Oded Fehr) from season six and season seven respectively. Langmead regarded the familial relationship as weaker than those already explored by the show.  References =CitationsBook sources *Gallagher, Diana G; Burge, Constance M. \\"Trickery Treat\\".

The challenge takes the form of a daytime navigation exercise held in the Dartmoor National Park in the county of Devon, England. The challenge is usually held on a Saturday in late August or early September. The Dartmoor Beast takes its name from the various big cat sightings that have been a recurring feature of local folklore in the Dartmoor, Exmoor and Bodmin Moor areas for many years and from the Royal Marine Commando speed march held during the final stages of qualification for the coveted Commando green beret. 300x300px  Teams  Teams of between 4 and 8 participants hike or 'yomp' either a 20 km or 30 km route across Dartmoor carrying a pack of either 10 kg or 15 kg respectively. No prescribed route is laid down for teams entering the challenge, but various checkpoints must be visited at places around the moor. Teams are left to plot and navigate their own route between checkpoints, making use of map, compass, map reading skills and global positioning systems. Whilst the challenge is not a competition, a climate of friendly and sportsman like rivalry contributes to the sense of achievement for all teams participating in this race against the clock.  Loading  Each individual participating in the challenge is required to carry a backpack of equipment aimed at ensuring safety whilst on the moor. Adequate clothing, food and water must be carried by each team member, in addition to maps, first aid kit, torch and other important items. The weight of each team member's backpack is checked at the start, finish and various points along the route, and time penalties are levied for every kg under the prescribed weight that each team member is found to be carrying. In practice this means that the 10 kg or 15 kg must not include the weight of food and water that will be consumed en route. Participants that are found to be carrying less than the required weight find their load increased by one or more of the many rocks that litter Dartmoor.  Navigation  The Dartmoor National Park is notorious for being a difficult environment in which to navigate, especially if visibility is poor. The moor often experiences extensive hill fog, or 'clag' as it is locally known, which combined with the absence of many linear features (such as walls, paths, fences, forest edges) provides a challenging test for even the most confident navigator. thumb  Staffing  In previous years the challenge has been staffed by volunteers from the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR) Bristol and representatives of the CCA. The checkpoints provide an opportunity for RMR staff to assess the fitness, progress and morale of each team, ensuring their safety throughout the competition.  Rewards of participation  Each team member who completes the challenge receives a completion certificate and prizes are awarded for the fastest team on the 20 km and 30 km routes and various other notable achievements. The event culminates in a barbecue hosted by the RMR and CCA at the Fox and Hounds Public House, in Bridstowe, Devon - which acts as the start/finish and command post for the event.

In some situations where a circuit includes numerous small congregations spread over a large area, the circuit may be subdivided for visitation purposes but still count as a single circuit for voting purposes. A circuit visitor is a pastor who helps to oversee the other pastors within a circuit. The position is best understood as a peer advisor, as the LCMS has traditionally been strongly congregational, as opposed to hierarchical, in its extra-congregational structure. Nevertheless, there is a district president over the circuit visitors who is ultimately responsible for the pastors and congregations (generally numbering 100-300) in his district.

It lies on the river Sieg, roughly 7 km northeast of Siegen. Geography=Location Netphen lies on the Rothaargebirge's southern slope and forms the natural boundary of the Wittgensteiner Land. The municipal area is made up of many dales and mountain ridges. Northeast of the constituent community of Walpersdorf lies the source of the river Sieg and in the Lahnhof ‚Äì another constituent community whose name takes the definite article ‚Äì lies the source of the river Lahn.

The area is around 5.9 km¬≤ The first mention of the area was on the 13 of February 1345 as \\"afelterbach\\" Siegener Urkundenbuch Band I, Siegen, 1887, S. 176‚Äì179, Nr. 288.. Beienbach The constituent community of Beienbach lies at the end of a small side dale of the Sieg between Netphen and Deuz and is fringed by spruce and broadleaf forest on the heights and by agricultural areas as well as old \\"fruit meadows\\" (where various fruit trees grow) right at the edge of the community. It is also crossed by the Katzenbach. It had its first documentary mention in 1299. Brauersdorf Brauersdorf lies near the Netphen Leisure Park (Netphener Freizeitpark) with its swimming pool, ice skating rink, fitness and sport centre, miniature golf course, and so on. Furthermore, the community lies right at the Obernau Dam. Brauersdorf Deuz Owing to its advantageous location, Deuz became the first industrial community in the old Amt of Netphen. Moving the Irle iron foundry from Kaan-Marienborn to Deuz is viewed as an economic birth. Over the years, further businesses have set up shop in Deuz. Dreis-Tiefenbach Dreis- Tiefenbach is, with its population of about 5300, Netphen's biggest constituent community, lying about 262 to 350 m above sea level on an area of some 7.5 km¬≤. It is roughly 6 km from Siegen and 4 km from Netphen (main town). Dreis-Tiefenbach lies on Federal Highway (Bundesstra√üe) 62, which joins with the H√ºttentalstra√üe. The community's environs consist of relatively broad, thick mixed forest and broad meadows. Dreis-Tiefenbach was likely once settled by Celts. It had its first documentary mention in 1239. EckmannshausenEschenbachFrohnhausen Frohnhausen lies roughly 2 km from Netphen (main town). As of 2005, some 470 people live there. The community ranges from 350 to 540 m above sea level, and roughly 70% of it is wooded, with the rest made up of fields, meadows, and built-up areas. The heart of the village consists mainly of half-timbered houses protected as monuments and built in the 17th and 18th centuries. Grissenbach Grissenbach lies in Netphen's east, right at the foot of the Rothaargebirge Nature Park. As with Frohnhausen, 70% of the community is wooded, with the rest made up of fields, meadows, and built-up areas. The community ranges from 336 to 530 m above sea level, and has an area of 4.6 km¬≤. As of June 2005, Grissenbach is home to 894 people, giving it a population density of 194/km¬≤, considerably lower than the average for the Federal Republic of Germany (about 230/km¬≤). Hainchen Hainchen's area encompasses 10.7 km¬≤, 6.5 km¬≤ of which is wooded, with the rest made up of meadows and built-up areas. The boundary runs for roughly 8 km along the border with Hesse. As well, Hainchen borders on the town of Bad Laasphe in the north and in the south on the community of Wilnsdorf. The difference in elevation between the entrance to the community and the exit from it at the Hessian border is 96 m (384 to 480 m). From the entrance to the Geiersgrundbach Valley to the boundary with Bad Laasphe, the difference in elevation is 190 m. The community has developed from one of small handicraft businesses and independent farmers to an industrial community nowadays, with two prefabricated house companies, one mechanical workshop and four service-sector businesses setting up shop here. Furthermore, there are four businesses using agricultural land, two of which are major landholders. All together, there are 129 registered jobs in the community. The overwhelming majority of workers commute to neighbouring areas (Greater Siegen, neighbouring areas in Hesse). An advantage to the community is the nearby A 45, only 14 km away and reachable in a matter of minutes. The advantageous transport links have also had something to do with revitalizing the hiking trails along the Rothaarsteig, 7 km of which run through Hainchen. Hainchen also has a castle, the Burg Hainchen, built in the heights with a moat. It has been standing at least since 1290, the year when it was first mentioned in a document. Helgersdorf Some 400 people live in Helgersdorf. Things to see there include the Mahnglockenturm (bell tower), the Backes (an old bakehouse), the old mill and Saint Elisabeth's Chapel. Here, too, the Wurstekommission ‚Äì \\"Sausage Commission\\" ‚Äì has been represented since 1919 (this is an organization dedicated mostly to scaring away evil spirits at New Year's; they get their name from the door-to-door sausage donations that they seek for the attendant festival). Herzhausen Herzhausen was for a long time an independent community, but is now a constituent community of Netphen. Lying in the middle of the Rothaargebirge, Herzhausen is even now still shaped by agriculture and forestry as well as ancient Siegerland traditions such as the Hauberg (a long-standing practice of co√∂perative forestry in this region) or the Martinsfeuer, or Saint Martin's Fire, a custom on Saint Martin's Day (11 November). The high point of the year is the yearly shooting festival, known far beyond the regional bounds. Herzhausen lies on the state highway (Landesstra√üe) between Dreis-Tiefenbach and Hilchenbach. In 2005, a citizens' club was founded. Also once found in Herzhausen was the district garbage dump. The storage of household rubbish there, however, is no longer allowed, and it is now used as an earth dump. Further trash is now sorted for incineration and forwarded. Irmgarteichen Roughly 900 people call Irmgarteichen home. It was once a community with great (ecclesiastical) importance. In Irmgarteichen, many clubs have had a hand in shaping the community as it is today. Very important rites are Drette Krestach and the Osterfeuer of the Hermedeicher Jonge. Nenkersdorf Mill in NenkersdorfNenkersdorf lies east of the constituent community of Grissenbach. The historic watermill on the eastern edge of the community is said to be particularly worth seeing. Lahnhof Source of the Lahn in the LahnhofThe Lahnhof, whose name takes the definite article (always der/den/dem Lahnhof, des Lahnhof(e)s in German), lies in the southeast Rothaargebirge at a height of 607 m above sea level. Its name first appeared in a document in 1333. Right nearby rise the rivers Lahn, Sieg and Eder. The pristine nature, to say nothing of the outstanding views when the weather is good, has led the Lahnhof to become, just as was also true one hundred years ago, one of the best loved local outing destinations from near and far. OelgershausenSalchendorf Since at least 1920 there has been in Salchendorf a youth association called the Wurstekommission (see Helgersdorf above) which has about 50 active members, 14 of whom are on the council of elders. In the middle of the village has stood since 1995 the Wurstekommission Memorial. A Salchendorf portal is in the planning stage. SohlbachUnglinghausenWalpersdorf WalpersdorfWalpersdorf had its first documentary mention in 1344. It is well known for its charcoal kilns and nature reserve with its snowflake meadows. Geographically, Walpersdorf, the first place on the river Sieg, lies at the edge of the Rothaarsteig hiking trail. About 3 km away rise the rivers Sieg, Lahn and Eder. Werthenbach Wertenbach was once an independent community. It came into being sometime between 900 and 1300 and has an adjusted area of 9.37 km¬≤, meaning that the area was once greater, but early in the 18th century, former border forests and protected woodlands belonging to the local lord were merged with neighbouring communities. Werthenbach, unlike other constituent communities' names like Sohlbach, Beienbach, Grissenbach, and so on, is not the community's original name, but rather it was once called Werthenbrecht. The placename element brecht that occurred in the name before it was corrupted can be compared to the common mountain name Bracht, and in the Rhenish Slate Mountains can still be found as a description for newer \\"clearing\\" communities. Werthenbach's earliest mentions: * 1336 Hartmann von Wertinbrecht * 1343 Hartmann von Wertinbracht * 1344 Wernckenbracht. In 1343, the Lords of Bicken relinquished an estate (actually a Hauberg ‚Äì see Herzhausen above) to the villagers in what was then called Wertinbracht as long as they paid a yearly fee for this favour to the Monastery of Keppel. The earnings from the Bicken estates in 1447 amounted to a \\"tithe of 7 Malter of corn, 11 Malter of oats\\" (a Malter being \\"15 pieces\\", so 105 and 165 respectively). Eleven houses stood on monastery land in 1566. A few meadows in Werthenbach have names bearing witness to the old landlords' ownership or rights. Zehntwiese, for instance, refers to Zehnten ‚Äì tithes. The Herrenberg (mountain) has a name suggesting lordly ownership (\\"Herr\\" means \\"lord\\"). The local \\"Hauberg\\" forestry co√∂perative, popularly called \\"Kloster\\" (\\"Monastery\\") evokes the Keppel Monastery's historical ownership of the land. In Werthenbach, on the street \\"Am Heller\\", 5 holiday cottages are to be built by 2007. Despite considerable protest from some quarters of the village community, the holiday village was approved on 27 March 2006 by the Netphen Town Development Board. Critics hold that it is unfair that rather than private houses, holiday cottages are being built on these lots. They will be built by a local prefabricated house company. History The earliest mention of this region of Siegen-Wittgenstein goes back to the 11th century. Here, as in most parts of the old Siegen district, the princely House of Nassau is named as the local overlords. In 1215, the Lords of Hain were mentioned as being at Hainchen Castle. From 1635 to 1637 raged the Plague. In 1742, Netphen, like all other places north of the Lahn, passed to Prince Wilhelm Karl Friso of Orange, Prince of Diez and heir to the United Netherlands, thereby making the Principality of Nassau-Siegen part of the Netherlands. Napoleon added the Siegerland to the Grand Duchy of Berg as part of his rearrangement of Germany. This change was, however, undone in 1813 and Netphen once again became Orange domain. In 1815, the House of Orange forwent all its German possessions and Netphen passed to Prussia in 1816. On 1 January 1969, as part of municipal reform, the greater community of Netphen came into being. On 30 June 1997, Netphen's population reached the 25,000 mark, thereby earning it town status. This was not made official, however, until just before the turn of the millennium, on 1 January 2000. Politics=Mayors * 1969‚Äì1989: Gerhard Josef Zimmermann (CDU), (1922 or 1923-2009) * 1989‚Äì1994: Helmut Buttler (SPD) * 1994‚Äì2009: R√ºdiger Bartsch (died 2015) * since October 2009: Paul Wagener (independent) Town council The town council's 38 seats are apportioned thus, in accordance with municipal elections held on May, 25, 2014 and September, 21, 2014. *CDU 15 seats *SPD 10 seats *Greens 2 seats *FDP 1 seats *UWG 5 seats * Die Linke 1 seat Note: UWG is a citizens' coalition. Coat of arms Netphen's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: Per fess, azure semee of billets a demi-lion Or armed and langued gules and Or a boar saltant sable langued gules. The lion is from Nassau's arms. The springing boar is copied from the oldest preserved seal of the Siegerland Court, from 1467. It belonged to the \\"Sch√∂ffen tzo Netfe ind Irmgarteichen\\", or the Jurymen at Netphen and Irmgarteichen. The Netphen symbol has its origins in the old Yule festival, in which the boar was sacrificed to the gods. Town partnerships * ≈ªaga≈Ñ, Poland, since 1995 * Qui√©vy, France * Vrchlab√≠, Czech Republic Culture and sightseeing=MuseenHeimatmuseum= Since 1996 there has existed in the local history museum a great exhibition room with exhibits from prehistory and early history. The focus is on the Netpherland economy with tanning, charcoal making, the Hauberg forestry system, the practice of Hude ( ‚âà silvopasture) and beekeeping. The same building also houses the cultural and tourism office. BuildingsMartinikirche= The Martini Church is a hall church from the 13th century. Beginning at dusk and into the night, the Romanesque tower is lit up. =Obernautalsperre= The Obernau Reservoir, which holds 15 000 000 m¬≥ of water is the biggest drinking water reservoir in the Siegerland. A track leading all the way round the reservoir invites hikers. Towering over the reservoir is the Alte Burg, or Old Castle, a \\"flight castle\\" (one used mainly for retreat or refuge) and a place of worship from La T√®ne times about 500 BC. Every New Year's Eve, a Volkslauf ( ‚âà fun run) is held there. =Wasserburg Hainchen= In Hainchen is found the reconstructed Wasserburg Hainchen, a moat-ringed castle. =Nenkersdorf Watermill= The mill's history goes back to the 12th century. It belonged until the 14th century to the Lords (Schlossherren) of Hainchen. At that time, the lord gave it to his tenant. Since that time, for more than five generations, the mill has been under the Weber family's ownership. =Walpersdorf charcoal kiln= Making charcoal is a tradition that goes back a long time in the Siegerland, owing mainly to another long tradition, iron smelting. In Walpersdorf is found the Siegerland's only charcoal kiln that is still used. The charcoal is made out of oak, birch and beech, yielding roughly one tonne of charcoal for every four of wood. Sport Netphen has a leisure park with a tennis hall, an ice stadium and an indoor swimming pool. The tennis hall and ice stadium were completed in October 1976, and on 14 May 1977 opened together with the indoor swimming pool. The outdoor swimming pool followed a short time later. Netphen's biggest sport club is the TVE. Culinary specialities Riewekooche, a kind of potato bread, is the local contribution to the world of food. Economy and infrastructure=Established businessesAMOVA= The plant for AMOVA manufactures a variety of goods handling systems, for the aviation, port logistics, and metal fabrication industries. =Firma Walzen Irle GmbH= Walzen Irle GmbH is a roller manufacturer. The traditional business can look back on a 180-year history, and was the first company in Germany to make chilled cast iron rollers. Today Walzen Irle belongs to the Irle Group and is a 100% daughter company of Irle-Deuz GmbH. =Flender-Flux= Flender-Flux is a traditional business in Deuz with a 240-year history whose main business is in manufacturing metal roof systems. = Deuzer Maschinenfabrik Heitze GmbH & Co. = The firm began on 1 May 1939 as a limited partnership for the purpose of making machines and apparatuses and also pursuing trade in the same, under the name Maschinenfabrik M Heitze, Kommanditgesellschaft, and under the personally liable partner, millwrighting master Martin Heitze, the engineer Edmund Dietrich and the director Ernst Zimmermann. By late 1939, the first works hall with a floor area of 600 m¬≤ was in place, and it was equipped with 3 lathes, 1 drilling machine, 1 handheld welding site and 5 millwrighting workplaces. Machine production did not, however, begin before the war broke out that same year. In 1939, the workforce was 6 persons. By late 1945, this had risen to 8. The first machines built at the plant were ones for woodworking, such as firewood cutting machines, carpenter's circular saws, wood drilling machines and long band saws. This production stopped in 1945 after more than 200 machines had been completed. When Mr. Honig joined the firm after the Second World War as a constructing engineer, and later a shareholder, his connection to his former employer, the Waldrich firm in Siegen, led to the company's beginning production, with the Eugen Waldrich firm in Bad Godesberg, of glass pane finishing machines late in 1945. The programme was based on folding-arm polishing machines, combination grinding and polishing machines, horizontal grinding machines, glass drilling machines and groove cutting machines. Production continued until 1965, shutting down only slowly after having fulfilled the glass industry's backlog. =Bombardier Transportation= In Netphen lies a Bombardier Transportation works at which bogies are made. Transport The world's first petrol-powered bus on the world's first busline. The destinations are clearly mounted on the display board at the cantrail. The main road to the town is Federal Highway (Bundesstra√üe) B 62, crossing the municipal area from southwest to northeast. At Dreis-Tiefenbach is an interchange with the Siegen municipal Autobahn (H√ºttentalstra√üe). For goods transport, there was once a railway line that ran from Irmgarteichen to Siegen-Weidenau. It was abandoned in 2004, except for works runs between Walzen Irle's works. A short stretch of the Rothaarbahn railway cuts across the municipal area in the northeast, but there is no stop. The world's first motorised bus route ran through the town, operated by the Netphener Omnibus- Gesellschaft as Siegen-Netphen-Deuz. It opened on 18 March 1895 with one bus powered by a single-cylinder petrol engine supplied by Benz & Cie. Local passenger transport now is supplied by Verkehrsgemeinschaft Westfalen-S√ºd (VGWS)(South Westphalia Transport Community) bus routes. The town is connected to regional air travel through the Siegerland Airport in Burbach, southwest of Netphen.

The five teens include two rival gang leaders, Ruben Pacecho (Michael Carmine), the leader of the Home Boys serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault and armed robbery; Moss Roosevelt (Leon Robinson), the leader of the 27th Avenue Players, also serving a three-year sentence, for assault and armed robbery; Carlos Aragon (Danny Quinn), a drug trafficker serving a four-year sentence after being arrested in a police sting; James Lee \\"J.L.\\" MacEwen (John Cameron Mitchell), the youngest and most violent of the teenagers, serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter of his abusive and alcoholic father and various arson charges; Dorcey Bridger (Al Shannon), a car thief serving three-plus years for various auto theft and over 15 escape attempts from various juvenile halls. Forced into the swamps, the teens must learn to survive in the dangerous swamp and how to work together. Upon completion of the program, the group buys a vacant house in a dangerous part of Miami and slowly rebuilds the neighborhood, kicking out the pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers. This offends the former illegal inhabitants of their house, all loyal customers of drug baron Cream (Laurence Fishburne). The conflict leads to armed fights, in which Joe is killed. The surviving members of the group take the fight directly to a drug manufacturing facility that is equipped with an M-134 Minigun.

Much of what is known about Black Patch Chaplin Park appears in a book by Ted Rudge, developed from an Open University degree thesis, and published by Birmingham City Council in 2003. Rudge's research records how, from the mid-19th century until they were evicted from it at the start of the 20th, the 'Black Patch' was the camping ground of a community of tent and vardo (caravan) dwellers who were to become integrated with 'gaujos' (non-Gypsies) in surrounding districts. The Gypsies on the Black Patch lived on a deep barren layer of furnace waste, which, after their eviction, was cleared down to grass growing soil to create a park.Ted Rudge Brumroamin: Birmingham and Midland Romany Gypsy and Traveller Culture. Birmingham City Council Department of Leisure & Community Services (2003) There is disputed evidence that Charlie Chaplin might have been born at Black Patch.  Situation  Boundary Brook Black Patch Park lies 2¬Ω miles from Birmingham city centre just outside the boundary of the city, and is surrounded north, east and south by railway embankments. One of these carries the Birmingham - Wolverhampton part of West Coast Main Line. That and the A41 and the Birmingham Canal Navigations' Birmingham to Wolverhampton 'Mainline' canals - old and new - are arteries of the region's 'North West Corridor of Regeneration'. In the centre of Black Patch Park, Boundary Brook, which for centuries marked a boundary between Staffordshire and Warwickshire, meets Hockley Brook, which once separated the country villages of Handsworth and Smethwick. Boundary Brook enters from the South, while Hockley Brook comes in from the West under Woodburn Road. The park is linked to the Birmingham main line canal via a route through Avery Road that connects it to the West Midlands Sustrans Cycle Route 5, running along the canal towpath, part of a National Cycle Network running from the Cotswolds via Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick, Birmingham, and Stafford to Stoke- on-Trent in Staffordshire. Black Patch Park is edged by Foundry Lane to the west and south, Woodburn Road to the north, and to the east, Perrott Street, beyond which, as far as Handsworth New Road, stretches the triangle of Merry Hill Allotment Gardens. The West Midlands Metro has two stops nearby; Winson Green Outer Circle and Handsworth Booth Street. Kitchener Street which, until they were demolished in 1980, ran between terraced houses, was gated in January 2009 under section 129A of the Highways act 1980 - a measure intended by Sandwell MBC to prevent extensive fly-tipping.  Industrial Revolution  Merry Hill Allotments 2004 In 1769 James Brindley supervised the building of a canal between Birmingham and the Black Country. This waterway came to be known, within 60 years, as the 'old' Main Line Canal after Thomas Telford constructed a straighter, broader New Birmingham Main Line Canal, which opened in 1829 to carry an ever-increasing volume of narrow boat traffic. Brindley and Telford's waterways attracted industrial entrepreneurs including Matthew Boulton, and James Watt who bought by the canal at Merry Hill, about a mile from the firm's Soho Manufactory in Handsworth and opened the Soho FoundryAvery Weigh-Tronix in 1796 'for the purpose of casting everything relating to our steam engines'. As the local population grew, tension developed between them and the travellers. Rudge records that Gypsies and travellers camped on the \\"Black Patch\\" from the mid-19th century, not always with approval of local people. Only in the early 20th century, and after several attempts, were the Gypsies finally and forcibly evicted from the 'Black Patch' as rising population density and new land owning assumptions placed greater and greater restriction on their traditional sites. From being a thriving industrial site, the area was transformed in little more than a lifetime, to a site of dereliction, with the decline of almost all the park's surrounding industrial giants during the economic upheaval of the 1960s. One successful survivor is Avery Weigh-Tronix on Foundry Lane, the world's largest manufacturers of machines for weighing, counting, measuring and testing, whose main entrance is the frontage of Boulton's and Watt's old Soho Foundry opposite the 'Soho Foundry Tavern'.  Gypsy connection  Gypsies on the Black PatchRudge says that Esau Smith was the acknowledged king of the Black Patch. When he died in 1901 at the age of 92, his widow Henty was elected queen. Even while Esau was alive it was generally understood by local people that the Gypsies gained legal rights to the land as squatters. Though such rights are seldom written down, it is said that deeds to this effect were destroyed when the king and queen's caravan was ritually burned after her death on 7 January 1907. Queen Henty, who was buried with her husband in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, is said to have placed a curse on anyone who builds over the Black Patch, the subject of a song by the well known folk artist Bryn Phillips in September 2003.Ted Rudge's web pages on a campaign to save Black Patch Park(including the full text of Bryn Phillips song) In 1906 Mrs E J E Pilkington and Tangye Ltd were referred to as legal owners of Black Patch, having put it up for sale after employing land agents to carry out a court imposed eviction of the Gypsies on 26 July 1905. They did not finally relinquish links with the land until a \\"peaceful eviction\\" was negotiated by Birmingham Corporation Parks Department on 15 February 1909. Subsequent stories contribute to reasonable doubt as to who ought to have inherited the Black Patch and who now holds legal title to the Gypsies' old camping ground. Rudge reports that in 1960 Jane Badger, who lived near Black Patch, got into conversation while walking by the Park with a gentleman with an American accent. He claimed he owned the deeds to the land. This story resembles a statement made by Ray Plant, a distant relative of the Black Patch Gypsies, that a family called Murdock once owned the land and gave permission to camp there. According to Ray Plant when the Murdocks emigrated to America they handed over the Black Patch deeds to the Gypsies. The deeds were apparently stolen making any of the gypsies claims to the land unfounded. Many of the gypsy descendants still live in the surrounding area - the names of descendants accessible via the National Census. In July 2005, a memorial plaque to the gypsies was erected. Sometime in March 2007 this plaque disappeared but has since been replaced.  Creating the Park  Despite past and present doubts about exact ownership the impetus for and organisation of its purchase and development as a public park came from the Birmingham Playgrounds, Open Spaces and Playing Fields Society, chaired by John Nettlefold, a Birmingham Councillor, married into the Chamberlain family. A mix of public subscription and cash from Smethwick and Handsworth Councils and Birmingham Corporation raised ¬£12,200. One of the vendors, Mrs Pilkington, donated ¬£500 from the conveyance to assist with their aim of providing a place where people could enjoy fresh air away from the smoky atmosphere of the surrounding factories. The new public space was divided into three; in Handsworth, seven in Smethwick and seven in Birmingham. Further land was acquired to build Perrott Street, widen the Great Western Railway and provide the Merry Hill Allotments on the other side of Perrott Street. Birmingham Corporation was asked by the Society to lay out and manage Black Patch Park. Unemployed people under the supervision of a Parks' Superintendent carried out this work. It began in January 1909 and was completed in May 1910. The Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Alderman Bowater, formally opened the Black Patch Recreation Ground on 20 June 1911. In 1966 management was taken over by the new Borough of Warley, now Sandwell Metropolitan Council, whose Planning Department confirms that covenants held by Pilkington and Tangye still exist, but until then Black Patch Park was under the stewardship of Birmingham Parks Department.  Campaign to save Black Patch Park  In August 2003 a campaigning group called \\"The Friends of Black Patch Park\\" was formed to challenge proposals outlined in Sandwell Council's Unitary Development Plan to zone two thirds of the park for industrial use. The aim of the Friends of Black Patch Park has been to protect, celebrate and enhance the park's - as originally created by public subscription in 1907 - as a place of historic importance and indispensable green space for future generations. As well as its legacy as a traditional Romany camping ground, the park's current value is as a wildlife oasis, a place for quiet walks and relaxation and an essential site for a large number of young people from diverse backgrounds to practice sport. Footballers from the Soho Foundry Tavern and many other Warley League Teams, are strongly against the loss of the playing fields that make up the largest part of the Black Patch.  Regeneration  Agenda item 5 of a Report to the Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Transport, Councillor Bob Badham, Sandwell MBC, dated 21 February 2007, states: > Within the adopted Unitary Development Plan, sites around Black Patch Park, > near to the Soho Foundry were allocated for industrial uses in order to > attract investment for a Technology Park. However, this has not come to > fruition. A recent Employment Land Survey has revealed that there is no > immediate need for further industrial land in this location. As there are no > deliverable proposals identified, and to accommodate the wishes of Friends > of Black Patch Park to retain the Park area, these allocations have been > removed.

Smethwick Area Action Plan - Preferred Option Document > (Cabinet Forward Plan Ref. No. RT089). On 30 August 2017 Sandwell MBC Cabinet, under the leadership of Cllr Steve Eling, agreed a policy to rezone land around Black Patch Park for housing.

Connors and Christopher Lawrence. The game was originally developed as RuneQuest: Slayers, a follow-up to the third edition of RuneQuest by the publisher Avalon Hill, which owned the RuneQuest trademark at the time. In 1998 Avalon Hill was acquired by Hasbro and the project was canceled. The authors then published the game on the Internet as a free PDF file, under the title RuneSlayers.  History  The first two editions of RuneQuest were published in 1978 and 1980, respectively, by Chaosium. They were firmly set in Chaosium founder Greg Stafford's fictional world of Glorantha. The third edition was published in 1984 by Avalon Hill as part of a deal where Avalon Hill took ownership of the RuneQuest trademark while Chaosium retained copyright to the rules text and full ownership of the Glorantha setting, which Avalon Hill used under license. In the mid 1990s, Avalon Hill began work on a fourth edition of RuneQuest subtitled Adventures in Gorantha, however Stafford did not approve of the project and it was canceled. Avalon Hill, to assert their trademark to the RuneQuest name, instead hired new designers on the project to start over with a fresh approach. Slated for a 1998 release, RuneQuest: Slayers, did not resemble previous editions in regards to rules and focused on a low-magic setting inspired by pulp sword and sorcery fiction. RuneQuest: Slayers was literally at the printers when Hasbro acquired Avalon Hill and canceled the project. RuneQuest: Slayers was never formally released. The rights to RuneQuest: Slayers reverted to the authors who released the game as RuneSlayers as a free PDF on the Internet.

The largest retail complex in the state, it opened in 1988 after more than 20 years of planning, and features 150 stores, with Macy's (formerly The Bon March√©), JCPenney, Kohl's and Dillard's (added in 1998) as anchor stores. The mall also includes the first Apple Store in Idaho. Boise Towne Square is owned by the Chicago-based Brookfield Properties Retail Group and is located near the junction of Interstate 84 and Interstate 184. Brookfield Properties Retail Group also operates an adjacent strip mall, Boise Towne Plaza, which is anchored by Nordstrom Rack and Old Navy.Boise Towne Square Mall - Store Directory In addition, the mall comprises nine freestanding businesses on its property, including major retailers PetSmart and Pier 1 Imports. History=Plans for mall in Boise The idea for a large regional shopping mall for Boise had been in discussion during the 1960s and 1970s.Boise Redevelopment Agency documents, 1974-1989 The first major proposal came in 1973, when Karcher Mall developer Harry Daum attempted to purchase land, owned by Larry and Peg Ott, near the intersection of Cole and Franklin Roads in Boise. The Otts responded with a lawsuit to stop Daum from attempting the building a shopping mall on their property. In 1976, the Otts agreed not to protest developer Larry Leasure's efforts to get the shopping center site annexed and zoned for commercial use. In return, they agreed to the let the property be developed as a community shopping center and office buildings, not a regional shopping mall. In 1978, another unsuccessful purchase attempt of the property was led by developer Ernest Hahn. In the early 1980s, various developers proposed ideas for a shopping mall in and around Boise. This began in 1980, with a mall proposed for nearby Meridian. During the same year, an urban renewal project in downtown Boise was planned to include a large shopping mall with Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) as an anchor store. ZCMI backed out of the downtown project in October 1980, and The Bon March√© was added in its place in 1981. The city eventually gave up on the idea of downtown shopping mall. In 1982, Salt Lake City developer John Price proposed another shopping mall near the intersection of Interstate 84 and Cloverdale Road. Department store chains J. C. Penney, Lamonts, Sears, and ZCMI were committed to anchor the new shopping mall. In December 1982, the Federal Highway Administration approved a $6 million interchange at Cloverdale Road. Price offered to pay for the interchange, which would have advanced the 1990 completion date to 1985 or 1986. Meanwhile, Boise developer Larry Leasure proposed a shopping mall, named Westpark, at the intersection of Cole and Franklin Roads, but the mall was on hold due to zoning and access problems. Price said he might consider dropping the Cloverdale project if Leasure would agree to sell the Westpark site to him when the issues were resolved. By December 1986, construction began on Boise Towne Square northwest of the intersection of Cole and Franklin Roads, the original site where Harry Daum attempted to build a shopping mall 13 years earlier. Within the next year, it was announced that Sears, JCPenney, Mervyns and The Bon March√© would be the new mall's anchor stores. Sears, JCPenney and The Bon March√© were operating locations in downtown Boise, and the latter two stores were also anchors at the Karcher Mall in nearby Nampa, the only mall in the area at the time. After Boise Towne Square opened, Karcher Mall would lose business to Boise Towne Square. Opening In September 1988, Sears and JCPenney both began to liquidate their downtown locations in preparation to open in the new mall. At the time JCPenney also liquidated their Karcher Mall location in Nampa and sold the location to Troutman's Emporium. The Bon March√©, however, planned to keep its downtown location for at least a year but eventually stayed until the chain's demise in 2005 when the company's name was converted to Macy's. Macy's operated the downtown location for five more years before closing in 2010 after declining sales. After much anticipation, the mall's first anchors, The Bon March√© and Sears, opened their doors on October 9, 1988 at 10 a.m. Kim Clark, advertising and special events coordinator for The Bon March√©, estimated that 10,000 people from the area would visit the store's grand opening. The mall's third anchor, JCPenney, opened its doors on October 12, the same day JCPenney closed its downtown Boise location, which it had operated since 1932. The mall's formal grand opening occurred on October 19. The mall's grand opening included a ribbon cutting ceremony with then mayor of Boise, Dirk Kempthorne. The mall's fourth anchor, Hayward, California-based Mervyn's, opened in February 1989. In September 1989, ZCMI made plans to open two ZCMI II stores in Boise, including a location at Boise Towne Square, but neither were built. 1995-1998 expansions Macy's (previously The Bon March√©) at Boise Towne Square Mall in 2010. In November 1995, the mall officially announced plans for a major expansion that would bring a fifth anchor store to the mall. Among the retailers rumored for the fifth anchor spot were Dillard's and ZCMI. Richard Madsen, president of ZCMI, confirmed JP Realty had drawn expansion plans with Dillard's listed as the fifth anchor Despite this, Rex Frazier, president of JP Realty, confirmed the company was talking with Dillard's, but would not confirm any business arrangements. Also in November, The Bon March√© began a two-phase expansion of its store at mall. Phase one of the expansion included renovating a space vacated in December 1994 by Lamonts for Kids; the second phase was a addition. In February 1996, Dillard's was officially confirmed as the mall's fifth and largest anchor store. In addition to the new store, a new addition of new retail space was set to be built south of the new Dillard's store. Three months later, plans for the expansion were put on hold when the mall was sued by The Bon March√©. The Bon claimed the addition of Dillard's is a twofold violation of The Bon's lease, which states that consent is required before physical changes can be made to the mall. The lawsuit was settled in January 1997 and plans for the expansion were approved by the Boise Design Review Committee. Construction on the expansion and the Dillard's store began in June, with Dillard's opening and most of the mall's new stores opening in August 1998. In an interview with the Idaho Statesman, the chairman of JP Realty revealed he hopes to eventually add a sixth anchor tenant and parking garages to mall. More expansions; closure of theater Mervyns at Boise Towne Square Mall during its store closing sale in 2008. A Kohl's department store moved into the space in September 2011. During 1999, the mall completed a five-month, $1 million remodel of the food court. In 2001, Loews Cineplex announced the closure of three Treasure Valley theaters, including the mall's theater. The movie theater, which previously operated as a Cineplex Odeon until its 1998 merger with Loews, was opened in 1988. The empty theater was reopened by local movie theater chain, The Reel Theatre, in December 2004. The Reel Theatre shut down the Boise Towne Square location in 2007 after a major renovation of a nearby location. The mall's theater remained vacant until it was demolished in October 2009 for a PetSmart store. The PetSmart store opened in 2010 after relocating from an older location nearby. In 2006, the mall was expanded to add of retail space. The expansion's first new tenants included Borders, which relocated from an older location nearby, and The Cheesecake Factory. The expansion also added Talbots, which relocated from its 19-year-old Parkcenter Mall location, in October 2007. An interior renovation was completed in October 2008. The 2007 expansion has made Boise Towne Square the largest mall in Idaho, with more than 180 stores. 2008 to present One of several smartphone charging stations at the mall. In August 2008, long-time anchor Mervyns announced it would close its location in the mall in late early November 2008, as part of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. A contractor bidding announcement confirmed Kohl's was planning a store at the Boise Towne Square Mall in the former Mervyns building. Construction on the new Kohl's store began March 1 and was completed September 27, 2011. On February 9, 2009, local police were forced to evacuate the mall after several suspicious devices were found, a first for the 20-year-old shopping mall. At least 2,000 customers and employees were in the mall when it was evacuated. Boise police and federal law enforcement located what were discovered to be fake explosives in several different locations in the mall. The mall reopened at its regular time the following day. It was announced in February 2010, Apple Inc. had chosen the mall for Idaho's first Apple Store location. The new store was opened on September 11, 2010. In January 2011, Nordstrom announced it was considering the Boise Towne Square Mall as a location for Idaho's first Nordstrom Rack. On February 16, 2011, Borders Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and the closure of 200 of its 642 bookstores. The mall's location was not included in the closure list released by the company. The mall's owner has requested to appear in the Borders bankruptcy case, in order to represent their interests. On July 18, 2011, Borders announced it would liquidate and close its remaining 399 stores. The store closed on September 13, 2011. Less than a year later, H&M; announced plans to open its first Idaho store in the vacant Borders space. On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide. The store closed in January 2019. Boise Towne Plaza During late 1997, JP Realty Inc., owner of the mall during the 1990s, began construction on a shopping center in a area adjacent to the mall, called Boise Towne Plaza. The shopping center's initial anchors were Circuit City and Linens 'n Things. An additional anchor, Old Navy, was later added on. A 1999 expansion added Hallmark and Famous Footwear. Linens 'n Things announced it would liquidate and close its remaining stores in October 2008. On January 16, 2009, it was announced that Circuit City would also liquidate and close remaining stores. On March 31, 2011, Nordstrom confirmed that Idaho's first Nordstrom Rack would open at the former Linens 'n Things building. The store opened on April 12, 2012. On April 12, 2012, at the grand opening of Nordstrom Rack, a mall spokesperson confirmed that retailer Ulta Beauty would open in one half of the former Circuit City building. On April 23, 2012, it was confirmed that restaurant chain Dave & Buster's would open in the remaining space left in the former Circuit City building.

He started out playing for Bannow Celtic in Dublin where he soon caught the attention of Belvedere. He started his senior career in the Bohemians B team but with a breakthrough to the first team proving elusive, he moved to Shamrock Rovers making his debut on 14 March 1999 against Derry City. He then returned to Bohemians where he played for just one season (1999‚Äì20), gaining an FAI Cup Runners up medal before being snapped up on a free transfer by English Football League One club AFC Bournemouth, where he played 168 league games and scored 24 goals. Garreth was a noughties Bournemouth legend who had similarities to Marc Pugh. His excellent dribbling and wing play made him a key asset. In May 2005 he moved on a Bosman transfer to play in the Football League Championship with Burnley where he played regularly during the 2005‚Äì06 season, mainly scoring his goals from set-pieces. One of his most memorable goals was a 25-yard free-kick against Wolverhampton Wanderers, in a match which Burnley won 1‚Äì0. However, his appearances became less regular during the second half of the season and he spent the 2006‚Äì07 season as a little used substitute and squad player. He did though score Burnley's second goal in the 3‚Äì2 defeat at Reading after coming on as a substitute. He was placed on the transfer list at the end of that season. On 12 June 2007 O'Connor returned to Bournemouth on trial with the possibility of a season long loan. However, this did not happen and he returned to Burnley. There he found himself frozen out of the first-team squad by Steve Cotterill and not even given a squad number. One of new manager Owen Coyle's first actions in regards his first-team squad was to give O'Connor a first team squad number for the remainder of the 2007‚Äì08 season. Nevertheless, O'Connor was released at the end of the season. On 6 October 2008, O'Connor signed for League Two side Luton Town after a three-week trial. Luton boss Mick Harford had been impressed by O'Connor's performances in reserve games, scoring three goals in two games. Rather unfortunately, Garreth never made the impact at Kenilworth Road that had been hoped for, and after just 7 appearances for Luton Town (3 coming in the League), he was released by manager Mick Harford as the January 2008 transfer window opened. With money tight, Harford released both Garreth and fellow midfielder Kevin Watson from their deals, thus freeing up money to bring in some new faces. On the eve of the 2009 season, O'Connor returned to Dublin and signed for St. Patrick's Athletic after non fruitful trials with Bohemians and Dundalk. Garreth scored a memorable goal in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Steaua Bucure»ôti in the Europa League play-off during St Pats 2009 European campaign. Agreed a contract with Drogheda along with Glen Fitzpatrick in January 2010.

One of the models suggested in the book is based on an analogy with the reliability theory. The underlying hypothesis is based on the (previously suggested) premise that humans are born in a highly defective state. This is then made worse by environmental and mutational damage; exceptionally high redundancy due to the extremely high number of low-reliable components (e.g.., cells) allows the organism to survive for a while. The theory suggests an explanation of two aging phenomena for higher organisms: the Gompertz law of exponential increase in mortality rates with age and the \\"late-life mortality plateau\\" (mortality deceleration compared to the Gompertz law at higher ages).Gavrilov, Gavrilova (2001).

Essentially, it was the remainder of the Jam√©sie Territory's land after all of the major population centres were removed. On July 24, 2012, the Quebec government signed an accord with the Cree that would result in the abolition of Baie-James and the creation of a regional government known as Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory. The hydroelectric power plants of the La Grande Complex were all located within the municipal boundaries of Baie-James, making the municipality strategically important to Quebec's energy policy. Other important economic sectors are mining, softwood logging, forestry, and tourism. History The municipality was created in 1971 and was run by the board of directors of the Soci√©t√© de d√©veloppement de la Baie James. It managed the territory of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement between the 49th and 55th parallel, with the exception of the Cree Category 1 lands and the enclaves of Chapais, Chibougamau, Lebel-sur-Qu√©villon and Matagami. In December 2001, the municipal council was reformed. It became a municipality of a special type directed by the mayors of the four enclave towns, as well as the chairpersons of the local community councils of Radisson, Valcanton and Villebois. An eighth seat is reserved for a representative coming from the non-urban territory. The municipality gained additional authority and can exert certain powers as a regional county. Under the terms of the Agreement on Governance in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory of July 24, 2012, the municipality ceased to exist and was replaced by a new regional government called Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory.

Dynamic asset allocation includes CPPI, which consists of a guarantee, notionally related to a zero-coupon bond and an underlying investment. Assets are dynamically shifted (or allocated) between these two components depending largely on the performance of the underlying investments. In some cases, certain products can use a borrowing facility to enhance exposure if the underlying investments experience strong returns. If the underlying investments decline in value, CPPI automatically deleverages, reducing exposure in falling markets.

He is associated with the matterism of the European informal art movement and described his style as a polymaterialist. He had connections with Lucio Fontana's spatialism and, with Antoni T√†pies, an influence on the revival of the art of post-war assembly in America (Robert Rauschenberg) as in Europe. Biography In the ‚ÄúOverrated and Underrated‚Äù column published by the American art magazine ARTnews, Alberto Burri‚Äôs name is often mentioned. Carolyn-Christov-Bakargiev made a mention about him, in the January 2005 issue for example. 1915‚Äì1940: Early years Alberto Burri was born on 12 March 1915 born to Pietro Burri, a tuscan wine merchant and Carolina Torreggiani, an umbrian elementary school teacher. Between 1934 and 1939, he attended at the University of Perugia, after graduating from the Annibale Mariotti high school, he enrolled in the faculty of medicine at the University of the same city, graduating on 12 June 1940 with a doctor degree, and was a military doctor for four years in World War II. He claimed he studied art history, because he wanted to be able to understand the works of art that surrounded him. He also studied Greek, a language in which he became proficient and later in life was able to read and enjoy Classical Greek literature. While studying medicine, he specialized in tropical medicine and decided to work in Africa. With an precocious voluntary experience in the Italo-Ethiopian War, Burri was then recalled to military service on 12 October 1940, two days after Italy's entrance into World War II, and sent to Libya as a combat medic. On 8 May 1943 the unit he was part of was captured by the British in Tunisia and was later turned over to the Americans and transferred to Hereford, Texas in a prisoner-of-war camp housing around 3000 Italian officers. After his unit was captured in North Africa, he was interned in 1944 in a prison camp in Hereford, Texas, where he began painting. After his liberation in 1946, he moved to Rome and devoted himself exclusively to painting; his first solo exhibition took place at the La Margherita Gallery in 1947. He then exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery in New York and at the Gallery de France in Paris. Prevented from practicing his medical profession, Burri had the opportunity of choosing a leisure activity thanks to the YMCA Association. Using the limited amount of materials available in the camp he took on the activity of painting, at the age of almost 30 and without any kind of academic reference.Barzini, Luigi, \\"Rome: Where Art is Forever Italy\\", The New York Times (22 December 1969). p.40Zorzi, Stefano (2016). Parola di Burri. Milan: Electa. p. 15 Meanwhile, the tragic death of his younger brother Vittorio on the Russian front in 1943 had a strong impact on him.Zorzi, Stefano (2016). Parola di Burri. Milan: Electa. pp. 19‚Äì20 Shutting himself off from the rest of the world, and depicting figurative subjects on thick chromatic marks, he progressively realized the desire of abandoning the medical profession, in favor of painting. Paintings=From abstraction to matter Once Burri returned to Italy on 27 February 1946, his decision collided with the severe post‚ÄìWorld War II recession and his parents' dissatisfaction. He moved to Rome as a guest of the violinist and composer Annibale Bucchi, his mother's cousin, who encouraged his activity as a painter.Carandente, Giovanni (2007). \\"Burri: memories of a friendship, 1948‚Äì1988\\". In Palumbo, Piero (2007). Burri, Una Vita. Milan: Electa. p. 176 While in Rome, he had the chance of establishing a contact with the few but very active institutions dedicated to painting, which were creating a new platform for visual arts after the war.Iori, Aldo (2016). \\"Rome 1947‚Äì1958: From Europe to America and Back\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (2016). Burri: Lo Spazio di Materia tra Europa e USA. Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri, Citt√† di Castello. pp.36‚Äì49. He remained a reserved artist, ceaselessly working and creating, initially in a small studio in Via Margutta but frequently moving out. As a matter of fact, Milton Gendel ‚Äì an American journalist who visited Burri's studio in 1954 ‚Äì, later reported: \\"The studio is thick-walled, whitewashed, neat and ascetic; his work is 'blood and flesh,‚Äô reddened torn fabric that seems to parallel the staunching of wounds that Burri experienced in wartime.‚ÄùGendel, Milton (1954). \\"‚ÄòI Will Not Be a Sunday Painter‚Äô: Alberto Burri Makes a Picture, in 1954\\". Art News, December 1954. Burri‚Äôs first solo figurative artworks exhibition took place on 10 July 1947 at the gallery-cum- bookshop La Margherita, in Rome, presented by the poets Leonardo Sinisgalli and Libero De Libero. However, Burri‚Äôs artistic production flowed definitively into abstract forms before the end of the same year, the use of small format tempera resulting from the influence of such artists as Jean Dubuffet and Joan Mir√≥, whose studio was visited by Burri during a trip to Paris in the winter of 1948.Serafini, Giuliano (2015). Burri: matter first. Milan: Giunti. p. 37 = Tars, Molds, Hunchbacks = Burri's artistic research became personal in short time, between 1948 and 1950 he began experimenting with using unusual, 'unorthodox' materials such as tar, sand, zinc, pumice, and Aluminium dust as well as Polyvinyl chloride glue, this last material being elevated to the same importance as oil colors. During this artistic transition, the painter showed his sensitivity to the mixed-media type of abstraction of Enrico Prampolini, a central figure in Italian Abstract art. Nonetheless Burri went one step further in his Catrami (Tars), presenting tar not as a simple collage material, but as an actual color which ‚Äì by way of different lucid and opaque shades in monochrome black‚Äì, blended itself with the totality of the painting.Brandi, Cesare (1963). Burri. Rome: Editalia. p.22: ‚ÄúBurri did not begins with collage: the first pictures of '48 are all paintings. But in the earliest of them, the first Nero (Black) one, with a little blue square (and round and oval elements), the passage from shiny to opaque black acts not as a color but as material, like the right and wrong sides of a piece of satin.‚ÄùSerafini, Giuliano (2015). Burri: matter first. Milan: Giunti. pp. 42‚Äì43: ‚ÄúBurri intuition was decisive. For centuries, art history has posited a kind of duality in which matter served as artist‚Äôs tool, as the factor that, to become form, must necessarily be subjected to an operation of sublimation.‚ÄùCor√†, Bruno (2015). \\"Burri, the First One Hundred Years of Greatness\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (2015). Alberto Burri General Catalogue Vol. I Painting 1945‚Äì1957. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.32: ‚ÄúBurri‚Äôs painting did not aim to substitute reality with the reality of the material, at the contrary, aimed to turn the material into a pure form.‚Äù His 1948 \\"Nero 1\\" (Black 1) was later taken by the artist as initial milestone of his painting and established the prevalence of the black monochrome, which will be maintained as close identity throughout his career, alongside white, since Bianchi (Whites) 1949‚Äì50 series, and red. The following series of Muffe (Molds) literally presented the spontaneous reactions of the materials employed, enabling matter to 'come to life' in drippings and concretions which reproduced the effects and appearance of real mold. In some artworks of the same period which he called Gobbi (Hunchbacks), Burri focused on the painting‚Äôs spatial interaction, achieving another original outcome due to the incorporation of tree branches on the rear of the canvas which pushed two-dimensionality towards Three-dimensional space.Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \\"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. Burri Retrospektive, 1915‚Äì1995. Milan: Electa. Exhibition catalogue. pp. 81‚Äì83 In 1949 the critic Christian Zervos published the photo of a Catrame (exhibited in Paris the previous year) in the renowned Cahiers d'art. Despite Burri‚Äôs affinity with informalism and his friendship with Ettore Colla, which brought Alberto close to the Gruppo Origine (established and disbanded in 1951 by Colla himself, Mario Balocco and Giuseppe Capogrossi), the painter‚Äôs artistic research appeared more and more solitary and independent.Carandente, Giovanni (2007). \\"Burri: memories of a friendship, 1948‚Äì1988\\". In Palumbo, Piero (2007). Burri, Una Vita. Milan: Electa. p. 177  Sacchi and the American emergence  Starting in 1952 Burri achieved a strong, personal characterization with the Sacchi (Sacks), artworks directly obtained from jute fabric widely distributed by the Marshall Plan: color almost entirely disappeared, leaving space for the surface material so that painting coincide with its matter in its total autonomy, as it was no more separation between painting surface and its form.Serafini, Giuliano (2015). Burri matter first. Milan: Giunti. p.44: \\"Canvas, in the humble version of jute, the favorite support in every epoch, was no longer merely the material in which to paint, but the painting itself, the work. In a word, matter became the subject.\\" The formal artistic elegance and the spatial balances obtained through aeroform steams, craters, rips, overlapping color layers and different forms, differentiated Burri‚Äôs art, founded on attentive reflections and precise calculations, from the impulsive gestures that characterized Action painting during the same period.Tomassoni, Italo (2016). \\"Burri, de Kooning, Pollock: Parallel Convergences\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (ed.) Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.50. Burri offered an initial view of these peculiar elements in 1949, with SZ1 (acronym for Sacco di Zucchero 1 meaning Sack of Sugar, 1): the presence of a portion of the american flag contained in the artwork anticipated the use of the same subject made by pop art. In Burri‚Äôs case, however, there were no social or symbolic implications, the painting‚Äôs formal and chromatic balance being the only real focus.Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \\"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. Burri Retrospektive, 1915‚Äì1995. Milan: Electa. Exhibition catalogue. p.83 = Censorship and success = Burri‚Äôs Sacchi did not win the public‚Äôs understanding and were instead considered as extremely far from the notion of art. In 1952, year of his first participation at the Venice Biennale exhibition, the Sacks titled Lo Strappo (The Rip) and Rattoppo (Patch) were rejected.Sarteanesi, Chiara (2016). \\"The Seasons of Burri\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (ed.) Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA. Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. Citt√† di Castello. p.29: \\"The rules [of black and whites section of Biennale] stated that the works had to be done purely in pencil or lead point. Burri replaced the two paintings with the relative \\"Studio per lo Strappo\\" and \\"Disegno per Rattoppo\\", one of the rare case in which the artwork precedes the study, produced at a later date. \\"Studio per Lo Strappo\\" was purchased by Lucio Fontana, the only major recognition received by the Umbrian master on this occasion.\\" Again, in 1959 a point of order of the Italian Parliament asked for the removal of one of the painter‚Äôs works from the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. Burri‚Äôs work received a different and positive consideration in 1953, when James Johnson Sweeney (director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) discovered Burri‚Äôs paintings at the Obelisco Gallery in Rome, and subsequently introduced the artist‚Äôs work to the United States, in a collective exhibition representative of the new European artistic tendencies.Fontanella, Megan (2015).\\"Begun Behind Barbed Wire: Alberto Burri‚Äôs Early Career in America\\". In Braun, Emily. Alberto Burri: The Trauma of Painting. New York: Gugghenheim Museum Publications. pp.92‚Äì112. This encounter subsequently led to a life-long friendship with Sweeney becoming an active a proponent of Burri‚Äôs art in leading American Museums and writing the very first monogrph about the artist in 1955. During the same year Robert Rauschenberg visited the painter‚Äôs studio two times: despite the linguistic differences between the two artists prevented them to talking to each other, Rauschenberg‚Äôs visits provided substantial input for the creation of his Combine Paintings.Celant, Germano (1994). \\"Burri vs Rauschenberg\\". In Celant (Germano), & Costantini (Anna). Rome New York 1948‚Äì1964 : an Art Exploration. The Murray and Isabella Rayburn Foundation, New York, 5 Nov ‚Äì 10 January. Exhibition catalog. Milan: Charta. p. 22. Serafini, Giuliano (2015). p. 27: \\"His objective, from the very first hour was always and only to perform a healing act. The humblest material which Rauschenberg was to use in the combine paintings as a social signal, in an explicitly 'new Dada' function, and Arte Povera in an intellectually 'poverty- stricken' manner ‚Äì was 'redeemed' by Burri through aesthetic means, becoming instrumental to the attainment of a inevitable, entirely necessary goal of beauty.\\"Diacono, Mario (2016). \\"Burri and/or America: the Ground Zero of painting\\", in Cor√†, Bruno (ed.) Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.50. Burri's strong relationship with the United States became official when he met Minsa Craig (1928‚Äì2003), an American ballet dancer (student of Martha Graham) and choreographer whom he married on 15 May 1955 in Westport, Connecticut. They stuck together through thick and thin, for the rest of their lives.Carandente, Giovanni (2007). \\"Burri: memories of a friendship, 1948‚Äì1988\\". In Palumbo, Piero (2007). Burri, Una Vita. Milan: Electa. p. 179  Adoption of fire  After a few sporadic attempts, in 1953‚Äì54 Burri conducted a carefully planned experimentation with fire, through small combustions on paper, which served as illustrations for a book of poems by Emilio Villa.Villa, Emilio, ed. Crespi, Stefano (1996). Pittura dell‚Äôultimo giorno, Scritti per Alberto Burri. Firenze: Le Lettere. The poet was one of the first to understand the painter's revolutionary artistic potential, writing about it since 1951 and working with him to artist's books.Cor√†, Bruno, & Sicoli, Tonino (2015). Alberto Burri e i poeti. Materia e suono della parola. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. Exhibition catalogue. He later recalled a common visit to an oil field (for a 1955 reportage for the magazine \\"Civilt√† delle Macchine\\") as a strong influence for the artist's interest on the use of fire.Nordland, Gerald (1986). Burri 18 paintings 1953‚Äì1986. New York: Di Laurenti Gallery. Exhibition catalogue. p. 7 = Combustions, Woods, Irons, Plastics = The procedure adopted for the Combustioni (Combustions) passed from paper to the Legni (Woods) around 1957, in thin sheets of wood veneer fastened to canvas and other supports.Nordland, Gerald (1977). Alberto Burri A retrospective view 1948‚Äì1977. Los Angeles: Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery Editions. Exhibition catalogue. p. 46: It must be noted that the Englishman Gwyther Irwin, came to adopt the legno procedure in 1961, and that the colorful French artist, Yves Klein also made his first fire paintings with a flame-thrower in the year 1961. In the same period Burri was also working on the Ferri (Irons), creations made out of metal sheets cut, and welded by Blow torch, to aim the general balance of the elements. The best known application of this procedure was reached in the Plastiche (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri's art showed up in Italy as well. The blowtorch was only apparently a destructive device. Indeed, the craters modeled by the flame on cellophane, black, red or transparent plastic or on the Bianchi Plastica (White Plastic) series, in which the transparent plastic is laid on a white or black support, were lightly directed by the painter's blowing. The balances of the matter were thus highlighted once again, in a sort of 'defiance' towards of flame's randomness on the one hand, and in a sort of attempt to 'dominate chance', intrinsic to Burri's philosophy, on the other.Pirovano, Carlo (1996). \\"The Seasons of Fire\\". In Burri: 1915‚Äì1995 Retrospektiv. Rome: Electa. Exhibition Catalogue. pp. 114‚Äì115  From Cretto to Cellotex  From 1963 on, Burri and his wife started spending their winters in Los Angeles. The painter progressively detached himself from the city's artistic community, deeply focusing on his own work.Melandri, Luisa (2010). \\"Resident outsider\\". In Melandri, Luisa, with Duncan, Michael. Combustione, Alberto Burri and America. Los Angeles: Santa Monica Museum of Art. Exhibition catalogue. p. 22 During his recurrent trips to Death Valley National Park, the artist found in the natural cracking of the desert the visual spur which led him, starting from 1973, to create Cretti (Cracks) developing the use of the crackled paint effect of his 1940's artworks.Melandri, Luisa (2010). Ibidem. p. 23: \\"The noun 'cretto' ‚Äì from the verb crettare in rare old Tuscan Italian ‚Äì refers to small cracks that appear in plaster walls. The wod was originally most often used to describe the cracks that might appear in the 'intonaco' of a fresco. The term is therefore not only descriptive but links Burri‚Äôs works to the mural traditions of his native Italy ‚Äì and to Renaissance art-making.\\" Employing a special mixture of kaolin, resins and pigment, the painter dried its surface with the heat of an oven. Burri arrested the heating process at the desired moment using a PVA glue layer, thus obtaining greater and lesser cracking effects, which were always balanced thanks to the painter's extensive knowledge of chemistry.Tomassoni, Italo (2015): \\"Alberto Burri: His Cretti (Cracks) and Their Roots in the History of Art\\". In Alberto Burri General Catalogue Vol. II Painting 1958‚Äì1978. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.22: \\"Cretti therefore mark the start of the move away from the contemplative idea of the surface in favour of the structural, perceptive and dynamic blend of subterranean and potentially unlimited energies, which claime the need for design and limit. With all the naturalness of physiological processes, the dynamic and self-referential proliferation of the tesserae pushes towards the natural geometry of a halting station marked by the time of its 'duration‚Äô\\". = Grande Cretto at Gibellina = Burri reproduced the procedure used for the Cretti, either black or white, also in sculpture, on large extensions in the University of California, Los Angeles and Naples (Museo di Capodimonte) Grandi Cretti (Large Cracks) made of baked clay (both 49 x 16) and, most importantly, in the vast cement covering of the Grande Cretto at Gibellina, upon the ruins of the old small Sicilian town destroyed by the 1968 earthquake.Cor√†, Bruno (2016). Burri e I Cretti. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. exhibition catalogue. pp. 13‚Äì17. Began in 1984 and interrupted in 1989, the work was completed in 2015, for the artist's centenary of birth. It is one of the largest works of art ever realized, extending over an area of approximately 85,000 square meters. Its white concrete covering expands over the town, following the old street map in long arterial roads and corridors, which are walkable, thus symbolically bringing the devastated town back to life. = Cellotex and the large cycles of paintings = During the Seventies Burri's art saw a gradual transition towards wider dimensions, while retrospectives followed one another around the world. The great solo exhibition crossing the United States in 1977‚Äì78 and ending at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York is one example. In the 1979 cycle of paintings called Il Viaggio (The Journey) Burri retraced, through ten monumental compositions, the key moments of his artistic production.The artist polemically excluded the Sacchi, which many critics were considering his major works, to emancipate his production from the ‚Äòlazy crystallization of his expressive message‚Äô (Pirovano, Carlo. 2015. \\"Burri, the Investigation of Space\\". In Cor√†, Bruno. Alberto Burri General Catalogue. Volume IV. Tempera, Drawing, Architecture, Sculpture, Theatre, Set Design 1946‚Äì1994. p.13). The privileged material during this phase is Celotex (the author added an l to its name), an industrial mixture of wood production scraps and adhesives, very often used in the making of insulating boards. Up to then, the painter had used this material in his previous works since the early 1950s as a support for his acetate and acrylic works.Butterfield, Jan (1982). \\"Alberto Burri: Umbrian Echoes and Alchemical Implications\\". In Alberto Burri. Palm Spring Desert Museum. Exhibition catalogue. After that Cellotex was used for cyclical series conceived as polyptych on a dominant and clear geometrical structure, through extremely thin scratched shades or juxtapositions of smooth and rough portions like Orsanmichele (1981), or in black monochromes variations like Annottarsi (Up to Nite, 1985), as well as in multicolored forms like Sestante (Sextant, 1983) or the homage to the gold of Ravenna mosaics in his last Nero e Oro (Black and Gold) series.Sarteanesi, Nemo (1980). Il Viaggio. Milan: Electa: \\"The division of the Cellotex‚Äôs geometric purity, from which the shape of the 'quadrant' emerges in pure gold ‚Äì found a perfect contrast immediately after the tempera.. Their corresponding sensations of equilibrium remind us of the fascination o the ancient aesthetic speculations on the golden section\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (2015). Alberto Burri. General Catalogue, Volume III. Painting 1979‚Äì1994 (texts by Bruno Cor√†, Carlo Bertelli). Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.20.  Sculpture and set design  Burri's entire artistic production was conceived by the author as an inseparable whole of form and space, both in painting and in sculpture. An example is the recurrent motif of the archivolt, viewed in its plain form in painting and in perspective in such iron sculptures as Teatro Scultura ‚Äì a work presented at 1984 Venice Biennale ‚Äì, and in the 1972 Ogive series in ceramics.Duranti, Massimo (2011).\\"From form to matter, to abstract form: the development of Alberto Burri‚Äôs aesthetic devolution\\". In Duranti, Massimo, Alberto Burri form and matter. Perugia: Fabbri. p. 16 The strong continuity of Burri's sculptural works with his paintings can also be seen in the Los Angeles UCLA and Naples Capodimonte ceramic Grandi Cretti (with the help of the long collaborator ceramist Massimo Baldelli), or in the Grande Ferro (Large Iron) exhibited in Perugia on the occasion of the 1980 meeting between the artist and Joseph Beuys.Richter, Petra (2016). \\"Alberto Burri on the German Scene from 1950s to the 1970s\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (2016). Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. pp. 116‚Äì117. The Large Cretto at Gibellina doesn't properly fall under the category of land art, but it has features combining architecture, sculpture and space. Other sculptures on iron are permanently held in Citt√† di Castello museums, Ravenna, Celle (Pistoia), Perugia and Milan, where the rotating wings of the Teatro Continuo (Continuous Theatre) is both real scenic space and sculpture, employing the Sforza Castle park as natural backcloth.The work was built on the occasion of the 1973 Milan Triennale, then demolished in 1989 by the municipality. It was reconstructed in 2015 for the artist centenary of birth (with the support of NCTM law firm) and donated to the Comune of Milano and the Triennale Foundation. Scardi, Gabi (2015). Il Teatro Continuo di Alberto Burri. Mantova: Corraini. Italian/English.  Theatre sets  Theater had a privileged role in Burri's artistic production. Though in isolated interventions, the painter worked in the fields of prose, ballet and opera. In 1963 Burri designed the sets for Spirituals, Morton Gould's ballet at La Scala, in Milan. The painter's Plastiche emphasized the dramatic force of such plays as the 1969 Ignazio Silone stage adaptation in San Miniato (Pisa) and Tristan and Iseult, performed in 1975 at the Teatro Regio in Turin. In 1973 Burri designed sets and costumes for November Steps, conceived by his wife Minsa Craig, with a score by Toru Takemitsu. The ballet was interacting with an early example of visual art by a film clip depicting how the Cretti progressively came into being.  Graphic work  Burri never considered graphic art of secondary importance to painting. He participated intensively in the experimentation of new printing techniques as the 1965 reproduction of the Combustioni ‚Äì in which the brothers Valter and Eleonora Rossi perfectly succeeded in mimicking the effect of burning on paper ‚Äì, or the irregular Cretti cavities (1971) with the same printers. Further innovative developments can be found in the silk screens Sestante (1987‚Äì89) ‚Äì with the help of Burri's old friend and collaborator Nuvolo ‚Äì to the Mixoblack series (1988), created in Los Angeles with printers Luis and Lea Remba on marble dust and sand in particular three-dimensional effects.Sarteanesi, Chiara (2015). \\"Tradition and Innovation in Alberto Burri‚Äôs Graphic Art\\". In Cor√†, Bruno (ed.). Alberto Burri. General Catalogue. Volume V. Graphic Works 1949‚Äì1994. Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. pp. 12‚Äì21. A telling fact is that Burri used the money from the Feltrinelli Prize for graphics ‚Äì awarded to him in 1973 by the Accademia dei Lincei ‚Äì to promote and support the restoration of Luca Signorelli's frescos in the small oratory of San Crescentino, only few kilometers far from Burri's country house in Citt√† di Castello; a further example of how modern and contemporary are mentally close in Burri's art.Sarteanesi, Chiara (2016). \\"Burri e Signorelli: un omaggio\\". In Iori, Aldo, & Cecchetti, Catia (2016). Burri e Signorelli. Citt√† di Castello: Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri editore. pp. 23‚Äì27.  Legacy  Alberto Burri died childless on 13 February 1995 in Nice, in the French Riviera, where he had moved for the ease of living and because of a pulmonary emphysema. () Just before his death, the painter was awarded the Legion of Honour and the title Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, besides being named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His graphic series Oro e Nero (Gold and Black), was donated by the artist among others at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence 1994, by which time he was already beginning to be considered more of a 'classical' than a 'contemporary' artist.Cor√†, Bruno (2015). \\"Burri and the Cellotex Works: a Common Denominator in Material Painting\\". In Alberto Burri General Catalogue. Vol. III Painting 1979‚Äì1994 Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p. 21: \\"Burri inherited and cultivated ‚Äì perhaps not by accident, but due to physically belonging to a place, an area, an architetctural and artistic culture, a landscape and permanent stratification ‚Äì a tendency towards regenerating the bond, as unpronounceable as it is original and primordial, between power and beauty, which he often claimed to be incapable of speaking of, but which, in the final analysis, emanates from all his art.\\" Alberto Burri's art captured the interest of many contemporary artist colleagues, from Lucio Fontana and Giorgio Morandi to Jannis Kounellis, Michelangelo Pistoletto and Anselm Kiefer, who recognized Burri's greatness ‚Äì and, in some cases, influence ‚Äì time and time again.McEvilley, Thomas (1986). \\"Mute Prophecies: The Art of Jannis Kounellis\\".

Foundation and the museums  In accordance with the painter's will, the Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini was established in Citt√† di Castello in 1978, in order to copyright Burri's own work. The first museum collection, inaugurated in 1981, is the one situated inside the Albizzini Renaissance apartment building. The 15th century Patrician house, belonged to the patrons of Raphael's Wedding of the Virgin, was refurbished by the architects Alberto Zanmatti and Tiziano Sarteanesi in accordance with Burri's own plans.Sarteanesi, Nemo (1996). \\"The Fondazione Albizzini Collezione Burri in Citt√† di Castello\\".

Citt√† di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. The second collection is that of the Citt√† di Castello former tobacco drying sheds, an industrial structure gradually abandoned during the 1960s and inaugurated in 1990, expanding over an area of 11,500 square meters. At present, the structure features the totality of large cycles of painting by the artist, monumental sculptures and, from March 2017 on, the painter's entire graphic production. The structure's black exterior and the particular space adaptations represent one last attempt by Burri to create a total work of art, in continuity with the idea of formal and psychological balance he constantly pursued.  Criticism  Alberto Burri is currently recognized as a radical innovator of the second half of the twentieth century, as a precursor of the solutions found by such artistic movements as Arte Povera, Neo-Dada, Nouveau r√©alisme, Postminimalism and process art, leaving open many critical interpretations and methodological interpretations of his work.Jacob, Mary Jane (1986). \\"Annottarsi 2: A reintroduction to the art of Alberto Burri\\". In Alberto Burri Annottarsi (Up to nite). New York: The Murray and Isabella Rayburn Foundation. Exhibition catalogue: \\"His contribution is not limited to the development of Abstract Expressionism, but also is evident in the tradition of collage, assemblage (especially Rauschenberg who visited Burri‚Äôs studio two times in 1953), shaped canvases (for which Burri‚Äôs \\"Gobbi‚Äù, or hunchbacked-formed paintings beginning in 1950 were a forerunner), process art (from his \\"Muffe\\", in which mold changed the work, to his use of fire), monochromatic painting, and abstraction in general. Burri‚Äôs relation to his contemporaries, the French Nouveaux Realists, and to his direct successors in the use of poor materials, the artists of Arte Povera, provide other areas of rich critical research still to come.\\"Pirani, Federica (1996). \\"Notes on the critical vicissitudes of Alberto Burri\\". In Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, & Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. Burri Retrospektiv 1915‚Äì1995. Milan: Electa. pp. 126‚Äì134 In his 1963 monograph, Cesare Brandi highlighted the essentialness of Burri's painting and his rejection of both decorative detail and the historical avant-gardes' (e.g. Futurism) provocations, favoring a new approach through an 'unpainted painting' concept.Brandi 1963, p.26 On the other hand, Enrico Crispolti interpreted Burri's employment of material from an existential point of view ‚Äì as James Johnson Sweeney similarly had in the very first monograph on Burri published in 1955 ‚Äì implying a criticism towards a certain post-war ethical drift. Pierre Restany considered him as a \\"special case\\" in the Minimalism history, having been \\"the monumental outsider and genial precursor at the same time\\".Pirani, Federica (1997). \\"Interview to Pierre Restany\\". In Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, & Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. Burri 1915‚Äì1995 Retrospektive. Milan: Electa. Maurizio Calvesi adopted a psychoanalytic reading during the years, finding \\"ethical values\\" in his art, identifying at the same time the Renaissance origins of Burri's homeland: Piero della Francesca would have inspired in Burri the sense of space and solemnity of the masses which the painter then transferred on the combusted woods or the worn-out sacks.Calvesi, Maurizio (2015), \\"He was a son of Piero\\". In Focus on Burri. Il Giornale dell‚ÄôArte. October 2015. p.7. More recently, Burri's position has been reevaluated thanks to the 2015 major retrospective exhibition Alberto Burri: The Trauma of Painting curated by Emily Braun for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and to the 2016 collective exhibition Burri Lo spazio di Materia tra Europa e USA edited by the current Foundation chairman Bruno Cor√†, which foregrounded the radical change in traditional Western painting and modern collage brought about by Burri, while also focusing on his 'psychological' recovery of classical painting's formal balances alive. Among the many historical readings, Giulio Carlo Argan's judgment (written in the 1960 Venice Biennale catalogue) remains emblematic: \\"For Burri we must speak for an overturned Trompe-l'≈ìil, because it is no more painting to simulate reality, but it is reality to simulate painting.\\"Argan, Giulio Carlo (1960). Alberto Burri in XXX Biennale internazionale d‚Äôarte di Venezia. Venezia: stamperia di Venezia. Republished in \\"Salvezza e caduta dell‚Äôarte moderna\\". Milan: Il Saggiatore. 1964. pp. 259‚Äì263  Exhibitions  Burri's career began in Rome with a first solo exhibition in 1947 at La Margherita bookshop, owned by Irene Brin, where he presented his first abstract works the following year. Brin and her husband, Gaspero del Corso founded the Obelisco Gallery, the first art gallery to open in Postwar Rome, featuring the 1952 solo exhibition Muffe e Neri (Molds and Blacks) and the first Combustions in 1957. The Burri's first exhibition with the Sacchi was presented by the poet Emilio Villa at the Origine Foundation in 1952, in confirmation of his increasingly original production. The Ferri (Irons) were held at Galleria Blu in Milan. From 1953 on, Burri regularly exhibited his works in the United States, at the Allan Frumkin Gallery (Chicago), the Stable Gallery and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. In the same year, the director and curator of Guggenheim Museum James Johnson Sweeney included Burri in the landmark exhibition Younger European Painters: A Selection bringing his work to focus in the international community. Burri's initially seesawing relationship with the Venice Biennale marked its turning point in 1960, when he was offered his first solo area by Giulio Carlo Argan. In 1962 Cesare Brandi presented the Plastiche at the Marlborough Fine Art in Rome. The first anthological retrospectives were held around this time and in the following decade, as the solo exhibitions at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris (1972), the one in Francis of Assisi Sacred Convent (1975) and the great traveling exhibit which started at the UCLA's Frederick S. Wight Gallery in Los Angeles, moved to the Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute in San Antonio (Texas) and ended in 1978 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. From 1979 on, the Large Cycles of paintings on Cellotex dominated Burri's entire subsequent production, which was conceived for big spaces such as cathedrals (like the 1981 Cycle in Florence titled Gli Orti) or former industrial complexes, like the Giudecca Isle's ex-boatyards in Venice, where he exhibited the chromatic series Sestante. In 1994, Burri presented the cycle titled Burri The Athens Polyptych. Architecture with Cactus for the exhibit curated by Giuliano Serfafini at the National Gallery (Athens), and then at the Italian Institute of Culture in Madrid (1995). The 1996 posthumous anthological exhibition at Palazzo delle Esposizioni (Rome) was successfully repeated at Lenbachhaus (Munich) and at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels. In 2015‚Äì16 the major retrospective exhibition The Trauma of Painting organized by Emily Braun at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (later at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf in 2016) received much international attention to the painter's art. At the conclusion of the centenary of Alberto Burri's birth, the exhibition titled Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA curated by Bruno Cor√† established a comparison between the epigones of 20th century material art. The exhibit was held in Citt√† di Castello, in the exhibition space of the former tobacco drying sheds which, since 2017, house the painter's graphic collection.\\"The artworks of post-war artist Alberto Burri celebrated in his native town of Citt√† di Castello after exhibitions in New York and Dusseldorf\\".

Composer Salvatore Sciarrino wrote an homage to commemorate the painter's passing in 1995, commissioned by Citt√† di Castello's Festival delle Nazioni. For the same festival the former tobacco drying sheds became the setting of a composition by Alvin Curran in 2002.Alvin Curran official website The Large Cretto at Gibellina has functioned several times as a set for the Orestiadi Festival and as set for a 2015 performance by artists Giancarlo Neri and Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack). The 1973 ballet November Steps, with Burri's sets and costumes, was proposed again in 2015 by the Guggenheim Museum, New York. In 2016 choreographer Virgilio Sieni created the work Quintetti sul Nero,Virgilio Sieni official website \\"Quintetti sul nero\\" inspired by the Umbrian master. In 2017 John Densmore (The Doors) performed in front of the Grande Nero Cretto (Large Black Crack) at ucla, Los Angeles during the event Burri Prometheia. Throughout the years, fashion designers have drawn inspiration from Burri, from Roberto Capucci, with his 1969 item of clothing Omaggio a Burri which has asymmetric features recreating the Cretti effects, up to Laura Biagiotti for her (last) 2017 collection. In 1987 Burri created the official 1990 FIFA World Cup posters. The Umbria Jazz Festival used the Sestante series for the 2015 edition poster, celebrating the artist's centenary of birth.

Construction did not begin until February 1855 because of financial and right of way issues, and its first train operated on February 22, 1856. Although the oldest working railroad in the state was the Arcata and Mad River Railroad, first operational in December 15, 1854, the Sacramento Valley Railroad was the West's pioneering incorporated railroad, forerunner to the Central Pacific. Original SVRR route From Report of the Chief Engineer Theodore Judah: Preliminary Surveys and Future Business of the Sacramento Valley Railroad (Sacramento, Democratic State Journal, 1854). Cross and longitudinal views of a section of the original Welsh iron \\"pear\\" rail used to lay the SVRR in 1856 On August 4, 1852, the Sacramento Valley Railroad was incorporated in California, and Charles Lincoln Wilson became its first president. He left for New York to find expertise and private funds for the railroad effort; he recruited a young survey engineer Theodore D. Judah from New York to come west with him to Sacramento. Judah arrived in mid-May 1854, and on May 30 his report and preliminary survey for the proposed SVRR line eastward from Sacramento to Marysville by way of Folsom were in the hands of his employers. Because of financial and right of way issues, construction with grading subcontractors did not begin until February 1855, but soon other problems arose. In August 1855, the SVRR board elected Commodore C. K. Garrison, former mayor (1853-1854) of San Francisco, as president of SVRR. They also elected as vice president of SVRR the future American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was at that time the head of the banking house of Lucas & Turner in San Francisco. William Sherman, contacted his brother John, who had recently been elected to Congress, for help in obtaining federal land grants for the railroad, but to no avail. The board also in August 1855 announced that the actual laying of tracks can begin. The railroad's gauge was , ( wider than ) and was laid with Welsh iron \\"pear\\" rail. Mastering the technique, the track laying crew were putting down six hundred feet of track daily. The original plans for a line from Sacramento to Folsom and then to Marysville were not fully realized as the funding did not materialize. As constructed, the Sacramento Valley Railroad ran from the Sacramento River levee at Front and \\"L\\" Street in present-day Old Sacramento and terminated at Folsom. On February 22, 1856, the first train operated over the entire line. Theodore Judah was the Chief Engineer of the Sacramento Valley Railroad. Judah would later become the Chief Engineer of the Central Pacific Railroad and the chief proponent of the first transcontinental railroad over the Sierra Nevada by way of Dutch Flat. On April 19, 1877, the Sacramento Valley Railroad was consolidated with the Folsom and Placerville Railroad to form the Sacramento and Placerville Railroad. In 1877 the Placerville and Sacramento Valley Railroad was also deeded to the Sacramento and Placerville Railroad. The new railroad operated over of track between Sacramento and Shingle Springs. The railroad eventually came under the control of the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP); first under SP's subsidiary, the Northern Railway in 1888, and then ten years later under the SP on April 14, 1898. The route as it exists now Today much of the original route still exists and was the former Placerville Branch of the Southern Pacific. Today it is used by Union Pacific Railroad and extends to the Aerojet facility just west of Folsom. The Sacramento RT Light Rail Gold Line parallels the route and uses the right of way between Sacramento and Folsom. Most of SVRR's planned route was built by subsequent railroad companies after 1869. A notable historic section is still in operation today as Niles Canyon Railway that linked Sacramento to the San Francisco Bay Area through Niles, California.

In 1963, Troutman's Emporium moved to a space in Pony Village Shopping Center, an enclosed shopping mall. Troutman's Emporium started growing when the company opened a second store at the Willamette Plaza in Eugene, Oregon, in 1968. A third store was built in 1972 in Mount Vernon, Washington. Expansion An Emporium store in Gresham, Oregon, in 1989 In 1973, Troutman's Emporium acquired two Alexander's stores in Springfield and Florence, Oregon.

The Oregonian, p. E6. working stock and sweeping floors. The company's headquarters was moved to the Springfield store after its acquisition, but when it was damaged by fire in 1977, the headquarters was relocated to Eugene, where Emporium also opened a new distribution center. The next several years were a period of major expansion, and by 1983, Emporium was a 13-store chain. The company's gross sales in 1984 exceeded $50 million, and as of 1985 the company had about 1,000 employees.Cour, Brian (March 10, 1985). \\"Chain founder traces Emporium growth\\". The Oregonian, p. D10. Founder Dallas Troutman was still company president. Around 325,000 customers held Emporium charge accounts at that time. By this time, at least, the stores were all identified simply as Emporium, and the company name was alternatively given as Emporium Inc. or Troutman's Emporium. The average store size was 30,000‚Äì40,000 square feet (2,800‚Äì3,700 m2) at that time, following early 1980s remodeling of some stores. In 1986, Emporium acquired the then-40-year-old, eight-store Quisenberry's chain, which had five stores in Eastern Oregon and three in Idaho.\\"E. Oregon chain bought by Emporium\\". (February 1, 1986). The Oregonian, p. C2. Over the next two years Troutman's Emporium opened 5 stores, including a store in Chico, California. In 1988, Emporium acquired a J.C. Penney store in Nampa, Idaho, at the Karcher Mall. The Chico store opened at Chico Mall in 1988, and was the only Emporium in California. That store was called \\"Troutman's\\", due to a trademark dispute with Emporium in California (Emporium-Capwell at the time of the Troutman's store's opening). In 1999, Emporium was in merger talks with Lamonts, but it fell through.\\"Lamonts ends merger talks with owner of Emporiums\\". (July 6, 1999). The Seattle Times, p. C6. In 2000, Ron Schiff was hired as the new president and CEO of Troutman's Emporium.

Bankruptcy and liquidation A former Emporium in Ontario, Oregon, in 2006 In 2002, faced with increasing debt with creditors, Troutman's Emporium filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Kosseff, Jeffrey (December 17, 2002). \\"Emporium files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\\". The Oregonian, p. 1. The company initially planned on closing one store but instead found themselves with far more debt than expected. Unable to secure financing or investment partners while in bankruptcy, Emporium announced it would be closing all of its stores and was formally going out of business. The last stores were closed in 2003. The company's remaining assets were liquidated, and it completed the remainder of its bankruptcy proceedings in 2004. When the closure was announced, the company had been operating 34 stores across five western U.S. states employing 1,600 people.

Overview An early member of the Whyos, McGloin would rise to become leader of the gang by the late 1870s, in his late teens. Continuing the ruthless tactics of his predecessors \\"Dandy\\" Jim Dolan, Piker Ryan and others of the previous decade, McGloin terrorized New York's Westside, particularly Hell's Kitchen throughout the late 1870s. On the night of December 29, 1881, four members of the Whyos (presumably including McGloin) entered a local Hell's Kitchen tavern owned by Louis Hanier. As one of the men asked to change a $10 bill, another man suddenly became ill and tried to get behind the bar. Asking the men to leave, there was no further incident until around midnight when Hanier closed the bar and went upstairs to bed. Sometime around 2:00 am, Hanier's wife reported hearing noises coming from downstairs. When Hanier attempted to investigate, he was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman. Led by NYPD police superintendent Inspector Thomas F. Byrnes, police investigation was able to trace the murder weapon, a .38 caliber pistol, to a pawn shop on Ninth Avenue, which had previously been owned by McGloin. However attempts to gain further evidence against him, including assigning a woman to live with the 19-year-old gang leader in the hopes of gaining a confession, proved fruitless as further attempts proved inconclusive. Byrnes, accompanied by Captain Williams and six other officers, raided the Whyos headquarters, arresting gang members Thomas Moran, Frederick Banfield and Robert Morrissey on January 31, 1882. McGloin, convinced that the other members would testify against him, admitted to breaking into the tavern and killing Hanier, however, he claimed self-defense, believing Hanier was armed. On March 1, McGloin was tried alongside Moran and Morrissey and, after eleven minutes of discussion among the jury, McGloin was convicted by the General Sessions of first degree murder and sentenced to death while Moran and Morrissey received eight years imprisonment for burglary. Despite being granted a stay of execution after several pleas for appeal, McGloin was hanged in The Tombs on March 9, 1883.Execution of McGloin, detailed See also * Capital punishment in New York (state) * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in New York General references *Asbury, Herbert.

It is located on the territory of the municipality of Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis. The station is connected to the / station of the Brussels metro system. Naming The Brussels-Capital Region is bilingual; hence, both the French and Dutch names of the station are official. Outside Belgium, this often leads to the use of combined shorthands; for example in the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable, Brussels-South is designated as /; Dutch Railways announce the station as Brussel Zuid/Midi. \\"Le Midi\\" is a reference to Southern France, as trains departing from this station in the 19th century had the region as their final destination. The name , as the Dutch translation of , was only introduced after the equality law of 1898.focusonbelgium.be History=First station (1839‚Äì1869) Bogards' Station (1839), pictured A first station known as Bogards' Station (, ) had existed, since 1839, near Rouppe Square in the southern part of the City of Brussels, so-called for the eponymous convent whose site it was built on, and to which / is nowadays the only reference. The presence of a station at this location also explains the unusual width of the current Avenue of Stalingrad, which goes up from the square to the small ring road and back then used to have train tracks in the middle. Second station (1869‚Äì1949) The Belgian railway network grew rapidly during the second half of the 19th century, and the old station quickly became too small, so the authorities decided to demolish it. A new monumental station built outside the Pentagon and designed by architect Auguste Payen opened in 1869, a short distance south from the original site. In tribute to the railway technology, a statue of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, was placed on the roof of the station. In front of the station, a large square, known as the / (\\"Constitution Square\\"), was created, acting as an entry to the city.

Most of the current buildings were erected between 1939 and 1954, in post-war functionalist style, from plans by architects Adrien and Yvan Blomme and Fernand Petit. Work on the connection also led to the station's immediate surroundings to be reorganised. The tracks were raised and extended unto a viaduct towards the city centre, with shops under it and a covered street, / (formerly /), along which trams run. The rear part of the station, built in front of Victor Horta Square, and designed in 1992 by architect Marc De Vreese, serves as a terminal for high- speed trains.

In the 1990s, the Eurostar terminal was added on Rue de France's side. This part contains two bay platforms with no onward northbound connection. A tripartite agreement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK on 15 May 1993, which permitted British officials to carry out pre-embarkation immigration controls for passengers travelling on direct Eurostar train services from Brussels to London and Belgian officials to carry out pre- embarkation immigration controls at London Waterloo International station for passengers travelling in the other direction. As a result of this agreement, juxtaposed controls were set up in the station. On 1 October 2004, an administrative arrangement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK to extend juxtaposed controls to Eurostar services between London and Brussels which make a stop in Lille. Eurostar passengers travelling to the UK clear exit checks from the Schengen Area (carried out by the Belgian Federal Police) as well as UK entry checks (conducted by the UK Border Force) in the station before boarding their train. On the other hand, Eurostar passengers travelling to Lille Europe or Calais-Fr√©thun remain within the Schengen Area and are therefore not subject to border checks. Accordingly, they go through a different departure area in the station (bypassing the juxtaposed controls for passengers heading to the UK) and travel in a separate designated coach (available in standard class only) controlled by security guards, who ensure that all of these passengers disembark at Lille/Calais before the train continues to the UK.

Mention was made of salt springs in the area appear in the 10th century, and were noted by the ambassador of the Caliphate of Cordoba to the court of Emperor Otto the Great in 973. Along with the surrounding area, the village was under the control of the Archbishopric of Cologne from at least the 12th century; however exploitation of the salt springs was the right of free peasant families in the area. From the 19th century, the brine produced in the area was used for bathing and medicinal purposes, and the first therapy center or spa was opened in 1852. Commercial salt production faced declining yields, and was largely discontinued in 1934, and completely discontinued by 1952.

It may be used when you have multiple estimates of a future event, and you would like to combine these estimates in such a way to get a more accurate and relevant estimate. This is typically used by actuaries working for insurance companies when determining the premium values. For example, in group health insurance an insurer is interested in calculating the risk premium, RP, (i.e. the theoretical expected claims amount) for a particular employer in the coming year. The insurer will likely have an estimate of historic overall claims experience, x, as well as a more specific estimate for the employer in question, y. Assigning a credibility factor, z, to the overall claims experience (and the reciprocal to employer experience) allows the insurer to get a more accurate estimate of the risk premium in the following manner: RP = xz + y(1-z).The credibility factor is derived by calculating the maximum likelihood estimate which would minimise the error of estimate. Assuming the variance of x and y are known quantities taking on the values u and v respectively, it can be shown that z should be equal to: z = v / (u+v).Therefore, the more uncertainty the estimate has, the lower is its credibility. Types of Credibility In Bayesian credibility, we separate each class (B) and assign them a probability (Probability of B). Then we find how likely our experience (A) is within each class (Probability of A given B). Next, we find how likely our experience was over all classes (Probability of A). Finally, we can find the probability of our class given our experience. So going back to each class, we weight each statistic with the probability of the particular class given the experience. B√ºhlmann credibility works by looking at the Variance across the population. More specifically, it looks to see how much of the Total Variance is attributed to the Variance of the Expect Values of each class (Variance of the Hypothetical Mean), and how much is attributed to the Expected Variance over all classes (Expected Value of the Process Variance). Say we have a basketball team with a high number of points per game. Sometimes they get 128 and other times they get 130 but always one of the two. Compared to all basketball teams this is a relatively low variance, meaning that they will contribute very little to the Expect Value of the Process Variance. Also, their unusually high point totals greatly increases the variance of the population, meaning that if the league booted them out, they'd have a much more predictable point total for each team (lower variance). So, this team is definitely unique (they contribute greatly to the Variance of the Hypothetical Mean). So we can rate this team's experience with a fairly high credibility. They often/always score a lot (low Expected Value of Process Variance) and not many teams score as much as them (high Variance of Hypothetical Mean). A simple example Suppose there are two coins in a box. One has heads on both sides and the other is a normal coin with 50:50 likelihood of heads or tails. You need to place a wager on the outcome after one is randomly drawn and flipped. The odds of heads is .5 * 1 + .5 * .5 = .75. This is because there is a .5 chance of selecting the heads-only coin with 100% chance of heads and .5 chance of the fair coin with 50% chance. Now the same coin is reused and you are asked to bet on the outcome again. If the first flip was tails, there is a 100% chance you are dealing with a fair coin, so the next flip has a 50% chance of heads and 50% chance of tails. If the first flip was heads, we must calculate the conditional probability that the chosen coin was heads-only as well as the conditional probability that the coin was fair, after which we can calculate the conditional probability of heads on the next flip. The probability that it came from a heads-only coin given that the first flip was heads is the probability of selecting a heads- only coin times the probability of heads for that coin divided by the initial probability of heads on the first flip, or .5 * 1 / .75 = 2/3. The probability that it came from a fair coin given that the first flip was heads is the probability of selecting a fair coin times the probability of heads for that coin divided by the initial probability of heads on the first flip, or .5 * .5 / .75 = 1/3. Finally, The conditional probability of heads on the next flip given that the first flip was heads is the conditional probability of a heads- only coin times the probability of heads for a heads-only coin plus the conditional probability of a fair coin times the probability of heads for a fair coin, or 2/3 * 1 + 1/3 * .5 = 5/6 ‚âà .8333 Actuarial credibility Actuarial credibility describes an approach used by actuaries to improve statistical estimates. Although the approach can be formulated in either a frequentist or Bayesian statistical setting, the latter is often preferred because of the ease of recognizing more than one source of randomness through both \\"sampling\\" and \\"prior\\" information. In a typical application, the actuary has an estimate X based on a small set of data, and an estimate M based on a larger but less relevant set of data. The credibility estimate is ZX + (1-Z)M, where Z is a number between 0 and 1 (called the \\"credibility weight\\" or \\"credibility factor\\") calculated to balance the sampling error of X against the possible lack of relevance (and therefore modeling error) of M. When an insurance company calculates the premium it will charge, it divides the policy holders into groups. For example, it might divide motorists by age, sex, and type of car; a young man driving a fast car being considered a high risk, and an old woman driving a small car being considered a low risk. The division is made balancing the two requirements that the risks in each group are sufficiently similar and the group sufficiently large that a meaningful statistical analysis of the claims experience can be done to calculate the premium. This compromise means that none of the groups contains only identical risks. The problem is then to devise a way of combining the experience of the group with the experience of the individual risk to calculate the premium better. Credibility theory provides a solution to this problem. For actuaries, it is important to know credibility theory in order to calculate a premium for a group of insurance contracts. The goal is to set up an experience rating system to determine next year's premium, taking into account not only the individual experience with the group, but also the collective experience. There are two extreme positions. One is to charge everyone the same premium estimated by the overall mean \\\\overline{X} of the data. This makes sense only if the portfolio is homogeneous, which means that all risks cells have identical mean claims. However, if the portfolio is heterogeneous, it is not a good idea to charge a premium in this way (overcharging \\"good\\" people and undercharging \\"bad\\" risk people) since the \\"good\\" risks will take their business elsewhere, leaving the insurer with only \\"bad\\" risks. This is an example of adverse selection. The other way around is to charge to group j its own average claims, being \\\\overline{X_j} as premium charged to the insured. These methods are used if the portfolio is heterogeneous, provided a fairly large claim experience. To compromise these two extreme positions, we take the weighted average of the two extremes: : C = z_j\\\\overline{X_j} + (1 - z_j) \\\\overline{X}\\\\, z_j has the following intuitive meaning: it expresses how \\"credible\\" (acceptability) the individual of cell j is. If it is high, then use higher z_j to attach a larger weight to charging the \\\\overline{X_j}, and in this case, z_j is called a credibility factor, and such a premium charged is called a credibility premium. If the group were completely homogeneous then it would be reasonable to set z_j=0, while if the group were completely heterogeneous then it would be reasonable to set z_j=1. Using intermediate values is reasonable to the extent that both individual and group history is useful in inferring future individual behavior. For example, an actuary has an accident and payroll historical data for a shoe factory suggesting a rate of 3.1 accidents per million dollars of payroll. She has industry statistics (based on all shoe factories) suggesting that the rate is 7.4 accidents per million. With a credibility, Z, of 30%, she would estimate the rate for the factory as 30%(3.1) + 70%(7.4) = 6.1 accidents per million. ReferencesFurther reading *Behan, Donald F.

He became known as the commander of the 20th Ohio Volunteer Infantry in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and was a recipient of the Army Medal of Honor for gallantry in action. Early life and career Manning F. Force was born in Washington, D.C., where his father, Peter Force, was the mayor. He turned down an appointment to West Point and went on to attended Harvard College until 1845, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1848. The following year, Force moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and began his law practice.Force, Manning, 2007 [1865] , p. 185 Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Force joined the Union forces as major of the 20th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, serving in the Western Theater as part of General James B. McPherson's 17th Corps. Colonel Force's 20th Ohio bore the brunt of the Battle of Raymond, Mississippi, in the Vicksburg Campaign. Osborn Oldroyd related the number of casualties from the 20th Ohio to his commander: > I took the roll-book from the pocket of our dead sergeant and found that > while we had gone in with thirty-two men, we came out with but sixteen‚Äî one- > half of the brave little band, but a few hours before so full of hope and > patriotism, either killed or wounded. Nearly all the survivors could show > bullet marks in clothing or flesh, but no man left the field on account of > wounds. When I told Colonel Force of our loss, I saw tears course down his > cheeks, and so intent were his thoughts upon his fallen men that he failed > to note the bursting of a shell above him, scattering the powder over his > person, as he sat at the foot of a tree.Oldroyd, page X. Following the Siege of Vicksburg, Force marched on to northern Georgia, where he fought in the Atlanta Campaign. He was severely wounded in the face during the Battle of Atlanta and was disfigured for life. For his valor during the Atlanta Campaign, Force was promoted to major general of volunteers in March 1865. Following the Battle of Atlanta, he participated in Sherman's March to the Sea. The thirty-seven-year-old lawyer began the conflict as a major and ended as a brevetted major general. Sgt. Osborn Oldroyd noted his leadership when he wrote in his diary: As Colonel Force called us to 'Attention' this morning one of the boys remarked, 'I love that man more than ever.' Yes, we have good reason to be proud of our Colonel, for upon all occasions we are treated by him as volunteers enlisted in war form pure love of country. ... \\" In his memoirs printed after the war, Force stated: > When lying there (in the trenches outside Vicksburg) it sometimes occurred > to me, what a transformation it was for these men, full of individuality and > self-reliance, accustomed always to act upon their own will, to so > completely subordinate their wills to the wills of other men ... Their > practical sense had told them an army differs from a mob only in discipline, > and discipline was necessary for self-preservation.Oldroyd, page Y. Postbellum activities Manning Force, pen and ink from Osborn H. I. Oldroyd, A Soldier's Story of the Siege of Vicksburg, 1885 After the war, Force returned to Cincinnati, where he became a justice of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. He also authored several law books and became a prominent writer as well as a lecturer. In 1892, he received the Medal of Honor. Manning Force is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. His papers and documents are housed in the Manning Ferguson Force Collection of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center.

Lemm graduated from Carroll College, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in 1942 after playing football for head coach John W. Breen. After service in World War II during the next two years, Lemm served as an assistant coach at the University of Notre Dame under Hugh Devore in 1945. Lemm returned to Carroll as an assistant coach with the school's football team the following year, then became a head coach for the first time, accepting the top job for Waukesha High School in 1948. Following Lemm's one year at Waukesha, Carroll's former coach, Breen, took the head coaching position at Lake Forest College. Lemm served under his leadership for the next three years, while also working as the school's head basketball coach, then replaced Breen in 1952. During his two seasons, he compiled an 11‚Äì4‚Äì1 record before leaving to accept the head coach position at Montana State University. An 8-1 season in 1954 was followed the next year by a 4‚Äì4‚Äì1 campaign. On May 14, 1956, he reached the National Football League (NFL) when he accepted a defensive assistant position with the Chicago Cardinals. Lemm spent just one season before resigning to again accept the head coaching position at Lake Forest. During the next two years, he nearly matched his previous stint at the school with an 11‚Äì5 record, winning District Coach of the Year accolades in 1957 from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). On February 21, 1959, he returned to an assistant's role with the Cardinals, and would remain at the professional level for the remainder of his career. After again spending a single season with the Cardinals, Lemm resigned on January 12, 1960 to accept an assistant coaching position with the Houston Oilers of the seminal American Football League. During the first season of play, the Oilers captured the league's first-ever title, but Lemm resigned after the season, returning to Libertyville, Illinois to work in the sporting goods industry. However, after a slow start to the 1961 season that saw the team with a 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, Oilers' head coach Lou Rymkus was fired. Lemm was offered the position by his former coach John Breen, the Oilers' Director of Player Personnel, and proceeded to lead the team to nine straight victories. The team then won its second straight title with a 10‚Äì3 win over the San Diego Chargers on December 24, 1961, and Lemm was named AFL Coach of the Year for his efforts. After orally agreeing to a contract for the next season, Lemm instead resigned on February 22, 1962 to take the top spot with the Cardinals, citing the proximity of St. Louis to his home in Lake Bluff, Illinois. He replaced Pop Ivy at St. Louis, and Ivy replaced Lemm at Houston. After a 4‚Äì9‚Äì1 record in his first year, Lemm came close to capturing the NFL's Eastern Conference title with a 9‚Äì5 season in 1963 and a 9‚Äì3‚Äì2 mark the following year. After signing a contract with a huge pay increase, the Cardinals crashed in 1965 with a 5‚Äì9 mark, with Lemm seemingly having job security. However, after Lemm was asked to stay in St. Louis as a full-time coach, he resigned on January 10, 1966, again citing family considerations. Oddly, he then accepted the head coaching job with his former team in Houston 19 days later. The Oilers struggled in 1966 with a 3‚Äì11 record, but bounced back in 1967 with a 9‚Äì4‚Äì1 record and a spot in the AFL Championship game. After a 40‚Äì7 thrashing at the hands of the Oakland Raiders, the Oilers again reached the postseason in 1969 compiling a mediocre 6‚Äì6‚Äì2 record and were again dismantled by the Raiders, 56‚Äì7, in the AFL's oddly constructed one year playoff system. For that season the first place team of the West played the second place team of the East and vice versa. The team's first year in the post-merger NFL, 1970, finished with a disastrous 3‚Äì10‚Äì1 mark. Following a 44‚Äì0 loss to his former team in St. Louis on November 1, 1970, Lemm announced he would be retiring at the conclusion of the year, this time citing health issues. Lemm's final game came on December 20 of that year, a 52‚Äì10 loss to the Oilers' Lone Star State rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. Lemm died on October 8, 1988 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after a college reunion.

Competing in six Winter Olympics, she won the gold medal in the women's singles luge event at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, and together with Jennifer Isacco she won the bronze in Turin in the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2006 Winter Olympics. She was the first Italian sportsperson to win Olympic medals in two disciplines. Luge career Weissensteiner was introduced to luge by her uncle at the age of seven, initially sledding on natural luge tracks. She won a World Junior Luge Championship title in 1988. Weissensteiner won eleven medals at the FIL World Luge Championships, including two gold (Women's singles: 1993, Mixed team: 1989), three silvers (Women's singles: 1989, Mixed team: 1990, 1995), and six bronzes (Women's singles: 1995, 1996; Mixed team: 1991, 1993, 1996, 1997). She was also won seven medals at the FIL European Luge Championships with two golds (Mixed team and Women's singles: both in 1994), two silvers (Women's singles: 1990; Mixed team: 1998), and three bronzes (Mixed team: 1988, 1990, 1996). Weissensteiner won the overall Luge World Cup title in women's singles twice (1992-3, 1997-8). She took a total of 13 wins, eight second places and eight third places in World Cup races. She was also the flagbearer at the opening ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. Her Olympic triumph was dampened by the death of her brother in a car accident a few days later: during his funeral, a burglar broke into Weissensteiner's home and stole her gold medal. Following the Games she retired from luge, becoming a youth luge coach. Bobsleigh career Weissensteiner returned to sledding as a bobsleigh pilot in 2001. She finished seventh in the 2-woman bobsleigh (with the former biker Antonella Bellutti, gold medalist in cycling) at the 2002 Winter Olympics. After the 2002 Games she teamed up with sprinter Jennifer Isacco, who she competed with until her retirement from the sport. Their best finish in the Bobsleigh World Cup was third twice in the two-woman event. (2002-3, 2003-4 (tied with Germany's Susi Erdmann)). She finished sixth in the 2-woman bobsleigh event at the 2005 FIBT World Championships in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The following year, Weissensteiner and Isacco finished second in the European Championships, and Weissensteiner joined Erdmann as being one of only two sledders to win a medal in both bobsleigh and luge at the Winter Olympics. She retired from all competition after the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. That year she was appointed as a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In addition she has a rhododendron named after her: this was part of a collaboration between the Accademia dei Georgofili and the Italian National Olympic Committee to name an azalea after each medal winner at the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 2006 Winter Paralympics. Subsequently, she returned to youth coaching in luge as well as working as a press officer for the Italian Luge Federation.

Prior to Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg's securing control of New York City schools, the Board of Education itself ran the schools. On June 30, 2002, Mayor Bloomberg secured authority over the schools from the New York State legislature, which began the era of \\"mayoral control\\" over the city schools. The New York Supreme Court elaborates: On June 30, 2009, the New York State Senate declined to renew the mayor's full authority over the school system. In particular, State Senate Democrats leader John Sampson, of Brooklyn, opposed the extension of mayoral control. The authority reverted for a time to the Board of Education, but mayoral control was restored until 2015 in a vote on August 6, 2009.

Geography The mountain range is fault-block mountain about long and wide and is situated just northeast of Dojran Lake. The highest point is Radomir (Kalabaka) at 2,031 m, with elevation otherwise ranging between 300 and 1900 m above sea level. The borders of all three countries meet at Tumba Peak.

Anab. 1,1,5) It is generally equated today with the modern Belasica.Brill Online Reference Works - Orbelus von Bredow, Iris (Bietigheim-Bissingen). The name √ìrbƒìlos is probably derived from the ancient Thracian/Paionian toponym of the mountain, which means \\"shining mountain\\", from belos - \\"blazing\\" or \\"shining\\", and or - \\"mountain\\".Beitr√§ge zur Namenforschung, C.

Background Born in Lagos on 8 April 1917, George Adeniji Garrick was the eldest son of Stanley David Garrick, a senior administrator and courtier to the Oba of Benin in the former Kingdom of Benin, now southwestern Nigeria. His grandfather was a Sierra Leone Creole catechist in Brass, Nigeria called J.D. Garrick. George Garrick attended King's College, Lagos where he was Head Boy. He excelled academically and was also noted for his prowess at games including cricket, football, squash and athletics. National record In 1938, Garrick enjoyed his finest moment when he established the Nigerian High Jump record with a clearance of 6 feet 3 and 1/2 inches during an athletic competition in Lagos. His record remained unbeaten for fourteen years and earned him national recognition. An exercise book illustration was created to honour his contribution to sports in general and High Jump in particular; one which millions of Nigerian students are very familiar with. Overseas success The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended Garrick's hopes of a medal at the British Empire Games which, ordinarily, would have been held in 1942. Nevertheless, he went on to register several athletic successes as a medical student at Glasgow University during the war years. In October 1946, he was awarded his Full Athletics Blue by the university; then, in 1947, he gained international honours representing Scotland against England and Ireland. Subsequently, he was appointed Captain of University Athletics for the 1948‚Äì49 season. Professional and personal life Returning to Nigeria after qualifying as a medical doctor, George Garrick entered the Government Medical Service and served in several parts of the country before going into private practice. In 1953, he married Princess Comfort Odinchezo Amobi, a granddaughter of Igwe Amobi I of Ogidi. Upon his father's death in 1958, Garrick's inheritance of the lands and seigniorial standing of the Siluko barony bestowed by the Oba of Benin led him to settle permanently in Benin City to continue his medical career. Garrick and his wife had two children together. Kola (d. 2009) and Tayo, the reclusive younger boy who is the present holder of the lands and title. Final years Dr. Garrick later served as vice president of the Bendel State Medical Association and on the state board of medical examiners, among others. In 1978, together with fellow practitioner Dr. N.O. Azinge, he was credited with important clinical observations regarding patient reactions to medication for the Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome. Over time, as George Garrick's health declined, his interest in and patronage of sports in Nigeria at state and national level waned but he remained enthused by international athletics and cricket until the end of his life.

Each Sky Bar has four sections, each with a different filling‚Äîcaramel, vanilla, peanut, and fudge‚Äîall covered in milk chocolate. History=New England Confectionery Company Sky Bar advertisement published in the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph in September 1938 Sky Bar was first announced in March 1938, as the New England Confectionery Company (Necco) became the first manufacturer in the United States to introduce a molded candy bar with four different centers encased in a chocolate covering. The originator of the Sky Bar was a candy maker working for Necco named Joseph Cangemi. Necco introduced Sky Bar by means of a dramatic skywriting advertising campaign, and ran a \\"complete the sentence\\" contest in The Boston Globe with cash prizes to raise consumer awareness. The initial price for a Sky Bar was five cents. Sky Bar's four different centers enrobed in chocolate were originally described in 1938 as English toffee, nougat, nut butter toffee, and fudge parfait. By 1955, they were English toffee, honey nougat, peanut whip, and fudge parfait. By 2001, the fillings were caramel, vanilla, peanut, and fudge. The peanut section was not peanut butter‚Äîit was a peanut-flavored caramel‚Äîwhile the vanilla section was not quite nougat or marshmallow, but similar to the consistency of a Valomilk cup. In 1945, a Necco advertisement for Sky Bar was one of only six signs illuminated in New York City's Times Square following VE Day. In late 2009, as an advertising tie-in with the DVD release of New Moon (from the Twilight vampire series), Necco released special chocolate bars inspired by the original Sky Bar candy. One bar, similar to the original, contained three filling flavors‚Äîcaramel, creme and peanut butter. Another bar resembled a heart shape and only contained creme. By 2014, Sky Bar had become difficult to find, but was still produced by Necco and could be found in some stores such as Cracker Barrel (especially in New England) or on the Internet through Amazon.com (in bulk) or some candy resellers. Sky Bar Confectionary Company Storefront of the Sky Bar Confectionary Company in Sudbury, Massachusetts Following the closure of Necco in mid-2018, the Sky Bar brand was sold at auction on September 27, 2018. The winning bidder was Louise Mawhinney, owner of a gourmet food store named Duck Soup based in Sudbury, Massachusetts. The new owner indicated plans to resume production in small batches in late 2019. In November 2019, operating as the Sky Bar Confectionary Company, ownership announced that Sky Bar was once again in production, available online and at the Duck Soup store in Sudbury. Beginning December 7th, 2019, the Sky Bar was sold at a separate Sky Bar store directly adjacent to Duck Soup, with the bar being produced in the rear of the store. In popular culture A Sky Bar candy bar is shown twice in the 2009 film The House of the Devil. Early in the film the Samantha Hughes character (Jocelin Donahue) opens and begins to consume a Sky Bar while in her college dorm room. Later, during her babysitting job, she's shown eating an already opened Sky Bar (presumably the unfinished candy bar from earlier).

Summary Journey consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian shore of the Niagara River. The tunnels and platform can be reached by elevators from the street level entrance. The tour is unguided. The two tunnels extend approximately behind the waterfall and allow visitors to view water cascading in front of the open cave entrances. Earlier in the attraction's history visitors were permitted far closer to the portals' edge, however, the ongoing erosion of the gorge itself left these areas with insufficient rock remaining on the sides, and new tunnels were built further back. Barricades now exist further back from the ledge at the end of the tunnels to ensure visitor safety. The observation deck provides a vantage point looking up with the falls to the right, allowing photographers a full view of the famous landmark. The deck is sprayed with water from the cascade so visitors are provided with plastic raincoats prior to their descent.

Bengali has developed over the course of roughly 1,300 years. The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the Charyapada, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries, and considered to be written in an ancestor language of Bengali, Assamese, Odia and many other languages belonging to the Eastern branch of the Indo-Aryan languages. The timeline of Bengali literature is divided into three periods ‚àí ancient (650-1200), medieval (1200-1800) and modern (after 1800). Medieval Bengali literature consists of various poetic genres, including Hindu religious scriptures (e.g. Mangalkavya), Islamic epics (e.g. works of Syed Sultan and Abdul Hakim), Vaishnava texts (e.g. biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu), translations of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit texts, and secular texts by Muslim poets (e.g. works of Alaol). Novels were introduced in the mid-19th century. Other than the Eastern Nagari script, Bengali has been written with different scripts such as the Perso-Arabic and Sylheti Nagri in certain parts of history. Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore was the best known figure of Bengali literature to the world. Kazi Nazrul Islam, notable for his activism and anti-British literature, was described as the Rebel Poet and is now recognised as the National poet of Bangladesh. Ancient (c. 650-1200) Charyapada manuscript preserved in the library of Rajshahi College. The first works in Bengali, appeared between 10th and 12th centuries C.E. It is generally known as the Charyapada and are 47 mystic hymns composed by various Buddhist monks, namely; Luipada, Kanhapada, Kukkuripada, Chatilpada, Bhusukupada, Kamlipada, Dhendhanpada, Shantipada and Shabarapada amongst others. The manuscript was discovered on a palm leaf in the Nepal Royal Court Library in 1907 by the Bengali linguist Haraprasad Shastri. Due to the language of these manuscripts only being partially understood, they were classified by Shastri with the name Sandhya Bhasha (‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∑‡¶æ), meaning dusk language. Medieval (1200-1800)=Early medieval/Transitional (1200-1350) This period is considered to be the time in which many common proverbs and rhymes first emerged. The Bengali alphabet became a lot like what it currently is. Ramai Pandit and Halayudh Misra were notable writers of this period. Pre-Chaitanya (1350-1500) The tomb of Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, under whose patronage were writers such as Shah Muhammad Sagir and Krittibas Ojha. Muslim writers were exploring different themes through narratives and epics such as religion, culture, cosmology, love and history; often taking inspiration from or translating Arabic and Persian literary works such as the Thousand and One Nights and the Shahnameh. The literary romantic tradition saw poems by Shah Muhammad Sagir on Yusuf and Zulaikha, as well as works of Sabirid Khan. The Dobhashi culture introduced Arabic and Persian vocabulary into Bengali texts to illustrate Muslim stories. Epic poetry included Nabibangsha by Syed Sultan, Janganama by Abdul Hakim and Rasul Bijoy by Shah Barid. Chandidas was the celebrated Hindu lyrical poet of this period, famed for translating Jayadeva's work from Sanskrit to Bengali and for producing thousands of poems dedicated to the love between Radha and Krishna such as the Shreekrishna Kirtana. Majority of Hindu writers in this period drew inspiration from a popular Maithili language Vaishnavite poet known as Vidyapati. Maladhar Basu's Sri Krishna Vijaya, which is chiefly a translation of the 10th and 11th cantos of the Bhagavata Purana, is the earliest Bengali narrative poem that can be assigned to a definite date. Composed between 1473 and 1480 C.E., it is also the oldest Bengali narrative poem of the Krishna legend. The Ramayana, under the title of Sri Rama Panchali, was translated by Krittibas Ojha.Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas, Vol.I, , Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , pp.105-10 Chaitanya era (1500-1700) Lalon inspired and influenced many poets, social and religious thinkers including Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Allen Ginsberg Bengali literature flourished in Arakan following its reconquest. It was home to prominent writers patronised in the Arakan royal court such as Alaol, who wrote Padmavati, as well as Daulat Qazi, Dawlat Wazir Bahram Khan, Quraishi Magan Thakur who wrote Chandravati and Maradan who wrote Nasirnama. Qazi was the first poet under the court patronage. He started writing Satimayna O Lorchandrani, considered to be the first Bengali romance. Teamwork was common in the court, and Alaol finished off Qazi's romance as the latter had died before managing to complete it.Sen, Sukumar (1993). Islami Bangla Sahitya (in Bengali), Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , pp.23-33 Modern (1800-present) Michael Madhusudan Datta's first epic Tilottama Sambhab Kabya published in 1860 was the first Bengali poem written in blank verse. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was considered one of the leading Bengali novelists and essayists of the 19th century. He also wrote Vande Mataram, the national song of India, which appears in his novel Anandamath (1882). In the 1880s, Chatterjee critically analysed Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita as well as the problems of Krishnaism from a historical perspective in his Dharmatattva and Krishna Charitra. Romesh Chunder Dutt and Mir Mosharraf Hossain are notable for their works of fiction. Girish Chandra Ghosh and Dwijendralal Ray were prominent playwrights of the time, whereas Akshay Kumar Boral and Ramendra Sundar Tribedi are famous for their influential essays. Rassundari Devi authored the first full-fledged autobiography in modern Bengali literature in 1876. The Pre-Tagore era also saw an undercurrent of popular literature which was focused on daily life in contemporary Bengal. The prose style, as well as the humour in these works, were often crass, blunt and accessible. A masterpiece in this regard was \\"Hutom Pechar Naksha\\" (The Sketch of the Owl) written by Kaliprasanna Singha, and satirically depicts \\"Babu\\" culture in 19th century Kolkata. Other notable works in this regard are \\"Alaler Ghorer Dulal\\" (The Spoilt Brat) by Peary Chand Mitra, \\"Ramtanu Lahiri o tatkalin Banga shamaj\\" (Ramtanu Lahiri & contemporary Bengali society) by Nyaymohan Tarkalankar, and \\"Naba Babu Bilas\\" & \\"Naba Bibi Bilas\\" by Bhabanicharan Bandopadhyay. These books arguably portrayed contemporary Bengali dialect and popular society effectively, and also incorporated now-extinct music genres such as Khisti, Kheur and Kabiyal gaan by stalwarts like Rupchand Pakhi and Bhola Moyra. Books like these have become rarer since the emergence of Tagore culture, and the burgeoning preference for literary elegance and refinement in Bengali society.

Bankim, Tagore and Nazrul Bankim Chandra Chatterjee is considered the first successful novelist in Bengali-language and through Kazi Nazrul Islam's contributions, Bengali ghazals were enriched profusely Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobel laureate Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's Vande Mataram played a vital role in the Indian independence movement and he is widely respected in India though less respected in Bangladesh his novels are popular in a lesser extent in Bangladesh. Bankim Memorial Award is the highest literary award which is given by the Government of West Bengal, India. Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam are the most well-known prolific writers of Bengal in this century. Tagore is celebrated as the writer of both India's national anthem, Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla as well as being a source of inspiration for the Sri Lanka Matha and similarly Nazrul is celebrated as the national poet of Bangladesh. Short story writers Bengali literature is also famous for short stories. Some famous short story writers are Rabindranath Tagore, Manik Bandopadhyay, Jagadish Gupta, Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, Rajshekhar Basu (Parasuram), Syed Mujtaba Ali, Premendra Mitra, 1947-1965 Rajshekhar Basu (1880‚Äì1960) was the best-known writer of satiric short story in Bengali literature. He mocked the charlatanism and vileness of various classes of the Bengali society in his stories written under the pseudonym \\"Parashuram\\". His major works include: Gaddalika (1924), Kajjwali (1927), Hanumaner Swapna (1937), Gamanush Jatir Katha (1945), Dhusturimaya Ityadi Galpa (1952), Krishnakali Ittadi Galpa (1953), Niltara Ittadi Galpa (1956), Anandibai Ittadi Galpa (1958) and Chamatkumari Ittadi Galpa (1959). He received the Rabindra Puraskar, the highest literary award of Paschimbanga in 1955 for Krishnakali Ityadi Galpa. Rajsheskhar was also a noted lexicographer, translator and essayist. His Chalantika (1937) is one of the most popular concise Bengali dictionaries, while his Bengali-language translations of Meghaduta (1943), the Ramayana (1946), the Mahabharata (1949) and the Bhagavat Gita (1961) are also acclaimed. His major essays are included in Laghuguru (1939) and Bichinta (1955). Prakalpana Movement Prakalpana Movement, branded by Steve LeBlanc, the noted US critic, as 'a tiny literary revolution', 'nurtured' by Kolkata, has been fostering its new genres of Prakalpana fiction, Sarbangin poetry and Chetanavyasism for over four decades, spearheaded by Vattacharja Chandan, beginning in 1969. It is probably the only bilingual (Bengali -English) literary movement in India mothered by Bengali literature, that has spread its wings worldwide through the participation of well known international avant-garde writers and mail artists such as Richard Kostelanetz, John M. Bennett, Sheila Murphy, Don Webb, with notable Bengali poets, writers and artists like Vattacharja Chandan.Songs of Kobisena by Steve Leblanc in Version 90, PMS Cafe Press, Alston, MS, USA.

Their headquarters are in Waiblingen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, near Stuttgart, Germany. Stihl was founded in 1926 by Andreas Stihl, an important innovator in early chain saw production. Stihl claims to be the world's best-selling brand of chain saws, and the only chain saw manufacturer to make its own saw chains and guide bars. Andreas Stihl AG is a privately held company owned by the descendants of Andreas Stihl. Stihl operates the Stihl Timbersports Series.  Company history  Andreas Stihl designed and hand built his first chainsaw in 1926. The saw was electrically powered, and weighed about 64 kg. The Stihl name soon became popular, and also became synonymous with professional grade chainsaws and soon became the number-one selling chainsaw company in the world, a title that the company retains to this day. Stihl growth was slow initially, as the chainsaws came to the market about the same time as the Great Depression; with manpower cheap, and old two-man saws proven, there was no need for power saws. The early saws were very heavy, and often needed two men to operate them. Some outfits had a wheeled generator which had a power cord to run to the electric saw. Stihl saws were used by the Wehrmacht, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia, where timber was cut for defensive positions. In the mid-1970s Stihl expanded the company by building manufacturing plants in Brazil and in the United States. Much of the increased demand came from the construction and landscaping markets. Along with the professional markets, Stihl designed a number of home-use equipment, like blowers, line trimmers, edgers, and chainsaws. In 2008, the newest Stihl production facility opened in Qingdao, China. In December 2008, Stihl acquired the carburetor producer Zama to safeguard the supply and to enter a new business segment with growth potential. During the 70s while building chainsaws, Stihl entered the weed-trimmer\\\\brush-cutter market contracting a Japanese company as their supplier for several years until Stihl had their own model to build themselves. 1992 saw the acquisition of the Austrian Viking brand.  Stihl Subsidiaries  Incorporated in Delaware, Stihl Inc. is the US subsidiary of Stihl International GmbH and is based in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Construction of the facilities there began in 1974. Along with the manufacturing facilities, there are also warehouses and administration buildings at the 150-acre complex. Stihl Inc. employs almost 2,000 employees on 2 million square feet of buildings. Andreas Stihl Ltd was founded in 1978 in the United Kingdom.  Product Evolution  After the war, the availability of cheap, strong aluminum, better designs, and more powerful engines meant that the Stihl saw came into its own. The name of the saw that was proving itself was called the Stihl Lightning perhaps with a model designation of 07S. Having established a foot hold in America the reputation of dependability propelled Stihl to the top of the market. Many improvements to design during the 1970s led the \\"chainsaw\\" to become a homeowner tool. Automatic chain oiling. anti-vibration handles, electronic ignition, chain brakes are some of them. Not only was the stronger aluminum a component but injected magnesium was used for even greater strength and lightweight. In the early 1970s there were few models of Stihl chainsaws available, with a model number related to cubic inches, rare for a German design. There was a standard & a heavy duty (the 040 & 050) with super saws of 070 & 090\\\\. Improvements led to the 041 & 051 and with anti-vibration came the 041AV. A new style lighter-weight saw was introduced with the 030AV, the 031AV etc. The reputation of the 020AV among fire fighters and tree trimmers was so good that demand for the saw continued even after mass-production ceased . Four employees would take all the parts and assemble them by hand averaging 10 saws per day. However, the saws did command upwards of $600 while other small saws were selling for a third of that. The new style of the 031 was made into an 045 that out-cut the 051 so the 051 was improved to an 075 (about 110cc). The 045 was hopped up to an 056 with a Magnum and a Magnum II before it was discontinued. Also, there was an 08S (56cc) which was a chainsaw but also a powerhead, removable bar & chain, that would power tools such as brush cutter, post hole digger, and cut-off saw. The experience with injection molding was applied to a new material, plastic. The plastic injection system at the factory in Virginia Beach is run round the clock so the mold does not clog. Batches of plastic plugs are tested for quality before use with weather chamber that simulates hot & cold and saws are dropped from a height to see if bending or breakage occurs.personal experience in the industry  Product gallery ReferencesExternal links * * Official STIHL UK website * Official STIHL UK Blog * Official STIHL USA website * Official STIHL Taiwan website * Official STIHL Australian website Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1926 Category:Companies based in Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Agricultural machinery manufacturers of Germany Category:Tool manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Lawn and garden tractors Category:Chainsaws Category:German brands Category:1926 establishments in Germany ","title":"Stihl"},{"id":"4152815","text":"Giving Birth to a Stone is the debut and only studio album by UK metal band Peach, released in 1994 through Mad Minute Records.

During World War I he became a known Major-General. Early life Empain was born at Bel≈ìil, Belgium, and was the son of schoolteacherTHE BELGIANS OF EGYPT, 13 May 1995 at www.egy.com Fran√ßois Julien Empain and his wife Catherine (n√©e Lolivier). He went into business with his brother, Baron Fran√ßois Empain and other family members, and amassed a great fortune. Empain began his career a draughtsman at a metallurgical company, Soci√©t√© m√©tallurgique, in 1878,EMPAIN Edouard at www.wallonie-en- ligne.net and became involved in railway construction when he noticed that transport infrastructure in the countryside was inadequate. After success in Belgium with the Li√®ge-Jemeppe line, his companies developed several railway lines in France, including the creation of the Paris M√©tro. Because he felt that he depended too much on the banks for his industrial plans, in 1881 he founded his own bank, Banque Empain, which later became the Belgian Industrial Bank (\\"Banque Industrielle Belge\\"). The Empain group of companies expanded greatly throughout the 1890s, constructing electric urban tramlines in Europe, Russia, China, the Belgian Congo, and in Cairo, Egypt. Desiring to also be independent of electricity producers, Empain also was involved in forming a number of electricity companies to power his projects. Egypt Baron Empain Palace (Qasr Al Baron), Heliopolis, Egypt. √âdouard Empain arrived in Egypt in January 1904, intending to rescue one of the projects of his company S.A. des Chemins de Fer de la Basse-Egypte; being the construction of a railway line linking Mansourah (on the Nile river) to Matariya (on the far side of Lake Manzala from Port Said).BELGIAN COMPANIES IN EGYPT* at www.booneshares.com In 1906, Empain established the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company, which bought a very large stretch of desert (25 square kilometres) to the northeast of Cairo at a low price from the Egyptian government. Commencing in 1906 this company proceeded with the building of the new town of Heliopolis, in the desert ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. It was designed as a \\"city of luxury and leisure\\", with broad avenues and equipped with all necessary conveniences and infrastructure; water, drains, electricity, hotel facilities, such as the Heliopolis Palace Hotel (formerly the presidential palace of ex-President Hosni Mubarak) and Heliopolis House, and recreational amenities including a golf course, racetrack and park. In addition, there was housing for rent, offered in a range of innovative design types targeting specific social classes with detached and terraced villas, apartment buildings, tenement blocks with balcony access and workers' bungalows. Today, Baron Empain is perhaps best known by modern visitors to Egypt for the building of a palace (the Palais Hindou) in the Avenue des Palais (renamed Orouba Avenue following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952) Heliopolis, Egypt. Inspired by Angkor Wat in Cambodia and the Hindu temples of Orissa,, the Baron Empain palace was designed by French architect Alexandre Marcel (1860‚Äì1928) and decorated by Georges-Louis Claude (1879‚Äì1963), with construction being completed in 1911. In 1905, Empain assisted the Belgian government in the purchase of an Old Kingdom mastaba for the royal museum in Brussels, of which he was a benefactor. In 1907 he received the title of Baron, and also suggested to Belgian Egyptologist Jean Capart that he excavate at Heliopolis, where his building constructions were underway. He also made it possible for Capart to acquire some fine ancient artefacts for the Brussels Museum. Military Career Major-General Baron Empain During World War I, he was given the rank of general and directed armaments production at Paris and Le Havre for the Belgian army. He died in Woluwe, Belgium, and was buried in Our Lady of Heliopolis Basilica (Basilique Notre-Dame d'H√©liopolis). In Egypt. He was succeeded as baron by his son, Jean Empain, who married American burlesque performer Rozell Rowland (sometimes Rozelle Rowland). They entertained frequently at the Heliopolis.

Known for most of its length as Blue Ball Road, the state highway runs from MD 213 in Elkton north to Kirk Road and Warburton Road at Pleasant Hill in central Cecil County. MD 545 was constructed to Little Elk Creek near Childs in the early 1930s and extended to Pleasant Hill in the late 1940s. Route description MD 545 northbound in Elkton after MD 213 View north along MD 545 at MD 279 in Elkton MD 545 begins at MD 213 (Bridge Street) on the west side of Elkton. The state highway heads west as two-lane undivided Elkton Boulevard, which becomes Blue Ball Road when the highway curves north at Bratton Road. MD 545 intersects MD 279 (Elkton Road) and crosses Dogwood Run before leaving the town of Elkton. The highway intersects Dogwood Road, crosses Gravelly Run, then passes under Interstate 95 with no access and immediately crosses Little Elk Creek. MD 545 parallels the creek to the road's narrow, curved passage under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision rail line as it enters the village of Childs. The highway intersects Leeds Road in the hamlet of Leeds before reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with Kirk Road and Warburton Road in the hamlet of Pleasant Hill. Blue Ball Road continues northwest as a county highway toward Blue Ball Village. History MD 545 was paved as a concrete road from MD 280 (now MD 213) to Little Elk Creek near Childs in 1933. This work included the construction of a steel pony truss bridge over Little Elk Creek that was completed in 1932. MD 545 was extended to Pleasant Hill after the state reconstructed Blue Ball Road from there to Childs as a gravel road between 1947 and 1949 and resurfaced soon after with bituminous concrete. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 280 to Dogwood Road in 1969 and from Dogwood Road to Pleasant Hill in 1972. In January 2010, the Maryland State Highway Administration put the 1932 pony truss bridge MD 545 used to cross Little Elk Creek up for sale to any buyer willing to preserve the bridge at a new location. No interested party was found, so the old bridge was demolished in June and July 2011. The new concrete bridge opened in November 2011.

(ca. 1230 - 25 December 1306) was an Italian Franciscan friar from Umbria in the 13th century. He wrote several laude (songs in praise of the Lord) in the local vernacular. He was an early pioneer in Italian theatre, being one of the earliest scholars who dramatised Gospel subjects. Life Born Jacopo dei Benedetti, he was a member of a noble family. He studied law in Bologna and became a successful lawyer. At some point in his late 20s, he married a young noblewoman, named Vanna according to some accounts, who was a pious and generous woman. Due to his reputation as a worldly and greedy man, she took it upon herself to mortify her flesh in atonement for his behavior. Not long after their wedding, Benedetti urged his wife to attend a public tournament. In the course of the spectacle, she was killed when part of the stand in which she was sitting gave way. Rushing to her side, he discovered that she had been wearing a hairshirt. Shocked, he realized that she had performed this penance for his sake. The Piazza del Popolo in Todi, where Jacopone crawled around on one occasion Benedetti gave up his legal practice, gave away all his possessions and from about 1268 lived as a wandering ascetic, joining the Third Order of St. Francis. During this period, he gained a reputation as a madman, due to his eccentric behavior, acting out his spiritual vision, earning him the nickname he was to embrace of Jacopone. Examples of this behavior included appearing in the public square of Todi, wearing a saddle and crawling on all fours. On another occasion, he appeared at a wedding in his brother's house, tarred and feathered from head to toe. After about ten years of this life, Benedetti sought admission to the Friars Minor, but they were reluctant to accept him due to his reputation. He soon composed a beautiful poem on the vanities of the world, which led to his admission into the Order in 1278. He chose to live as a lay brother. By this time, two broad factions had arisen in the Franciscan Order, one with a more lenient, less mystical attitude and one being more severe, preaching absolute poverty and penitence (known as the \\"Spirituals\\" or Fraticelli). Jacopone was connected with the latter group and in 1294 they sent a deputation to Pope Celestine V to ask permission to live separately from the other friars and to observe the Franciscan Rule in its perfection. The request was granted. But Celestine resigned the papacy before action was taken and was succeeded by Pope Boniface VIII, who opposed the more rigorous views.McNamara, Fr. Robert F., St. Kateri Tekakwitha Parish, Irondequoit, New York During the struggle that followed, Jacopone publicized the Spirituals' cause by writing verses highly critical of their opponents, the Pope included. When two brother- cardinals, the Colonnas, sided with the Spirituals and with the king of France against Pope Boniface, and Fra Jacopone gave his support to the Colonnas, politics and even war entered upon the scene. The Pope excommunicated them. A battle between the two rival parties ensued, ending with the siege of Palestrina and the imprisonment and excommunication of Jacopone in 1298. He was freed in 1303 upon the death of Boniface, having been specifically excluded from the Jubilee Year of 1300 by papal bull. Broken and in poor health, Jacopone retired to Collazzone, a small town situated on a hill between Perugia and Todi, where he was cared for by a community of Poor Clares. His condition deteriorated toward the end of 1306, and he sent word requesting that his old friend, John of La Verna, come to give him the last rites. John arrived on Christmas Eve and comforted him, as he died about midnight. Jacopone's body was originally buried in the monastery church. In 1433 his grave was discovered and his remains transferred to a crypt in the Franciscan Church of San Fortunato in Todi. Poetry Jacopone's satirical and denunciatory Laude witness to the troubled times of the warring city- states of northern Italy and the material and spiritual crisis that accompanied them. The laude are written in his native Umbrian dialect and represent the popular poetry of the region. Many hundreds of manuscripts attest to the broad popularity of his poems in many contexts - although anonymous poems are often attributed to him by the tradition. Other laude extol the spiritual value of poverty. Some of his laude were especially in use among the so-called Laudesi and the Flagellants, who sang them in the towns, along the roads, in their confraternities and in sacred dramatical representations. With hindsight, the use of the laude may be seen as an early seed of Italian drama that came to fruition in later centuries. The Latin poem Stabat Mater Dolorosa is generally attributed to Jacopone, although this has been disputed. It is a fine example of religious lyric in the Franciscan tradition. It was inserted into the Roman Missal and Breviary in 1727 for the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary, celebrated on the Friday before Good Friday. Following changes by Pope Pius XII, it now appears on the Feast of Our Lady's Sorrows celebrated on 15 September. Many composers have set it to music, including Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Palestrina, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Gioacchino Rossini, Toivo Kuula, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi. Veneration Tomb of Jacopone in Todi From the time of his death, Jacopone was considered to have been a saint by his followers, both within and outside of the Franciscan Order. He is honored as Blessed within the Order. Several attempts were made over the centuries to have the Catholic Church recognize his sanctity. In the 17th century, both the City Council and the cathedral chapter of Todi petitioned the Holy See to do so. In the 19th century, the Postulator for the causes of saints of the Order of Friars Minor collected documents for this step. To date, however, the Church has never formally approved this devotion. One possible reason for this may be the conflict between Jacopone and Pope Boniface VIII. Legacy Jacopone was steadfast in condemning corruption, especially through his satirical Italian poems. Jacopone would not recant his position on the requirement of ascetic poverty, believing that the mainstream church had become corrupt and that its ministers were not interested in the welfare of the poor. This criticism is echoed in the contemporary Alleluia Movement. It was a time of famine and poverty in Italy and many mystics and preachers like Gioacchino da Fiore anticipated the end of the world and the coming of Christ. They also said kings and clergy had become too attached to material goods and too interested in their personal wars rather than the welfare of the country. Jacopone's preaching attracted many enthusiasts and Dante praised him in his Paradiso.

It carries no dedication. This string quartet has none of the bravura of the fifth symphony which preceded it. Instead, the composer seemed to have discovered a new kind of distinctly Russian neoclassicism. The tone is chiefly optimistic, although the minor- keyed inner movements provide a contrast. Shostakovich wrote of this quartet \\"I visualized childhood scenes, somewhat na√Øve and bright moods associated with spring.\\" Premiere The work was premiered in Leningrad on 10 October 1938 by the Glazunov Quartet. It was also premiered in Moscow on 16 November 1938 by the Beethoven Quartet. This premiere began a lifelong friendship between Shostakovich and the quartet. Structure In the traditional style of a string quartet, the work has four movements: Playing time is approximately 14 minutes. First Movement The first movement, in C major, is in sonata-allegro form. The exposition starts with flowing chords under an opening theme, which then moves to a tentative but happy second theme pushed along by continuous short notes. After a brief development section and recapitulation, the movement closes with a content coda (ending). Second Movement The happy mood of the first movement is contrasted by the slow second movement, in A minor. It consists of eight variations on a folk tune melody first played on the solo viola. This melody is not actually from a Russian folksong, but a creation by Shostakovich based on folksong tradition. After four melancholy variations, the music moves into a lighter mood for two variations, then back into minor for the last two variations. The movement ends with a pizzicato A minor chord. Third Movement The third movement, a scherzo, is set in the remote key of C minor. It begins with a single note quickly repeated on the viola in time, creating a nervous mood. After a bit of fast melody, it then moves to a trio in F major which is slightly more relaxed, but still apprehensive and quick. The scherzo is repeated again, and an ironic coda, which references the trio, brings a close to the movement. Fourth Movement The last movement, in the home key of C major, brings the springlike mood back full force, in the form of an energetic finale. The opening immediately sets a cheerful mood with trills and light-hearted melodies. There is, however, still a darker side which clashes with the happy mood in the exciting development, which leads to the vibrant recapitulation and coda. The ending bars are an impressive climax, with the viola and cello playing rapid notes in their lowest registers while the violins hammer out C major chords above.

PBPs normally catalyze the cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall, but they can be permanently inhibited by penicillin and other Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. (NAM = N-acetylmuramic acid; NAG = N-acetylglucosamine) Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are a group of proteins that are characterized by their affinity for and binding of penicillin. They are a normal constituent of many bacteria; the name just reflects the way by which the protein was discovered. All Œ≤-lactam antibiotics (except for tabtoxinine-Œ≤-lactam, which inhibits glutamine synthetase) bind to PBPs, which are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. PBPs are members of a subgroup of enzymes called transpeptidases. Specifically, PBPs are DD-transpeptidases. Diversity There are a large number of PBPs, usually several in each organism, and they are found as both membrane-bound and cytoplasmic proteins. For example, Spratt (1977) reports that six different PBPs are routinely detected in all strains of E. coli ranging in molecular weight from 40,000 to 91,000. The different PBPs occur in different numbers per cell and have varied affinities for penicillin. The PBPs are usually broadly classified into high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low- molecular-weight (LMW) categories. Proteins that have evolved from PBPs occur in many higher organisms and include the mammalian LACTB protein. Function PBPs are all involved in the final stages of the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is the major component of bacterial cell walls. Bacterial cell wall synthesis is essential to growth, cell division (thus reproduction) and maintaining the cellular structure in bacteria. Inhibition of PBPs leads to defects in cell wall structure and irregularities in cell shape, for example filamentation, pseudomulticellular forms, lesions leading to spheroplast formation, and eventual cell death and lysis. PBPs have been shown to catalyze a number of reactions involved in the process of synthesizing cross-linked peptidoglycan from lipid intermediates and mediating the removal of D-alanine from the precursor of peptidoglycan. Purified enzymes have been shown to catalyze the following reactions: D-alanine carboxypeptidase, peptidoglycan transpeptidase, and peptidoglycan endopeptidase. In all bacteria that have been studied, enzymes have been shown to catalyze more than one of the above reactions. The enzyme has a penicillin-insensitive transglycosylase N-terminal domain (involved in formation of linear glycan strands) and a penicillin- sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain (involved in cross-linking of the peptide subunits) and the serine at the active site is conserved in all members of the PBP family. Some low-molecular-weight PBPs associate with the MreB cytoskeleton and follow its rotation around the cell, inserting petipdoglycan in an oriented manner during cell growth. In contrast, high- molecular-weight PBPs are independent from MreB and maintain cell wall integrity by detecting and repairing defects in the peptidoglycan. Antibiotics PBPs bind to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics because they are similar in chemical structure to the modular pieces that form the peptidoglycan. When they bind to penicillin, the Œ≤-lactam amide bond is ruptured to form a covalent bond with the catalytic serine residue at the PBPs active site. This is an irreversible reaction and inactivates the enzyme. There has been a great deal of research into PBPs because of their role in antibiotics and resistance. Bacterial cell wall synthesis and the role of PBPs in its synthesis is a very good target for drugs of selective toxicity because the metabolic pathways and enzymes are unique to bacteria. Resistance to antibiotics has come about through overproduction of PBPs and formation of PBPs that have low affinity for penicillins (among other mechanisms such as lactamase production). These experiments change the structure of PBP by adding different amino acids into the protein, allowing for new discovery of how the drug interacts with the protein. Research on PBPs has led to the discovery of new semi-synthetic Œ≤-lactams, wherein altering the side-chains on the original penicillin molecule has increased the affinity of PBPs for penicillin, and, thus, increased effectiveness in bacteria with developing resistance. Presence of the protein penicillin binding protein 2A (PBP2A) is responsible for the antibiotic resistance seen in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The Œ≤-lactam ring is a structure common to all Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. Other images File:Penicillin-core.pngPenicillin core.

After the couple leaves their car, the wife has a slight accident in which she rolls downhill and sprains her ankle. When the husband reaches her, they realise they are being stalked and attacked by tumbleweeds which appear to be possessed by some form of energy. At first they attempt to keep the tumbleweeds at bay with fire, but soon run out of firewood. At this point they are saved by a severely disturbed (possibly schizophrenic) farmer named Lamont, who explains that things have been awkward in the valley ever since a \\"meteor\\" landed two weeks before, causing his farm to die out. Lamont tells them he stayed merely out of curiosity, but now the possessed weeds, trees and rocks won't allow him to leave either. The three make their way to Lamont's house where they spend a frightening night surrounded by tumbleweeds first and then thousands of frogs. The wife discovers Lamont's diary containing eloquent and intelligent passages regarding his awareness of an apparent alien presence. Come morning, they walk back to the car without trouble, only to be attacked by living rocks once they get there. One rock kills Lamont. The couple run back to the farmhouse, where Lamont eventually returns and sits down in a chair, remaining motionless, speechless and in a trance-like state, with the couple trying to rouse him, and then realizing that he has been possessed by an unknown entity. The husband then decides that the only way they are ever to escape is to attempt to communicate with whatever is behind the possessions. The husband manages to make contact through self-hypnosis, and is briefly possessed by what appears to be a non-corporeal alien mind that came to Earth out of mere curiosity, but failed to establish communication. The extraterrestrial presence bemoans its vain attempt at communicating with humans and eventually departs after transmitting the idea that mankind perhaps needs more time to evolve in order to communicate with it. After its departure, everything returns to normal, allowing the couple to return to their car. On their way home, the husband compassionately philosophises that, while both of them are only a few miles away from their home, the alien intelligence must, to the contrary, be far further from its own.

It is a key concept in systematic software reuse. A key idea in systematic software reuse is the domain. Most organizations work in only a few domains. They repeatedly build similar systems within a given domain with variations to meet different customer needs. Rather than building each new system variant from scratch, significant savings may be achieved by reusing portions of previous systems in the domain to build new ones. The process of identifying domains, bounding them, and discovering commonalities and variabilities among the systems in the domain is called domain analysis. This information is captured in models that are used in the domain implementation phase to create artifacts such as reusable components, a domain-specific language, or application generators that can be used to build new systems in the domain. Purpose Domain engineering is designed to improve the quality of developed software products through reuse of software artifacts. Domain engineering shows that most developed software systems are not new systems but rather variants of other systems within the same field. As a result, through the use of domain engineering, businesses can maximize profits and reduce time-to- market by using the concepts and implementations from prior software systems and applying them to the target system. The reduction in cost is evident even during the implementation phase. One study showed that the use of domain- specific languages allowed code size, in both number of methods and number of symbols, to be reduced by over 50%, and the total number of lines of code to be reduced by nearly 75%. Domain engineering focuses on capturing knowledge gathered during the software engineering process. By developing reusable artifacts, components can be reused in new software systems at low cost and high quality. Because this applies to all phases of the software development cycle, domain engineering also focuses on the three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation, paralleling application engineering. This produces not only a set of software implementation components relevant to the domain, but also reusable and configurable requirements and designs. Given the growth of data on the Web and the growth of the Internet of Things, a domain engineering approach is becoming relevant to other disciplines as well. The emergence of deep chains of Web services highlights that the service concept is relative. Web services developed and operated by one organization can be utilized as part of a platform by another organization. As services may be used in different contexts and hence require different configurations, the design of families of services may benefit from a domain engineering approach. Phases 330px Domain engineering, like application engineering, consists of three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation. However, where software engineering focuses on a single system, domain engineering focuses on a family of systems. A good domain model serves as a reference to resolve ambiguities later in the process, a repository of knowledge about the domain characteristics and definition, and a specification to developers of products which are part of the domain. Domain analysis Domain analysis is used to define the domain, collect information about the domain, and produce a domain model. Through the use of feature models (initially conceived as part of the feature-oriented domain analysis method), domain analysis aims to identify the common points in a domain and the varying points in the domain. Through the use of domain analysis, the development of configurable requirements and architectures, rather than static configurations which would be produced by a traditional application engineering approach, is possible. Domain analysis is significantly different from requirements engineering, and as such, traditional approaches to deriving requirements are ineffective for development of configurable requirements as would be present in a domain model. To effectively apply domain engineering, reuse must be considered in the earlier phases of the software development life cycle. Through the use of selection of features from developed feature models, consideration of reuse of technology is performed very early and can be adequately applied throughout the development process. Domain analysis is derived primarily from artifacts produced from past experience in the domain. Existing systems, their artifacts (such as design documents, requirement documents and user manuals), standards, and customers are all potential sources of domain analysis input. However, unlike requirements engineering, domain analysis does not solely consist of collection and formalization of information; a creative component exists as well. During the domain analysis process, engineers aim to extend knowledge of the domain beyond what is already known and to categorize the domain into similarities and differences to enhance reconfigurability. Domain analysis primarily produces a domain model, representing the common and varying properties of systems within the domain. The domain model assists with the creation of architectures and components in a configurable manner by acting as a foundation upon which to design these components. An effective domain model not only includes the varying and consistent features in a domain, but also defines the vocabulary used in the domain and defines concepts, ideas and phenomena, within the system. Feature models decompose concepts into their required and optional features to produce a fully formalized set of configurable requirements. Domain design Domain design takes the domain model produced during the domain analysis phase and aims to produce a generic architecture to which all systems within the domain can conform. In the same way that application engineering uses the functional and non-functional requirements to produce a design, the domain design phase of domain engineering takes the configurable requirements developed during the domain analysis phase and produces a configurable, standardized solution for the family of systems. Domain design aims to produce architectural patterns which solve a problem common across the systems within the domain, despite differing requirement configurations. In addition to the development of patterns during domain design, engineers must also take care to identify the scope of the pattern and the level to which context is relevant to the pattern. Limitation of context is crucial: too much context results in the pattern not being applicable to many systems, and too little context results in the pattern being insufficiently powerful to be useful. A useful pattern must be both frequently recurring and of high quality. The objective of domain design is to satisfy as many domain requirements as possible while retaining the flexibility offered by the developed feature model. The architecture should be sufficiently flexible to satisfy all of the systems within the domain while rigid enough to provide a solid framework upon which to base the solution. Domain implementation Domain implementation is the creation of a process and tools for efficiently generating a customized program in the domain. Criticism Lately, domain engineering has been criticized for focusing too much on \\"engineering-for-reuse\\" or \\"engineering-with-reuse\\" of generic software features rather than concentrating on \\"engineering-for-use\\" such that an individual's world-view, language, or context is integrated into the design of software.

Gungbok lost his mother to pirates when he was young. His father was a slave carpenter in Police Office of Cheonghae. Working hard in the rough dock, Gungbok soon masters the sea and has the knack of building ships. Faced with challenges, he becomes calmer and bolder. Both Gungbok and his mate Nyeon learn martial arts from certain Choi Moo-chang. Such abilities helped him to rise from a gladiator to a security guard, military head of Muryongun and then ambassador of Cheonghae. As a part of this, he eliminated the pirates by installing Cheonghaejin on Wando, which is a geographically important sea route. With his clever battle strategies, he is able to defeat the army led by Madam Jami and install the true ruler of Korea. However, even after repeated requests by the king, he refuses the high positions. After the king is assassinated by the cunning Kim Yang, he prepares the army to lead a final assault and remove the corrupt ministers appointed by Kim Yang. :At the end, Consul Jang Bogo is fatally stabbed in his office with a concealed knife by Yeom Jang.

For this, he trains Kim Yang's men in martial arts and leads the assault against Madam Jami's men, when they temporarily reconcile with Jang Bogo. He is later appointed the head of the king's bodyguards. With war looming against Jang Bogo, he visits Cheonghae to defuse the situation. He promises Kim Yang that if the need arises, he will assassinate him, provided Kim spares Jang Bogo's wife (daughter of Jang Bogo's trade master) and their new born child, Jung-hwa and the people of Silla. During their meeting, he tries his best to deviate Jang from his attack, but Jang has made up his mind to put an end to the ineffective and corrupt ministers in the king's council. In the end, he betrays Jang Bogo and kills him. He receives a jolt after the assassination, when Kim Yang launches an attack on Silla.

Plot Two astronauts on the M-1 spaceship land on Mars in the year 2021; when one goes out to explore he is heard screaming and his last transmission indicates that he had no idea what was happening to him. When the second astronaut goes out to investigate, he too makes a similar transmission. Three years later a second mission, M-2, lands with a crew of four consisting of Major Merritt, Captains Buckley and Lazzari and Lieutenant Johnson. They are tasked both to explore and to determine what happened to the M-1. When Captain Lazzari is sent to explore the ruins of the M-1, he goes behind the ship to examine it and screams in unbearable agony, just like the previous crew. Captain Buckley and Lieutenant Johnson go to investigate and Buckley finds only bloodstains. Johnson, armed with a nuclear bazooka, wanders off and disappears. The two remaining crew are ordered to stay within the confines of the ship in the last hours before take-off. However, Captain Buckley has a vision wherein the planet's deserts appear as sand-filled oceans; he then slips out to examine these \\"oceans\\". While exiting the ship he cuts his hand; he rubs the blood onto a scrap of cloth and throws it out into the desert. He learns that a Sand-Beast ‚Äì a crustacean-like animal that swims through the sands like a shark ‚Äì is at fault for the deaths. Major Merritt, the leader of the expedition, was asleep when Captain Buckley exited, but goes out to find him and becomes trapped on a rock when the Sand-Beast pursues him. With ten minutes left until lift-off, Captain Buckley creates a distraction by running across the sands; this allows both Merritt and Buckley to reach the shore unharmed. They shoot the Sand-Beast, using the nuclear bazooka Johnson left behind when he was killed. The fatally wounded Sand-Beast submerges beneath the surface, but five other Sand-Beasts, drawn by the noise and blood of their dying kin, soon emerge. The two remaining astronauts realize, \\"There's a whole army of them\\". Major Merritt and Captain Buckley communicate with control on Earth that they are coming home.

That story takes place on the fourth planet of a faraway star, where the fifty-man warship Nesbitt lands to investigate the disappearance of a number of spaceships sent to the planet. After a ten-man expeditionary team is consumed from inside a forcefield, the ship's computer suggests, unconvincingly, that \\"invisible\\" birds are to blame. Twenty-nine more men are killed and a lone survivor, named Lazzari, is found in the desert. The final transmission from his unit: \\"No! No! They're coming out of the ground!\\" Lazzari kills himself by smashing his head against a bulkhead and the remaining crew gather outside the ship to give him a military burial. The computer advises against it; the corpse is bloody and blood seems to provoke the attacks. Allison, the civilian computer expert, protests against the burial and is locked inside the Nesbitt by the mission commander. Allison watches helplessly as the funeral party is eaten by \\"large, heavy, porpoiselike creatures ...swimming up out of the sand as if it were water.\\"The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), p. 297 After reading Sohl's first draft based on his short story, ABC decided the monster should appear sooner, so Seeleg Lester rewrote the script. That version involved the ship's crew monitoring the planet's surface with cameras (Lester even talked to Sohl about writing scenes incorporating cameras beneath the sands of Mars), yet with all these cameras operating, the crew still didn't figure out what was killing them. After further rewrites by Sohl, the script was passed to producer Ben Brady, who rewrote the last act into a \\"calm fourth quarter\\". Finally, director Byron Haskin rewrote the entire script over a 28-hour period, feeling that the episode would never have aired if he had filmed the script he was given.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), pp. 297‚Äì8 Cast *Adam West ‚Äì Major Charles 'Chuck' Merritt *Rudy Solari ‚Äì Captain Buckley *Joe Maross ‚Äì General Winston *Ted Knight ‚Äì Mr. Jerome *Chris Alcaide ‚Äì Colonel Danvers *Anthony Costello ‚Äì Lieutenant Bowman *Bob DoQui ‚Äì Lieutenant Johnson *Peter Marko ‚Äì Captain Lazzari *Mike Mikler ‚Äì Captain Thomas Trivia *This episode's alternative title is \\"The Yellow Sands\\". *The Sand-Beast makes a cameo appearance in the next episode, \\"Wolf 359\\". *This episode is erroneously listed on one DVD case (\\"The Outer Limits Volume Three The Original Series Disc 1 Episodes 33‚Äì40\\") in \\"The Outer Limits The Complete Original Series Volumes 1‚Äì3\\".

Mass Games can basically be described as a synchronized socialist- realist spectacular, featuring over 100,000 participants in a 90-minute display of gymnastics, dance, acrobatics, and dramatic performance, accompanied by music and other effects, all wrapped in a highly politicized package. Students practiced every day from January onwards.

These were the hardest working days of the year since every individual was required to participate along with his fellow workers. Being late on this day or not shouting the party leader's name loudly enough would lead to being reported by fellow workers to prosecutors. In Bulgaria, mass games were occasionally held during the Zname na mira (\\"Flag of Peace\\") international youth festivals. However, Bulgaria did not have a tradition of mass games, and performances were rare. In Yugoslavia, similar activities called Slet were organized, and one of these events was the Relay of Youth. In Yugoslavia, participation in Slet events was voluntary. In East Germany, eight mass games called the GDR Gymnastics and Sports Festival were held in Leipzig.

It first aired on 7 November 1964, during the second season. The title is derived from a star of the same name located relatively near Earth. Introduction The speedy evolution of an alien culture is observed through a professor's telescope. However, the experience soon goes out of control when a malevolent lifeform evolves at the planet's surface and threatens the scientific team. Opening narration Outward stretches the quest for truth. Stars without end. Timeless infinities. A billion, billion galaxies. Man's imagination reaches out and out, while betimes the farthest reaches of knowledge are found in the smallest places... Plot Working on behalf of corporate interests, scientist Jonathan Meridith has created a miniature version of a remote planet (in the titular Wolf 359 system) in his laboratory. Due to the miniaturization, this artificial world knows an accelerated development, thus allowing Meridith to study its evolution through an electronic microscope, and to observe the birth of archaic life forms on its surface. However, soon a mysterious lifeform evolves along with the developing experiment. It is aware of the scientist's presence‚Äîeven acting aggressively towards him at some point. Manifesting by night in the absence of light, the creature takes a physical shape into the laboratory itself, destroying all life inside it, including plants, a colony of ants and a couple of guinea pigs. Becoming aware of the situation, Meridith weighs the value of his experiment versus the possible dangers. He resorts to firing his lab assistant and sending his wife back home, in order to keep them away from harm. Pursuing his studies, the scientist soon discovers the creature inhabiting the planet seems to be a manifestation of the planet itself, similar to its collective mind, and bent on destruction. As the evolution of the miniature world progresses, Meridith observes a reproduction of the darkest moments of Earth's history at its surface (including the development of nuclear weapons). Lowering his guard one night, the scientist is suddenly attacked by the creature; he is, however, saved by his wife. She returns from home at the right moment to breach the miniature planet's containment cell, causing its atmosphere to escape so that the creature is destroyed along with the planet. In the epilogue, Meridith can be seen recording his final report on Wolf 359, saying that the experiment is over and the planet destroyed. Yet he also mentions that the experience could be successfully recreated in the future, if only one could find a better planet. Closing narration There is a theory that Earth and sun and galaxy and all the known universes are only a dust mote on some policeman's uniform in some gigantic superworld. Couldn't we be under some supermicroscope, right now?

As a performer he has recorded music by composers from Antoine Busnois to Silvestre Revueltas, and as a scholar has published research on composers from the Renaissance to the 20th century. He is famed among classical musicians and aficionados for his increasingly influential theory that most of Bach's choral works were sung with only one singer per choral line. Rifkin argued: \\"So long as we define 'chorus' in the conventional modern sense, then Bach's chorus, with few exceptions, simply did not exist.\\" He is best known by the general public, however, for having played a central role in the ragtime revival in the 1970s, with the three albums he recorded of Scott Joplin's works for Nonesuch Records. Rifkin and Joplin A 1901 edition of Joplin's work Rifkin's Joplin albums (the first of which was Scott Joplin: Piano Rags in November 1970 on the classical label Nonesuch)‚Äîwhich were presented as classical music recordings‚Äîwere critically acclaimed, commercially successful and led to other artists exploring the ragtime genre. It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch's first million-selling record. The Billboard \\"Best-Selling Classical LPs\\" chart for September 28, 1974 has the record at No. 5, with the follow-up \\"Volume 2\\" at No. 4, and a combined set of both volumes at No. 3. Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra), but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. Rifkin's work as a revivalist of Joplin's work immediately preceded the adaptation of Joplin's music by Marvin Hamlisch for the film The Sting (1973).Kronenberger, John. \\"The Ragtime Revival-A Belated Ode to Composer Scott Joplin\\", New York Times, August 11, 1974 In 1979 Alan Rich in the New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on record Nonesuch Records \\"created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival.\\" In August 1990, Rifkin recorded a CD for the Decca label (catalog number 425 225) featuring rags by two of the other major composers of ragtime, Joseph Lamb and James Scott, and also tango compositions by the Brazilian composer Ernesto Nazareth. Rifkin and Bach=Bach's vocal scoring Rifkin is best known to classical musicians for his thesis that much of Johann Sebastian Bach's vocal music, including the St Matthew Passion, was performed with only one singer per voice part, an idea generally rejected by his peers when he first proposed it in 1981. In the twenty-first century the idea has become influential, despite still not achieving consensus in the field. The conductor Andrew Parrott wrote a book arguing for the position (The Essential Bach Choir; Boydell Press, 2000; as an appendix the book includes the original paper that Rifkin began to present to the American Musicological Society in 1981, a presentation he was unable to complete because of a strong audience reaction). Bach scholars as Daniel Melamed,Daniel R. Melamed, Hearing Bach's Passions, Oxford University Press, 2005, Chapters 1 and 2, David SchulenbergDavid Schulenberg, Music of the Baroque, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 192: \\"...it appears increasingly likely that most of Bach's vocal works were composed for a 'chorus' comprising a single singer on each part. Orchestral parts, too, were rarely doubled, except for the violin and continuo lines. Thus what many modern listeners have come to regard as massive choral movements for large choir and orchestra are in fact examples of chamber music for vocal soloists and a small instrumental ensemble.\\" and John ButtJohn Butt, Bach‚Äôs Dialogue with Modernity: Perspectives on the Passions, Cambridge University Press, 2010, Chapter 4, have argued in its favor. Furthermore, Rifkin and Parrott are no longer the only notable conductors to adopt the approach in performance. Among the conductors and ensembles to record and perform music of Bach using some form of the vocal scoring argued for by Rifkin are John Butt with the Dunedin Consort (Magnificat, Cantata no. 63, Mass in B minor in Rifkin's critical edition of the work, discussed below, the St. John Passion, and St Matthew Passion), Konrad Jungh√§nel (Mass in B minor, several cantatas, St. John Passion, and the motets), Sigiswald Kuijken (Mass in B minor, St. John Passion, St Matthew Passion, Christmas Oratorio, and the beginning of a cycle of the complete Bach cantatas), Paul McCreesh (St Matthew Passion, Magnificat, Easter Oratorio, and several cantatas), Monica Huggett (St. John Passion), Eric Milnes, who has begun recording the complete cantatas cycle with one singer per part, Marc Minkowski (Mass in B minor), Lars Ulrik Mortensen (Mass in B minor), Philippe Pierlot with the Ricercar Consort (Magnificat, masses and cantatas), Jeffrey Thomas (who has also often used multi-voice choirs), Jos van Veldhoven (Mass in B minor, St Matthew Passion), Matteo Messori (Christmas Oratorio, cantatas, motets), and Peter Kooy in the motets. Rifkin himself has recorded Bach's Mass in B minor‚Äîhis 1981 Nonesuch recording won the 1982‚Äì83 Gramophone Award in the Choral category‚ÄîMagnificat, and cantatas nos. 8, 12, 51, 56, 78, 80, 82, 99, 106, 131, 140, 147, 158, 172, 182, 202, 209, 216, and others, for the Nonesuch, Mainach, L'Oiseau-lyre, and Dorian labels, all with his Bach Ensemble and various singers. Other Bach scholarship One of Rikfin's widely accepted findings, which he published in 1975, is that Bach's St Matthew Passion was first performed on Good Friday, 1727, not 1729 as was previously believed.Joshua Rifkin, \\"The Chronology of Bach's Saint Matthew Passion,\\" Musical Quarterly (61 (1975), pp. 360‚Äì87 Rifkin's scholarly critical edition of Bach's Mass in B minor was published by Breitkopf and H√§rtel in November 2006. It is the first edition to follow strictly Bach's final version from 1748 to 1750, not intermixing readings from the 1733 Missa (the first version of the Kyrie and Gloria), and posits novel solutions to removing edits made posthumously by Bach's son C.P.E. Bach. Rifkin has done extensive research on the orchestral suites of Bach, in particular arguing in detail that No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067, is based on an earlier version in A minor in which the solo instrument was not the flute.Joshua Rifkin, \\"The B-Minor Flute Suite Deconstructed\\" in Gregory Butler (ed.), Bach Perspectives, nr 6: J. S. Bach's Concerted Ensemble Music, The Ouverture 2007: University of Illinois Press¬ª, pp. 1‚Äì98, Rifkin has, further, created reconstructions of J.S. Bach's posited Oboe Concerti: for oboe, strings and continuo in D minor, from BWV 35, 156, 1056 and 1059; in A major for oboe d'amore, strings and continuo from BWV 1055; in E-flat major for oboe, strings and continuo from BWV 49, 169 and 1053. All the original movements are keyboard settings. They reflect the Baroque oboe idiom convincingly. In this form, they evince the influence of the Venetian school, notably Marcello, Corelli and Vivaldi.Technical notes in the CD cover of Rifkin's own recording: Pro Arte digital CDD 153. In a paper published in the Bach-Jahrbuch in 2000, Rifkin argued that the cantata Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft, BWV 50 was not written by Bach, but by an as-yet unidentified composer.Rifkin, Joshua (2000). \\"Siegesjubel und Satzfehler. Zum Problem von \\"Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft\\" (BWV 50)\\". Bach-Jahrbuch 86: 67‚Äì86 Studies and career Rifkin studied with Vincent Persichetti in the Music Division at the Juilliard School and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1964. He also studied with Gustave Reese at New York University (1964‚Äì1966), at the University of G√∂ttingen (1966‚Äì1967), and later with Arthur Mendel, Lewis Lockwood, Milton Babbitt, and Ernst Oster at Princeton University where he received his M.F.A. in 1969. He also worked with Karlheinz Stockhausen at Darmstadt in 1961 and 1965. Rifkin has taught at several universities, including Brandeis University (1970‚Äì1982), Harvard, Yale, and is currently Professor of Music and Fellow of the University Professors at Boston University. He is noted for his research in the field of Renaissance and Baroque music: scholarship by Rifkin has examined the authorship and chronology of music attributed to Josquin des Prez; Renaissance music manuscripts; the motet around 1500; and music of Heinrich Sch√ºtz. He has also published research about Anton Webern. As a conductor and keyboard soloist, he has appeared with the English Chamber Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Victorian State Symphony, and Israel Camerata Jerusalem. He has led operatic productions at Theater Basel in Switzerland and the Bayerische Staatsoper, Munich. He has recorded music of Handel, Mozart, and Haydn with the Concertgebouw Chamber Orchestra and Capella Coloniensis. As a choral conductor he has recorded motets of Adrian Willaert with the Boston Camerata Chamber Singers, and music of the Medici Codex with the Dutch ensemble Capella Pratensis; that 2011 CD, titled Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope, won a Diapason d'Or.Vivat Leo! Music for a Medici Pope SACD Rifkin (Challenge) 2011 Among his works as a composer are the two Winter pieces for violin resp. piano both written in 1961. The Winter piece for violin was premiered by Paul Zukofsky in 1962. Work in non-classical music In the 1960s, Rifkin created arrangements for Judy Collins on her albums In My Life and Wildflowers. He performed with the Even Dozen Jug Band (along with David Grisman, Maria Muldaur, Stefan Grossman, and John Sebastian, among others) and made a recording of his humorous re-imaginings of music by Lennon and McCartney in the style of the 18th century, notably Bach, known as The Baroque Beatles Book and recently reissued on CD. In a related vein, Rifkin sang the countertenor solo in the premiere performance of the spoof cantata Iphigenia in Brooklyn by P. D. Q. Bach (Peter Schickele).

The Foundation carries out various projects for exchange between the Republic of Korea and foreign countries to cultivate mutual understanding.  History  Amid the Republic of Korea's rapid economic growth from the late 1970s to the 1980s as well as the country's concomitant democratization and the upheaval in the international community after the Cold War, an overhaul of Korea's foreign policy strategy became inevitable. Having demonstrated its enhanced capabilities by successfully hosting the 10th Asian Games in 1986 and the 24th Summer Olympics in 1988 in Seoul had a lasting impact on how the world viewed Korea. Subsequently, the idea for an international exchange organization was born that would serve as a single point of contact and support exchange projects in various fields. In September 1989, the Korean parliament began an official debate about the establishment of the Korea Foundation, which eventually led to the adoption of the Korea Foundation Act on December 14, 1991.  Organization  The Korea Foundation is affiliated with Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which oversees three affiliate organizations ‚Äì the Korea Foundation, the Overseas Korean Foundation (OKF), and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). All three are dedicated to advancing Korea's diplomatic relations with the rest of the world. The Korea Foundation currently has 4 bureaus, under which 120 staff work in 13 departments. Its headquarters and the KF Global Center are located in Seoul. In addition, the foundation maintains 7 overseas offices on 3 continents, including in Beijing, Berlin, Tokyo, Moscow, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Hanoi.  Establishment of the Korea-Central Asia Cooperation Forum Secretariat  In 2017, the Korea Foundation launched two new initiatives. In July 2017, the Korea-Central Asia Cooperation Forum Secretariat commenced its work. It serves as a platform for the nations of Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan from which to develop practical and future-oriented mutual cooperation. In doing so, it aims to aid the implementation and diversification of initiatives handled by the Korea-Central Asia Cooperation Forum, the multilateral consultative group launched in 2007. The Secretariat is coordinated by the Korea Foundation, which oversees projects in a variety of fields, including medicine, tourism, arts and culture, youth leadership forums, and water management.  Establishment of the ASEAN Culture House (ACH)  Since September 2017, the Korea Foundation is in charge of operating the newly established ASEAN Culture House (ACH) in Busan. The vision of this venue is to provide a lively platform to enhance Koreans‚Äô understanding of the cultures and societies of ASEAN countries. The ACH is a venue for cultural exchanges and networking between Koreans and ASEAN residents in Korea, and facilitates collaboration between Korea's local and regional governments in introducing ASEAN culture. The plan to establish the ACH was one of the outcomes of the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit held in Busan in 2014 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the ASEAN-ROK Dialogue Relations.  Relocation of Korea Foundation headquarters  In July 2018, the Korea Foundation relocated its main office to Seogwipo, Jeju Province, pursuant to the Special Act on the Construction of and Support of Innovation Cities Following Relocation of Public Agencies.  Activities = Support for Korean studies  The Korea Foundation extends support to international universities for the establishment of Korean studies professorships, employment of contract faculty members, and appointment of visiting professors to advance Korea-related education and scholarship. Under an array of programs, including fellowships for graduate and postdoctoral studies, as well as fellowships for field research and Korean language training, the foundation assists graduate students and scholars in their research endeavors. The foundation also organizes Korean studies workshops for non-Korean educators to aid their Korea-related classroom instruction and develop cooperative networks. In addition, the foundation implements various special projects to promote Korean studies and foster the next generation of Koreanists.

This family includes an enzyme known as RPE65 which is abundantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium where it catalyzed the formation of 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinyl esters. Carotenoids such as beta- carotene, lycopene, lutein and beta-cryptoxanthine are produced in plants and certain bacteria, algae and fungi, where they function as accessory photosynthetic pigments and as scavengers of oxygen radicals for photoprotection. They are also essential dietary nutrients in animals. Carotenoid oxygenases cleave a variety of carotenoids into a range of biologically important products, including apocarotenoids in plants that function as hormones, pigments, flavours, floral scents and defence compounds, and retinoids in animals that function as vitamins, visual pigments and signalling molecules. Examples of carotenoid oxygenases include: * Beta- carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (BCDO1; ) from animals, which cleaves beta- carotene symmetrically at the central double bond to yield two molecules of retinal. * Beta-carotene-9',10'-dioxygenase (BCDO2) from animals, which cleaves beta-carotene asymmetrically to apo-10'-beta-carotenal and beta- ionone, the latter being converted to retinoic acid. Lycopene is also oxidatively cleaved. * 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase from plants, which cleaves 9-cis xanthophylls to xanthoxin, a precursor of the hormone abscisic acid. * Apocarotenoid-15,15'-oxygenase from bacteria and cyanobacteria, which converts beta-apocarotenals rather than beta-carotene into retinal. This protein has a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure with four hisitidines that hold the iron active centre. * Retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (RPE65) from vertebrates which is important for the production of 11-cis retinal during visual pigment regeneration.

It first aired on 14 November 1964, during the second season. It was remade under the same title in 1995. Leonard Nimoy appeared in both versions. Opening narrationPlot Defence attorney Thurman Cutler is coaxed out of retirement to take the case for the defence of a robot, Adam Link, against the charge that it willfully murdered its creator Dr. Charles Link. Placed on trial, Adam sits alone in the courtroom, apart from his only friend Nina Link, the professor's niece. Testimony reveals that once Adam was activated he began a trial and error process of learning like that of a child. This suggests that some of his later acts, construed as violent, were in fact a matter of the mechanical man not understanding his own strength, or subtle or vague areas of human thought and emotions. Unfortunately the defence never fully recovers from the revelation that Adam read the novel Frankenstein while absorbing all the books in the Doc's library, and the judge pronounces the robot guilty, even though the Doc's death was accidental. Before Adam can be hauled away to be dismantled, he breaks free of his bonds outside the courthouse to throw a child aside from the path of an oncoming truck, but is smashed into scrap metal in the process. Cutler notes sardonically: \\"That terrible monster won't ever harm anybody again.\\" Closing narrationBackground The Adam Link stories first appeared in Amazing Stories magazine between 1939 and 1942, written by Eando Binder, a pseudonym used jointly by brothers Earl and Otto Binder, (though only Otto wrote the Adam Link stories). Unusually for a robot at that time, Adam was a sympathetic character with genuine emotions, and the tales were narrated by Adam himself. \\"I Robot\\" first appeared in Amazing Stories Vol. 13/no. 1 (January 1939), and was continued in \\"The Trial of Adam Link, Robot\\" (Amazing Stories vol. 13/no. 7 (July 1939)). The original story ends with Adam intending to turn himself off, believing he will not be allowed a trial, and although innocent, writing his confession. The Outer Limits episode is based on these first two stories. In this TV adaptation, writer Robert C. Dennis invented the character of attorney Thurman Cutler, greatly expanded the role of a nameless newspaperman, mentioned only in passing in Binder's original story, into Judson Ellis and changed Prof. Link's relative to a woman.The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), page 333 The ending was also changed so that Adam is found guilty, ending up as scrap metal when saving a child from being hit by a truck outside the courthouse; in the original \\"Trial\\" story, he is vindicated and set free. Unlike his TV counterpart, the original Adam Link was a six-foot-tall android. In the following four stories (\\"Adam Link in Business\\", Vol. 14/no. 1, Jan 1940; \\"Adam Link's Vengeance\\", Vol. 14/no. 2,Feb 1940; \\"Adam Link, Robot Detective\\", Vol. 14/no. 5, May 1940; and \\"Adam Link, Champion Athlete\\", Vol.14/no. 7, Jul 1940) he amasses a fortune as a business consultant, enough to fund a rejuvenation of slum areas and build a \\"female\\" robot named Eve to be his wife, is betrayed by a friend who uses him to rob banks, becomes a private detective to find the person who framed Eve for 3 murders and performs a series of athletic challenges. The later stories, (\\"Adam Link fights a War\\", Vol.14/no. 12, Dec 1940; \\"Adam Link in the Past\\", Vol.15.no. 2,Feb 1941; \\"Adam Link Faces A Revolt\\", Vol. 15/no. 5, May 1941; and \\"Adam Link Saves The World\\", Vol.16/no.4,Apr 1942) were more outlandish SF adventure tales with Adam and Eve fighting evil robots and aliens in defense of the human race. All 10 stories were adapted by Otto Binder into a 174-page novel Adam Link: Robot, and first published in the US by Paperback Library in 1965. \\"I, Robot\\" first appeared in color comic strip form in 1954 in EC Comics Weird Science-Fantasy #27, followed by \\"The Trial of Adam Link\\" in #28 and \\"Adam Link in Business\\" in #29, all adapted by Albert Feldstein, with art by Joe Orlando. Later an irregular series of black and white Adam Link comic strips, written by Otto Binder and drawn by Joe Orlando, were published in Warren Magazines' Creepy between 1965 and 1967 (\\"I, Robot\\", #2 Apr 1965; \\"The Trial Of Adam Link!\\", #4 Aug 1965; \\"Adam Link in Business\\", #6 Dec 1965; \\"Adam Link's Mate!\\", #8 Apr 1966; \\"Adam Link's Vengeance!\\", #9 Jun 1966; \\"Adam Link, Robot Detective!\\", #12 Dec 1966; 'Adam Link Gangster!\\", #13 Feb 1967; \\"Adam Link, Champion Athlete\\", #15 Aug 1967).

Extending along the Pawcatuck River and south of West Broad Street (United States Route 1), the area includes a large brick mill complex on the banks of the river, and a neighborhood of well-preserved worker housing on the road grid to its west. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. and Description and history The Pawcatuck area of Stonington developed, along with adjacent Westerly, Rhode Island, as a port and shipbuilding center in the early 19th century. Several shipyards lined the western (Stonington) bank of the river, whose worker housing formed the early construction of worker housing on the residential grid to the west. The arrival of the railroad in 1837 led the area to also develop an industrial base, with a foundry established in 1851 and a machine factory in 1857. This plant eventually specialized in the manufacture of printing presses, and was joined later in the 19th century by a textile mill. Worker housing of all types was built nearby, both by the business owners and other parties, to meet the housing demand for the workers employed in these businesses. Worker's house on Mechanic Street The historic district is in size, bounded on the north by West Broad Street and the east by the Pawcatuck River. It includes a large waterfront mill complex, with 7 major buildings over a area, and a smaller company office building. It extends westward from the mill as far as Courtland Street, the area beyond the railroad tracks consisting mainly of worker housing. The buildings in the residential area are stylistically diverse, including examples of Greek Revival housing from the shipyard period, and tenement-style housing built later in the 19th century.

It was premiered by the Beethoven Quartet and is dedicated to the composer Vissarion Shebalin. When Shostakovich began writing his Second String Quartet he had already completed eight of his fifteen symphonies. He was also half-way through his life. Another thirteen quartets however remained to be composed, and they would come in rapid succession. Structure The work has four movements: Playing time is approximately 35 minutes, one minute shorter than his longest, String Quartet No. 15. The overture that the work begins with is in sonata form, traditional for the first movement of such a work. The music is strong, forceful, and animated. This strong tone is subdued by the lyrical, wandering mood of the recitative. The first violin leads a slow, distressed line of music over soft seventh chords, and eventually finds calm in the romance. The finale works around to and ends in A minor, meaning that the quartet ends in the parallel minor to the opening major key.

Presentation Brothers live and work in Ireland, England, USA, Canada, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Grenada with about 100 Brothers throughout these countries. The Brothers take three promises‚Äîpoverty, chastity and obedience‚Äîand live together in small groups called \\"communities\\". The motto of the congregation was adopted from that of the Jesuits: \\"Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam\\" or \\"For the Greater Glory of God\\". Brothers bear the initials F.P.M. (Fratres Presentationis Mariae). The expressed mission of the Presentation Brothers is to \\"form Christ in the Young\\" and traditionally they have worked to achieve this through education. Today Presentation Brothers work in a wider range of ministries including with the homeless, elderly, disadvantaged youth and the Roma people. In 2007 the Presentation Brothers opened new missions in Slovakia and Nigeria and an Advocacy Office for the poor in Geneva. History The Presentation Brothers were founded by Edmund Rice in the city of Waterford, Ireland in 1802. Edmund Rice Edmund Rice was born in the townland of Westcourt near the village of Callan in County Kilkenny on June 1, 1762. His parents, Robert and Margaret Tierney Murphy Rice, were prosperous farmers. The family spoke Irish but would also have spoken English in order to conduct their business affairs. Ireland in 1762, was under British rule and the anti-Catholic Penal Laws prevented a Catholic from receiving an education. Rice received his primary school education from a ‚Äúhedge school‚Äù. These were illegal schools established by travelling teachers. The laws were relaxed at the time of Edmund‚Äôs childhood and eventually he attended an academy in Kilkenny.\\"Edmund Rice\\", Presentation Brothers At the age of 17, Rice was apprenticed to his uncle, Michael Rice, in Waterford city. Waterford was one of the busiest ports in the world at the time, second only to Hamburg.\\"Edmund Ignatius Rice\\", Edmund Rice International Heritage Centres, Ltd. Seven years later, Edmund‚Äôs uncle signed the business over to him. A shrewd businessman, Rice invested his growing fortune in land and property. At the age of 25, Edmund married the daughter of a local businessman, Mary Elliott. Mary was killed in a horse riding accident and the baby she was carrying was born with a handicap. The baby was christened Mary and Edmund‚Äôs step-sister Joan took charge of looking after her. After his wife‚Äôs death, Rice became more religious and he developed a devotion to St. Teresa of Avila. He also became involved in charitable works and regularly visited the poor of Waterford providing financial assistance to those in need. In 1798, Edmund helped the Presentation Sisters open a convent and school for girls in Waterford. Rice decided to try something similar for young boys. In 1800 he began to teach youngsters at his business premises in Barronstrand Street with the assistance of some volunteers. The following year, Rice converted some stables on New Street into a makeshift school. His friends and colleagues described it as an act of \\"mad folly\\". Two men, Patrick Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, arrived to help. The three men lived in temporary accommodation over the horse stable as they waited for a monastery to be built. The Congregations In the early days, when Edmund first began to attract followers to his way of life, these formed themselves into a small group of companions. They lived together in community and began to follow an adaptation of the Presentation Sisters‚Äô Rule. The Holy See had already approved of this Rule when Edmund and his followers began to use their adaptation of it to guide their first steps along the path of religious life. In 1832 the Rule of the Religious Brothers, approved by the Pope, was adopted. As Superior General of a Pontifical Institute, Rice could now move brothers between dioceses without having to seek each local bishop's permission.The Presentation Brothers: A Centenary in Canada 1910-2010 The majority of brothers accepted the new Rule and went on to become the Congregation of Christian Brothers. Today there are Irish Christian Brothers in 17 different countries. Brother Michael Augustine Riordan, and a few of the Cork Brothers decided to remain under the jurisdiction local diocesan bishop and continued to live by the Presentation Rule. They became a Pontifical Institute in 1889. The Presentation Brothers have a particular devotion to Our Lady of Good Counsel. Expansion In 1876 the first Presentation school outside Ireland opened in England. Like the Irish Christian Brothers, the Presentation Brothers have followed the missionary example of the great Irish missionaries Brendan and Colmcille, responding as they believe Edmund Rice would have, to different needs as they encounter them in different regions and different circumstances. The main foundations have been: U.S.A. 1843; England 1876; Canada 1910; West Indies 1946; Ghana 1968; Peru 1969; Geneva 2007; Nigeria 2007; Slovakia 2007. Headquarters The Presentation Brothers' Generalate is located at Mount St. Joseph in Cork, Ireland. Provinces There are about 350 Presentation Brothers living in 22 communities in 7 countries around the world.

The highway runs from Elk Mills east to MD 279 near Elkton in northeastern Cecil County. MD 277 was constructed west of MD 316 in the early 1920s. The highway was planned to be extended in both directions in the late 1940s. However, neither extension occurred until MD 277 was extended east to MD 279 in the mid-1980s. Route description View east along MD 277 at MD 316 near Elk Mills MD 277 begins at an arbitrary point on Elk Mills Road in the community of Elk Mills about west of the entrance to Elk Mills Community Park. Elk Mills Road continues west as a county highway toward MD 213. MD 277 heads east as a two-lane undivided road and has a grade crossing of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The highway crosses over Big Elk Creek and passes along the northern edge of the Elk Mills Quarry before intersecting Appleton Road, which heads south as MD 316. MD 277 continues east as Fletchwood Road, which briefly parallels the West Branch Christina River as it passes through Fletchwood Community Park. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 279 (Elkton Road) northeast of the town of Elkton and just west of the Delaware state line. History MD 277 westbound past eastern terminus at MD 279 near Elkton Elk Mills Road was constructed as a concrete road from Appleton Road (then named Barksdale Road) to the current western terminus in 1921. By 1934, MD 277 was proposed to be widened from . In 1945, Cecil County requested the highway be extended west to MD 280 (now MD 213) and east to MD 279 in the first year of a three-year post-World War II construction program. The extensions of MD 277 were planned to be placed under contract in 1947. However, the highway from MD 316 to MD 279 was later proposed to be paved by the state but remain a county highway, and the highway west to MD 280 disappeared from improvement plans. MD 277's old bridge across Big Elk Creek was replaced with a steel beam bridge in 1968, and the highway was paved with bituminous concrete in 1973. Almost 40 years after it was proposed, MD 277 was extended east to MD 279 when Fletchwood Road was transferred from county maintenance in a May 16, 1984, road transfer agreement. The Fletchwood Road portion of the highway was reconstructed between 1990 and 1992.

It comprises the forty-first and forty-second episodes of the show, in the second season. Part I was first aired on November 21, 1964; Part II on November 28, 1964. Part I Four U.S. Army soldiers, with nothing in common other than having served in the same combat zone and been shot in the head with bullets cast from fragments of a meteorite, cheat death and begin working on a mysterious project. Intelligence officer Adam Ballard attempts to unravel the mystery behind the strange behavior of the men, who have each attained I.Q.s of over 200. :Opening narration: In the troubled places of the world, the Devil's Hunter finds rare game. For man-made savagery is only the instrument for a secret terror stirring from its dark place of ambush... Lt. Minns (Steve Ihnat) is shot in the head. Rescued, he is flown to the U.S. and is operated on by American doctors. Adam Ballard (Robert Duvall) watches the operation. Minns begins to show the same brainwave patterns that three other men have shown‚Äîeach one shot in the head by a bullet made from a meteorite fragment. Ballard explains to his superior (Ted De Corsia) that he believes Earth has been invaded, and that these four men are in league with extraterrestrials. As Ballard investigates, he discovers that the men are building a starship. He also discovers that Minns is recruiting children to take with him on a long trip. All the children are handicapped in some way‚Äîblind, deaf/mute, paralyzed in the legs, and so on. Ballard is afraid these helpless children are to be victims of alien abduction. He finds the location where the ship is being built, but the men within are sealed off by a force field that nothing can penetrate. : Closing narration: Man looks up at the stars, and dreams his futile dreams. Child of the universe, his toys are ignorance, his games, fantasy. Not even master of his own fate, it is the Devil's Puppeteer who stretches his fingers to answer the question: What will happen next? Part II : Opening narration: The Earth, tumbling grain of sand in the darkness of unending space, plays host to a strange and awful guest, unsought, uninvited, possessor of fearsome power, purveyor of dark deed, a relentless traveler on the road to its mysterious goal... Lt. Minns arrives with the children, and ushers them into the ship, suggesting, \\"help each other ... learn to help each other\\". Ballard begs the men to fight the \\"Charlie\\" in their heads, turn off the force field, and not kidnap the children. Minns explains the project's purpose. The children are not to be examined, they are to be helped‚Äîthe alien intelligence behind this project originates from a planet inhabited by a highly advanced, peaceful extraterrestrial civilization that has become sterile and are now unable to perpetuate their species. Therefore, they have chosen several handicapped/disinherited children that would not miss their life on Earth, to become the inheritors of their legacy, and thus they will be taken to a new world, where their handicaps will be healed. Indeed, the special air circulating within the starship has even now begun to heal them. Minns turns off the force field, and invites Ballard inside the ship. Ballard sees what Minns says is true. He exits, and Minns gives the men a choice‚Äîstay on Earth or go with him and the children. They elect to leave for a new world and a new life. : Closing narration: The Inheritors are on their way. In a universe of billions of stars, there are places of love and happiness. On this Earth, in this spot, magic settled for a moment. Wonder touched a few lives, and a few odd pieces fell smoothly into the jigsaw of Creation. Production Story editor Seeleg Lester was determined to feature a benevolent \\"invasion\\" in the story, because, as he says, \\"Monsters coming to destroy the world is garbage. We had the god-damndest trouble with ABC because they didn't understand the story. I told Ben: 'We'll fight for this. If they want monsters, we'll put in the other shows.' And when ABC saw the final-draft script, they told us, 'You know, this could make a damned good story ‚Äî let's not fuck it up!' That illustrates the kind of mentality the network had.\\" Lieutenant Minns' climactic monologue in Part II was improvised by actor Steve Ihnat, based loosely on the original scripted lines. Actress Morgan Brittany later said, \\"He put it into his own words... not a word-for-word memorization. It just came out so beautifully. To me, it made the whole show... You've never in your life seen crew members so mesmerized. Just silence on the set.\\" Director James Goldstone had a hard time dramatizing the plywood spaceship rising into the air at the end of the story: \\"We couldn't do it optically, and didn't have the time or the money to shoot it any other way, so Ken Pesch and I just dollied the camera back until we were off the stage, then tilted up to the sky.\\" Cast * Robert Duvall ‚Äì as Adam Ballard * Donald Harron ‚Äì as Art Harris * Steve Ihnat ‚Äì as Lt.

Background The Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD) Board of Education, led by Superintendent Jim Sweeney, created several charter schools in the district, the most controversial of which is located on the campus of Sacramento High School. To create a charter school at Sacramento High School, the SCUSD Board made the controversial decision to close Sacramento High School. They then issued a charter to St. Hope, a not-for- profit community development corporation founded by former NBA player Kevin Johnson. St. Hope opened its charter school on September 2, 2003. Some parents, along with the teachers' union, sued the district because it felt the creation of the charter school was not in compliance with California state law. The court found that SCUSD indeed violated the charter school law. A consent decree was entered into by the plaintiffs, St. Hope, and SCUSD. and the settlement required that SCUSD create a public high school for the attendance area served by Sacramento High School. To date several unsuccessful attempts have been made to establish a replacement program for Sacramento High school.

It is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the history of the Americas. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.  Historical development  Itneg potters in northern Philippines. The person on the right is biologically male and is wearing women's clothes, a common practice in pre-colonial Philippines. Scholars studying the history of Mexico's indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The Handbook of Middle American Indians, edited by archeologist Robert Wauchope was involved with creating a multiple volumes on Mesoamerican ethnohistory, published as Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, appearing in 1973.Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973. At the time that the volumes were published, \\"both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon.\\"Howard F. Cline, \\"Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory\\" in Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, vol. 12, p. 3. The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources \\"which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory.\\"Cline, \\"Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory\\", p. 4. In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the New Philology. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the history of Mexico that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.James Lockhart, \\"Charles Gibson and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico\\" in Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology. Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178Restall, Matthew, \\"A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History\\", Latin American Research Review - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113‚Äì134 In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the Indian Claims Commission. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist Howard F. Cline, who was commissioned to work on Florida Indians and Jicarilla Apache. The field has also reached into Melanesia, where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. Michael Harkin argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.Michael E. Harkin, \\"Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory,\\" Social Science History, Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128 Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group. They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code. Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related methodologies in that it embraces emic perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of Native American peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past. The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically \\"the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material,\\" as described by William N. Fenton. Later, James Axtell described ethnohistory as \\"the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories.\\" Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. Ed Schieffelin asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea, 3 Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as \\"a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow.\\" He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a holistic, diachronic approach that is most rewarding when it can be \\"joined to the memories and voices of living people.\\" Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century. Commenting on the possibilities for ethnohistory studies of traditional societies in Europe (such as Ireland), Guy Beiner observed that \\"pioneering figures in the development of ethnohistory ‚Ä¶ have argued that this approach could be fruitfully applied to the study of Western societies, but such initiatives have not picked up and very few explicitly designated ethnohistories of European communities have been written to date\\".Guy Beiner, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster (Oxford University Press, 2018), p.10.

Opening narration :Since the first day that Man stared up at the stars and saw other worlds, there has been no more haunting question than this: What will we find there? Will there be other creatures, and will they be like us? Or when that ancient dream comes true, will it turn into a nightmare? Will we find, on some distant, frozen planet, an alien life of unimaginable horror? Plot It is the year 2025; fourteen years previously wealthy research academic Henderson James had Captain Karl Emmet smuggle a Megasoid to Earth.http://wearecontrollingtransmission.blogspot.com/2011/03/duplicate- man.html It is illegal to possess a Megasoid as they are highly dangerous, always thinking about killing, unless in a reproductive cycle, which this one now is. When the Megasoid escapes to hide amongst the stuffed exhibits at a nearby space zoo, James, lacking the courage to track it down and kill it himself, has a clone of himself illegally made for the purpose by clone bootlegger Basil Jerichau. Strict guidelines govern the production of these \\"duplicates\\", which must be destroyed before vestigial memory renders them indistinguishable from the originals. The clone botches its mission at the zoo and the Megasoid gets away after informing the clone that he is a duplicate. A trace of memory leads the duplicate James to the home of Captain Emmet. Emmet panics and tries to phone the police; the duplicate James knocks him out cold; and, accumulating more of the real Henderson James‚Äô memories as he goes, he finds his way to \\"his\\" own home. The wounded Megasoid returns to the James home and hides in the bushes. Duplicate James meets the real James‚Äô wife, Laura, who sees in him a more youthful version of her husband before he became obsessed with studying the Megasoid. The real James has gone to bribe Emmet into killing the duplicate James once he has completed his mission. Returning home, he leaves Emmett on the grounds to await duplicate James‚Äô arrival. Unfortunately, Emmett is attacked and killed by the Megasoid. Entering his home, the real James meets his duplicate. Seeing a more compassionate version of himself gives him the courage to kill the alien, as he believes Laura would be happier with the duplicate. Henderson James and his duplicate hunt for the Megasoid. James shoots the alien after it has torn his duplicate apart. He discovers that his clone was dying all the time, from a timed release of poison into his blood stream; a precaution provided by the clone bootlegger. A less cynical Henderson James is now reconciled with his wife. Closing narration > \\"In all the universe, can there be creatures more strange than the species > called Man?

But the > thing which distinguishes him is his ability to learn from his mistakes.\\" Background Adapted from the short story 'Goodnight, Mr James' by Clifford D. Simak, first published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in March 1951, later published as \\"The Night of the Puudly\\" in 1964 in a collection of Simak's short stories. The original story begins and ends with the \\"duplicate\\" of Henderson James, who awakes on a street in an unnamed city with a mission to kill an alien called a Puudly. Using telepathy the Puudly informs \\"duplicate\\" James of his origins as a clone, before James kills it. James then decides to attempt to talk the real Henderson James into letting him live. The clone of James arrives at Henderson James' home just after the gardener (whose job it is to kill the clone) has mistakenly killed the real James instead. As the duplicate prepares to become the real James, he receives a phone call from Allen, the clone bootlegger, who advises him of the poison: \\"Like a time bomb. No antidote for it even if he found out somehow.\\" The duplicate says \\"It was good of you to let me know.\\" Allen replies, \\"Glad to, Goodnight, Mr. James.\\" (source - The Outer Limits: The Official Companion (1986), page 343.)

It reaches to the end of the imagination, then beyond into the mysteries of dreams, hoping always to convert even the dreams into reality, for the greater well-being of all mankind‚Ä¶ Plot Scientist Eric Plummer comes under the sinister influence of a creature from outer space, capable of materializing in human form, but lacking human emotions. As a prelude for the invasion of Earth by his kind, an extraterrestrial being, Ikar, studies the human race. The one thing he cannot comprehend is emotion. Meanwhile, obsessed scientist Plummer is nearing a nervous breakdown, trying to complete a magnetic disintegrator that will convert matter into pure energy. As Plummer's weapon would aid Ikar's invasion force if completed, Ikar makes a deal with Plummer (who is unaware of Ikar's purpose). He will help Plummer complete the invention by offering his technical knowledge to provide the new equations necessary for the invention's completion in exchange for the scientist's ability to feel emotions for a \\"test drive\\". It is revealed that Ikar comes from a hive world with strictly defined roles, divorced from emotion and personal identity. Big brains (like himself) do the thinking, while soldiers do the fighting, and females produce the offspring as their only function. Due to the interference of Plummer's girlfriend, Janet Lane, Ikar is unable to control or understand his adopted emotions. This causes the experiment to backfire. The alien has great difficulty in understanding such things as love and beauty - concepts utterly foreign in his world. Ikar's behavior comes to the attention of his superiors, who dispatch soldier-forms of his species to discipline him. Meanwhile, Plummer uses Ikar's data to harness a fantastic energy source and fashions a weapon capable of destroying all life. Ikar, who has begun to experience emotions such as anger and desire for Janet, who compares Ikar's world to an ant colony. He returns the scientist's emotions to him. Ikar is now being pursued by his own species, as a threat to the planned invasion. It is revealed the aliens' homeworld is overpopulated, and they have chosen Earth to be their new home. In the end, having experienced emotions and now feeling sympathy for Plummer, Ikar kills two of the soldiers but is himself disintegrated before Plummer destroys the last soldier. In disgust, Plummer destroys his weapon, erasing all traces of his work and evidence of the aliens. Closing narration :The curious mind cannot be chained. It is a free mind, endlessly searching for the greater freedom that must eventually make every living being joyfully complete within himself; therefore at peace with himself and his neighbors.

The heavens are > a mystery only science can solve, as it penetrates the unknown.\\" Plot Four scientists, a newspaper man and a construction tycoon agree to spend 261 days in isolation in an interstellar flight simulation to planet Antheon, a world that would be a potential target for future human colonization. A \\"panic button\\" is included in case any of the subjects wants to end the simulation. However, hitting the button ends the entire simulation, and all participants will forfeit cash awards for completing the experiment. Unbeknownst to all, the experiment has been infiltrated by an extraterrestrial being, one who causes the subconscious mind of the various passengers to go amok: one of the passengers finds the doll of his deceased daughter on his bed, while another one is almost choked in his sleep by invisible hands. As months pass on board, relations between passengers become increasingly tense and uneasy, each one being faced with his own part of darkness. Horror eventually escalates with the plants of one passenger coming to life and destroying one another and the presence incarnating itself into one of the plants and making it grow into a huge, hideous creature. The extraterrestrial mind eventually reveals itself to the entire crew, claiming to be one of Antheon's indigenous inhabitants.

This is the only time this technique was used on The Outer Limits. Background Based on the short story \\"Counterweight\\" by Jerry Sohl, first published in Worlds of If magazine in November 1959. The original story traces the activity of a \\"Nilly\\" or scapegoat placed aboard Weblor II, a long term space colony flight, so that the passengers will direct all their anger and frustrations toward it and not each other. It is known to the colonists as \\"Red Mask\\" and it keeps up a level of terrorism that keeps the colonists from killing each other, and when the time is ripe dying at their hands.Schow, David J. & Jeffrey Frentzen The Outer Limits: The Official Companion, New York: Ace Books, 1986, p.301 In the original story, this measure is employed on Weblor II due to the failure of the first flight on Weblor I and its disappearance without a trace on the second flight due to the social breakdown of the passengers and crew on a long space flight. A Nilly is a human operative among the passengers who, with the collusion of the captain and key crew members, provides the \\"counterweight\\", that is, a necessary diversion of tensions between the passengers, by committing, or seeming to commit, various acts of theft and violence, climaxing with the apprehension, trial, and fake execution of the Nilly. The term \\"Nilly\\" comes from the name Gelthorpe Nill, a former counter-espionage specialist who trained Harrel Critten, the Nilly on Weblor II. Milton Krims's script turns the source story on its head. He introduces an actual alien presence, in place of a human scapegoat, in the form of a jagged light pattern and changes the genuine long space voyage into a simulated voyage that all the participants know from the start is only a simulation that can be terminated at any time by pressing a panic button. The alien then causes trouble between the passengers instead of diverting trouble toward itself as a scapegoat. When Joe Dix will not permit anyone to press the panic button the jagged Antheon light pattern occupies a plant specimen, turning into a human sized monster. After stating its concerns about the violent behavior of humans then giving a warning to stay away from the planet Antheon, it forces Joe Dix to hit the panic button, thus ending the \\"flight.\\"Schow & Frentzen The Outer Limits: The Official Companion, pp.300-1 Cast * Michael Constantine ‚Äì Joe Dix * Jacqueline Scott ‚Äì Dr. Alicia Hendrix * Sandy Kenyon ‚Äì Prof. Henry Craif * Larry Ward ‚Äì Keith Ellis * Stephen Joyce ‚Äì Harvey Branson * Shary Marshall ‚Äì Margaret O'Hara * Charles H.

Opening narration :On the fabulous spawning grounds of Man's ever-increasing knowledge of science and technology, ancient, half-forgotten legends seemingly have no place. Except one: The legend of the Gordian Knot, a knot so intricate and convoluted that no man could untie it. For there are problems so perplexing that they are seemingly impossible to solve, when Man ventures to the outer limits of his experience... Plot Jim Darcy, the pilot of an X-15 rocket- powered research aircraft, and his wife, Linda, become trapped 10 seconds ahead of their time, enabling them to watch time unfold to catch up with them at the rate of about one second every 30 minutes. In the time left before returning to synch with normal time, they see that their daughter, Janie, is about to be hit by a rolling military truck whose parking brake had not been set. Jim and Linda's inability to move objects in the \\"real\\" world prevents them from resetting the truck's parking brake or pulling young Janie out of danger. Their problem is aggravated as they soon learn that at the moment when time \\"catches up\\" with them, they must assume the exact positions they had been in five hours earlier, when this whole thing started, or they could remain in that state forever. They meet an unnamed and seemingly malevolent individual (Kay Kuter, but only identified as \\"Limbo Being\\" in the cast list) who earlier experienced the same situation, but failed to make it back in time. When it reveals that it could take from them their chances to return to reality Jim and Linda come to see just how grave their situation is: one or both could end up being stuck in this state forever. On discovering that he can move and manipulate items in the crashed plane and car, Jim hits upon a way to save his daughter from death. He removes seatbelts from his wife's car and ties them to the back wheel of the menacing truck. He then ties the other end around the brake lever so that the truck's brakes will engage the moment the time warp ends. (It was, by that time, moving at 10 mph.) With no time to spare, they hurry back to the crash site and assume their original positions. When time catches up the seatbelt pulls the emergency brake, stopping the truck. Their daughter is safe, the world returns to normal, and no one is the wiser. Closing narration :Man is forever solving the most perplexing problems as he ventures ever further into the unknown.

Founded in 1858, it is the only American museum devoted exclusively to their preservation and study. Its collection encompasses nearly one million items, including medals and paper money, as well as the world's most comprehensive library of numismatic literature. Highlights of its collection include the famous Waterloo Medallion, commemorating the defeat of Napoleon; commissioned in 1817, it took 30 years to produce. Introduction The American Numismatic Society is an organization dedicated to the study of coins, currency, medals, tokens, and related objects from all cultures, past and present. The Society's headquarters in New York City houses the foremost research collection and library specialized in numismatics in the United States. These resources are used to support research and education in numismatics, for the benefit of academic specialists, serious collectors, professional numismatists, and the interested public. It is one of a number of numismatic associations. The ANS is a constituent member of the American Council of Learned Societies. ANS should not be confused with the Colorado Springs-based American Numismatic Association. Location Originally, the ANS was located at Audubon Terrace on West 155th and Broadway in New York before relocating to Fulton Street. In 2008, the ANS moved to its current location is at 75 Varick Street by Canal Street in downtown Manhattan. Collection The collection of coins, medals and paper currency consists of over 600,000 objects drawn from all periods and cultures. In many fields the ANS' collections are the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. The collection includes early numismatic items from Ancient Greece and the Roman Republic, and also has a strong representation of coins of American, European, Far Eastern, and Islamic origin. These coinages range from 700 BC to the present. In addition, the collection contains paper and primitive money, as well as medals and decorations dating back to as early as approximately 4000 BC. The curatorial department of the ANS preserves, studies, and documents the extensive collection. This work includes keeping the collection's database MANTIS up-to-date, which also involves adding images. This online database is a major asset to the study of numismatics, because it is one of the largest of its kind and accessible to everyone. Online Resources The ANS also collaborates with other institutions to make numismatics accessible online. In collaboration with the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, the ANS is creating OCRE, which is an abbreviation for \\"Online Coins of the Roman Empire.\\" This project aspires to record every published type of Roman Imperial Coinage and link them with examples in major collections published online. The ANS also participates in Nomisma.org, which \\"is a collaborative project to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts according to the principles of Linked Open Data.\\" Further the ANS maintains the website of ‚ÄúThe Jewish Museum in Cyberspace.‚Äù Exhibitions At its headquarters in Manhattan, the ANS has a small exhibition space, which is open to the public. The ANS also loans objects from its collections to other institutions and exhibitions. While the largest number of objects from the ANS can be found at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, there are exhibitions with ANS objects all over the world. Library The library of the ANS houses over 100,000 items and is one of the most comprehensive collections of numismatic literature including books, periodicals, auction catalogs, manuscripts, photographs, and pamphlets. A special part of the library is the Rare Books Room with its unique collection of antique numismatic literature. Publications The ANS is also an active disseminator of research. As the largest non-profit numismatic publishing house in the world, ANS issues books, periodicals, monographs, catalogues, conference papers, and conference proceedings in a variety of series and special issues. Currently the ANS publishes three periodicals: the annual American Journal of Numismatics (1866‚Äì1924 and 1989‚Äìpresent), the triannual Colonial Newsletter (1960‚Äìpresent), and the quarterly ANS Magazine (2001‚Äìpresent). Electronic publications are the monthly \\"ANS eNews\\" and the \\"Pocket Change\\" blog. The ANS also publishes books on coins and medals. Past publications have included the Numismatic Literature journal (1947-2007). Awards The ANS gives multiple awards to people contributing to numismatics and the Society. The Huntington Medal Award is conferred annually in honor of Archer M. Huntington, who was an important contributor to the ANS at the beginning of the 20th century. This award recognizes outstanding career contributions to numismatic scholarship. The first such award was conferred to Edward T. Newell in 1918. The Saltus Medal Award is named after J. Sanford Saltus, who initiated this award in 1913. This award is given to sculptors ‚Äúfor distinguished achievement in the field of the art of the medal‚Äù. While this medal was at first only given to Americans, since 1983 foreign artists are also eligible to receive this award. The 2011 award recipient was Portuguese artist Jo√£o Duarte and previous winners are on the List of Saltus Award winners. Graduate Seminar In 1952, the American Numismatic Society established the Eric P. Newman Graduate Seminar in Numismatics. This training program in numismatics takes places each summer and many of its alumni are now in academic positions. History The ANS was formed by a group of collectors in New York City in 1858, at a time when many learned societies were created. Although the initial meeting of the collectors occurred in March 1858, the Society looks back to April 6, 1858, as its date of creation; that was the day on which the fledgling Society's first constitution and bylaws were approved by the membership. That same month, the Society accessioned its first coin. In 1865, it was incorporated as the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society or ANAS.https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174938/http://www.numismatics.org/governance/ANSCertificate.html In 1907, the name was changed back to the original one. ‚ÄúThe founders were Edward Groh, James Oliver, Dr. Isaac H. Gibbs, Henry Whitmore, James D. Foskett, Alfred Boughton, Ezra Hill, Augustus B. Sage, Asher D. Atkinson, M.D., John Cooper Vail, W. H. Morgan, Thomas Dunn English, M.D., LL.D., and Theophilus W. Lawrence. The corporators were Frank H. Norton, Isaac J. Greenwood, John Hannah, James Oliver, F. Augustus Wood, Frank Leathe, Edward Groh, Daniel Parish, Jr., and William Wood Seymour.‚ÄùLossing, Benson J. History of New York City Volume II (New York: The Perine Engraving and Publishing Co., 1884), 598. Benson Lossing in the History of New York City Volume II wrote in 1884 that ‚Äúthe prime objects of the society are the cultivation of the science of numismatology, the promotion of the study of American archaeology, and the collection of coins and medals and specimens of archaic remains.‚Äù Later, ANS changed its mission to focus primarily on all aspects of coins and medals.American Numismatic Society. \\"ANS Introduction\\" . The American Numismatic Society website. Accessed September 11, 2007. Under the leadership of several dynamic, resourceful and generous presidents, the ANS grew to become a major international center for numismatic research. One of these presidents, Archer M. Huntington, scion of the family who built the Southern Pacific Railroad and a serious collector, gave the Society land at 155th Street and Broadway and contributed toward construction of the neoclassical building which opened in 1908. In 1929, Huntington underwrote the expansion of the building, which doubled its size. As President of the ANS from 1916 to 1941, Edward T. Newell, a scholar of Greek coins, guided the Society toward making its mark worldwide. He also left his enormous personal coin collection to the Society. It was in the latter half of the 20th century that the Society evolved into the foremost numismatic research institution in the United States. Its cabinet of nearly one million objects ranks with the largest in the world and is an extraordinary resource for students of the humanities. Its unique library of over 100,000 items is the most comprehensive collection of numismatic literature in existence. The Society's Eric P. Newman Graduate Seminar in Numismatics, established in 1952, continues today as a training program in the discipline and numbers among its alumni many scholars now in academic positions including several of the Society's current curatorial staff. The Society administers a variety of fellowships and grants designed to promote research in numismatics and encourage use of the collections. Notable members *Agnes Baldwin Brett *Harry W.

Biography Bri√ßonnet was born into a wealthy aristocratic family about the year 1472. His father was Guillaume Bri√ßonnet (1445‚Äì1514) who had already enjoyed a successful career in the Catholic Church.He was Bishop of Saint-Malo, Archbishop of Reims, Archbishop of Narbonne, and also a cardinal. He also served as a counselor to King Charles VIII of France. The influence that the elder Guillaume Bri√ßonnet exercised certainly did not hinder his son and namesake from advancing up through the Church hierarchy. The younger Bri√ßonnet was made Bishop of Lod√®ve in 1489 and was later installed as the abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s in 1507. Bri√ßonnet also had political connections to the royal court. In 1516 he was commissioned by King Francis I of France to negotiate with Pope Leo X on the terms of the Concordat of Bologna. In the same year Bri√ßonnet was chosen as the new Bishop of Meaux where he would begin the most significant part of his career. As Bishop, Bri√ßonnet began to implement a program of reform in his diocese. He worked to improve the training of his clergy as well as improving monastic discipline. In the course of these efforts however he made some enemies, particularly among the Franciscan friars within his diocese. Additionally, Bri√ßonnet invited a number of evangelical humanists to work in the bishopric to help implement his reform program. This group of humanists became known as the Circle of Meaux and included Josse van Clichtove, Guillaume Farel, Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples, Martial Mazurier, G√©rard Roussel, and Fran√ßois Vatable. The members of the Meaux circle were of different talents but they generally emphasized the study of the Bible and a return to the theology of the early Church. Although Bri√ßonnet supported a renewal of his diocese along humanist lines with the support of evangelical reformers, the bishop never supported and later condemned the growing Reformation movement centered on Martin Luther. Certain members of the group disagreed with the bishop in their attitude towards Lutheranism however. The support of Lutheranism by some of his subordinates cast suspicion on Bri√ßonnet's entire project. Some of the Franciscan friars in his diocese, already unhappy with the Bishop's austere method, took the opportunity offered by this suspicion and accused him of Lutheranism. Bri√ßonnet had to appear before the Parlement of Paris to face charges of heresy. Bri√ßonnet was found innocent by the Parlement, possible because of his connections at the royal court in Paris. Permanent damage had been done to Bri√ßonnet's reform efforts however, and he found it impossible to continue his attempt to regenerate the spiritual life of his diocese. The Circle of Meaux disbanded about 1525 and its members went various ways, some of them later playing important roles in the Reformation. After the breakup of the Circle of Meaux Bri√ßonnet served for another nine years as bishop before his death, dismayed at the growing reaction in the Catholic Church against all attempts at internal reform that smacked of possible heresy. In retrospect Bri√ßonnet can be grouped with contemporary Bishops of the Catholic Church such as Christoph von Utenheim and Hugo von Hohenlandenberg who attempted, unsuccessfully, to reform the Church along evangelical lines without breaking up ecclesiastical unity. Guillaume Bri√ßonnet died at Esmans castle on January 24, 1534; he is buried in the church of this town.

It first broadcast on 16 January 1965, during the second season. Opening narration :The persistence of Man's curiosity led him into new worlds. Without conquering his own, he invaded the sub-world of the microscope, and the outer-world of space. It is said turnabout is fair play‚Ä¶ but is it? The story The final episode of The Outer Limits deals with four plane crash survivors who suddenly find themselves trapped in an alien space probe that was taking water samples. Inside they find a puzzle they need to solve before all four are killed. Plot En route to Tokyo, a plane flies into a storm and the pilot is forced to ditch the plane into the eye of a hurricane. The crew and passengers awake on a life boat and soon discover that they have been captured by an alien space probe. The passengers captured are Jefferson Rome, Amanda Frank, Coberly (the pilot), and Dexter. They originally think that they're inside the eye of the hurricane and try to use the emergency radio. The four discover that they are not floating on the ocean, but are inside a foggy floor surface. The radio doesn't work. Once inside, the four are bathed in some sort of mist that emerges from a large circle atop a pedestal, which cleanses them and dries their clothing. Dexter is frozen within the light beam coming out of the same circle, but is rescued by the others before he is frozen completely. Dexter stays behind while the others begin to explore the inside of the probe. Jefferson Rome and the others discover a room with an alien telemetry system. The probe is drawing up seawater. Jefferson Rome remembers the space probe Surveyor, used to study other nearby planets such as Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The three survivors themselves are being held captive in antiseptic chambers, where they are prey to some strange mutant microbes. Such a mutant microbe, larger than a person, attacks Dexter, and presumably consumes him, as the others are exploring the probe. Rome begins to surmise that the raft was being subjected to testing and they got in the way. Rome, Amanda Frank and Coberly discover the giant microbe, but it is zapped by the alien's freeze beam. It splits off a portion of itself to survive. Jefferson Rome, looking at data in the Analog Room, begins to notice a pattern - that the probe moved from world to world, using some sort of space warping drive system. The microbe may have gotten inside. They see a screen transmitting symbols, and Rome begins attempts at communicating by altering the sequence of the alien symbols. Meanwhile, the microbe tries to attack Coberly, but is held off by Jefferson Rome and Amanda Frank. The alien circle begins to transmit light beams in sequence. The probe then captures three of the humans in transparent tubes to sterilize them and protect them from the microbe. The probe then prepares its lift procedures. While Coberly goes to use the radio, Rome and Amanda attempt to communicate by figuring out the alien symbols. Outside the Analog Room, Coberly is enveloped in an alien mist and disappears. Jefferson Rome leaves the Analog Room to look for Coberly. He, too, disappears in the alien mist. When communication fails, Amanda Frank simply starts to plead for mercy. She begins to beg for the aliens to understand their predicament. She panics and leaves the Analog Room to look for Rome and Coberly. The alien light beam begins to probe her and she is surrounded in the mist. Atop the alien probe surface deck, she is re-united with Jefferson Rome and Coberly. A rescue plane arrives and Coberly begins transmitting their coordinates. Aboard the rescue plane, Amanda Frank begins to think she did get through, though even Rome could not transmit their position. Outside, the alien probe lifts off and suddenly explodes. The aliens had understood them and broken down Earth's alphabet. Rome wonders would they be as wise if the probe was from their own world, to which Amanda responds by hoping we would be wise and kind enough.

A warm, compassionate stranger, to tell us of wonders beyond imagination, of life beyond comprehension, of secrets from the treasure house of stars?

Geir Thorsn√¶s Skoger (Store norske leksikon) History Historically the area had large forested areas, and much arable land. Reference to Skoger is made in the land register maintained by Bishop Eystein Erlendsson (Biskop Eysteins jordebok). The parish of Skouger was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 under of the law of formannskapsdistrikt. This provision of the Constitution of Norway, required that every parish (Norwegian: prestegjeld) form a local self- government district. Skoger with 1,837 inhabitants merged with Str√∏msgodset with 731 inhabitants, as well as an uninhabited part of Eiker on January 1, 1844. The enlarged Skoger municipality had a population of 2,568. Until 1889 the name was written Skouger. A part of Skoger was moved to Drammen on 1 January 1870. The rest of Skoger was incorporated into Drammen on 1 January 1964. This entailed a border adjustment by which Skoger became a part of Buskerud county. Skoger Parish Skoger has two parish churches both of which are part of the Church of Norway and belongs to Drammen deanery in Tunsberg diocese. Access to both sites is via Norwegian National Road 33 ( FV33). Skoger Church (Skoger kirke) was inaugurated on 9 December 1885. It is built of brick stone and has 300 seats.

The first National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup was held in Lubenham, on the grounds of what is now Thorpe Lubenham Hall. Lubenham Parish extends to Gartree in the north and Bramfield Park in the west. The village appears in four entries in the Domesday Book. Transport On 6 June 1966, Lubenham railway station on the Rugby and Stamford Railway line closed in the Beeching Axe. Lubenham lies on the A4304 road which connects the M1 to Market Harborough, a route for heavy goods vehicles. A young schoolboy from the village was killed on the road in 2006, and the Adam Smile Project exists to create an off-road cycle route to Market Harborough using the track of the former railway and improve road safety. Buildings All Saints' Church, the medieval church at the centre of the village which holds regular services, has medieval wall paintings and box pews. Other features are the Easter sepulchre, the sedilia in the north chapel and the Renaissance reredos.Harvey, A. & Crowther-Beynon, V. B. (1924) Leicestershire and Rutland; 2nd ed.

Practice nights are Wednesdays from 7.30pm and visiting ringers of all standards are very welcome. Papillon Hall was a country house outside Lubenham that was built in about 1620 and demolished in 1950. In about 1903 it was remodelled by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. There is a public house, the Coach and Horses. The Tower House was built in 1771. Gore Lodge or \\"The House that Jack built\\" is a Grade II former farmhouse, converted to a hunting box with stables and cottage, in 1875 by Robert William Edis. Events Lubenham was judged to be Midlands Calor Village of the Year in 2001 because of its community activities, among them its scarecrow weekend. The regular Open Gardens event in aid of All Saints' Church held in June each year provides an opportunity for visitors to visit around 20 private gardens. The Village Hall hosts clubs and events. Lubenham has a beacon which was made for HM the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The beacon designed and made by an apprentice has been lit on special royal occasions such as the jubilee and the Queen's 90th birthday. \\"The House that Jack built\\" (Gore Lodge) The area boasts some lovely walks with abundant wildlife. Otters and kingfishers were seen on the River Welland in 2015. In 2008/2009, the Lubenham Heritage Group published a Heritage Trail with an interpretation panel on the village green, a pamphlet and placed plaques on buildings of interest.

Georgia's primary deepwater ports are located in Savannah and Brunswick, supplemented by two inland container trans-load facilities, with a third to open in 2021. Facilities The Port of Savannah comprises two major facilities: * Garden City Terminal: Owned and operated by the GPA, the Garden City Terminal is a secured, dedicated container terminal, the largest single-operator container terminal in North America. The facility features 9,693 feet (2,955 m) of continuous berthing and more than 1.1 million square feet (104,000 m2) of covered storage. The terminal is equipped with thirty-six high-speed container cranes (30 super post-Panamax and 6 post-Panamax), as well as an extensive inventory of yard handling equipment. * Ocean Terminal: Also owned and operated by the GPA, the Ocean Terminal is a secured, dedicated breakbulk facility specializing in the rapid and efficient handling of a vast array of forest and solid wood products, steel, RoRo (Roll-on / Roll-off), project shipments and heavy-lift cargoes. The facility features 3,599 feet (1,099 m) of deepwater berthing, approximately 1.425 million square feet (133,000 m2) of covered storage and 99 acres (401,000 m2) of open, versatile storage. The Port of Brunswick includes three GPA-owned deepwater terminals, two of which are directly operated by the GPA. * Colonel's Island Terminal: Owned and operated by the GPA, the facility has three berths and three on-terminal auto processors. The -plus facility features 3,355 feet (1,023 m) of continuous berthing and than of paved open storage. The facility also handles break-bulk and project cargo. * Mayor's Point Terminal specializes in break-bulk and project cargo, in particular the handling forest products. The facility features 1,200 feet (366 m) of deepwater berthing, approximately 355,000 square feet (33,000 m2) of covered storage and 7.9 acres (32,100 m2) of open, versatile storage. * East River Terminal and Lanier Dock, operated by Logistec U.S.A., specializes in the handling of break-bulk and bulk commodities. The facility features 1,600 feet (488 m) of deepwater berthing, approximately 688,000 square feet (64,000 m2) of covered storage and 15 acres (61,000 m2) of open, versatile storage. Georgia Ports Authority opened the Appalachian Regional Port, a container truck-to-rail transload facility in Murray County, Georgia, in August 2018. The inland port serves additional markets in Alabama and Tennessee and is connected to the Port of Savannah by a 388-mile CSX- operated railroad route. Owned and operated by the Georgia Ports Authority, Bainbridge is located on the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Waterway. The facility is equipped to handle a variety of bulk cargo via barge traffic, including nitrogen solution, gypsum, ammonium sulfate, urea, cottonseed and cypress bark mulch. The 104-acre Northeast Georgia Inland Port will open in 2021, providing a direct link to the Port of Savannah via Norfolk Southern. The rail terminal will open with 9,000 feet of working track. Economic impact According to a report from the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business, Georgia's ports supported 439,220 full- and part-time jobs throughout Georgia as of 2017, or about 9 percent of total state employment, with personal income of about $25 billion. According to the report, port activity accounted for about $106 billion in statewide sales. Tax revenue stemming from port trade totaled $5.9 billion in federal taxes, $1.4 billion in state taxes, and $1.5 billion in local taxes. Savannah Harbor Expansion Project The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is an in-progress dredging program to deepen the harbor from 42 feet to 47 feet. The depth will allow large ships that are coming through the Panama Canal to call on the Port of Savannah. While some of these Neo-Panamax ships already call Savannah, they are not loaded to capacity. As of February 2018, the project, which began in 2015, was about halfway completed. The remaining work is expected to be finished by 2021, and will allow loaded ships to transport about 3,600 additional cargo containers through the harbor on each passage. The project is estimated to cost a total of about $973 million, of which 75% is provided by the federal government, with the remainder from the state of Georgia. In September 2018, Savannah Now reported that officials thought the Talmadge Bridge may need to be replaced if the port was to service Neo-Panamax vessels.

The length scales considered are large enough for the atomic structure of the material to be ignored (the continuum approximation), yet small enough to resolve magnetic structures such as domain walls or vortices. Micromagnetics can deal with static equilibria, by minimizing the magnetic energy, and with dynamic behavior, by solving the time-dependent dynamical equation. History Micromagnetics as a field (i.e., that deals specifically with the behaviour of (ferro)magnetic materials at sub-micrometer length scales) was introduced in 1963 when William Fuller Brown Jr. published a paper on antiparallel domain wall structures. Until comparatively recently computational micromagnetics has been prohibitively expensive in terms of computational power, but smaller problems are now solvable on a modern desktop PC.  Static micromagnetics  The purpose of static micromagnetics is to solve for the spatial distribution of the magnetization M at equilibrium. In most cases, as the temperature is much lower than the Curie temperature of the material considered, the modulus M of the magnetization is assumed to be everywhere equal to the saturation magnetization Ms. The problem then consists in finding the spatial orientation of the magnetization, which is given by the magnetization direction vector m = M/Ms, also called reduced magnetization. The static equilibria are found by minimizing the magnetic energy, :E = E_\\\\text{exch} + E_\\\\text{anis} + E_\\\\text{Z} + E_\\\\text{demag}+E_\\\\text{m-e}, subject to the constraint M=Ms or m=1. The contributions to this energy are the following:  Exchange energy  The exchange energy is a phenomenological continuum description of the quantum-mechanical exchange interaction. It is written as: :E_\\\\text{exch} = A \\\\int_V \\\\left(( abla m_x)^2 + ( abla m_y)^2 + ( abla m_z)^2\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}V where A is the exchange constant; mx, my and mz are the components of m; and the integral is performed over the volume of the sample. The exchange energy tends to favor configurations where the magnetization varies only slowly across the sample. This energy is minimized when the magnetization is perfectly uniform.  Anisotropy energy  Magnetic anisotropy arises due to a combination of crystal structure and spin-orbit interaction. It can be generally written as: :E_\\\\text{anis} = \\\\int_V F_\\\\text{anis}(\\\\mathbf{m}) \\\\mathrm{d}V where Fanis, the anisotropy energy density, is a function of the orientation of the magnetization. Minimum-energy directions for Fanis are called easy axes. Time-reversal symmetry ensures that Fanis is an even function of m. The simplest such function is :F_\\\\text{anis}(\\\\mathbf{m}) = -K m_z^2. where K is called the anisotropy constant. In this approximation, called uniaxial anisotropy, the easy axis is the z direction. The anisotropy energy favors magnetic configurations where the magnetization is everywhere aligned along an easy axis.  Zeeman energy  The Zeeman energy is the interaction energy between the magnetization and any externally applied field. It's written as: :E_\\\\text{Z} = -\\\\mu_0 \\\\int_V \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{a} \\\\mathrm{d}V where Ha is the applied field and ¬µ0 is the vacuum permeability. The Zeeman energy favors alignment of the magnetization parallel to the applied field.  Energy of the demagnetizing field  Example of micromagnetic configuration. Compared to a uniform state, the flux closure structure lowers the energy of the demagnetizing field, at the expense of some exchange energy. The demagnetizing field is the magnetic field created by the magnetic sample upon itself. The associated energy is: :E_\\\\text{demag} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{2} \\\\int_V \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{d} \\\\mathrm{d}V where Hd is the demagnetizing field. This field depends on the magnetic configuration itself, and it can be found by solving: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{d} = - abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{M} : abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{d} = 0 where ‚àí‚àá¬∑M is sometimes called magnetic charge density. The solution of these equations (c.f. magnetostatics) is: :\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{d} = -\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi} \\\\int_V abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{M} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}}{r^3} \\\\mathrm{d}V where r is the vector going from the current integration point to the point where Hd is being calculated. It is worth noting that the magnetic charge density can be infinite at the edges of the sample, due to M changing discontinuously from a finite value inside to zero outside of the sample. This is usually dealt with by using suitable boundary conditions on the edge of the sample. The energy of the demagnetizing field favors magnetic configurations that minimize magnetic charges. In particular, on the edges of the sample, the magnetization tends to run parallel to the surface. In most cases it is not possible to minimize this energy term at the same time as the others. The static equilibrium then is a compromise that minimizes the total magnetic energy, although it may not minimize individually any particular term.  Magnetoelastic Energy  The magnetoelastic energy describes the energy storage due to elastic lattice distortions. It may be neglected if magnetoelastic coupled effects are neglected. There exists a preferred local distortion of the crystalline solid associated with the magnetization director m, . For a simple model, one can assume this strain to be isochoric and fully isotropic in the lateral direction, yielding the deviatoric ansatz \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_0(\\\\mathbf{m}) = \\\\frac{3}{2} E\\\\, [\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{m} - \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\mathbf{1}] where the material parameter E > 0 is the magnetostrictive constant. Clearly, E is the strain induced by the magnetization in the direction m. With this ansatz at hand, we consider the elastic energy density to be a function of the elastic, stress-producing strains \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_e := \\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon} -\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_0. A quadratic form for the magnetoelastic energy is E_\\\\text{m-e} = \\\\frac{1}{2} [\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon} -\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_0(\\\\mathbf{m})] : \\\\mathbb{C} : [\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon} -\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_0(\\\\mathbf{m})] where \\\\mathbb{C} :=\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{1}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{1} + 2\\\\mu \\\\mathbb{I} is the fourth-order elasticity tensor. Here the elastic response is assumed to be isotropic (based on the two Lam√© constants Œª and Œº). Taking into account the constant length of m, we obtain the invariant-based representation E_\\\\text{m-e}= \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2} \\\\mbox{tr}^2[\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}] \\\\+ \\\\mu \\\\, \\\\mbox{tr}[\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}^2] \\\\- 3\\\\mu E \\\\big{ \\\\mbox{tr}[\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}(\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{m})] \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\mbox{tr}[\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}] \\\\big} . This energy term contributes to magnetostriction.  Dynamic micromagnetics  The purpose of dynamic micromagnetics is to predict the time evolution of the magnetic configuration of a sample subject to some non-steady conditions such as the application of a field pulse or an AC field. This is done by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which is a partial differential equation describing the evolution of the magnetization in term of the local effective field acting on it.  Effective field  The effective field is the local field felt by the magnetization. It can be described informally as the derivative of the magnetic energy density with respect to the orientation of the magnetization, as in: :\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\mathrm{eff} = - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0 M_s} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 E}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\mathrm{d}V} where dE/dV is the energy density. In variational terms, a change dm of the magnetization and the associated change dE of the magnetic energy are related by: :\\\\mathrm{d}E = -\\\\mu_0 M_s \\\\int_V (\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{m})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{eff}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V Since m is a unit vector, dm is always perpendicular to m. Then the above definition leaves unspecified the component of Heff that is parallel to m. This is usually not a problem, as this component has no effect on the magnetization dynamics. From the expression of the different contributions to the magnetic energy, the effective field can be found to be: :\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\mathrm{eff} = \\\\frac{2A}{\\\\mu_0 M_s} abla^2 \\\\mathbf{m} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu_0 M_s} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_\\\\text{anis}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{m}} + \\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{a} + \\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{d}  Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation  The terms of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation: precession (red) and damping (blue). The trajectory of the magnetization (dotted spiral) is drawn under the simplifying assumption that the effective field Heff is constant. This is the equation of motion of the magnetization. It describes a Larmor precession of the magnetization around the effective field, with an additional damping term arising from the coupling of the magnetic system to the environment. The equation can be written in the so-called Gilbert form (or implicit form) as: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf m}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\gamma \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\mathrm{eff} + \\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{m}\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{m}} {\\\\partial t} where Œ≥ is the electron gyromagnetic ratio and Œ± the Gilbert damping constant. It can be shown that this is mathematically equivalent to the following Landau-Lifshitz (or explicit) form: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf m}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{1+\\\\alpha^2} \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\mathrm{eff} - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}{1+\\\\alpha^2} \\\\mathbf{m}\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{m}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\text{eff}) Applications The interaction of micromagnetics with mechanics is also of interest in the context of industrial applications that deal with magneto-acoustic resonance such as in hypersound speakers, high frequency magnetostrictive transducers etc. FEM simulations taking into account the effect of magnetostriction into micromagnetics are of importance. Such simulations use models described above within a finite element framework. Apart from conventional magnetic domains and domain-walls, the theory also treats the statics and dynamics of topological line and point configurations, e.g. magnetic vortex and antivortex states; or even 3d-Bloch points, where, for example, the magnetization leads radially into all directions from the origin, or into topologically equivalent configurations. Thus in space, and also in time, nano- (and even pico-)scales are used. The corresponding topological quantum numbers are thought to be used as information carriers, to apply the most recent, and already studied, propositions in information technology.

Allegheny City created it in response to the City of Pittsburgh's creation of Schenley Park. The land the Riverview Park occupies belonged to Sam Watson and was known as Watson's Farm. Mayor William M. Kennedy and the residents of Allegheny City pooled their money and purchased Watson's farm in 1894 and then donated the land to the City of Allegheny. Changes over time When the park first opened, it had \\"meadows and grassy hills\\" as compared to the somewhat unmanaged landscape that park visitors enjoy today. The park also had a small zoo, an elk paddock, a bear pit, a merry-go round, and an amphitheatre. Today many of these structures are gone, but a stroll into some of the now undeveloped areas of the park may have you find some of these mementos of the past. The park now has a public pool, a playground, the only equestrian (bridle) path in the City Park system, various shelters, the Allegheny Observatory, and summertime concerts and movies.

Known for most of its length as Jacob Tome Memorial Highway, the highway runs from MD 222 in Port Deposit north to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Harrisville in western Cecil County. MD 276 connects Port Deposit with Rising Sun. MD 276 was constructed along an old turnpike from Port Deposit through Woodlawn, then north to Rising Sun to the east of the present corridor. The Woodlawn-Rising Sun piece was paved by 1910; the Port Deposit-Woodlawn stretch was paved in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 276 was shifted west to between Woodlawn and its present northern terminus at US 1 in the late 1950s. The highway was completely reconstructed between 1959 and 1965. Route description View north along MD 276 at MD 273 in Harrisville MD 276 begins at an intersection with MD 222 (Main Street) opposite Ferry Street in the town of Port Deposit two blocks east of the Susquehanna River. The two-lane undivided state highway, which is Center Street in town and becomes Jacob Tome Memorial Highway at the town limit, which the route follows northeast as it ascends the high bluff above the river. MD 276 follows the town limit along the edge of the property of former United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, until shortly before its intersection with the northern terminus of MD 275 (Perrylawn Drive). The highway continues northeast to the hamlet of Woodlawn, where it curves north at Hopewell Road. MD 276 crosses several branches of Basin Run and briefly parallels Sale Barn Road before reaching the hamlet of West Nottingham, where the route passes to the east of the West Nottingham Academy Historic District and the namesake boarding school. The highway parallels Harrisville Road, which provides access to West Nottingham Meetinghouse, between Barnes Corner Road and MD 273 (Rising Sun Road). The two state highways meet at a roundabout in Harrisville, which is west of the town of Rising Sun. MD 276 continues north a short distance to its northern terminus at US 1 (Rising Sun Bypass) opposite Slicers Mill Road. MD 276 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from near Waibel Road to Hopewell Road within Woodlawn. The highway was named for Jacob Tome, a lumber magnate, state senator, and philanthropist in Port Deposit in the 19th century. MD 276 was designated Jacob Tome Memorial Highway by the Maryland State Roads Commission on May 24, 1961, based on a 1961 joint resolution of the Maryland General Assembly. History The portion of MD 276 from Port Deposit to Woodlawn follows the path of the Old Baltimore and Philadelphia Turnpike, a collection of free and toll roads that passed through Cecil County from a ferry crossing at Port Deposit northeast through Calvert to Chester County, Pennsylvania. The connection between the turnpike and Rising Sun was east of modern MD 276 along Hopewell Road, which was paved as a macadam road from the turnpike intersection east of Woodlawn at Cathers Corner to Rising Sun by Cecil County with state aid by 1910. Wilson Avenue in Rising Sun and the highway adjacent to the town were reconstructed as a concrete road to eliminate a steep grade in 1926. That same year, work began on paving the highway from Port Deposit to Cathers Corner. A section of the highway between the two endpoints near but not in Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in 1926. The Port Deposit end of the highway was completed in 1929. The gap in MD 276 between the concrete segment west of Woodlawn and Cathers Corner was filled between 1930 and 1933. MD 276 was relocated to the west through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement between the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County. The agreement transferred Hopewell Road from Cathers Corner to the town limit of Rising Sun from state to county maintenance in exchange for Kelly Road from Woodlawn north to the Rising Sun Bypass being transferred from the county to the state. Wilson Avenue in Rising Sun remained in the state highway system, as MD 811, until it was transferred to the town by a January 5, 1979, agreement. Shortly after the 1958 transfer, MD 276 was reconstructed over its entire length. The highway from Port Deposit to the Kelly Road intersection in Woodlawn was reconstructed in 1959 and 1960. MD 276 from Woodlawn to Liberty Grove Road, then MD 269, was reconstructed in 1962 and 1963, with much of the highway being relocated from what are now Sale Barn Road and Harrisville Road. The highway was relocated from Barnes Corner to MD 273 at Harrisville, bypassing the rest of Harrisville Road, in 1963 and 1964. Finally, MD 276 was reconstructed in place between MD 273 and US 1 in 1964 and 1965. The bypassed sections of MD 276 became segments of MD 813. The MD 276-MD 273 intersection was reconstructed as a roundabout in 2002 and 2003.

She was the older sister of United States President Theodore Roosevelt and an aunt of Eleanor Roosevelt. Her childhood nickname was Bamie (), a derivative of bambina (Italian for \\"baby girl\\"), but as an adult, her family began calling her Bye because of her tremendous on-the-go energy (\\"Hi, Bamie! Bye, Bamie!\\"). Throughout the life of her brother, Theodore, she remained a constant source of emotional support and practical advice. On the child-bed death of her brother Theodore's young wife Alice Hathaway Lee, Bamie took custody of the child, assuming parental responsibility for T.R.'s first daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, during her early years. Early life Bamie was born in a brownstone home at 28 East 20th Street in New York City on January 18, 1855. She was the eldest child of businessman/philanthropist Theodore \\"Thee\\" Roosevelt (1831-1878) and socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch (1835-1884). In addition to brother Theodore Jr. (T.R.) (1858-1919), Bamie's siblings were socialite Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt (1860-1894) and writer/speaker Corinne Roosevelt (1861-1933). Bamie was afflicted by a spinal ailment that led to her being partially crippled and confined by corrective steel braces as a child. She lives with T.Roosevelt and lived a long life there. T.R.'s daughter Alice once remarked that had Bamie, with her incredible intelligence and energy, been born a 19th-century man, without the social restrictions that the era placed on women, she would have been president instead of her brother. Elliott's daughter, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, stated in her autobiography that Bamie had \\"an able man's mind.\\" Although she was not seen as a stunningly gorgeous woman like her mother or her sisters-in-law, her natural intelligence and energy was magnetic to both men and women. She remained an emotional pillar of strength for all the Roosevelts. Family responsibilities from a young age Because Bamie's mother, Mittie, was often distracted by illness or by her grand social life, Bamie increasingly took a central role in running the Roosevelt household, particularly after the premature death of her father, Thee. In fact, T.R.'s elder daughter Alice remarked that Bamie almost seemed to be born into middle age, so significant were the adult responsibilities put into her hands from childhood. Unlike many children in a similar situation, Bamie had the natural maturity, judgement, and wisdom to \\"hold the family together,\\" Alice said. When T.R.'s first wife Alice died suddenly following childbirth, most probably of kidney failure (Bright's Disease) or toxemia, Bamie took custody of young Alice. Because her grieving father initially would not call her by his late wife's name, Alice was called \\"Baby Lee\\" for her mother's family, the Lees of Boston. Alice would say of Bamie that she was the most influential person in her entire life. When the young and vivacious Alice became more than her stepmother, Edith Kermit Carow, or her father could handle, they would send her up to Auntie Bye for a dose of discipline and to give her the structure that the Roosevelts in the White House were not able to exert. Elliott's wife, Anna Rebecca Hall, had wished for Bamie to have custody of her children, Eleanor, Elliott Jr., and Gracie Hall Roosevelt, upon her death. She was separated from her husband, and died young of diphtheria. Custody of the children was not immediately possible because Elliott was still alive‚Äîthough exiled by the family because of his alcoholism‚Äîand could not be bypassed in the event of litigation. Bamie considered a custody suit but realized that Anna's mother, Mary Livingston Ludlow, would not be willing to give the children into Bamie's care. She did open her home to Eleanor, who was a welcome visitor and made extended stays. Bamie was successful, though, in getting Eleanor out of the oppressive and harrowing home situation by demanding that she be sent to Allenswood School for girls in England, where Eleanor developed socially and emotionally. During Eleanor and Alice's childhood, Bamie kept them informed of each other's activities, helping to maintain something of a relationship between the two, though it was a vexing relationship, ranging from sometimes being very close and often a bitter and competitive relationship. She was close to both girls and contributed greatly to their development. T.R.'s lifelong confidante Throughout his life, Bamie's brother Theodore often turned to her for counsel in letters and personal conversations. In fact, it was said by their niece Eleanor that T.R. made few important significant political decisions and even fewer personal decisions without getting the input of his sister. She remained a trusted confidante for his entire career. As president, he would walk down to her residence at 18th and I in Washington so often that Bamie's house was sometimes called the \\"other White House.\\" As she became more infirm, T.R. turned more and more to his daughter Alice for advice and to act as a go- between in delicate political situations. Marriage In 1895 at age 40, Anna Roosevelt married US Navy Lt. Commander (later Rear Admiral) William Sheffield Cowles (1846‚Äì1923), a divorc√© who was 49. They had a son, William Jr. (1898‚Äì1986), who married Margaret Alwyn Krech (1900‚Äì1982) in 1920. Later life When niece Eleanor Roosevelt campaigned against T.R.'s eldest son, Theodore \\"Ted\\" Roosevelt III, she publicly broke with her niece after the ordeal. In a letter to her son, Bamie wrote of Eleanor: :\\"I just hate to see Eleanor let herself look as she does. Though never handsome, she always had to me a charming effect. Alas and alack, ever since politics have become her choicest interest, all her charm has disappeared!\\" T.R.'s elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over this highly distasteful (to Theodore's family) political activity that included Eleanor's riding up to Ted's speaking engagements with a teapot on her car to remind voters of Ted's supposed (but later disproved) connections to the Teapot Dome Scandal. Eleanor dismissed Bamie's criticisms by referring to her as an \\"aged woman.\\" Despite all these intra-family discords, long after Bamie's death, Alice and Eleanor would later reconcile after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth. Eleanor Roosevelt on her Aunt Bamie Bamie and her niece, Eleanor Roosevelt, eventually reconciled, and in an article in the Ladies Home Journal, \\"How to Take Criticism,\\" Eleanor referred to her Aunt Bamie, saying, \\"I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'\\" Death Alice and Eleanor's warmest link to their fathers' generation died on the night of August 25, 1931, aged 76. Her last words, \\"Never mind, it's all right,\\" were reportedly spoken to her friend Sara Delano, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's mother, before Bamie slipped into a coma and died.

Geography Ibbenb√ºren is situated on the Ibbenb√ºrener Aa river, at the northwest end of the Teutoburger forest and rather exactly in the center of the two cities Rheine in the west and Osnabr√ºck in the east, both approximately 20 km away. History Ibbenb√ºren is mentioned in documentary evidence for the first time in 1146, when the bishop of Osnabr√ºck at that time, Philipp of Katzenelnbogen, donated a tenth of his possessions in Ibbenb√ºren to the Getrudenkloster of Osnabr√ºck. Although Ibbenb√ºren was already much older and a document of the year 1348 mentions the establishment of a church in the year 799, though the year 1146 is officially considered as the year of the foundation of Ibbenb√ºren. In the years 1219 and/or 1234 it appears as a church village. In the transition from the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb√ºren, that is the abbot of Herford and the counts of Tecklenburg, possessed basic rule of the place. At this time Ibbenb√ºren belonged to the Diocese of Osnabr√ºck. During this time the castle of Ibbenb√ºren was built by the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb√ºren starting from 1150. The last remains of this castle are the remnants of the heath tower in the proximity of the Aasee. After the noble gentleman of Ibbenb√ºren died out, Ibbenb√ºren came under the exclusive rule of the counts of Tecklenburg. This rule lasted until the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century, when Ibbenb√ºren finally fell into the possession of Charles V in 1548 by awkward and luckless tactics used by the counts of Tecklenburg. Karl donated it to his sister Mary of Habsburg, governor of the Netherlands. Ibbenb√ºren was assigned to the office of Lingen. Into this period also falls the beginning of coal mining. After Ibbenb√ºren repeatedly fell under control of the Netherlands and Spain in the Dutch Revolt, it was assigned to the House of Orange-Nassau after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Around this time was the beginning of iron ore mining in and around Ibbenb√ºren, which ended in the first half of the 19th century. By succession it came under Prussian rule in 1702. On February 1, 1724, Ibbenb√ºren attained municipal rights, which stood among other things in connection with the introduction of excise duty. In 1743 the first magistrate and mayor were appointed. During the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte at the beginning of the 19th century, Ibbenb√ºren belonged to the first French Empire, until it was freed by Prussian and Russian troops in 1815. It came back under Prussian rule on January 1, 1816, and was assigned to the district of Tecklenburg. After the end of World War II the city Ibbenb√ºren and the municipality Ibbenb√ºren Land were formed on December 31, 1974, into the department federation Ibbenb√ºren, resulting in today's city of Ibbenb√ºren. With the simultaneous dissolution of the district of Tecklenburg and fusion with the old district of Burgsteinfurt, Ibbenb√ºren was assigned to the new district of Steinfurt. On 16 May 2015, a passenger train collided with a vehicle on a level crossing at Ibbenb√ºren. Two people were killed and 20 were injured, three seriously. Panorama shot of the city centre of Ibbenb√ºren and the mountain \\"D√∂renther Berg\\". In the background on the \\"Schafberg\\" one can recognize the mine plants as well as the Ibbenb√ºren power station. Coat of arms Coat of arms displays an upright golden anchor on a blue shield.

IL-7 is a hematopoietic growth factor secreted by stromal cells in the bone marrow and thymus. It is also produced by keratinocytes, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, neurons, and epithelial cells, but is not produced by normal lymphocytes.  Structure  The three-dimensional structure of IL-7 in complex with the ectodomain of IL-7 receptor has been determined using X-ray diffraction.  Function = Lymphocyte maturation  IL-7 stimulates the differentiation of multipotent (pluripotent) hematopoietic stem cells into lymphoid progenitor cells (as opposed to myeloid progenitor cells where differentiation is stimulated by IL-3). It also stimulates proliferation of all cells in the lymphoid lineage (B cells, T cells and NK cells). It is important for proliferation during certain stages of B-cell maturation, T and NK cell survival, development and homeostasis. IL-7 is a cytokine important for B and T cell development. This cytokine and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) form a heterodimer that functions as a pre-pro-B cell growth-stimulating factor. This cytokine is found to be a cofactor for V(D)J rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta (TCR√ü) during early T cell development. This cytokine can be produced locally by intestinal epithelial and epithelial goblet cells, and may serve as a regulatory factor for intestinal mucosal lymphocytes. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this cytokine plays an essential role in lymphoid cell survival.  IL-7 signaling  IL-7 receptor and signaling, common Œ≥ chain (blue) and IL-7 receptor-Œ± (green) IL-7 binds to the IL-7 receptor, a heterodimer consisting of Interleukin-7 receptor alpha and common gamma chain receptor. Binding results in a cascade of signals important for T-cell development within the thymus and survival within the periphery. Knockout mice which genetically lack IL-7 receptor exhibit thymic atrophy, arrest of T-cell development at the double positive stage, and severe lymphopenia. Administration of IL-7 to mice results in an increase in recent thymic emigrants, increases in B and T cells, and increased recovery of T cells after cyclophosphamide administration or after bone marrow transplantation.  Disease = Cancer  IL-7 promotes hematological malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T cell lymphoma).  Viral Infections  Elevated levels of IL-7 have also been detected in the plasma of HIV-infected patients.  Clinical application  IL-7 as an immunotherapy agent has been examined in many pre-clinical animal studies and more recently in human clinical trials for various malignancies and during HIV infection.  Cancer  Recombinant IL-7 has been safely administered to patients in several phase I and II clinical trials. A human study of IL-7 in patients with cancer demonstrated that administration of this cytokine can transiently disrupt the homeostasis of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with a commensurate decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. No objective cancer regression was observed, however a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was not reached in this study due to the development of neutralizing antibodies against the recombinant cytokine.  HIV infection  Associated with antiretroviral therapy, IL-7 administration decreased local and systemic inflammations in patients that had incomplete T-cell reconstitution. These results suggest that IL-7 therapy can possibly improve the quality of life of those patients.  Transplantation  IL-7 could also be beneficial in improving immune recovery after allogenic stem cell transplant.

The game was one of the nine launch titles available when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The objective is identical to the card game: to beat the dealer's card total, without going over 21, to win a bet. One to three players play the computer dealer. Gameplay The player uses the paddle controller to enter a bet of up to 25 chips from an initial pot of 200. An up card is then presented, and the player decides whether to \\"hit\\" (accept another card) or stand. The player breaks the bank by obtaining a score of 1,000 chips, or is \\"busted\\" upon losing everything. Due to a glitch in the program, while a player is selecting among the options of what to do with the current hand by pressing left or right with the paddle controller, the amount of the player's next bet is modified even though it is defined by a variable that will not be visible until the end of the hand, requiring the player to carefully re-enter it at the start of every hand without pressing the button carelessly or risk wagering an unintended amount. Reception Blackjack was reviewed favorably in Video magazine as part of a general review of the Atari VCS.

Multiuse and commuter trails Many of the major trails in Ithaca and the surrounding areas lie in abandoned railway beds. Ithaca was part of the first big railroad boom in the 1830s. While only one short-haul freight train remains, the area benefits from the use of the well-graded surfaces that the railroads left behind. In 2004, the City of Ithaca drew up a master plan for its trail system, to fill gaps in trail coverage and to make them more usable as commuter trails in addition to providing better access by foot and bicycle to major area natural preserves and state parks. If all of the connecting trails are completed, Ithaca will have a fairly complete network connecting most neighborhoods in the area without roads. Cayuga Waterfront Trail A sign along the Cayuga Waterfront Trail in Cass Park. Cornell's Collyer Boathouse is visible across the Inlet. The Cayuga Waterfront Trail connects Cass Park, on the western shore of Cayuga Lake, to Stewart Park on its eastern shore. The trail is 10-12 feet wide with an asphalt surface, and links Ithaca's waterfront destinations, including the Tompkins County Visitors' Center, the Ithaca Youth Bureau, Stewart Park, Cascadilla Boat Club, Newman Golf Course, Farmers' Market, Cornell and Ithaca College boathouses, Inlet Island (with a planned extension to the current US Coast Guard at the Inlet Island point), Cass Park and Allan H. Treman State Marine Park. South Hill Recreation Way The trail in Spring This , packed-gravel trail was developed in 1986 as a N.Y.S. Environmental Quality Bond Act Project. It runs parallel to (NE of) Coddington Road in the Town of Ithaca, mostly following the abandoned rail bed of the Cayuga and Susquehanna Railroad, which was built in 1849 to ship coal from Pennsylvania mines to Ithaca for water shipment over the Erie Canal. Eventually it merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and was abandoned in 1956. The descent into Ithaca from South Hill was via two switchbacks. The trail skips the middle switchback. Instead it follows a short steep asphalt-paved connector (not part of the railroad) from the upper to lower grades. The tail tracks of the switchbacks are not included in the trail; these were located NW of Coddington Road at the end of the upper trail, and SE of the bottom of the connector, respectively. Except for the connector, the trail is a gradual downhill from Burns Road to Ithaca. Hiking paths lead off the biking trail into the Six Mile Creek gorge. The trail is a popular spot for cross-country skiing in the winter, and in the summer, connects Ithaca College students to sunning and (illegal) swimming in Six Mile Creek and the City Reservoir. Small parking areas are located at the end of Juniper Drive and at the corner of Burns Road and Coddington Road in the Town of Ithaca. East Ithaca Recreation Way East Hill Recreation Way in winter East Ithaca Recreation Way is a paved pedestrian/bike trail in East Hill which runs in several sections between Game Farm Road and Honness Lane and joins with the Vincent and Hannah Pew Trail to the south. It is open one-half hour before sunrise until one-half hour after sunset. Many benches exist along the trail, providing rest areas for hikers and joggers. The northernmost section from Game Farm road to Maple Avenue runs through Cornell-owned natural areas along Cascadilla Creek, and allows for horseback riding. The total length of this section is . From Game Farm Road to the bridge over Judd Falls Road it is built on the railroad bed of the former Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad (later taken into the Lehigh Valley Railroad) (1871‚Äì1976),Lee, H.

To get to the next portion of the trail, one continues for west along Maple Avenue, where the trail starts up again. The middle section runs south from Maple Avenue to Honness Lane (crossing Mitchell Street along the way) and is built on the railroad bed of the former Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad (later taken into the Lehigh Valley Railroad) (1875‚Äì1936),Lee, H.

This section of the trail is a popular way to commute to and from Cornell's main campus. The total length of this section is . To get to the next portion of the trail, one continues east up Honness Lane and then across Pine Tree road. The southernmost section of the trail is also known as the Vincent and Hannah Pew Trail and connects the trail to the Tudor Park and the Snyder Hill / Eastern Heights neighborhood. This part of the trail travels through the Pine Tree Wildlife Preserve and the East Ithaca Nature Preservehttps://ithacatrails.org/site/East%20Ithaca%20Recreation%20Way for . There is a parking area for trail users, a bus pull-off and transit plaza with connections to the trail on Pine Tree Road, benches, and plantings. The trail received a federal highway grant to aid in completion in 2004. The total length of the trail (including all three sections and connecting streets) is .  Jim Schug Trail / Dryden Lake Trail  The Jim Schug Trail, named after the Dryden Town supervisor who secured most of the land but died shortly after the beginning of construction, is in length. Like other trails in the area, it runs on an abandoned railroad bed (the Southern Central railway, for most of its existence part of the Lehigh Valley). It begins on Main Street in Dryden, and continues to the Cortland County border, where it connects to the Finger Lakes Trail. A proposed extension of the trail would connect it northwest to the nearby village of Freeville (also in the Town of Dryden), and eventually via the Varna / Fall Creek trail to Ithaca. It is gravel packed and suitable for bicycling, and is also level for the entire route.Town of Dryden Department of Public Works Black Diamond Trail  The Black Diamond trail is the keystone of a major trail system in the Ithaca area, and has been planned since the 1970s. The section of trail from Cass Park to Taughannock Falls State Park opened in the fall of 2016. This section is now (since 1999) owned by the New York State Parks. The main trail segment is the former Lehigh Valley Railroad passenger line from Ithaca to Geneva, New York, popularly known as the \\"Route of the Black Diamond\\" from the name of the Lehigh Valley's premier passenger train, which last ran in 1959. This line stretches along the western shore of Cayuga Lake from Cass Park to Taughannock Falls State Park and Trumansburg, New York, steadily rising from lake level to above sea level at the bridge across Taughannock Creek. South of Cass Park, the about of the planned route follows the Cayuga Flood Control Channel along Route 13a, and then crosses the flood control channel (via a yet to be built bridge) directly opposite Cecil Malone Drive at Cherry Street, providing access to the Cherry Street Industrial Park, the city's Southwest district, and eventually to the new housing development planned there. From there, it follows the DL&W; right of way built in 1849 as part of the Cayuga & Susquehanna railroad, crossing over the fish ladder and eventually goes underneath the Route 13 bridge near the Town/City of Ithaca line, and then proceeds parallel to its south side, terminating in Robert H. Treman State Park. This urban section of the trail is estimated to cost $5 million, mostly for the construction of three new bridges: the bridge connecting to Cecil Malone Drive, one near the fish ladder, and a third bridge crossing over the Cayuga Inlet near the trail branch connecting to Buttermilk Falls. This last connecting trail is planned to branch near the City / Town of Ithaca line to connect to the (planned) Gateway Trail, through Buttermilk Falls State Park and towards South Hill Recreation way. A pedestrian/bicycle bridge already stretches over Route 13 near Buttermilk Falls to provide access to the planned Gateway trail. This \\"bridge to nowhere\\" was built before any rights to the abandoned DL&W; were secured and at the time widely criticized as a spectacularly visible example of a \\"pork barrel\\" waste of tax money, as the trail it connects to will not be usable for several years, if ever. Much more information, including the master plans are available online at the NY State Parks website.NY State Parks  Lansing Town Trail (Phase 1 open)  The 2.4 mile Phase 1 walking trail on farmland owned by the Town of Lansing opened on January 22, 2011. It is a loop trail mostly in open fields with magnificent views of the Cayuga Lake Valley and hills to the south east. Although intended for hiking, X-C Skiing (rated easy), and snowshoeing, it may be expanded for multipurpose use in the future. Maps and information are available at . East-South Trail (planned) The East-South connector trail extends from the terminus of South Hill Recreation Way near the intersection of Coddington Road and Burns Road, crosses Route 79/Slaterville Springs Road, runs along it for a short distance, and then connects through Snyder Hill to the planned Pew trail. Almost all of this connector trail will likely be either in the form of bike lanes along the road, or simply the addition of signage to indicate that bikes and cars will share the road. Although Burns Road has fairly light traffic, Route 79 is a major corridor, so safety might be an issue if the route is not separated from traffic. Because it crosses a shallow valley to join South Hill and East Hill, Burns Road has fairly steep sections, but this likely remains the best route to connect the two existing trails.  Varna Trail / Fall Creek Trail (planned)  The Varna and Fall Creek trails are one continuous segment on the Lehigh Valley (Elmira Cortland & Northern) railbed from Varna to the East Ithaca Recreation Way at its northeast terminus, passing through the Monkey Run nature preserve in the Cornell Plantations. As is the case for many of the other planned trails, several bridges need to be repaired or built along its route before it can be completed. Part of the route is already used by the Cayuga Trail. Gateway Trail / Buttermilk Falls Corridor (planned) The Gateway trail goes up South Hill, connecting the Black Diamond trail in the City's Southwest area with the northern branch of the South Hill Recreation Way, using the former DL&W; right-of-way. We discuss the trail in 2 sections =Lower Buttermilk falls to somewhat past Stone Quarry road= This portion is in good shape and the land belongs to the State of New York and Pennsylvania Lines LLC. It would take some work to connect it to the \\"bridge to nowhere\\", but it currently has a connection to the Buttermilk Falls parking lot, and to near the southern end of Spencer Rd. This section continues parallel to Spencer Rd. and goes past Stone Quarry Road, which might require some signage. =Portion near Emerson= This portion belongs to Emerson, and still has old railroad ties, and would need substantial work. It has a substandard bridge over the extension of S. Cayuga Street. It then connects to the end of Turner Place near Hillview Place. Because Hillview is too narrow for a completely separate path, the current plan involves the use of bike lanes or shared roadway signage for the last connection. The most favorable routing would go through Emerson Power Transmission property, and rights have not yet been negotiated. Despite the steepness of the only possible route and barriers to completion, completing this connector trail is frequently cited as a priority by State and County officials when discussing the Black Diamond Trail, because of the connection to the heavily used South Hill Recreation Way. It would provide a completely new connection to the Southwest area, avoiding the indirect route that automobile traffic currently must take. East Shore Trail (planned) This trail would extend along the hillside above the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, connecting the City and Town of Ithaca with Lansing. It would use the abandoned Central New York Southern Railroad grade (popularly known as the Ithaca-Auburn Short Line). Bridges were removed from the line when it was dismantled in the 1920s; two were replaced by footbridges built by the sewer district which uses this right of way and used for monitoring sewer lines, but they are posted \\"No Trespassing\\" and have locked fences at both ends. Hiking trails and paths=Finger Lakes Trail System The main Finger Lakes Trail passes south of Ithaca proper and follows the south boundary inside Robert H. Treman State Park. An orange- blazed connecting trail from upper Lick Brook links it with the trail system at Buttermilk Falls State Park, near the S end of Lake Treman. The portion of the Finger Lakes Trail between Watkins Glen and Caroline is maintained by volunteers of the Cayuga Trails Club.Cayuga Trails Club Cayuga Trail The long Cayuga Trail originates at the Stewart Avenue bridge over Fall Creek, and passes eastward through the Cornell University campus and plantations, generally paralleling Fall Creek. It crosses the Creek on a suspension bridge in the vicinity of Forest Home, and again via the Route 13 bridge. After the second crossing, it turns westward again, using the LV railbed part of the way, and ending in the vicinity of Varna. The Cayuga Trail was built and is maintained by volunteers from the Cayuga Trails Club. Natural features and attractions=Cascadilla Creek A trail leads from the College Avenue Bridge down along the gorge to Court and Linn Street in Ithaca, providing a convenient route between downtown Ithaca and the Cornell University campus. A path also extends through the Cornell Campus from the College Avenue Bridge upstream to the Hoy Road Bridge. The trail is closed during the winter. Six Mile Creek View of Six Mile Creek in winter Access to this gorge trail can be found within the Town and City of Ithaca. Two major access points within the city are via the South Hill Recreation Way, or via a small parking lot at the intersection of Giles and Water streets. On a given summer day, you might find both human fishermen and a great blue heron. The trail also provides access to the old City Reservoir, a popular (but illegal and unsafe) swimming destination in the summer. Some maps State Parks Buttermilk Falls Allan H. Treman and Taughannock Falls State Parks are both near Lake Cayuga and are oriented towards shorter, lighter walks and hikes, while Buttermilk Falls and Robert H. Treman State Parks are marked by their waterfalls, and focus on hiking trails which follow their respective creeks, and are thus more difficult although still rewarding trails. * Allan H.

History George Washington Preparatory High School was founded in 1927 as a six-year high school that slowly developed into a four-year school. The first graduating class was 1928 with 5 seniors. The school was badly damaged by the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and the students went to school in tents for a year or two. In 1935 Washington High began accepting 11th and 12th graders only, and before 1950, Washington Senior High School had expanded to include grades 10 through 12. In January 1983, a new founder, the famed George McKenna, redefined Washington High School as a college preparatory school, and George Washington Preparatory High School, \\"The Prep,\\" became an academic institution for grades 9‚Äì12. Background The reorganization of Washington Preparatory High School into Small Learning Communities (SLCs) began in 2006. The purpose of the SLC is to develop a sense of unity and cohesiveness and to foster the individual needs of students. The SLCs that were established as a result of this effort are: Etech (Engineering and Technology); ELMS (Ethics, Leadership, and Mediation Scholars); S.T.A.R.S (Visual and Performing Arts); BIZ (Business); SHAPE (Health and Fitness); and Law and Justice. The three Magnet programs have remained intact. During subsequent years, Washington added Performing Arts, Math/Science, and Communication Arts Magnets and achieved honors in scholastic, athletic and extra-curricular competition. As of 2009, in order to graduate and participate in senior activities such as prom, senior picnic, and grad night seniors must earn 230 credits, pass the California High School Exit Exam, and maintain 95% attendance.HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL .

Bernard, Sr. left a 10-year career with a major New York banking institution and together with his wife, Karen, went into full-time ministry. What started as a small storefront church in Williamsburg, Brooklyn has grown into a 37,000+ member church that sits on an -acre campus in Brooklyn, New York. He is founder and CEO of the Christian Cultural Center. Bernard has served as the President of the Council of Churches of the City of New York representing 1.5 million Protestants, Anglicans and Orthodox Christians. Bernard founded the Christian Community Relations Council (CCRC, a NY based not-for-profit that will serve as a central resource and coordinating body for congregations and community organizations. He is currently on the Board of Directors for the Commission of Religious Leaders (CORL). Bernard served on the NYC Economic Development Corporation Board for current Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; NYC School Chancellor's Advisory Cabinet and on Mayor Michael Bloomberg's 2001 Transition Team and Mayor Bill de Blasio's 2014 Transition Team.

He has been awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Wagner College and an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Nyack College/Alliance Theological Seminary. Biography Bernard was born in Panama, the son of a black Panamanian mother and a father who was a Castilian Spaniard.Charisma News: \\"Once a Loyal Muslim, A. R. BERNARD Now Marches to a Different Drum\\" by Herbert Toler August 22, 2015 His father disowned him and in 1957, he and his mother moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. As part of the 1960s desegregation movement in the public school system, he was bused to school in Ridgewood, Queens and then attended Grover Cleveland High School. Bernard worked after school in the garment district pushing racks for $2.00 per hour to assist his mother in their single parent household. He landed a clerk position with Bankers Trust Company during his senior year of high school. Bernard earned a number of promotions leading to a position as Operations Specialist in the Consumer Lending Division. Establishment of church Prior to becoming a born again Christian in January 1975, Bernard was a part of the Muslim American movement. In 1978 he and his wife, Karen started a bible study in the kitchen of their Brooklyn railroad apartment. Bernard left his 10-year banking career in 1979 to go into ministry full-time. As the bible study group grew, so did the need for a facility. The Bernards took their savings and rented a small storefront in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. Later that year Household of Faith Ministries was incorporated. In 1988, Household of Faith purchased and renovated an abandoned Brooklyn supermarket into a 1000-seat sanctuary, complete with administrative offices and a bookstore. Household of Faith was renamed Christian Life Center and formally moved into its property in June 1989 with a membership of 625. Further growth As Christian Life Center began experiencing exponential growth ‚Äî four Sunday services, lines forming at 4:00am, and overflow rooms filled to capacity, the ministry was quickly outgrowing its home on Linden Boulevard. The need for a larger facility was evident and in 1995 a vacant lot adjacent to Starrett City was purchased and construction followed immediately. On December 31, 2000, under the leadership of Bernard, Christian Cultural Center took its new name and moved into its new home. The 6.5-acre (26,000 m2) sanctuary and conference center also includes a chapel, bookstore, television production facilities and state of the art youth center. Christian Cultural Center, one of the largest independent churches in the United States, exemplifies a new paradigm in the worship experience. Bernard remains a highly sought after speaker, teacher and community leader. He has traveled extensively throughout the United States and internationally addressing religious organizations, businessmen and political dignitaries. Future expansion and development is anticipated on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m2) of land adjacent to the current CCC campus. International Christian Brotherhood Bernard was asked to serve on the Board of Directors for the Christian Men's Network (CMN) to help restructure the organization. During his six years on the board, CMN grew to an organization with 74 international offices and with a presence in approximately 150 nations. In addition to serving as Treasurer for the board, Bernard was one of their most requested speakers. With the death of Dr. Edwin Louis Cole in 2002, he became the President of CMN. International Christian Brotherhood (ICB) began as an assigned project under the leadership of Ed Cole, but after a separation from CMN, Bernard re- launched ICB as his own Men's Ministry.  Controversy  During the campaigning for the 2016 presidential elections, Bernard joined the board of Donald Trump's \\"Evangelical Executive Advisory Board\\". The purpose of the board was to \\"provide advisory support to Mr. Trump on those issues important to Evangelicals and other people of the faith in America,‚Äù the campaign said in a statement. Bernard then stepped down in 2017 quoting a \\"deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.\\" Bernard had submitted his letter of resignation on 15 August 2017, the same day Trump made controversial remarks about the events that took place in Charlottesville. Since 1999, A. R. Bernard has been visiting the controversial City Harvest Church in Singapore and maintains a close friendship with the church's founder Kong Hee. Kong was convicted of conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust, for misusing his church's building fund on his wife's singing career, masked through a series of bond investments. A. R. Bernard has been the Chairman of City Harvest Church‚Äôs advisory panel and vouched for the integrity of Kong Hee in 2010, when he was first arrested and sought to exert pressure on the Singapore government by political means and the press media. Involvement in education Bernard is also the founder of Brooklyn Preparatory School in New York City and Cultural Arts Academy Charter School. Formed in 1993, BPS is a premiere early education institution dedicated to serving young children, ages 3‚Äì6. Their June 1999 first grade graduates ranked 91st in the national percentile in reading and 96th in the national percentile in mathematics.  Family  Bernard is married to his wife Karen since 1972. Bernard and Karen met in high school in East New York, when he was 15 and she 16. In an interview, he revealed that they were once headed for divorce because of some decisions that he had made and that he had made his \\"ministry his mistress\\".

Maxim premiered the piece during his graduation at the Moscow Conservatory. This piano concerto was intended to be the last piece he wrote for piano. It contains many similar elements to his other composition, Concertino for Two Pianos. They were both written to be accessible for developing young pianists. It is an uncharacteristically cheerful piece, much more so than most of Shostakovich's works.  Instrumentation  The work is scored for solo piano, three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, timpani, snare drum and strings.  Movements  The concerto lasts around 20 minutes and has three movements, with the second movement played attacca, thereby moving directly into the third (although the second movement does come to an acceptable resolution in C minor, such that the third movement is not entirely necessary to bring the music to a conclusion):  Reception  This concerto is sometimes dismissed as one of the composer's less important works, especially in comparison to some of the symphonies and string quartets. In a letter to Edison Denisov in mid-February 1957, barely a week after he had finished work on it, the composer himself wrote that the work had \\"no redeeming artistic merits\\". It has been suggested that Shostakovich wanted to preempt criticism by deprecating the work himself (having been the victim of official censure numerous times), and that the comment was actually meant to be tongue-in-cheek. In April of 1957, he and his son performed a two piano arrangement of the work for the Ministry of Culture, and then it was later premiered for the public at the Moscow Conservatory. Despite the apparently simplistic nature of this concerto, the public has always regarded it warmly, and it stands as one of Shostakovich's most popular pieces. In 2017, the concerto was voted 19th in the Classic FM Hall of Fame.  Recordings  Despite his dismissal of the concerto, the composer performed it himself on a number of occasions, and recorded it along with his first concerto. Both are played at fast tempo rarely matched in modern recordings. On the third recording, one can hear some of the passages played by Shostakovich were not as clean and it was a sign of his deteriorating hand. In his recordings of the second movement, Shostakovich presents slight variations in some passages that are not written in the score. Some examples include a repeated chord Shostakovich plays from bar 33 that is from the first beat of bar 34 is written as a tie in the score. Maxim's own son, Dmitri Maximovich Shostakovich, has also recorded the piece, with his father conducting I Musici de Montreal. Identical in bearing to his famous grandfather, Dmitri the younger also matches his grandfather's frenetic speed and expression very closely. Other recordings include those by Leonard Bernstein as soloist and conductor for Columbia Records, Marc-Andr√© Hamelin for Hyperion Records, and Dmitri Alexeev with Jerzy Maksymiuk conducting the English Chamber Orchestra. There has been a recording of this concerto by the Mariinsky Orchestra with soloist, Denis Matsuev and Valery Gergiev as conductor.Dmitri Shostakovich and Rodion Shchedrin, Shostakovich: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 2 / Shchedrin: Piano Concerto No. 5.

Bronfman has also recorded both of the concertos with the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. Ballet The concerto is used in two different ballets.

Sutro built his mansion on a rocky ledge there, above the first Cliff House. The grounds consisted of a spacious turreted mansion, a carriage house, and outbuildings set in expansive gardens. The estate dominated the Lands End area, with an elaborate entrance gate. He spent in excess of a million dollars to recreate an Italian style garden.

The name may also have derived from the word ‚ÄúK√≥√∞‚Äù, which translates to ‚Äúshallow waters.‚Äù It may have derived from the word ‚ÄúKva√∞a‚Äù, which means resin and perhaps may have referred to Kodal's vast Spruce forests. The ending, -dal, most likely derives from ‚Äúvalley.‚Äùhttps://andebu.info/tema/bygdebok/historisk_innledning.htm#Sognenavnenes%20opphav%20og%20betydning.Gallis, Arne (1975).

History It was started by the Church Missionary Society, England, in 1817 when no institution existed in the then- Travancore state to teach English. Rev. C.Y.Thomas in the History of Madhya Kerala Diocese says: \\"After 1836 we find in the C.M.S. records, references to the 'Kottayam Village Mission' with Bailey in charge of it and 'the Kottayam District Mission' under Baker, with his headquarters at Pallom, five miles to the South. They also continued educational work and built another college at Kottayam, the C.M.S. College in 1838. The new college made its real start in 1840 when the Rev. John Chapman took charge of it. According to Agur, in Church History of Travancore, Nagam Aiya and Velu Pillai in separate editions of Travancore Manual have recorded that Scott christian College, Nagercoil started its career as a school in 1805 and evolved into a full-fledged college in 1817. So chronologically, Scott Christian College founded by LMS missionaries was the first college in the princely state of Travancore. Rev. Benjamin Bailey was the first principal of The College, COTTYM, as it was then called and spelt. The government welcomed the College as \\"a place of general education whence any demands of the state for officers to fill all departments of public service would be met\\". In the early years, the curriculum included the study of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Mathematics, History and Geography besides English, Malayalam, Sanskrit and Syriac. In 1838, the College was shifted to the wooded hillock ‚Äî the present site ‚Äî commanding views of the distant Western Ghats. One of the oldest buildings in the campus is Room 52 or \\"Grammar School,\\" as it was then named. The College magazine in Malayalam was started in 1864 by the then-principal Richard Collins, after whom the College Library is named. In 1857 the College was affiliated to Madras University soon after its incorporation and the College presented students for the Matriculation examination. The College provided free education to all the students until 1855 when the fee of one Rupee a month began to be collected from each student. The total number of students in 1870 was only 129. In 1880, the Maharaja of Travancore who visited the College observed: \\"Long before the state undertook the humanizing task of educating the subjects, the Christian Missionaries had raised the beacon of knowledge in the land\\". In 1890, two- year classes were started and the first batch of students was presented for the F.A Examination in 1892. It was in 1938 that female students were admitted in the College for the first time. In 1840, the number of students in the College was 220. In 1950, Degree classes were started and by 1960, the number of students in the College rose to 1250. Postgraduate classes were started in 1959. The College is now affiliated to Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. In 1981, the Synod of the Church of South India transferred the management of the College to the C.S.I. Madhya Kerala Diocese. Thy Word Is Truth is the motto of the College. In 1999 the college was accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with five star status. Later in 2004 the University Grants Commission (UGC)accorded the status of College with Potential for Excellence (CPE). Academics The college has 14 departments and 47 courses. There are six research centers in the college. Ph.D. research work is conducted in the departments of Botany, Zoology, Physics, Chemistry, English and Commerce. Notable alumni The Alumni of the college include * Dr. K. R. Narayanan, former President of India; * Mr.K. P. S. Menon; formulator of Indian foreign policy; * Sardar K. M.

His terms in office were marked by increasingly severe partisanship leading to the breakup of the state Democratic Party in the years leading up to the American Civil War. His brother-in-law was involved in John Brown's Raid and was executed. Willard went to the south to advocate unsuccessfully for his release, and became despised by southerners who accused him of having a secret involvement in the raid. He died two months before the start of the war while giving a speech on national unity, and was the first governor of Indiana to die in office. Early life=Family and background Ashbel Parsons Willard was born on October 31, 1820 in Oneida County, New York, the son of Erastus and Sarah Parsons Willard. His father farmed and was the county sheriff. There he attended Hamilton College and studied law with Judge Barker. He moved to Marshall, Michigan in 1842 and lived there for about a year. In 1843 he made a trip to Texas on horseback and on his return stopped in Carrolton, Kentucky; he so liked the town he settled there for a year and became a local school teacher. After living there about a year there he moved again to Louisville, Kentucky where he continued teaching. In his spare time he read and studied.Woollen, p. 104Gugin, p. 125 In the 1844 election Willard, a Democrat, stumped all around the Louisville area and southern Indiana for James Polk who ultimately won the election. While on the stump the people of New Albany, Indiana so liked him that they invited him to come live in their community. He accepted their offer and moved there in the spring of 1845 and set up a law office. Finding there to be a lack of clients, he also worked for a time as a writer in the clerk's office to obtain extra income. He met Carline C. Cook, a town native, and was married to her in 1847. The couple had three children, but the oldest, Ashbel P. Willard Jr. died from scarlet fever at age three. New Albany remained Willard's home for the rest of his life.Woollen, p. 105Gugin, p. 126 Legislator In 1849 Willard became a New Albany councilman, furthering his local popularity. In 1850 he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives as New Albany's representative. He chaired the states Ways and Means Committee, became Speaker of the House. His rapid progress quickly led him to become a leader in the state Democratic Party. In the General Assembly he was known for his wit and oratory, and won most debates he entered. In 1852 he was nominated to the candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Indiana at the state Democratic Convention. His quick rise in the party was attributed to his exceptional oratory and political skills. The ticket won, in large part because of the stumping of Willard, and he served with Governor Joseph A. Wright. Willard was bitterly antagonistic towards the Know-Nothing party, newly formed from disaffected Whigs, the Free Soil Party, and the Liberty Party. His derision toward them in the Senate created problems for him when its member later joined the Republican Party. During his time as President of the Senate, the senate was closely split between the parties. When the measure to enter a joint session to elect a new United States Senator, the Senate had a tie vote. Knowing that given the number of Know-Nothings in the House they would be a majority in a joint session, Willard refused to break the tie and Indiana remained several years with only one Senator in Congress.Woollen, p. 106 Governor=Campaign In 1856 Willard was nominated to run as the Democratic Candidate for Governor on the Democratic ticket. He was opposed in the election by Oliver P. Morton, the most influential man among the Know-Nothing opposition. The remnants of the Whig party supported his bid and did not field their own candidate. The election was referred to as the \\"battle of the Giants\\", and was one of the most divisive in the history of the state. Both men being among the most astute politicians in the history of the state.Goodrich, p. 224 The state Democratic party had been undergoing a major division during the two years preceding the campaign. The former Governor Wright was very unpopular with the party's leadership, and party leader Jesse D. Bright. Wright and other members were expelled from the party when they failed to support the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which the leaders treated as a loyalty test. Many of the expelled and their constituents launched numerous personal attacks against Willard. Much like the nation, Indiana had split along northern and southern lines. Resident of southern Indiana, who were predominantly of southern ancestry, went democrat. Northern Indiana resident who were dominantly of northern origin, voted for the Know-Nothings. Willard won the close election by about six thousand votes.Gugin, p. 127 Deadlock Shortly after his election, Willard traveled to a Mississippi governors' meeting where he openly voiced his support for state-rights, southern slavery, and the Fugitive Slave Law. His statements caused an uproar in Indiana among his adversaries. Willard's term was marked with severe partisanship and in-fighting in the Democratic Party. The Know-Nothing Party fell apart during the first two years of his term, but was replaced by the strengthening Republican Party, which absorbed most its members. The divisive atmosphere left the General Assembly in deadlock for most of his term, leading him to call the first special session of the body in state history, because the parties could not agree on the terms of a budget. In 1857 mid-term elections, the Republicans gained control of the Senate, and the Democrats retook the House after absorbing the remaining Whigs. The state still only had one US Senator, and the governor was hoping to have the assembly elect one, and nominate Jesse D. Bright to return to the Senate. The opposition was more hostile to Bright, primarily because of his actions regarding slavery. The Republicans were still angry over Willard's blocking their Senate pick, so the Senate decided to reciprocate his actions, refusing to enter the joint session necessary to elect a senator. Willard instructed the Democrats to meet without the Republicans and elect a Senator anyway. The dubious legality of the issue was considered outrageous by the Republicans and raised the tension to a fever pitch.Woollen, p. 111 In 1857 the move by pro-slavery forced in Kansas to legalize slavery caused a stir nationwide. Willard came out in support of the pro-slavery position, and supported President James Buchanan or Stephen Douglas. The event was the breaking point for the state's Democratic party. Most of the party's newspapers came out strongly against Willard, and numerous members began to switch to the Republican Party.Gugin, p. 129 In 1858 the legislature launched an investigation on the sale of public land in northeast Indiana. They discovered that over $100,000 had been embezzled by commissioners that had been appointed by the governor. Legislators began accusing Willard of corruption. He ignored their attacks, but removed the commissioners.Gugin, 130 John Brown's Raid While governor, Willard's brother-in-law John Cook was involved in John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry, an armed insurrection to free slaves in Virginia, and sentenced to death. Willard, determined to save his brother-in-law, went to him in prison and arranged to have his cell left open so he could escape. Cook refused to be released and was subsequently executed despite Willard's pleas to Governor Wise to stay his death sentence.Woollen, p. 110 Governor Wise accused Willard of being behind the entire affair, claiming to have secret intelligence from Washington D.C. Wise claimed that Willard had sought Brown's services through his brother-in-law and secretly commissioned the insurrection. Willard was vilified in newspapers across the south and even in some part of the north.Dunn, p. 562Woolen, p. 110 Willard found himself on the opposite side of the slavery debate as his brother-in- law. Although Indiana was a free state, he thought southerners should maintain the right to determine the slavery issue for their selves. Unable to run for reelection, Willard helped ensure the nomination of Thomas A. Hendricks for governor in 1860 to run against Republican Henry S. Lane, who had Oliver Morton as a Lieutenant Governor.Woollen, p. 117 Death and legacy Willard had been in poor health for some years, and it began to deteriorate quickly in 1860. That year the Democratic Party was struggling with internal problems, and the nation was on the brink of Civil War. Willard attended the state Democratic convention in Columbus, his last political appearance in the state. His party was so wracked with problems, it was proposed by a party member that the crowd give three cheers for the Republican candidates, who they believed would save the Union. Willard quickly ascended to the podium and rebuked the crowd and begged for unity. His speech was so forceful, he quickly became more ill than ever. His lungs began hemorrhaging, but his doctors were able to stop the bleeding. Shortly after, Willard traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota on a tour to promote goodwill among the states. Willard died from internal bleeding while giving a speech there on October 4, 1860. He was the first Governor of Indiana to die in office. He was laid in state in Indianapolis and his bier was attended by thousands, and buried in New Albany.Woollen, p. 107 His grave was unmarked until May 30, 1928 when the State of Indiana erected a gravestone after they were petitioned by the Floyd County Historical Society to appropriate $500.00 to erect a gravestone. Willard was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor Abram Hammond who fulfilled the final three months of his term. Willard's death had profound negative consequences for the state Democratic Party, who lost the election primarily because they were unable t field a new candidate very quickly, although it has been debated whether they could have won. Although he helped keep the Democrats in control of the General Assembly going into the Civil War, things quickly feel apart for his party. As the primary enforcer of party unity, the duty fell to Jesse D. Bright, who was soon caught up in scandal. Many members of the party joined the Republicans and two decades would pass before his party would regain power.

He succeeded to the office upon the death of Governor Ashbel P. Willard and completed the remaining three months of Willard's term. Early life Abram Adams Hammond was born in Brattleboro, Vermont March 21, 1814, the son of Nathaniel and Patty Ball Hammond. He moved to Indiana at the age of six when his family settled in Brookville, Indiana. He attended school and later studied law and was admitted to the bar. In 1835 he moved to Greenfield where he opened a law office. He married Mary Ansden in 1838 and the couple had one daughter. In 1840 he moved again this time to Columbus where he partnered in a law office with John H. Bradley. He was briefly the prosecuting attorney for Bartholomew County.Woollen, p. 113Gugin, p. 132 He moved again in 1846 to Indianapolis where he and his partner relocated their law office. They moved again in 1847 to Cincinnati, Ohio. Still on the move, they returned to Indianapolis in 1849 adding Hugh O'Neal to their law firm. In 1850 the Indiana legislature created a Court of Common Pleas and Hammond was selected to become its first judge. He held the post only briefly and resigned in 1852 to move to San Francisco to form a new law office with Rufus A. Lockwood. He returned to Indiana in 1853 and in 1855 moved to Terre Haute, Indiana where he formed yet another law office with Thomas H. Nelson. He remained in Terre Haute until he was elected Lieutenant Governor. Political career In 1852 John C. Walker was nominated by the Democratic Convention to be the candidate for Lieutenant Governor. But when it was found he was ineligible due to his age the party's Central Committee choose Hammond, and former Whig. The remnants of the state Whig Party completely integrated with the state Democratic party in 1852, and Hammond was one of its many pro-slavery member who merged.Woollen, p. 114 Hammond was included in the 1856 Democratic ticket as Lieutenant Governor with Governor Ashbel P. Willard, in hopes of drawing the Whigs who had gone to the Republican Party.Gugin, p. 133 When Governor Ashbel Willard died on October 5, 1860, Hammond was raised to the position of Governor where he served for three months. The death of Willard left the Democratic party without a candidate for governor. Hammond did not seek reelection as the party was in the midst of splitting with many member leaving to join the new Republican Party. Hammond supported Stephen Douglas. Hammond continued to advocate for the peaceful solution to the issue of slavery.Woollen, pp. 115-117 His only act of significance was an address to the General Assembly on January 11, 1860. In it he suggested several new laws, and offered a temporary solution to the problems caused by the gridlock in the assembly. His main theme, though, was to maintain harmony in the Union. He said, > It gives me great pleasure to say that Indiana as a state, has hitherto > faithfully kept the bond of Union with all her sister States. Her record is > unstained by any act of bad faith. She has never attempted, directly or > indirectly, the evade or avoid any of the requirements of the Federal > Constitution, and no man could doubt that if the same could be said of every > other state, instead of discord, harmony would reign throughout our borders. > Let us take pride in maintaining the high position we have thus far occupied > as a conservative, union-loving state, and while we throw our weight into > the scale in favor of any practice mode of settling the present trouble, let > us continue to aid in the permanent and more lasting settlement that must > flow from any restoration of amity and cordiality among our people, North > and South.Woollen, p. 116 In his speech, Hammond convinced the Assembly to send delegates to a Peace Congress held among most of the states in an attempt to negotiate a compromise on the slavery issue and avoid war. A delegation was sent, but voted unanimously against the conventions Crittenden Compromise, which would have given concessions to the south to avoid the war. The nation was, however, already set for war, and Indiana would become to first western state to mobilize forces for the invasion of the south less than four months later.Gugin, p. 132 Soon after he had completed his term as governor, Hammond came to be severely afflicted with rheumatism and asthma, and retired from public life. He moved to Denver where he believed the warmer and drier climate would ease his suffering. He died there on August 27, 1874. His body was returned to Indianapolis for a ceremony and he was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.

Its agenda declares that its aim is \\"to raise Polish youth in a Catholic and patriotic spirit\\". The inter-war incarnation was created in 1922 as part of the National Democracy movement, and was modelled after the inter-war fascist movement Falanga. During World War II it operated underground and was clamped down on the break of 1945/1946 by the Communist authorities. The present incarnation was created on December 2, 1989. Its manifesto from 1989 states that \\"one's country is the greatest earthly good. After God, your foremost love belongs to the Homeland, and foremost after God you must serve your own country,\\" and declares itself opposed to \\"doctrines promoting liberalism, tolerance, and relativism. The All-Polish Youth was affiliated with the League of Polish Families (2001-2006), but was never officially its youth wing. In the 21st Century it has been a fierce opponent of LGBT rights leading it to be widely condemned as homophobic by various organisations. It currently plays a major role as part of the National Movement party.  Inter-war All-Polish Youth  The organisation, properly the Academic Union \\"All-Polish Youth\\" (ZwiƒÖzek Akademicki \\"M≈Çodzie≈º Wszechpolska\\"), was founded in 1922 as an ideological youth organisation with a strong nationalist sentiment,Wapi≈Ñski 1980, 238. and was the largest student organisation in the Second Polish Republic. The Founding Convention of the All-Polish youth took place in March 1922, with Roman Dmowski being selected honorary chairman. The term \\"All-Polish\\" is intended to represent a desire to unify all Polish lands, and accentuate national ties and the equality of all people of Polish origin regardless of their wealth or social status. The idea for creating the organization occurred when Poland was partitioned and not officially on the world map, therefore it aimed to unite Poles from all three partitions. In the inter-war period, members of the organisation participated actively in academic life, and became the heads of many student organisations. The All-Polish Youth was the largest student organization in Poland during the 1930s. The goals of the organization were mainly focused on three issues:Kuli≈Ñska 2000, 36-37. # Defending the autonomy of universities against centralising forces of the government # Campaigning for lower tuition fees # Limitation of non-Polish, especially Jewish students, from higher education to prevent exclusion of Polish students from the countryside All-Polish Youth was the least radical of organizations of the National Democracy camp.Jacek Misztal, ‚ÄúZwiƒÖzek Akademicki M≈Çodzie≈º Wszechpolska 1922-1939, p. 164.‚Ä≥ Nevertheless, some of its members praised Mussolini and his Italian fascism for its hardline stances towards the left and realisation of \\"national revolution\\".Wapi≈Ñski 1980, 243-244 Part of the members, including Jƒôdrzej Giertych, also praised Hitler's GermanyWapi≈Ñski 1980, 317. economical changes, but understood that it is with the contradiction with Polish national interests and changed his views a year after NSDAP obtained power in Germany.Jacek Misztal, ‚ÄúZwiƒÖzek Akademicki M≈Çodzie≈º Wszechpolska 1922-1939, p. 94.‚Ä≥ Most leaders of the All-Polish Youth criticized Hitler for racism and radicalism. According to Jan Mosdorf, a pre- war chairman of All-Polish Youth who died in Auschwitz for saving Jews, the organization was against fascists and Hitlerites.Mateusz Kotas, \\"Jan Mosdorf. Filozof, ideolog, polityk, p. 45.\\" Some Members of the All-Polish Youth also praised authoritarian regimes of the Mediterranean, Salazar's Portugal and Franco's Spain. They also favoured economically boycotting the Jews, limiting their access to higher education (numerus clausus)Wapi≈Ñski 1980, 239. in order to equal the chance of children from countryside families who had very limited access to education to the chance of the children of Jewish families living in the towns and cities.Jacek Misztal, ‚ÄúZwiƒÖzek Akademicki M≈Çodzie≈º Wszechpolska 1922-1939, p. 23‚Ä≥ The All-Polish Youth also actively campaigned for ghetto benches, segregated seating for Jewish students.Joanna Beata Michlic, Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present, University of Nebraska Press, 2006, , p. 113.  Modern days  All-Polish Youth on 2015 March of Independence The modern incarnation of the All-Polish Youth was founded in Pozna≈Ñ in 1989, on the initiative of Roman Giertych, the former leader of the League of Polish Families (LPR). Continuing the tradition of its precursors, the organisation maintains its aim of raising youth with their ideology, and operates across all of Poland, working with high-school and university students. In 2006, the Polish Public Prosecutor's office launched an investigation after a video recording from a private party was leaked to the Polish press. It was considered that All-Polish Youth members including Leokadia WiƒÖcek, a personal assistant of Maciej Giertych (member of the European Parliament), were seen fraternizing with Neo-Nazi skinheads, listening to Neo-Nazi bands, and saluting the swastika.Warsaw Voice - LPR Ditches All-Polish YouthEJP  News  Eastern Europe  ‚ÄòAll-Polish Youth‚Äô Nazi movie generates controversy Following the incident, Leokadia WiƒÖcek was expelled from All-Polish Youth,http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,wid,8625569,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=17530 and the League of Polish Families cut ties with the group.Warsaw Voice - LPR Ditches All-Polish Youth (20 Dec 2006) As it was later determined, during the private party Leokodia WƒÖcek was not a member of the organisation and the main Polish television channel Telewizja Polska apologized to All-Polish Youth for accusing them of neo-nazi connotations.TVP Polish Television Evening News (02 Aug 2007) All-Polish Youth have declared that it is only by making Poland a Catholic state that its future will be secured, and chairman Konrad Bonis≈Çawski has stated \\"We do not want to become like Holland with its free drugs and gay marriage. Since joining the European Union we have seen attempts to destroy our Catholic values.\\"Daily Telegraph - Ghetto survivor warns of Polish 'fascism' (24 June 2006) All-Polish Youth have gained considerable press coverage due to their staunch opposition of abortion and, particularly, homosexuality (which their website condemns as \\"unnatural behaviour\\" and describes gay rights marches as \\"militant homosexualism\\"). This has led to (sometimes violent) clashes with pro-choice and gay rights demonstrators. All- Polish Youth have been widely condemned as homophobic by various organisations including Amnesty International,Amnesty International Report 2006 - Poland (archived by UNHRC, United Nations Refugee Agency) Human Rights Watch,Human Rights Watch (Scott Long) and even the United Nations (which, in their Universal Periodic Review, describes All-Polish Youth as an \\"extremist homophobic grouping\\"),UN Human Rights Council - Universal Periodic Review, Annual Report 2005 (page 6) as well as a multitude of gay rights organisations such as OutRage! and the Polish Campaign Against Homophobia. In 2004, 2005, and 2006, All-Polish Youth members and sympathizers violently attacked people who were taking part in pro-gay demonstrations, throwing eggs, bottles and rocks at them,BBC News Report, 28 April 2006Human Rights Watch (Scott Long) 14 Feb 2006 and were reported to have shouted \\"Send the fags to the hospital\\", \\"Perverts, get out of Krak√≥w\\", \\"Let's gas the fags\\" and \\"We'll do to you what Hitler did to the Jews\\". From 2012 onwards, the organisation has been heavily involved in playing a major role as part of the National Movement party, a party which the organisation was one of the several co- founders. In January 2019, the organisation's leader from 2015 to 2016, Adam Andruszkiewicz, was appointed as Poland's deputy minister for digital affairs. Former member (joined 2000), Lubusz chapter leader (2003‚Äì2004) and chairman (2005 and 2006) Krzysztof Bosak became the Confederate Party candidate for the presidential election 2020 after winning the presidential primaries held at the party convention in Warsaw on January 18 2020.

History The original iteration of High's was High's Ice Cream, an ice cream parlor founded by L.W. High in Richmond, Virginia in 1928 and purchased by James R. High Jr. with two partners in 1938, at which time there were 16 stores and an ice cream plant in Richmond. In 1941, Convenient Systems, Inc. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina purchased the chain, then numbering 50 stores. Gregory remained at the helm until 1976. The company was acquired by the Capital Milk Producers Cooperative, who grew the chain to 350 High's Dairy Stores and Restaurants, and sold the Virginia and West Virginia stores in 1987 to Southland Corporation, who converted many of them to 7-Eleven stores, and closed the rest. Fuel at High's gas stations was previously supplied by Shell and Citgo. High's first made a foray into proprietary fuel branding in 2011, when it was rolled out at a prototype station in Chester, Maryland. On March 1, 2012, High's, then based in Hanover, Maryland, was acquired by the Carroll Independent Fuel Company. Following the Carroll deal, most High's stores broke their ties with Shell and Citgo, began selling High's-branded fuel supplied by Carroll, and underwent remodels. Some High's locations continue to sell Shell-branded fuel. High's is now based in Carroll's Baltimore headquarters. Ice cream The right to produce High's brand of ice cream was sold in 1989 to Kay's Ice Cream, based in Knoxville, Tennessee (which was subsequently acquired by C. F. Sauer Company in 1990). The company no longer manufactures High's brand of ice cream. Until 2010 there was a High's Ice Cream parlor remaining in Portsmouth, Virginia, but it sold Hershey's brand ice cream. At the time of its closing, it still had the original High's interior (though showing its age) including the white and black checkerboard floor tiles that High's Ice Cream stores were known for. High's still sells its own brand of ice cream in gallon containers at its stores today.

Yahoo! Finance, 30 October 2014. and laid off more than 500 Palestinian workers in the process.  Product  The SodaStream Sparkling Water Maker is a device that forces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas (stored under pressure in a cylinder) into water, making it sparkling (fizzy). The product includes a machine, a carbon dioxide cylinder, and one or more reusable beverage bottles. The bottle, filled with water, is inserted into the machine, and with a button push or two, compressed CO2 from the cylinder is injected, creating carbonated water. Varieties of concentrated syrups are available, to create regular or diet soft drinks by adding a small amount of concentrate to the bottle after carbonation. Different flavours are created by adding fruit-flavoured concentrates. During its heyday, several famous brands were available in SodaStream concentrate form including Tizer, Fanta, Sunkist and Irn-Bru. SodaStream also offers diet concentrates sweetened with Splenda, and is used as much for plain sparkling water as for soft drinks. SodaStream and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in January 2012 involving the use of the Crystal Light and Country Time brand flavours with the SodaStream home carbonation system. In July of the same year, the two companies expanded their partnership to include the Kool-Aid flavour line. In 2013, SodaStream partnered with Ocean Spray to market three Ocean Spray flavours for use with the SodaStream home soda maker. In February 2013, SodaStream and Samsung announced that Samsung refrigerators with built-in SodaStream sparkling water dispensers would be available in the United States beginning in April. Excluding the purchase price of the machine, typical cost to the end user (2015, United States dollars) is 25 cents per litre of carbonated water generated plus another 50 cents per litre for the soda syrup. Pricing in other countries may vary.  History  The forerunner of the machine, the \\"apparatus for aerating liquids\\", was created in 1903 by Guy Hugh Gilbey of the London gin distillers, W & A Gilbey Ltd., and was sold to the upper classes (including the royal household). Flavoured concentrates such as cherry ciderette and sarsaparilla were introduced in the 1920s, along with commercial carbonation machines, and the first machine for home carbonation of drinks was produced in 1955. The SodaStream was originally sold in the UK, and later spread to other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. SodaStream machines were popular during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, and are associated with nostalgia for that period. Their slogan, \\"Get busy with the fizzy\\", started as an advertising jingle in 1979 and proved so popular that they added it to their logo. The slogan was initially dropped in 1996 after 17 years, but was reinstated in 2010 along with a new marketing campaign in the UK. In 1985, after various changes of ownership, SodaStream became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group. In 1998, SodaStream was bought by Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier. In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany. Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries. In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves B√©har to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability. B√©har's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.  2010 NASDAQ IPO  SodaStream International Ltd. went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2010. The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities. At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ and during the year 2010 one of the top- performing IPOs generally. To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited to ring the exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010. By August 2011, SodaStream's market capitalisation had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion. During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo. Analysts had expected another 27% growth in 2013 with earnings projected to grow 30% over the next 5 years. 2013's actual net earnings were down relative to 2012 despite an increase in sales; in 2014, the company's stock dropped to its lowest value since 2012. Barclays PLC analyst David Kaplan cited U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's warnings about the economic effects of boycotts and the company's failure to clarify the reasons for missed earning targets as causes for the drop. In October 2014, SodaStream announced its revenue for 2014 was expected to decline to $562.7 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year, while a report by Zacks Equity Research stated that net income for 2014 is expected to be 42% lower than in 2013. Zacks Equity Research cited declining sales in the United States, where an increasing number of consumers are choosing \\"more natural, less caloric and water based beverages\\" as opposed to traditional carbonated soft drinks.  Sales  Some 20% of households in Sweden owned SodaStream machines as of 2010. In January 2011, the company marked the sale of its millionth soda maker in the country. Europe accounts for 45% of SodaStream's sales. Since May 2012, SodaStream has been sold in over 2,900 Walmart locations in the United States. In June equity research firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. stated that SodaStream's machines were selling out at Walmart. SodaStream's U.S. sales grew from in 2007 to in 2011. Despite record sales, profit margins are declining. SodaStream's estimated 2013 net income ($41.5 million on an annual revenue of $562 million in 2013, compared to 2012's $43.86 million of net income on $436.32 million of revenue) fell short of targets and investor expectations. Sodastream also sells its product at most Bed Bath & Beyond stores.  Environmental marketing  In its marketing, the company focuses on environmental attractiveness of using tap water and returnable gas cylinders. SodaStream has been involved in environmental projects, including waste reduction, beach cleanup and reforestation. Americans alone dispose of 130 billion bottles and cans every year, and 340 billion beverage bottles and cans are not recycled every year worldwide. According to SodaStream, use of home carbonation systems reduces packaging waste from bottles and cans, and the pollution caused by the transport of bottled drinks. According to an analysis by Carbon Trust, SodaStream is 75 per cent less greenhouse gas-intensive than generic colas sold in plastic (PET) bottles in the UK. In 2011, SodaStream partnered with the Israel Union for Environmental Defense to launch an initiative promoting waste reduction and an improvement in the quality of tap water. Also in 2011, SodaStream launched a campaign with Erin O'Connor to raise awareness to the effects of plastic bottle waste on the environment. As part of the company's support for Climate Week, in 2012 SodaStream donated ¬£1,000 to a school in Crediton, Devon in the United Kingdom to fund an educational beach cleaning initiative. SodaStream partnered with Trees for the Future in 2012 to launch the Replant Our Planet initiative: for each home beverage carbonation system sold from its Rethink Your Soda product line, SodaStream committed to planting hundreds of thousands of trees in Brazil. SodaStream Italy and the Municipality of Venice partnered in 2012 to organize Join the Stream: fight the bottle, a cleanup initiative with its starting point at the Lido di Venezia. Actress Rosario Dawson launched the first annual Unbottle the World Day in New York City in July 2012. The campaign, initiated by SodaStream to raise awareness to the impact of cans and plastic bottles on the environment, calls on the United Nations to designate one day of the year a \\"Bottle Free Day\\".  Advertising campaigns  In 2010 SodaStream launched an international campaign to raise awareness of bottle and can consumption. The campaign involves the display of cages in various countries, each containing 10,657 empty bottles and cans. Begun in Belgium, the Cage campaign has since visited 30 countries with the message that the waste produced by one family over the course of five years from beverage containers ‚Äì 10,657 bottles and cans ‚Äì can be replaced by a single SodaStream bottle. When a cage went on display in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2012, Coca-Cola demanded that SodaStream remove its products from the cages and threatened to sue SodaStream. SodaStream responded by dismissing the threats and announcing that it would display the cage outside Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta. A 30-second television commercial promoting sustainability, showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using a SodaStream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012. Clearcast, the organization that approves TV advertising in the UK, explained that they \\"thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market\\". The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by SodaStream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected. A similar advertisement, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen reacting to the exploding bottles, was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013, but was rejected by CBS for its direct references to Coke and Pepsi. The previous SodaStream ad was shown in its place. SodaStream CEO said \\"The banned ad was a win because of the quality as well as the quantity of the exposure we received\\".  Production facilities  SodaStream has 13 production facilities worldwide. From 2016, SodaStream's principal manufacturing facility is in Idan HaNegev Industrial Park north of Beersheba, Israel. The plant provides employment for around 1,400 workers, many of them Negev Bedouins.SodaStream to invest in Negev, The Times of Israel, 4 April 2012 The cornerstone for the plant was laid in 2011, it opened in 2015.Sodastream breaks ground for Negev factory, Globes, 6 July 2011 An additional plant, which began operating in 2011 in Ashkelon, produces SodaStream syrups and flavours. Another plant operated in the Alon Tavor industrial zone near the Israeli city of Afula, between 2011 and 2015, but was closed once the Idan HaNegev facility was opened. In Europe, the company employs 250 people, in two main sites; at SodaStream's European commercial and logistics center, which is located in Rijen, Netherlands and at a manufacturing facility in Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. SodaStream's US headquarters is at Mount Laurel, New Jersey.\\"Form 20F: Annual Report 2015, page 24\\"  Controversy  As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) activist campaign launched in 2005 to pressure Israel to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, SodaStream was criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the Mishor Adumim industrial zone in the West Bank. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in 2010 that SodaStream was not entitled to claim a \\"Made in Israel\\" exemption from EU customs payments for products manufactured in the West Bank because Israeli settlements in the West Bank are outside the territorial scope of the EC- Israel Agreement. In January 2014, Oxfam accepted the resignation of Scarlett Johansson, a Jewish-American actress, as ambassador for that organisation, a role she had held for eight years, after she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream. Oxfam has stated that \\"businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support\\" and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law. Johansson reportedly resigned because of \\"a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement\\". In her statement she described SodaStream as \\"not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights\\". SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum also accused Oxfam of supporting the BDS movement against Israel as a whole, a charge Oxfam denied, saying that \\"this is about trade from the settlements\\" and specific to settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 border. which Oxfam states, due to their location, pose an obstacle to any future two-state solution. According to Birnbaum, the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of SodaStream, and he said, all SodaStream products sold in Norway, Sweden and Finland are manufactured in China. In January 2014 a Paris court ruled that Association France Palestine Solidarit√© (AFPS), a group campaigning to remove SodaStream from stores, must compensate SodaStream ‚Ç¨6500 because the group falsely claimed the products are sold \\"illegally and fraudulently\\" due to their use of the \\"Made in Israel\\" label while being partly manufactured in the West Bank.French court rules boycott group cease denigrating campaign against SodaStream, Haaretz, 29 January 2014 Human Rights Watch stated that \\"It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located\\". The United Church of Canada launched a campaign to boycott SodaStream products manufactured in the West Bank. In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from its stores, amidst growing BDS pressure and declining sales. Its Oxford Street, London store had been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of SodaStream products. In July 2014, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream also closed its Brighton store. Birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical. \\"We don't take sides in this conflict. He described the factory as \\"building bridges between us and the Palestinian population, and we provide our Palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits\\". SodaStream employed 500 West Bank Palestinians.Boycott Israel Push Against SodaStream Could Hurt Palestinian Workers. 10 February 2013 Addressing the location of SodaStream's Ma'ale Adumim plant, Birnbaum said \\"we're here for historical reasons.\\" The choice was made by company founder Peter Weissburgh, back in the 1990s, long before SodaStream was taken over by the current owners, who appointed Birnbaum in 2007. Birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it: \\"We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone‚Äôs political agenda...I just can't see how it would help the cause of the Palestinians if we fired them.\\"SodaStream Boss Admits West Bank Plant Is 'a Pain' ‚Äî Praises Scarlett Johansson, forward, 28 January 2014. Supporters of the factory cited the West Bank's high unemployment rate and low GDP as evidence the jobs were badly needed. Opponents argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements did not outweigh the effect the Israeli presence had on the Palestinian economy. Others argued that SodaStream was exploiting local cheap labour. Workers' incomes at the factory were substantially above the 1450 shekel/month Palestinian Authority minimum wage. All but one of the Palestinian employees interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor supported Johansson's stance and opposed a boycott of SodaStream, stating that a boycott would only hurt them. One Palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for SodaStream and felt like a \\"slave\\" working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day. Another Palestinian employee interviewed by Reuters reported that: \\"Most of the managers are Israeli, and West Bank employees feel they can't ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced.\\" In December 2014, Harvard University Dining Services halted SodaStream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society. A few days later, however, Harvard's President Drew Faust reversed the decision, claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place. When French host Cyril Hanouna aired a homophobic prank on French TV in May 2017, SodaStream first refused to stop advertising and supporting Hanouna's program, but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising.  Firing of Palestinian workers  In July 2014, Sodastream fired 60 Palestinian workers after they called a wildcat strike, complaining about not receiving sufficient food to break Ramadan fasts during night shifts (the company does not permit employees to bring their own food because the plant follows Jewish dietary restrictions). The workers were fired after receiving due process hearings and were given severance pay. SodaStream announced that its factory in Ma'ale Adumim would be closed by the end of 2015 in order to save $9 million in production costs. The plant's operations were transferred to a new factory in Lehavim, where it reportedly \\"employ a significant number of Bedouin Arabs\\".SodaStream to shut West Bank factory, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 29 October 2014. The move laid off 500 Palestinian workers, although 74 Palestinian workers moved with SodaStream when it relocated. However, the Israeli government initially refused to renew the Palestinians' work permits. SodaStream protested the government decision. Around a year later, the Israeli government renewed the working permits of the 74 Palestinian workers and they returned to SodaStream. Some news sources reported that SodaStream blamed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for the closing of its plant. Mahmoud Nawajaa, the BDS coordinator in Ramallah, called the loss of Palestinian jobs at SodaStream \\"part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation\\". SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum blamed Benjamin Netanyahu for the Palestinian job losses. According to Birnbaum, all of the Palestinian employees had passed Israeli security clearance, but were denied permits to work after Netanyahu intervened. Birnbaum claimed that Netanyahu wanted the Palestinians fired so he could then blame BDS. Netanyahu's office denied Birnbaum's claims.

Like many other Dylan songs of the 1965‚Äì1966 period, the song features a surreal, playful lyric set to an electric blues accompaniment. Lyrics Dylan's lyrics affectionately ridicule a female \\"fashion victim\\" who wears a leopard-skin pillbox hat. The pillbox hat was a fashionable ladies' hat in the United States in the early to mid-1960s, most famously worn by Jacqueline Kennedy. Dylan satirically crosses this accessory's high-fashion image with leopard-skin material, perceived as more downmarket and vulgar. The song was also written and released after pillbox hats had been at the height of fashion. Some journalists and Dylan biographers have speculated that the song was inspired by Edie Sedgwick, an actress and model associated with Andy Warhol. It has been suggested that Sedgwick was an inspiration for other Dylan songs of the time as well, particularly some from Blonde on Blonde. Influences The song melodically and lyrically resembles Lightnin' Hopkins's \\"Automobile Blues\\",\\"Wicked Messenger: Bob Dylan and the 1960s\\" By Mike Marqusee, p. 191 with Dylan's opening line of \\"Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat,\\" echoing Hopkins's \\"I saw you riding 'round in your brand new automobile,\\" and the repeated line of \\"...brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat,\\" melodically descending in the same manner of the Hopkins refrain \\"...in your brand new fast car\\". The Dylan reference to \\"the garage door\\" in the final verse of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" may also be an allusion to the automobile of Hopkins's song. In 2013 experimental hip-hop group Death Grips released a song titled \\"You Might Think He Loves You for Your Money But I Know What He Really Loves You for It‚Äôs Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat\\" named after the last lines in the song. Recording sessions Dylan began to include \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" in his live concerts with the Hawks in late 1965, and the song was one of the first compositions attempted by Dylan and the Hawks when in January 1966 they went into Columbia recording studios in New York City to record material for the Blonde on Blonde album. The song was attempted on January 25 (2 takes) and January 27 (4 takes), but no recording was deemed satisfactory. One of the takes from January 25 was released in 2005 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack. Frustrated with the lack of progress made with the Hawks in the New York sessions (only one song, \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\", had been successfully realized), Dylan relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in February 1966, where the evening of the first day of recording (February 14) was devoted to \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\". Present at the session were Charlie McCoy (guitar and bass), Kenny Buttrey (drums), Wayne Moss (guitar), Joseph A. Souter Jr. (guitar and bass), Al Kooper (organ), Hargus Robbins (piano) and Jerry Kennedy (guitar). Earlier in the day Dylan and the band had achieved satisfactory takes of \\"Fourth Time Around\\" and \\"Visions of Johanna\\" (which were included on the album), but none of the 13 takes of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" recorded on February 14 were to Dylan's satisfaction. Dylan soon left Nashville to play some concerts with the Hawks. He returned in March for a second set of sessions. A satisfactory take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" was finally achieved in the early hours of March 10, 1966, by Dylan along with Kenny Buttrey, Henry Strzelecki on bass, and the Hawks's Robbie Robertson on lead guitar (though Dylan himself plays lead guitar on the song's opening 12 bars). The recording sessions were released in their entirety on the 18-disc Collector's Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965‚Äì1966 on November 6, 2015, with highlights from the February 14, 1966, outtakes appearing on the 6-disc and 2-disc versions of that album.

The television series is the first installment of the \\"GARO\\" metaseries, which is composed of several installments, including a live action television series, films, TV & film specials, and anime series. The television series has been licensed for a North American release by Kraken Releasing. Production The series was created and directed by Keita Amemiya (Kamen Rider ZO, Zeiram) with supporting direction from Makoto Yokoyama (Power Rangers) and Kengo Kaji (Uzumaki). The creature designer was Yasushi Nirasawa, known for his later work as the designer of the Imagin for Kamen Rider Den-O, as well as for his work designing the monsters of Kamen Rider Blade and Kamen Rider Kabuto. Plot Since the beginning, mankind's malice created a dark energy (inga) that seeps into the Makai World. It's through that world that exists parasitic and predatory demons called Horrors. Ever hungry for more inga, they cross through the human world to possess and devour people to satiate their hunger. However, a group of people created the Makai Order to fight them. Consisting of priests and knights, they are the shadows that protect humanity from the Horrors. Prologue Decades ago, a young Luidy Knight named Barago lost his family to Horrors and wanted more power (shown in Kiba Side Story). Through his journey, he trained under Taiga Saejima, Golden Knight Garo. However, Barago's desire for power was great and was lured by the promise of greater power from Messiah, the Mother of all Horrors. A dark bargain was made: Barago will become Dark Knight Kiba, devour 1,000 horrors, and merge with Messiah to become a supreme being. Taiga attempted to save him but Barago went after Kouga (Taiga's son) and Taiga died protecting him. Leaving him an orphan, Kouga vowed to become stronger and succeed as the next Garo. Barago survived his fight but was badly disfigured. To realize his ambition, he made a little girl named Kaoru into a host for Messiah. He later killed the silver knight, D≈çji, for his potion to restore his looks. For the next several years, Barago disguised himself as Dr. Karune Ryuzaki, Kaoru's therapist to keep tabs on her. D≈çji's adopted son, Rei, witnessed the murder of his father and fianc√©e; he swore vengeance and succeeded as the next Silver Knight Zero. Because the killer resembled Garo's armor, he suspects his family's killer is Garo. In between, Kouga completed his training and succeeds as the new Garo. With his loyal butler (Gonza) and magical ring (Zaruba), Kouga goes out to protect humanity. Chapter of The Black Wolf Kaoru Mitsuki is attempting to get recognized for her artwork when the curator turned into a Horror. Kouga appeared and slayed the horror, but she was tainted in the horror's blood. Whoever is tainted will only have 100 days to live and made themselves delicious to horrors. A knight is expected to slay the victim to spare them, but Kouga wants to save her. This starts the unlikely relationship between the two. As a magnet to horrors, Kouga tracked Kaoru's activities to make sure she's not harmed. Originally thinking Kouga is a stalker, she realized he has been protecting her as she keeps bumping into new horrors. Kouga wanted Kaoru close to him as possible; she took advantage of his words and stayed at his home when she became homeless. As the two get to know each other, they started to like each other. However, things got complicated with the arrival of Zero and Barago's machinations at play. Under the presumption that Garo killed his family, Rei has consistently interfered and fought Kouga. Without absolute proof, Rei continued to vent his anger and tried to kill Kouga without explaining himself. To worsen things, Rei has harassed Kaoru and even tried to kill her (aware of her taint), causing the two to fight. Things would later change when the truth is revealed. Kouga would later meet with Priest Amon, to talk about curing Kaoru. However, Amon mentioned his suspicions that Barago might be still alive. Shortly after, Kaoru learned that Kouga has been using her as horror bait. Heart broken, she ran away but suffered deep anxieties knowing she's a walking target. Not long after, Barago killed Amon but his disciple, Jabi, was blamed for his death. To make matters worse, she distrusted the Watch Dogs and stole a box of Horror Daggers from them. The Watch Dogs (Ker, Ber, and Rose) that govern Kouga ordered him retrieve the daggers and kill Jabi, but they were friends and he wanted to give her a chance before passing judgement. Kouga refused to accept his mission and left to find Jabi, but the watch dogs in turn tasked Zero for the job. To further motivate him, they falsely assured Rei they could bring his lover back and confirmed Kouga murdered his family. Although Kouga found Jabi, she was deeply suspicious of him as Amon clued a knight killed him. Rei arrived and had Kaoru as his hostage, but Kouga managed to get Kaoru back. He sent Jabi and Kaoru away as he fought Zero. Fueled by rage, Zero almost killed Kouga but Jabi returned to save him. Kaoru would run off after realizing she's dying, but Gonza found her and asked Kaoru to have faith in Kouga. After Kouga recovered, he and Jabi found the watch dogs suspicious and agreed to exorcise the daggers themselves. Rei was also suspicious of the watch dogs but continued to serve them. Ker-Ber-Rose didn't trust Zero to complete the job and sent their loyal servant, Kodama, to assure the job is done. Kodama found the duo and seemingly killed Jabi. As Kouga fought Kodama, Rei arrived and helped Kouga exorcise the daggers. Unfortunately, it didn't work and it gave rise to a giant horror. It was then that Dark Knight Kiba arrived and devoured the horror. Rei now realized his family's killer was Kiba. After Kiba vanished, Kouga refocused on curing Kaoru. He ventured into another world and fought the Grou Dragon for the cure. With the help of Rei, Kouga got the cure and saved Kaoru. However, the gate that was imbued on Kaoru was activating and she'll become a vessel for Messiah to cross over. While looking into Messiah and Kiba, their investigation reveals everything is tied to Barago and Ker- ber-rose is allied with him. Realizing their common enemy is Barago, Kouga and Rei made peace and focus their attention towards the dark knight. Barago was ahead of everyone and kidnapped Kaoru. Garo and Zero went to find Barago but was stopped by Kodama. Desperate to save Kaoru, he exceeded the armor's time limit and became a Lost Soul Beast. In a fit of feral rage, Garo killed Kodama and Zero was forced to fight Kouga. Zero managed to retract his armor and the two pressed on to face Barago. While heading to rescue Kaoru, Gulm (Ker-ber- rose's merged form) fought Zero while Kouga faced Barago. Messiah by now had taken over Kaoru's body and devoured Barago. She revealed the legend and myth behind the dark knight was a rumor she created to attain enough power to cross into the human world. To save Kaoru, Kouga took her body to the makai realm and Messiah's true body revealed herself. Ultimately, Zero killed Gulm and Garo defeated Messiah. Kouga and Kaoru made it back to the human realm when Kiba returned for a final showdown. Garo defeated Kiba, but at the price of Zaruba. In the aftermath, Kaoru decided to head to Italy to further her art studies and Rei helped restore Zaruba. As a parting gift, Kaoru finish her father's incomplete art book and put a touching end for Kouga to see. The story ends with Kouga patrolling a new district; the story continues in Beast of the Demon Night Horrors The main antagonistic form in the series, Horrors are demons that reside in a realm known as the netherworld, and thrive on the darkness of humanity. The Horrors enter the human world through everyday objects known as Inga Gates, which are created through a mass of darkness. When the Horrors first come through, they also known as Inga Horrors, and must possess the body of the first human with inner darkness they come across. Because the Horrors feed on humans it is a Makai Knight's duty to hunt and slay the demons. Later entries in the series reveal more types of Horrors.

This statement holds whether sign is taken to mean a sign type or a sign token. Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses. Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the connotative relation and the denotative relation. The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs. The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the signified and the signifier. For example, a US salesperson doing business in Japan might interpret silence following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics Triadic relation The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components: 1\\\\. The representamen, which is the medium, or ‚Äòsign vehicle‚Äô, through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting. 2\\\\. The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign 3\\\\. The object, or that to which the sign refers Together, these three components generate semiosis. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers. While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself. The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol. These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire. The triadic model of the sign was proposed by Charles Peirce. In contradistinction to Ferdinand de Saussure's dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‚Äòrepresentamen‚Äô and ‚Äòinterpretant‚Äô components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure's dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.

Music video The music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi.Around The World album booklet (CD+DVD version) It shows Suzuki sleeping over some highly-technological machine, that keeps her floating in a room that is apparently closed from everyone. A girl makes an appearance then, she enters this room and insert a CD into the machine where Suzuki is floating and sleeping. When the CD starts to be read, the machine activates and Suzuki awakes slowly. Her sleep and consequent awakening in the video most likely refers to her absence and subsequent comeback in the major music industry. The music video has three different scenarios, each one in bright red, yellow and gray colors. The red one is where Ami is with her hair down and in a white dress, seen floating, first sleeping and then awake. In the yellow scenes Ami appears in a white suit and a futuristic hairstyle, being surrounded by some machines. The gray scenario shows Ami with a business suit slightly modified, doing a choreography with a dance crew. First, a short version of the video was included in the DVD of the \\"Eventful\\" single.
